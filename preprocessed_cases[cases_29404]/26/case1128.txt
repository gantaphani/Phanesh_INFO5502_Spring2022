introduction 
colorado law makes it criminal libel to knowingly publish any statement tending to impeach the honesty,integrity,virtue,or reputation or expose the natural defects of one who is alive,and thereby to expose him to public hatred,contempt,or ridicule.while a student at the university of northern colorado unc,thomas mink created and published an journal called the howling pig.several issues of the journal included mink pseudonymous column by junius puke,which parodied the views of a real unc professor named junius peake,and whose photograph bore a strong resemblance to the real professor.
professor peake complained to the greeley police department who commenced an investigation of mink for potential violations of colorado criminal libel statute.the police,in conjunction with the local district attorney office,sought and obtained a search warrant,which they executed at mink residence,seizing his personal computer and other written materials.
mink sued for prospective relief and damages under,and for violations of the privacy protection act.the district court entered a temporary restraining order against the district attorney office,but dismissed the case in its entirety after the office disavowed an intent to prosecute mink.the district court concluded that mink request for declaratory judgment failed for lack of standing,the statutory privacy claim failed to state a claim for relief,and the damages claim against the assistant district attorney arising from the search was barred by absolute prosecutorial immunity.
having jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm both the dismissal of mink facial challenge to the colorado criminal libel statute because he lacks standing and his claim is moot,and the dismissal of his statutory damages claim for failure to state a claim.but we reverse the district court dismissal of the damages claim arising from the search because we conclude it is not barred by absolute immunity.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further proceedings on the question of qualified immunity.
ii.background 
thomas mink began releasing issues of the howling pig,a,journal,during his fall semester as a student at the university of northern colorado.the journal,which was created,maintained,and published from the home computer mink shared with his mother,addressed current events involving the local unc community.among other things,it featured a regular column from the editor,a fictional character named junius puke.the column displayed obviously doctored photographs of an actual unc professor,junius peak,wearing dark sunglasses and a mustache.the purpose of the column,according to mink,was to spoof and parod y professor peake by addressing subjects on which the real professor would be unlikely to write,or through the assertion of views diametrically opposed to those of professor peake.at.
after learning of the parody,professor peake contacted the local district attorney and swore out a complaint,alleging he was a victim of criminal libel.in response to the complaint,a greeley police department detective opened an investigation.the detective reviewed copies of the howling pig and concluded that its editor was mink.based on this information,the detective prepared a search warrant affidavit according to procedures required by colorado law.proc.b,c.these procedures allow a detective to submit an affidavit to the office of the district attorney for legal review.consequently,a deputy district attorney,appellee susan knox,reviewed and approved the search warrant affidavit,which was then presented to and approved by a magistrate judge.
with the search warrant in hand,greeley police searched the home where mink lived with his mother on december.the police confiscated mink personal computer and additional written materials referencing the howling pig.according to mink,during the search one of the detectives told him he was in big trouble and led him to believe a criminal complaint had been filed.mink also claims that a detective warned him that resuming publication of the howling pig would only make things worse for him.at.
following the search,mink obtained counsel who contacted the greeley police on december.according to mink counsel,the investigating officer disclosed his plans to recommend that criminal libel charges be filed against mink.that same day,mink counsel informed a lawyer in the district attorney office that he believed the criminal libel law could not be applied constitutionally against mink for statements made in the howling pig.on december,mink counsel faxed a letter to the district attorney demanding the immediate return of materials seized from mink home and explaining mink position that prosecuting him under the criminal libel statute would be unconstitutional.the letter requested a reply by january,but the district attorney apparently never responded.
on january,mink filed suit in federal district court seeking prospective declaratory relief that the colorado criminal libel statute was unconstitutional under the first amendment and also requesting damages for the search and seizure conducted pursuant to the statute.with respect to the first claim,the complaint alleged mink faced an imminent threat of being charged with a violation of colorado criminal libel statute.at,and that the criminal investigation,the threatened prosecution,and the search and seizure have chilled mink from exercising his right to freedom of expression and his right to freedom of speech.at.
mink also requested a temporary restraining order.on january,the district court ordered 
that the district attorney for the judicial district shall not initiate the prosecution of thomas mink under colorado criminal libel statute,and the city of greeley shall,forthwith,return to the plaintiffs the computer,and all contents thereof,seized following the search of plaintiffs home in ault,colorado.
dist.order,at.
the district court subsequently held a status conference during which it learned the district attorney would not be filing charges against mink.in addition,the district attorney issued a written no file decision,concluding the statements contained in the howling pig could not be prosecuted under the statute.thereafter,pursuant to an agreement of the parties,the court issued an order vacating its temporary restraining order.
mink filed an amended complaint on february,on behalf of himself and the howling pig.the amended complaint repeated his allegations that the colorado criminal libel statute was unconstitutional,and also named the colorado attorney general and the local district attorney as defendants in their official capacities for purposes of seeking prospective relief.mink also realleged violations of his statutory and constitutional rights based on the search of his residence.he further claimed he had published two new issues of the howling pig since the filing of the complaint which contained statements that might be construed as violations of colorado criminal libel statute,and said he planned to continue publishing such statements in the future.in addition,he named susan knox,the deputy district attorney who reviewed and approved the search warrant affidavit,in her individual capacity under and the privacy protection act,
the district attorney answered the amended complaint on april,admitting most of its allegations.after the defendants filed dispositive motions,the district court dismissed mink suit in its entirety because he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the criminal libel statute,he failed to properly state a statutory claim for relief under the privacy protection act,and his constitutional claims against the deputy district attorney were barred by absolute immunity.
iii.discussion 
this appeal raises three issues first,whether we have jurisdiction to consider mink facial constitutional challenge to the criminal libel statute in light of the district attorney disavowal of an intent to prosecute second,whether mink claim for damages under the federal privacy protection act states a cause of action against public officials who did not participate in the search of mink residence and third,whether mink claims for damages against the attorney who reviewed the search warrant are barred by the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity.
we accept all facts as true for purposes of resolving an appeal from a motion to dismiss ruiz mcdonnell,cir,cert.denied,d.we view the facts as alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,and we will uphold the dismissal only if it appears beyond doubt that they can prove no set of facts which would entitle them to relief.initiative referendum inst.walker,cir.
facial challenge to colorado criminal libel statute 
summary of constitutional claims 
before turning to the threshold jurisdictional issues,we provide a brief summary of mink constitutional argument.this background bears on both the underlying procedural posture of the case,as well as the claims asserted against the prosecutor who reviewed the affidavit in support of the search warrant.
mink requests a declaration that the colorado criminal libel statute is facially unconstitutional under the first amendment.his amended complaint names the colorado attorney general and the district attorney as defendants.
colorado criminal libel statute provides 
a person who shall knowingly publish or disseminate,either by written instrument,sign,pictures,or the like,any statement or object tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead,or to impeach the honesty,integrity,virtue,or reputation or expose the natural defects of one who is alive,and thereby to expose him to public hatred,contempt,or ridicule,commits criminal libel.
it shall be an affirmative defense that the publication was true,except libels tending to blacken the memory of the dead and libels tending to expose the natural defects of the living.
criminal libel is a class felony.
mink primary contention is that the colorado criminal libel statute is overbroad because it implicates conduct that is constitutionally protected.in support of his argument,mink points to united states supreme court case law requiring a party bringing a libel action to prove fault of the speaker and falsity of the statement.specifically,the supreme court has held false statements on matters of public concern regarding public figures are protected unless they are made with actual malice,with knowledge the statements are false or with reckless disregard as to whether they are false or not.new york times sullivan,d.false statements on matters of public concern regarding private figures are protected unless they are made negligently.gertz robert welch,d.in public concern cases,the party bringing the action also bears the burden of proving the falsity of the statement.philadelphia newspapers hepps,d.
mink alleges the howling pig was devoted to matters of public concern to the unc community,such as lack of faculty diversity and free speech on campus.further,he alleges professor peake often voiced his views publicly and has therefore arguably rendered himself a public figure for first amendment purposes.mink does not,however,bring an as applied challenge to the statute.instead,he argues the statute is unconstitutional on its face because it punishes libelous statements with no fault requirement and without placing the burden of proving falsity on the prosecutor.
mink further contends the colorado supreme court subsequent interpretation of the statute does not cure the constitutional infirmities.the united states supreme court has long respected the ability of state high courts to narrow overbroad statutes so as to solve constitutional problems.osborne ohio,d.in,the colorado supreme court narrowed the potential scope of the criminal libel law in people ryan,
from the united states supreme court pronouncements concerning libel we discern a precise category of protected conduct that falls outside of the legitimate sweep of section.that category consists of libelous statements about public officials or public figures involving matters of public concern.this category of constitutionally protected conduct gives us a clear line by which to distinguish the statute constitutional and unconstitutional applications.we therefore hold that section is invalid only insofar as it reaches constitutionally protected statements about public officials or public figures on matters of public concern.our partial invalidation,however,affects only the application of subsection of the statute.truth shall remain an affirmative defense pursuant to section and article ii,section,of the colorado constitution.
id.at footnotes omitted.
according to mink,ryan did not limit the statute applicability with regard to statements made about private individuals on matters of public concern,and thus the law continues to run afoul of the first amendment.he claims these statements are still punishable under colorado law,even when made and even when the party bringing the action has not proven their falsity 
with that backdrop,we turn to the procedural posture of mink constitutional claim in light of the district attorney disavowal of an intent to prosecute him under the statute.
and mootness 
to pursue a case in federal court,a plaintiff must satisfy the twin requirements of standing and mootness.winsness yocom,cir.without a live,concrete controversy,we lack jurisdiction to consider claims no matter how meritorious.because we conclude mink faces no credible threat of prosecution under the criminal libel statute,he lacks standing to pursue his claims for prospective relief for the same reasons,we also conclude his claim is moot.therefore,we can not reach the merits of his constitutional challenge to the statute.
standing.to establish standing,mink must show he has suffered an injury in fact,traceable to the defendants,that can be redressed by a favorable decision of this court.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.a plaintiff injury must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.
in freedom of expression cases,injury in fact can be shown by alleging an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by statute,and a credible threat of future prosecution.ward utah,cir.allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the injury in fact requirement,though a plaintiff need not expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.initiative referendum inst.walker,at internal quotations omitted.but the mere presence on the statute books of an unconstitutional statute,in the absence of enforcement or credible threat of enforcement,does not entitle anyone to sue,even if they allege an inhibiting effect on constitutionally protected conduct prohibited by the statute.winsness,at.
to satisfy the injury in fact requirement,the plaintiff must demonstrate that expressive activities will be inhibited by an objectively justified fear of real consequences,which can be satisfied by showing a credible threat of prosecution or other consequences following from the statute enforcement.id.while past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury,littleton,d,they do not confer standing to pursue prospective relief without some credible threat of future injury.see los angeles lyons,d.a ssurances from prosecutors that they do not intend to bring charges are sufficient to defeat standing,even when the individual plaintiff had actually been charged or directly threatened with prosecution for the same conduct in the past.winsness,at quoting utah,cir.
but standing is determined at the time the action is brought,friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d,and we generally look to when the complaint was first filed,not to subsequent events.nova health gandy,cir internal citations omitted.in this case,however,the standing inquiry is complicated by the unique timeline of events.mink original and amended complaint both allege that as of january,mink face d an imminent threat of being charged with a violation of colorado criminal libel statute.at.before answering the complaint,the district attorney office concluded it could not prosecute the case and issued a no file decision on january.mink filed an amended complaint on february.although an investigation was pending at the time the complaint was filed,the threat of prosecution was still speculative at that time.moreover,by the time he filed the amended complaint,even the investigation had entirely dissipated.we look to the amended complaint in assessing a plaintiff claims,including the allegations in support of standing.and since an amended complaint supercedes an original complaint and renders the original complaint without legal effect,in re atlas van lines,cir moore federal practice,matthew bender ed,the justiciability of mink constitutional claim is further cast in doubt.
given this procedural posture,our cases suggest several outcomes 
in faustin city county of denver,cir,we held the disavowal of an intent to prosecute under a statute prior to the filing of a complaint defeated standing.
in utah,cir,we held the disavowal of an intent to enforce a criminal sodomy statute against the plaintiff after the complaint was filed,even if it might be enforced against another class of persons,was enough to defeat standing 
finally,in winsness yocom,cir,we found lack of standing in two situations where the plaintiff sought prospective relief from prosecution under a statute a where the plaintiff received assurances from the district attorney that the statute would not be enforced against him though the assurances came after the plaintiff filed his lawsuit,id.at and b where the plaintiff was already cited for,but the prosecutor quickly dropped the charges and disavowed an intent to prosecute before the plaintiff filed his suit.
each of these cases concluded the plaintiff lacked standing because he could not establish a credible fear of prosecution under the challenged statute.mink facts differ only slightly from these precedents.uniquely,the disavowal of prosecution in this case came between the time the lawsuit was filed and the filing of the amended complaint.at the time the original complaint was filed,moreover,police had conducted a search of mink residence,seized his computer and papers,and were retaining them pending further investigation.attempts by mink counsel to dissuade the district attorney from charging him had yet to bear fruit.thus,when he brought the suit mink appeared to have a legitimate basis for alleging a credible fear of future prosecution.
nonetheless,we conclude mink lacks standing under our case law.first,based on his review of controlling supreme court precedents,the district attorney disclaimed an intent to prosecute immediately after the lawsuit was filed.in both and winsness,the prosecutor quick disavowal of an intent to prosecute demonstrated a lack of injury in fact no charges were ever filed against mink and the district attorney publicly announced he would not prosecute well before his office filed an answer or motion to dismiss.where a plaintiff only seeks prospective relief,standing is defeated when there is evidence the government will not enforce the challenged statute against the plaintiff.see,harmon city of kansas city,cir plaintiffs lost standing to seek an injunction when city conceded all of their activities were constitutionally protected and were not prohibited by the ordinance.
second,it is significant mink filed an amended complaint after the district attorney disclosed his intent not to prosecute.the sequence of events confirms mink had no injury in fact for prospective relief when he filed his amended complaint any threat against mink at that time was hypothetical,not actual and imminent.
finally,although the no file letter conceivably might not bind other district attorneys,we have held the possibility of future enforcement need not be reduced to zero to defeat standing.winsness,at.it is not necessary for defendants to refute and eliminate all possible risk that the statute might be enforced to demonstrate a lack of a case or controversy.id.since this case commenced,moreover,the office of both the attorney general and the district attorney has changed hands with no change in the government position that the statute will not be enforced against mink 
mink,however,suggests the district attorney fumbled away its disavowal by admitting in the answer to the amended complaint that mink faced an imminent threat of prosecution.in the context of the procedural posture of this case and especially in light of the district attorney no file letter,this oversight is of no significance.it is obvious no charges against mink would be pursued,and,as we have explained,n othing in our case law prevents government actors from responsibly retreating from an prosecution,in response to controlling supreme court authority.winsness,at.
the government should be encouraged,not dissuaded,from assuring citizens that it will not pursue prosecutions based on statutes that can not be constitutionally enforced.given the realities of a public law office,it is not surprising the ultimate legal conclusion case could not be be made at the highest policy levels.by jumping the gun and filing a complaint for prospective relief,a plaintiff can not retain standing where the prosecutor immediately concludes the statute can not be constitutionally enforced.
based on the representations of the public officials charged with enforcing the statute against mink,we agree with the district court that no credible threat of prosecution existed when mink filed his amended complaint.thus,he lacks standing to seek prospective relief.
mootness.even if we were to assume a credible threat of prosecution existed before the lawsuit was filed,we also conclude mink claim for prospective relief is moot.i t is not enough that a dispute was very much alive when suit was filed,or when review was obtained,a live controversy must remain throughout the litigation.lewis continental bank,d.article iii of the constitution limits us to live controversies that exist at all stages of litigation,including appellate review.moongate water dona ana mut.domestic water consumers ass n,cir.when intervening acts destroy a party legally cognizable interest in the lawsuit,the federal courts are deprived of jurisdiction.id.
merely stopping the complained of conduct ordinarily is not enough,however,to establish mootness.for good reason,courts are reluctant to deem a controversy moot based merely on assurances from the defendants that they will not engage in unlawful activity again.winsness,at citing united states grant.v oluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case,in part because t he defendant is free to return to his old ways.instead,a defendant must show no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.grant,at.internal citations and quotations omitted.but in many circumstances it is obvious previously threatened conduct can not reasonably be expected to recur.see,tandy city of wichita,cir finding a controversy moot because a city had provided documents demonstrating it had changed its practices to comply with federal law and because n othing in the record suggests the defendant intends to resume its discontinued policies.
we recently discussed mootness in a first amendment declaratory judgment case challenging utah flag desecration statute.winsness.in winsness,a salt lake city resident burned a symbol onto a united states flag and hung the flag on his garage.a neighbor reported the incident to police,and winsness was cited for.the flag was confiscated as evidence.after the citation was filed,prosecutors concluded the ordinance could not be constitutionally enforced against winsness and immediately scuttled the case.the district attorney filed an affidavit with the court assuring it that charges would not be pursued.based on that record,we concluded that e ven if we assume that a credible threat of prosecution existed before this lawsuit was filed,the prosecutors affidavits have rendered the controversy moot.winsness,at.the government had foresworn any intention to bring criminal charges against individuals who alter the flag for expressive purposes and had categorically announc ed the office would bring no prosecutions under the statute.id.at.we found these assurances established mootness since the government had quickly repudiated the action initially taken against winsness,its statements were made in sworn affidavits,and it based its decision on controlling supreme court precedent,making future prosecutions unlikely.
these factors similarly cut against mink.first,no citation or formal charges were ever brought against mink.and prior to the filing of charges the district attorney preemptively issued a legal opinion that precluded prosecution.his opinion letter explained the statute could not be constitutionally applied to the conduct attributed to mink,and,accordingly,charges would not be filed in this matter.
second,although the no file decision was not in the form of an affidavit,the district attorney took an unequivocal position advising mink in writing,and advising the court that mink would not be prosecuted under the statute now or in the future.we find persuasive,as did the district court,the district attorney repudiation of an intent to prosecute,and its representation of the same to us on appeal.
finally,the parties concede on appeal that supreme court precedent makes enforcement of the colorado criminal libel statute unconstitutional under the facts as alleged here.the parties have conceded professor peake is a public figure,and well established case law requires falsity and actual malice to prove libel.gertz.moreover,the colorado supreme court has interpreted that statute to embody these standards.people ryan.accordingly,the district attorney recognized the force of these precedents and his no file decision supports our conclusion that the third winsness factor has been met in this case.
despite these assurances,mink contends the district attorney disavowal is limited to the specific statements made in the first three issues of the howling pig and does not apply more broadly to the type of statements that sparked this controversy or to those statements which might appear in future editions of the publication.in short,he claims that without a ruling that the colorado criminal libel law is unconstitutional,he may be subject to prosecution in the future.we find this argument unpersuasive.the analysis provided by the attorney general and district attorney demonstrate their legal reasons for not enforcing the statute in this case would carry over to further statements of the type mink has subsequently made or intends to make.although the district attorney no file decision was based upon the pending investigation,we see no reason his analysis would not apply to subsequent statements that are legally indistinguishable.
in short,we see no credible threat of prosecution against mink.the district attorney did what one would hope from a public official he responsibly retreat ed from an prosecution,in response to controlling supreme court authority.winsness,at.because standing and mootness are jurisdictional and,moongate water,at,we need not consider the merits of mink first amendment challenge to the colorado criminal libel statute in this case.
damages claim under privacy protection act 
mink also seeks damages under for alleged violations of the privacy protection act.the act creates a right of action for the improper seizure of media materials 
notwithstanding any other law,it shall be unlawful for a government officer or employee,in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense,to search for or seize any work product materials possessed by a person reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper,book,broadcast,or other similar form of public communication,in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce but this provision shall not impair or affect the ability of any government officer or employee,pursuant to otherwise applicable law,to search for or seize such materials,if there is probable cause.
mink alleges his statutory rights were violated when greeley police entered his home and seized materials relating to the howling pig.he does not,however,name any of the officers who conducted the search instead,he seeks a judgment against the deputy district attorney for her role in reviewing the affidavit in support of the search warrant,which he claims lacked probable cause.relying on the text of the statute,which makes it unlawful to search for or seize any work product materials,the district court dismissed the claim.here,mink did not allege the district attorney directed,controlled or participated in the search or seizure.since the statute includes no language covering predicate acts by other officials,such as the legal review of the warrant application,the district court concluded no liability attached to the district attorney.
we agree.the plain language of the statute precludes liability for a person who did not engage in a search.in an analytically similar case,citicasters mccaskill,cir,the eighth circuit concluded the statute covered only a defendant who directed,supervised,or otherwise engaged in the execution of the warrant to such an extent that a finding can be made that she searched for or seized the materials.id.at emphasis added.in citicasters,the facts centered around the prosecutor actions taken after the search warrant was issued and involved an allegation that the prosecutor actively assisted in the search.here,by contrast,mink has not alleged any conduct that could be construed as assisting in the warrant execution.
accordingly,we affirm dismissal of this claim against the deputy district attorney.
damages claim against the district attorney 
the most difficult issue in this case is mink claim for damages against the deputy district attorney based on her review of the application for a search warrant.the district attorney argues that this conduct is protected by the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity.the district court agreed,concluding the prosecutor acted as an officer of the court in a capacity to which absolute immunity applied.
legal framework 
absolute prosecutorial immunity is a complete bar to a suit for damages under.imbler pachtman,d.the doctrine evolved from the absolute immunity judges historically enjoyed for any judicial act done by them within their jurisdiction.bradley fisher,wall.
traditionally,the doctrine did not apply to other public as police officers,governors,and other executive were entitled only to qualified immunity for actions performed in their official capacity.under the common law,the scope of immunity for prosecutors was limited to suits for malicious prosecution and defamation,although its reach in damages cases was unclear.imbler,at.
supreme court framework.the supreme court developed the modern doctrine of prosecutorial immunity in cases in a series of cases beginning in.in imbler pachtman,the court rejected the argument that limited,or qualified,immunity would be adequate to protect the prosecutor from the threat of litigation that could shade their otherwise independent judgment.merely providing qualified immunity would prevent the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.at.according to the court,it was better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers of the court than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.id.at.quoting learned hand in gregoire biddle,cir.thus,prosecutors are absolutely immune for those activities intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.at.to apply this standard,the court crafted a functional approach by which we examine only the actions taken by the prosecutor in initiating and in presenting the state case for trial.id.at.
the supreme court was careful to note,however,that not every activity of a prosecutor involves initiating and presenting a case.absolute immunity does not extend to those aspects of the prosecutor responsibility that cast him in the role of an administrator or investigative officer rather than that of advocate.id.at.emphasis added 
we recognize that the duties of t
