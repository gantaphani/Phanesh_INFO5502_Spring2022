john doe plaintiff appeals an order denying his petition,brought under government code section in which he sought leave to file a late tort claim against the bakersfield city school district the district based on allegations of continuous sexual abuse by his former junior high school guidance counselor.according to the evidence plaintiff presented in support of his petition,the sexual abuse began in,when plaintiff was years old,continued through plaintiff high school years,and did not end until or,when plaintiff was or years old.throughout this period,the counselor made ongoing threats to publicly humiliate plaintiff if he ever disclosed the molestation.
in support of his petition,plaintiff argued the district should be equitably estopped from asserting his noncompliance with the requirements as a defense.he based his argument on evidence that the counselor threats deterred him from filing a timely government tort claim and that the deterrent effect of the threats was still operating on him until shortly before he filed his section petition.in denying plaintiff petition,the trial court found that the evidence presented at the hearing did not support application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel beyond any of the following plaintiff departure from the district to begin high school in another school district plaintiff becoming an adult plaintiff graduation from high school or plaintiff termination of his relationship with the guidance counselor.
we conclude that,under the unique circumstances of this case,the trial court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff petition.in short,plaintiff presented uncontradicted evidence of circumstances giving rise to estoppel which occurred after the events identified in the trial court ruling.further,there is no legal basis for concluding that estoppel would be cut off at any of the four points mentioned in the court order.although the leading cases defining the relevant test for estoppel involved minor petitioners,nothing in those cases suggests that an adult victim of sexual abuse,which began when the victim was a minor and continued into adulthood,is precluded from raising the doctrine of equitable estoppel in a lawsuit against a public entity.we reverse the trial court order and direct the court to grant plaintiff petition for relief from the claims presentation requirements of the california tort claims act.
factual and procedural histories 
on july,when he was years old,plaintiff filed a government tort claim against the district pursuant to sections,and.at the same time,he filed an application pursuant to section for leave to present his claim late,more than six months after the accrual of his cause of action.the district denied the application and rejected the claim as untimely.plaintiff then filed a petition pursuant to section for relief from the district denial of the application.
plaintiff submitted declarations in support of the petition and presented live testimony at the hearing.because the events and circumstances underlying plaintiff claim are fairly detailed,we set out the facts according to three main periods of events plaintiff junior high school,high school,and school years.the following facts are taken primarily from the declarations and hearing testimony of plaintiff and plaintiff girlfriend,
junior high school 
plaintiff was born in april.he met salvadore diaz,diaz,when he was in the sixth grade.diaz was a guidance counselor at the junior high school plaintiff began attending the following year.during plaintiff year,diaz spent time befriending plaintiff and inquiring into plaintiff family life.plaintiff explained to diaz that his father was disabled and was in and out of the hospital and that his family was struggling financially since his stepmother was the only one working.diaz told plaintiff if he ever needed to talk or get help with anything,plaintiff could come to him because,as the guidance counselor,that was his job.
plaintiff started to run into diaz more often at school.it seemed like diaz always happened to be where plaintiff was and continuously tried to talk to him.diaz,who also managed the snack bar,asked plaintiff to work there with him.because plaintiff was supposed to be in class,diaz would give plaintiff a pass to return to class and excuse his absence or tardiness.diaz also had plaintiff join the spirit team,which diaz coached.team practices were after school.diaz offered plaintiff rides home so he would not have to walk.soon diaz started asking plaintiff more personal questions relating to girlfriends and sex.plaintiff thought he could confide in diaz about anything because he was the school counselor.
diaz sexually molested plaintiff for the first time toward the end of plaintiff seventh grade year,around june.diaz arranged a slumber party at his house,inviting over plaintiff and other members of the spirit team.diaz gave the students alcohol to drink and put on pornographic movies for them to watch.in the early morning hours,plaintiff woke up to find diaz pulling down his shorts.plaintiff pretended to be asleep so diaz would go away.when diaz did not leave,plaintiff whispered,what are you doing diaz told plaintiff to be quiet or he would wake up his friend.diaz then forced oral sex on plaintiff.plaintiff was so scared he just laid there and did nothing and felt dirty afterward.the next morning,when diaz drove plaintiff home,diaz told plaintiff he was not allowed to tell anyone what had happened and plaintiff would get in trouble if he did.when plaintiff went to school the following monday,diaz acted like nothing had happened.plaintiff felt he would be safe if he said nothing and acted like nothing had happened.
a few weeks later,plaintiff went into diaz office to see him for counseling regarding an unrelated incident of sexual abuse.plaintiff was afraid to tell his parents and felt diaz was the only person with whom he could talk.diaz told plaintiff he was required by law to tell plaintiff parents.plaintiff begged him not to do so.diaz said the only way he would make an exception was if he could continue performing oral sex on plaintiff.plaintiff felt he had no choice.diaz continued to molest plaintiff on a weekly basis for the remainder of the school year.diaz would drive plaintiff home after school and pull into vacant parking lots.whenever plaintiff resisted,diaz would tell him he would not take him home unless he allowed diaz to perform oral sex on him.
the molestation continued into the summer.diaz knew plaintiff played sports and began to show up at his games.diaz asked plaintiff parents if he could take plaintiff out for dinner after the games.on the way home,diaz would stop at his house or pull into a parking lot and force oral sex on plaintiff.
diaz molested plaintiff throughout his eighth grade year both on and off campus.during plaintiff lunch break,diaz would take plaintiff out to lunch and molest him in the car on the way back to school,or he would take plaintiff back to his house and molest him there.diaz would also take plaintiff out of class,giving him a pass so plaintiff could go with diaz on diaz lunch break.plaintiff thought there was nothing he could do to stop diaz and felt he was not safe anywhere.diaz began pressuring plaintiff to do more sexual things with him,telling him he would get into trouble if he did not.
throughout this time,diaz made threats in connection with the molestation.when plaintiff resisted,diaz would threaten plaintiff,saying things such as,you know what is at stake,i am not the one who is going to get in trouble,and no one is going to believe you.plaintiff was always worried about his friends finding out and people making fun of him.other children would often notice how much time diaz was spending with plaintiff and would say plaintiff was diaz pet.diaz would tell plaintiff over and over that he was the one who made plaintiff popular and,without him,plaintiff would be nothing.when plaintiff tried to avoid diaz,diaz would tell plaintiff he could find out anything about plaintiff that he wanted.plaintiff believed diaz because he always seemed to know what plaintiff was doing even when plaintiff did not tell him.plaintiff declared that diaz repeatedly said,if he got in trouble,he would tell on me and all the kids would make fun of if it was my fault.
high school 
diaz continued to pursue plaintiff after plaintiff changed schools to begin high school in another school district.diaz would go to plaintiff parents behind his back and get their permission to pick plaintiff up from school or other activities.diaz would attend plaintiff wrestling matches and baseball games.because plaintiff father was ill and could not stay for the entire game,diaz would offer to take plaintiff home and then sexually assault him on the way.
even though diaz worked at a different school,diaz found ways to track plaintiff down when plaintiff tried to avoid him.diaz became friends with the attendance lady at plaintiff high school and would call the school and have messages sent to plaintiff there.if plaintiff was not responsive,when diaz was able to get hold of plaintiff,he would threaten to hurt plaintiff reputation by telling people plaintiff was gay.plaintiff was afraid of what diaz would do.diaz always told plaintiff he knew a lot of people.diaz would get people to come up to plaintiff and say things like,sal is looking for you,sal is mad at you,you do want sal mad at you,and sal needs to talk with you because he is not happy.diaz would often accuse plaintiff of trying to hide from him.when plaintiff told him he did not want to have sexual activities forced on him anymore,diaz threatened plaintiff that if he quit on him,he would regret it.diaz told plaintiff he would ruin plaintiff reputation and he knew people in high places who could take plaintiff down.
when plaintiff turned years old and started driving,the sexual assaults occurred less frequently because diaz did not have the excuse of driving plaintiff.however,diaz would still show up at plaintiff wrestling matches and want to take plaintiff out to dinner.if plaintiff did not want to go,diaz would threaten him.diaz had nicknames for plaintiff,including fluffy,which he would call out in front of other people at plaintiff baseball games.diaz got plaintiff friends to call him fluffy as well.plaintiff felt no one would believe his side of the story if he told and that he had to do what diaz wanted.
when he was years old,plaintiff moved out on his own and started attending college.diaz called plaintiff frequently,leaving messages asking why plaintiff had not called and making statements such as,you need to call me right way,it very important that you call me,and you do want anything to happen to you.plaintiff felt he had no other choice but to call diaz back.
diaz tried to find out from other people where plaintiff was and what he was doing.he discovered where plaintiff lived and started showing up at his apartment.diaz told plaintiff that unless he wanted his roommate to know what was going on,plaintiff better let him in.diaz became friends with plaintiff roommate and began showing up at the apartment when plaintiff was out and would be waiting for plaintiff when he got home.he even convinced plaintiff roommate to let him clean the apartment for per week.the sexual assaults started happening more often because diaz had access to plaintiff again.he knew the schedule of plaintiff roommate and would show up when the roommate was gone and threaten plaintiff if he did not do what he wanted sexually.diaz threatened to ruin plaintiff wrestling career and everything that plaintiff was working for.
according to plaintiff declaration,the last sexual encounter between diaz and plaintiff took place in early,shortly before plaintiff birthday.at the hearing,plaintiff testified that he believed the last encounter was in march.a sheriff department detective,brian armendariz,testified that plaintiff said the last sexual encounter took place in late.
after the last sexual encounter,whenever it occurred,diaz never stopped calling and threatening plaintiff.he would say things like,you do want me to start any trouble,do you plaintiff would avoid answering his telephone,or if he did answer,plaintiff would tell diaz he did not want to see him.plaintiff testified that,between the time he ended the relationship and august,he spoke with diaz at least once or twice a month but diaz was always calling plaintiff cell phone and leaving messages.plaintiff began to make it a point not to return all of diaz calls.
in november or december of,plaintiff disclosed the molestation for the first time to his girlfriend,testified regarding the circumstances of the disclosure.and plaintiff had been arguing,when said something plaintiff had done was as hurtful as a sexual assault and that he could never understand because,unlike her,he had never been sexually assaulted.plaintiff replied that he did understand.asked plaintiff if he had been molested.she described his reaction 
he said,i ca i ca talk about this.and he started crying hysterically.by this time we were driving,and was hysterically crying to the point i said,you have to pull over because i scared for my safety with you.
obviously he could see.so he pulled over into a parking lot.he did even get out and walk around the car to get in the back seat.he had a yukon,and he just crawled through the middle of the seat,and i got into the driver seat and he curled up in the back seat of his car in a fetal position with a shirt and just started screaming and crying at the top of his lungs,i ca tell.i not going to tell.i be hurt if i tell.i promise i never tell.i going to take this to my grave.
i said,who was he 
he said,he hurt me.i ca tell.
we went back to plaintiff house,and i had to,like,basically help him in the house.
when he got into his bedroom i said,you have to tell me who this was,and he said i told you i ca tell.he hurt me.i told you i was going to take this to my grave.
and he was crying so hysterically that he started gagging.
after three or four hours,plaintiff finally revealed diaz name.when suggested contacting the police,plaintiff became more hysterical,said diaz had people in high places that would come get him,and threatened to kill himself.
after plaintiff told about the abuse,she conned diaz telephone number from plaintiff.a few days later,called diaz and said she knew what was going on 
and he said,you do know what i do.
and i said,yes,i do,and i named five boys including plaintiff name,but i added all five of the guys names in there because i did want it to just be plaintiff for plaintiff safety because he was scared.
after call,diaz contacted plaintiff and said he wanted to see him.called diaz again and told him to stay away from plaintiff.diaz replied,you better watch out because he does know what he doing.i get him.this is going to ruin him if it going to ruin me.
as a result of actions,diaz came to the attention of law enforcement.detective armendariz testified that in november,a school principal contacted the sheriff department to report that after confronted diaz,diaz confessed to abusing students.as part of his investigation,the detective contacted plaintiff on january.
in february,and plaintiff were driving by diaz sister house when they spotted diaz outside unloading groceries.rolled down the window and yelled,you ca face the truth you want to hide from it diaz yelled back at plaintiff,who was in the passenger seat of the car,i ca believe you doing this to me you going to be very sorry you should have kept your mouth shut 
plaintiff testified that after he gave the detective his statement,he was enrolled in a witness protection program and was referred to psychotherapist joan knowlden.plaintiff met with knowlden on july,which was the first date she had available to meet with him.plaintiff testified that the counseling sessions with knowlden helped allay the fears that had deterred him from taking legal action earlier.after receiving help from knowlden,he took steps to get legal advice and followed the advice of his attorney.
in his declaration,plaintiff stated that it was not until the sheriff department contacted him indicating diaz was under investigation for pedophilia and he was entered into a local protection program and had his first counseling session that,for the first time in over eight years,he believed diaz would not be able to follow through with his threats.
the only evidence the district presented in opposition to the petition was the testimony of detective armendariz.armendariz testified that plaintiff never told him during any of their meetings that he was physically afraid diaz would harm him or would direct someone else to harm him.on,the detective explained that the statute of limitations for criminal charges had not expired,so he never considered or investigated the issue of the timeliness of plaintiff coming forward.on redirect,armendariz acknowledged that in the past he has encountered individuals who have communicated to him they were fearful of the people who had molested them,but in his meeting with plaintiff,he did not see anything to conclude that plaintiff was afraid of diaz.
at the time of the hearing,diaz remained at large and a warrant for his arrest was outstanding.after the hearing,the trial court issued a minute order denying relief.the order reads as follows 
petition denied.the evidence presented at the hearing conducted does not support invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel to the respondent assertion of the late claim limitations beyond petitioner departure from the bakersfield city school district,or becoming an adult,or graduating from high school,or termination of the relationship with diaz.
plaintiff subsequent request for a statement of decision was denied as untimely.

ii.california tort claims act and doctrine of equitable estoppel 
under the tort claims act,a person may not sue a public entity for personal injury or wrongful death unless he or she first presented a written claim to the public entity within six months following the accrual of the claim and the public entity rejected the claim,munoz state of california th,d munoz.if a claim is presented late,the public entity,within a prescribed time,may send the claimant written notice that the claim is being returned without action due to its untimely presentation.in that instance,the claimant only recourse is to apply for leave to present a late claim,subd.a.
a claimant has a period of one year from the accrual of the claim to present a written application to the public entity for leave to file a late claim.if the public entity denies leave to present a late claim,the claimant can petition the court under section for an order relieving him or her of the requirement of presenting a claim.the court must relieve the petitioner from presentation and claim requirements if it finds the claimant application under section was made within a reasonable time,was denied or deemed denied under section,and the failure to present the claim was through mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect unless the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of section,subd.c.in determining whether relief is warranted,the court will consider the petition,any supporting or opposing affidavits,and any other evidence presented at the hearing,subd.e bettencourt,supra,cal d at,munoz,supra,th at,d.
notwithstanding these rules,i t is well settled that a public entity may be estopped from asserting the limitations of the claims statute where its agents or employees have prevented or deterred the filing of a timely claim by some affirmative act.citations.estoppel most commonly results from misleading statements about the need for or advisability of a claim actual fraud or the intent to mislead is not essential.citation.a fortiori,estoppel may certainly be invoked when there are acts of violence or intimidation that are intended to prevent the filing of a claim.citations.john oakland unified school dist.cal d.
in john,a child molestation case involving a public school teacher,the supreme court held the doctrine of equitable estoppel could be applied against the school district if the fact finder determined the teacher threats prevented the student from pursuing his claim within the statutory period.john oakland unified school,supra,cal d at.the facts of john are as follows the victim was a student in the ninth grade when his mathematics teacher asked him to participate in a program where students received academic credit and monetary payments for assisting teachers with tasks such as helping to correct other students papers.id.at.students had the option of performing the required work at teachers homes.the teacher in john had the victim come to his apartment for that purpose.over the course of numerous sessions,the teacher attempted to develop a close relationship with the student and eventually tried to seduce him.the teacher tried to persuade the student that engaging in sex acts with him would be a constructive part of their relationship and,at times,threatened to give john failing grades if he would not go along with his desires and said he would tell people that john had solicited sex from him.id.at.on one occasion in february,the teacher pressured the student into engaging in acts of oral copulation and anal intercourse.the student told the teacher he would report the incidents to his parents.the teacher threatened to retaliate against the student if he revealed what had taken place.as a result of the threats,and his embarrassment and shame at what had happened,the student did not disclose the incidents to his parents until december.his parents subsequently reported the incidents to the school district and the police.ibid.the student presented his application to the school district in may,months after the assault.id.at.
the court of appeal concluded that the student application was timely within the period of section because,under the delayed discovery doctrine,his cause of action did not accrue until he told his parents about the incident in december.john oakland unified school,supra,cal d at.upon review,the supreme court expressed doubt about whether the delayed discovery theory applied to these facts but opined the circumstances could demonstrate the claim was timely filed under a theory of equitable estoppel.ibid.the court reasoned 
although the teacher alleged threats in this case were no doubt motivated largely by,rather than to prevent john from filing a claim against the district,it would clearly be inconsistent with the equitable underpinnings of the estoppel doctrine to permit the district to benefit to plaintiffs detriment by such threats.citation.putting aside for the moment the substantive question whether the district may be held vicariously liable for the teacher alleged molestation of john,we have no hesitation in concluding that the teacher threats may be taken into account in resolving the procedural status of plaintiffs claims against the district assuming plaintiffs can establish their case,it would plainly be inequitable to permit the district to escape liability only because the teacher threats succeeded in preventing his victim from disclosing the molestation until the time for filing a claim against the district had elapsed.we conclude that,for purposes of applying equitable estoppel,the time for filing a claim against the district was tolled during the period that the teacher threats prevented plaintiffs from pursuing their claims.john oakland unified school,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
the court held that the question of whether the district was estopped from
