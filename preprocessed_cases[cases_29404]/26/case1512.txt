this is an appeal from judgment entered after the trial court sustained respondents demurrer to appellants complaint the court denied appellants leave to amend.the case involves the duty to provide mental health services to handicapped students the appeal involves somewhat novel questions of exhaustion of administrative remedies in the context of disputes between governmental agencies.we will conclude that both appellants and respondents have failed to exhaust administrative remedies.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment but disagree with one of the trial court grounds for sustaining the demurrer.
facts and procedural history 
because judgment was entered upon the granting of demurrer,our summary of facts is limited to those pled in the complaint,together with facts judicially noticeable.crowley katleman cal th,d.
a.the parties 
appellant special education local plan area is a public entity organized pursuant to education code section et.it is alleged to be responsible for assuring access to special education and related services for individuals with exceptional needs who reside within tuolumne,amador,and calavaras counties,administering the special education local plan,and providing funding for the educational needs of students placed in residential facilities.appellant tuolumne county special education unit is an entity created by agreement of tuolumne county school districts to consolidate services under their special education local plan.it is a public entity responsible for ensuring that all individuals with exceptional needs who reside within tuolumne county are provided equal access to special education programs and for ensuring compliance with state and federal laws,statutes,and regulations relating to such individuals.there is no need to distinguish between the two appellants for purposes of this appeal,and we will refer to them jointly as appellants.
respondents are the county of tuolumne its board of supervisors the supervisors individually and the county administrator,county counsel,and the county director of mental health,all sued in their official capacities and as individuals.
b.the statutory framework 
the state of california receives funds under the federal individuals with disabilities education act idea,united states code section et.as a result,it must comply with the requirements of the act.see a.in order to do so,the legislature enacted certain provisions of the government code,as particularly relevant to the present appeal,sections and.
the primary goal of idea is to ensure that children with disabilities receive special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living.see d.by means of government code sections and,the legislature has divided responsibility for educational services and mental health services between the superintendent of public instruction and the department of mental health,or any community mental health service,subd.a.
in that division of services,the superintendent of public instruction is required to ensure that local educational agencies provide the educational and related services necessary and appropriate under a child individualized education plan.however,local educational agencies shall be responsible only for the provision of those services which are provided by qualified personnel whose employment standards are covered by the education code and implementing regulations.each county community mental health service is responsible for the provision of assessments and mental health services included in an individualized education plan,tit.
c.the problem 
according to respondents,state funding to counties for idea mental health services in the fiscal year was million.in the fiscal year,that funding was reduced to statewide.
in response to this reduction in funding,the individual respondents recommended action or acted depending on their position within county government to terminate the provision to special education students of mental health services required by their individualized education plans.termination was effective january.
according to appellants complaint,as a result of respondents actions,appellants will be obligated to provide mandated mental health services previously provided and paid for by respondents.
proceedings in the trial court 
appellants sued respondents on february,seeking to force the county to continue providing mental health services and to repay appellants for funds spent to provide services after respondents original termination of services.we will discuss certain of these causes of action more particularly as we address the issues below.the respondents demurred to the complaint,contending as relevant here appellants had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that the county was relieved of the duty to provide services because the statutory obligation was an unfunded state mandate.the individual respondents separately demurred,asserting immunity for legislative acts,absence of a personal duty to provide services,and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
after hearing,the trial court sustained both demurrers without leave to amend.as to the governmental respondents,the court concluded appellants had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that the county had no duty to provide services under an unfunded state mandate.in addition,the court concluded,as to the individual respondents,that all of their actions were within the sphere of legislative activity for which they are absolutely immune.the court ordered dismissal of the complaint.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
appellants contend respondents are not entitled to assert as a defense that their duties under government code section were excused by the failure of the legislature to fund that mandate.appellants also contend the available administrative remedies were insufficient to provide relief and that exhaustion of those remedies was,as a result,excused.finally,they contend certain of the causes of action do not,as a matter of law,require exhaustion of administrative remedies before commencement of judicial action.
unfunded state mandates 
the california constitution provides whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service,with exceptions not relevant here.cal,art.xiiib,hereafter,section.
the legislature has created a set of remedies if a local government claims a violation of section.first,local governments are not required to implement a program if a court,the legislature,or the commission on state mandates hereafter,the commission has identified the program as a new mandate or a mandate for a higher level of service,and if the legislature has specifically identified the program as a mandate for which no funding is provided,subd.a.to meet the requirement of being specifically identified by the legislature,the program must be included within the schedule of reimbursable mandates shown in the budget act and it is specifically identified in the language of a provision of the item providing the appropriation for mandate reimbursements,subd.a.if these conditions are met,the local government is permitted to make its own determination not to implement the mandate.
if a county believes state funding for a mandated program is inadequate,the local government may file a claim with the commission and,if the claim is denied,seek review by writ of administrative mandate in superior court.redevelopment agency commission on state mandates th,d.in addition,after spending funds on state mandated programs,the local government may file a claim for reimbursement with the commission,whose decision is judicially reviewable.if the legislature refuses to fund a program identified by the commission as a reimbursable state mandate,the local government may file an action for declaratory relief in the superior court of the county of sacramento to declare the mandate unenforceable and enjoin its enforcement,subd.c.
thus,a county is excused from duties imposed under a state mandate if the legislature specifically states that the mandated program is not funded or if the superior court in sacramento declares the program an unfunded mandate these avenues for relief from duties imposed by state mandate are exclusive.central delta water agency state water resources control bd.th,d.until local agencies have exhausted their administrative remedy before the commission,they can not know whether the statute imposes a cost ibid.or whether that cost will be reimbursed pursuant to the commission award on a claim.without first exhausting the administrative remedies,the local agency can not claim a section violation in defense of its failure to perform its duty.see central delta water agency,supra,at.after a determination by the commission that reimbursement is due,but only then,may the local government bring a traditional mandamus action or proceed pursuant to government code section.carmel valley fire protection dist.state of california d.
attempting to avoid the body of law just discussed,respondents mischaracterize both the law and the legislature actions.respondents provide the following erroneous summary of government code section,subdivision a when state funds are not provided,the county is no longer required to implement or give effect to the statute mandating the provision of services.government code section a.as set forth above,however,legislative action provides relief of local governments from mandated duties only when the legislature specifically states that the mandate is not funded,subd.a.
accordingly,respondents are also wrong when they claim that the legislature,in providing only nominal funding for the mandate,enacted the functional equivalent of no funds for the program,as contemplated in government code section,subdivision a.this is a misstatement because there is no functional equivalent to the legislative action specified in section.simply put,the legislature has not specifically identified the mental health services mandate as unfunded.
respondents give only one reason in urging us to ignore the plain requirement of government code section.they argue in construing the meaning of a statutory provision,the language should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.
the intent of the legislature,however,could not be more clear until and unless a court or the legislature itself has relieved a local government of a statutory mandate,the local government must perform the duties imposed by the mandate.in establishing an exclusive remedy by which local governments may claim funding for mandated programs see,the legislature has ensured an orderly procedure for resolving these issues,eschewing the local government anarchy that would result from recognizing a county ability sua sponte to declare itself relieved of the statutory mandate 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining respondents demurrers on the basis that appellants complaint asserted duties under an unenforceable unfunded state mandate.
appellants failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
as an alternative basis for sustaining the demurrer,the trial court found appellants had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.appellants contend the available remedies were inadequate and therefore excused and that certain of their causes of action did not require exhaustion of administrative remedies.
appellants discussion of the exhaustion of remedies issue in its opening brief focuses solely on government code section.that section permits a local agency as well as a parent or adult pupil to file an administrative complaint when another local agency fails to provide services required by an individualized education plan,subd.a see also,tit,subd.b.appellants correctly point out that courts have excused compliance with piecemeal administrative remedies when the issues to be litigated involve systemic shortfalls incapable of resolution in an available administrative proceeding.see glendale city employees,city of glendale cal d.
the individualized hearing contemplated by government code section is not,however,the only available administrative procedure.as appellants recognize in their reply brief,an administrative procedure specifically targeted at the kind of dispute now before us is contained both in california administrative regulations and in the underlying federal legislation.
united states code section a b ii provides,as relevant here if a public agency other than an educational agency fails to provide or pay for special education and related services,the local educational agency shall provide or pay for such services to the child.such local educational agency may then claim reimbursement for the services from the public agency that failed to provide or pay for such services and such public agency shall reimburse the local educational agency according to the procedures established in the interagency agreement required by an earlier provision a a i.
the procedures established are specified in the state regulations adopted pursuant to government code section.california code of regulations,title,section,provides allegations of failure by a community mental health service to comply with these regulations shall be resolved pursuant to chapter,commencing with section,of division of title of the california code of regulations,entitled uniform complaint procedures.
the uniform complaint procedures provide for an investigation and report by the state superintendent of public instruction whenever a complaint alleges that a public agency,other than a local educational agency,fails or refuses to comply with an applicable law or regulation relating to the provision of free appropriate education to handicapped individuals,tit,a vii a.
notwithstanding the federal statutory requirement that appellants provide or pay for necessary services and then seek reimbursement through the interagency procedure,appellants contend they are not required to follow this route because respondents did not identify this procedure below as one to be exhausted and the procedure does not permit an adequate remedy.
this contention is both factually and legally incorrect factually,respondents did identify the uniform complaint procedures as a full and adequate administrative remedy in documents filed in the trial court.legally,we review the judgment of the trial court,not its reasoning,and we affirm if that judgment is correct.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.the trial court did not specify the administrative remedy appellants had failed to exhaust,but the applicability of the uniform complaint procedures is an issue of law properly determined on appeal.
nor do we agree with appellants that the administrative remedy is inadequate.although the regulations specify that the superintendent of public instruction may elect to sanction a local agency by withholding funds see,tit,subd.a,that remedy is not exclusive.the regulation itself permits the superintendent to file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel the local agency compliance,tit,subd.a.further,the regulation generally permits the superintendent to use any means authorized by law to effect compliance,tit,subd.a.
not only are we satisfied the administrative remedy is adequate,we are satisfied the administrative remedy is intended to be exclusive.first,the regulations specifically state that allegations of failure by a community mental health department to provide services shall be resolved pursuant to the administrative procedure,tit.
further,the superintendent of public instruction is specifically charged with the duty to ensure that this chapter concerning interagency services to handicapped children is carried out through monitoring and supervision.permitting local educational agencies to proceed directly to court to enforce idea conflicts with this supervisory authority.
finally,the complex web of funding for programs such as this requires that the superintendent retain the greatest possible discretion in resolving interagency disputes,so as to l
