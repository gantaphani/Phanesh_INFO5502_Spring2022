henry tyler,an african american assistant dean for diversity at the university of arkansas,is suing the university and his former supervisor,dean of the college of pharmacy stephanie gardner,alleging the school did not hire him for the position of director of recruitment for diversity in retaliation for the charge of race discrimination he had filed against the school back in.tyler also alleges that the university discriminated against him on the basis of gender when it selected a young female with purportedly inferior qualifications,vivian flowers,for the coveted spot.because tyler claims are not supported by the required evidence of impermissible motivation behind the university decision to hire flowers,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of tyler employer.
tyler has been employed at the university of arkansas for medical sciences uams since.for the first twenty years at the school,tyler worked as a minority recruitment specialist at the college of pharmacy cop in,he was promoted to assistant dean for diversity for the center of diversity affairs within the same college.in both positions,tyler was responsible for recruiting minority students to the cop.along with the college of medicine com,the cop had a particularly dismal record of minority student enrollment and faculty representation out of the uams six colleges.
the present litigation finds its roots in september of,when tyler sued the university,alleging race discrimination in the university wage policy and retaliation for his challenge to the policy.the parties settled the lawsuit in october of.the settlement agreement fixed tyler job duties and elaborated on the university plan to create a office of diversity,supervised by a single director of diversity.one provision in the agreement clarified that the scheme would not in any way disadvantage tyler 
the parties understand and agree that uams has for some time been exploring the creation of a office of diversity,to be supervised by a director of diversity.the parties further understand and agree that if such office of diversity is implemented,it is possible that plaintiff and others at uams who currently perform minority recruiting or diversity functions may be transferred from their current colleges or units to the office of diversity,may then be directly supervised by the director of diversity,and may have their current titles specific job responsibilities appropriately altered.the parties agree that in the event plaintiff job position is moved from the college of pharmacy to an office of diversity,this shall have no negative impact on his current salary or benefits.
appellant app x at.
the plan referenced in the settlement agreement was a result of joint efforts by dean of the cop gardner and dean of the com albert reece to improve their colleges weak performance on the minority representation front.both deans saw a unitary office of diversity comprising all six colleges as a solution to the problem.when the com began a nationwide search to fill the director of recruitment for diversity spot in,it was looking for a candidate with a,experience in recruiting minority students,and a track record of writing grant applications.the search yielded two.landefeld and landefeld being in the lead based on his strong qualifications and extensive experience in the area.ultimately,however,the committee decided against hiring landefeld,citing his flamboyant sartorial style in explanation.at that point,the efforts to fill the position stalled.
that is until.at that time,a new dean was installed at one of the colleges and the search committee was reassembled.the committee consisted of the deans of all six colleges a body referred to as the council of deans,with dean gardner acting as the committee chair.by sheer coincidence,around the same time dean of the college of health related professions ronald winters attended his child high school graduation,where he was impressed by a commencement address given by one joyce elliott.elliott was an african american member of the arkansas general assembly and the legislative black caucus,who dedicated her entire career to issues of diversity in education.winters thought she would be a perfect fit for the position and relayed his assessment to the council.having heard winters enthusiastic endorsement of elliott,vice chancellor for administration and government affairs tom butler,not a member of the search committee,volunteered to contact elliott to gauge her interest in the job.
while elliott herself was not interested,she recommended vivian flowers as someone who was eminently qualified for the job.at the time,flowers was completing the master program at the clinton school of public service in college,she in political science and rhetoric and writing.flowers was also involved in various civic organizations she served as the executive director of the arkansas legislative black caucus,a commissioner on the arkansas minority health commission,and a member of the committee staff for the arkansas bureau of legislative research.in addition to her academic bona fides,flowers had the benefit of a family.her father,john flowers,was a physician serving on the uams minority advisory committee,and her cousin,stephanie flowers,served in the arkansas general assembly along with elliott.
following up on elliott recommendation,butler contacted flowers.flowers was interested and pursued the opportunity wholeheartedly.after conversing with several uams officials on the phone,she had an informational meeting with the entire search committee on december,before the committee announced the vacancy publicly.after that meeting,flowers met with dodd wilson,uams chancellor at the time,and then again with butler,who alerted her that a formal announcement for the position would be forthcoming.in the days prior to the formal posting,flowers had her recommenders submit letters on her behalf to chancellor wilson,who eventually forwarded them to the committee.no other candidate was afforded similar privileges prior to the public announcement of the position.
the said public announcement first appeared on the uams website on january.it called for a candidate with a master degree and three years of experience in public recruiting.a graduate,flowers could not satisfy the latter prerequisite.when the announcement appeared in a print format,however,three years of public recruiting experience was downgraded to a desired qualification,and experience in writing grant added as another desirable skill.the deans denied any manipulation of the position description to suit flowers qualifications,and a human resources department employee steven wood took the blame for what he characterized as the inadvertent mixup in the descriptions.
flowers submitted her application on the day of the online posting,and was invited for an interview the following day.tyler submitted his application on february,upon having discovered that the position did not require a terminal degree,as it did during the first search round in.he was interviewed on february,by gardner,executive associate dean for academic affairs richard wheeler,and dean of the graduate school robert mcgehee.according to the university,the interview did not go well.the committee viewed tyler as apathetic and lacking in enthusiasm,and their perception was marred by tyler subpar performance as a minority recruitment specialist during his tenure at the cop.out of the six finalists the committee interviewed,tyler was ranked third or fourth,with flowers and another female candidate,andi chappelle,being the two top choices.although the committee was concerned about flowers lack of recruitment experience,it ultimately selected her for the job.lowers became tyler direct supervisor when she started work in late february of.
after filing a grievance with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on the claim of retaliation only,tyler sued the university and gardner,in her individual and official capacities,alleging he was not selected for the director of recruitment for diversity position as a result of gender discrimination and because the university retaliated against him for filing the discrimination charge in.the complaint stated causes of action under title vii of the civil rights act and.
on october,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants.the court dismissed tyler title vii claim of gender discrimination against the board because it had not been administratively exhausted.the court dismissed the retaliation claim against the board because the temporal gap between the alleged protected activity and the retaliatory act was too great,and tyler had not produced any other evidence of retaliation.rejecting tyler claims against gardner,the court concluded his retaliation claim was foreclosed by gardner qualified immunity and his sex discrimination claim failed because there was never any evidence to show that gender played any role in the committee decision to hire flowers.the present appeal followed.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all evidence in the light most favorable to the party.graves.dep t of fin,cir.mindful of this standard,we address tyler claims of retaliation first and his gender discrimination claims second.
retaliation 
in complaining of retaliation,tyler proceeds under two theories violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and deprivation of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws under.
section a of title vii makes it unlawful for the employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii,or because he has made a charge of discrimination against the employer.a.in a case like this one,the mcdonnell douglas analytical framework helps the court answer the ultimate question whether the employer adverse action against the employee was motivated by retaliatory intent.wallace dtg operations,cir.as the first step of the framework,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct,including opposition to an action prohibited by title vii he was subjected to an adverse employment action,and there is a causal nexus between the protected conduct and the adverse action.lewis heartland inns of,llc,cir quoting wallace,at.in terms of the causal connection,the plaintiff must show that the protected conduct was a merely in the employer adverse employment decision.van horn best buy stores,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the plaintiff succeeds,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the action.maxfield cintas,cir.if the defendant does so,the plaintiff can still prevail on a final step of the mcdonnell douglas analysis by proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the reasons proffered by the employer are merely pretext for discrimination.richmond bd.of regents of of,cir.
although section a of title vii may not be the basis for a retaliatory discharge claim in a action,greenwood ross,cir,provides a vehicle for redressing claims of retaliation on the basis of the first amendment.lewis jacks,cir.f iling of an eeoc charge and a civil rights lawsuit are activities protected by the first amendment.greenwood,at.first amendment retaliation claims are analyzed under the same framework as claims of retaliation under title vii.okruhlik of,cir.
prima facie case 
tyler prima facie case fails because he can not establish a causal nexus between his suit and the university decision not to hire him as the director of recruitment for diversity in.that he does not have direct evidence establishing causation is not dispositive such evidence is seldom available.what is problematic,however,is that tyler can not put forward any indirect evidence on this as evidence establishing an inference of retaliatory animus through temporal proximity of the two events.buytendorp extendicare health,cir.
generally,more than a temporal connection is required to present a genuine factual issue on retaliation,peterson scott county,cir,and only in cases where the temporary proximity is very close can the plaintiff rest on it exclusively.smith fairview ridges,cir.as more time passes between the protected conduct and the retaliatory act,the inference of retaliation becomes weaker and requires stronger alternate evidence of causation.sims,cir.the inference vanishes altogether when the time gap between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is measured in months.see,littleton pilot travel,llc,cir a temporal gap of seven months not sufficiently contemporaneous to indicate a causal connection recio creighton,cir a gap too long to give rise to inference of causal connection lewis cloud state,cir we have held that an interval as brief as two months did not show causation for purposes of establishing a retaliation claim and that a interval was sufficient,but barely so.internal citations omitted.in this case,years,let alone months,passed between tyler protected activity and the alleged retaliatory act.to be more exact,it was years and months from the time tyler filed his eeoc complaint in march of until flowers was hired in february of.a bit shorter period of elapsed since tyler case was settled in october of.given the length of the intervening delay and the absence of other evidence of causation,tyler can not rely on temporal proximity to establish a causal nexus.
tyler attempts to shore up the interrupted causal connection by arguing gardner retaliatory animus manifested itself again when tyler helped kimberlee eason,an african american student at the cop,file a race discrimination grievance against the school in july of.according to tyler,his assistance to eason prompted gardner to move his office into the deans suite,allegedly a less location where tyler was under closer scrutiny by gardner.this argument does not hold water for several reasons.for one,the transfer of tyler office into the deans suite,where offices of all associate and assistant deans were located,was logical given tyler title as an assistant dean,and did not exhibit disparate treatment of tyler.also,to the extent tyler asserts his assistance to eason was a separate protected activity that caused a new instance of retaliation,the move could not be classified as an adverse employment action.at most,it was the kind of a petty slight or minor annoyance that does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action.burkhart am.railcar,cir quoting burlington santa fe ry.white.finally,there is tyler argument that the episode demonstrated gardner continuing hostility for tyler exercise of his constitutional rights in.but tyler does not have any evidence that gardner orchestrated the office move and subjected tyler to heightened scrutiny as a result of his lawsuit.by the time his office was moved,at least nine months had elapsed since the settlement of tyler suit an even longer period of time passed between the office move and the university selection of flowers in february of.under this circuit jurisprudence,the eason incident does not bridge the temporal gap between tyler lawsuit and the university decision to hire flowers.see littleton,at a gap not sufficiently contemporaneous to satisfy the causation element of a prima facie case.
nor is it a case where the employer took escalating adverse and retaliatory action against the employee.heaton v.the weitz co,cir.tyler did not present any evidence indicating the members of the committee were influenced by his litigation against the university,in order to bolster his claim of causation.true,the record contains some evidence that the individual members of the committee were independently aware of the fact of the litigation.but there is no evidence the incident was discussed during the committee meetings or otherwise tainted the committee collective perception of tyler candidacy so as to support an inference of gender discrimination.see nelson penney,cir in the absence of evidence that others who filed age discrimination charges were fired,that the plaintiff supervisors discussed the filing with each other,or that either of them even commented to the plain
