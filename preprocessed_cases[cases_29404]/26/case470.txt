this case demonstrates the progress we have made,yet the distance we have to go to eliminate the vestiges of past racial discrimination.
procedural background 
this lawsuit was first filed in,resulting in the washington parish public schools being integrated in.simultaneously with the integration of the schools,bowling green school was organized as a private racially segregated school.louisiana apparently has a long history of providing aid in the form of textbooks,library books,supplies,equipment and transportation to students in private schools.in,plaintiffs in this case alleged that washington parish public school district had unconstitutionally provided considerable aid to bowling green school in the form of equipment,furniture and books.after a hearing the trial court found i t is obvious to the court that the effect of the aforementioned aid to this private racially segregated school constitutes a public encouragement of private discrimination which has the effect of diluting and frustrating our efforts to integrate this public school system in washington parish.the court then enjoined washington parish school board from providing school textbooks other materials and equipment transportation and providing any other assistance to the bowling green school id.at.
in a separate lawsuit,brumfield dodd,was filed with some or all of the plaintiffs in the instant litigation,along with others bringing suit against certain state officials,the louisiana state board of elementary and secondary education bese and six louisiana parishes,including washington parish.this was a class action against the state and these six parish school districts.the brumfield court was a three judge panel within the same district as the case at bar.the order entered in brumfield applied to all defendants,and enjoined the state defendants and the six parish school districts from distributing or otherwise making available textbooks,library books,transportation,school supplies,equipment,and any other type of assistance,or funds for such assistance,to any racially discriminatory private school or to any racially segregated private school.brumfield.at.the acts enjoined by the brumfield court in were basically the same acts that were enjoined by the court in this case in.however,the court in brumfield created a mechanism for bese to certify that private schools were no longer racially discriminatory and thus make them eligible for state assistance.see brumfield.at.
from until bowling green made no effort to become brumfield certified.louisiana for some time has had a scholarship program called the tuition opportunity program for students tops providing college scholarships for students graduating from high school with a b average or better.in the spring of,the louisiana legislature amended the tops program to require that any student requesting an award of tops money had to be enrolled in a school that was eligible for such grants and be in effect a brumfield dodd certified school.
in july of,bowling green for the first time applied for brumfield dodd certification.although bese submitted bowling green application to the justice department,the justice department objected to bowling green application noting that bowling green had no african american students and indicating bowling green would have to offer substantial and credible evidence of objective acts and declarations showing that the absence of blacks was not proximately caused by the school policies and practices to be eligible for certification.bowling green was not certified at that time.
however,in december after enrolling an african american student,lee adams,bowling green received brumfield certification.bowling green thereafter requested available public assistance through the washington parish school board.washington parish school board denied bowling green request because of the injunction entered in this case in.in september bowling green moved,and was allowed,to intervene in this case,and petitioned the court to lift or modify the injunction.
the district court ruling 
the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing in this matter in april,and on june,conducted a second hearing and ruled from the bench that brumfield certification did not as a matter of law modify the injunction rendered in this case in,that brumfield certification alone was not reason to dissolve or modify the injunction,but that brumfield certification was a matter to be taken into consideration.the court found that it had to determine whether bowling green has demonstrated a commitment to eliminate vestiges of past discrimination and made meaningful progress toward becoming a fully integrated,school with respect to faculty,and all other facets of the operation.the court concluded that because bowling green failed to integrate its school from until,and ultimately integrated only because its students would have otherwise ceased to be eligible for the tops programs,and in view of the fact that the school did not have and had never had any black faculty,that bowling green had not met its burden for dissolving or modifying the injunction.the district court was also concerned that bowling green was a member of an athletic association in mississippi composed of private schools that the court concluded had been created mainly to avoid integration,rather than participating in the louisiana association for athletic events,comprised of both public and private schools.
argument of bowling green 
bowling green argues before this court that the district court erred in not holding that the order in the brumfield case superseded the injunction in this case since washington parish was a defendant in both cases and that the injunctions in both cases enjoined washington parish school district from basically the same conduct.bowling green further argues that since it is now brumfield certified that as a matter of law,the injunction against it should be dissolved and it should be allowed to receive public assistance as do almost all other private schools in louisiana who have been brumfield certified bowling green contends that because it can not receive textbooks and other assistance from the state of louisiana as do almost all other private schools that have been brumfield certified,that bowling green and its students are denied equal protection of the law.appellant also argues that based upon the facts before the court,the court should have vacated the injunction because the original reasons for the injunction no longer exist.
bowling green maintains that the reason the washington parish school board does not want to furnish state aid to bowling green is the school board does not want to lose african american students to bowling green and because of a belief by some of the school board members that it is bad public policy for the state of louisiana to give assistance to private schools for any reason.bowling green reasons that the denial of public funding is discouraging african americans from attending bowling green school.
argument of plaintiffs and washington parish school board 
plaintiffs and washington parish school board argue that the brumfield injunction and certification procedure did not have any impact on the injunction entered in this case,that bowling green and its students are not deprived of equal protection and that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vacate the injunction.the issues thus joined in this matter are submitted to this court for decision.
did the brumfield decision modify the injunction in this case 
as to bowling green argument that the injunction in this case was superseded or modified by the brumfield injunction,bowling green has offered no authority so holding,and this court has found none.there was nothing in the order that addressed any change or modification in the order.these were two separate cases,involving some of the same issues,but also others.accordingly,the district court should be affirmed in its holding that the injunction was not superseded or modified by the brumfield injunction.see generally united states united shoe machinery,d batts forklift,cir.
