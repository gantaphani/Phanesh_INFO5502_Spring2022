section of article xiii b of the california constitution hereafter section provides,with certain exceptions,that w henever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service italics added.we are called upon here to determine the extent to which california public school districts are entitled to reimbursement under section for costs incurred in carrying out mandatory expulsions of students under education code section,subdivision b hereafter section b,for possession of a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds and discretionary expulsions of students under section,subdivision c hereafter section c,for other specified types of misconduct at those locations.
defendant commission on state mandates the commission and real party in interest california department of finance the department together appellants appeal from a judgment granting a petition for a writ of mandate in favor of plaintiff and respondent san diego unified school district the district.the district filed with the commission a test claim seeking reimbursement from the state of california the state under section for costs incurred for the mandatory expulsion of students under section b and for the discretionary expulsion of students under section c.in its decision denying the district test claim,the commission found that the costs of discretionary expulsions under amended section c are not reimbursable costs under section and the costs of mandatory expulsions under amended section b are not reimbursable costs under section to the extent the expulsion hearing procedures are required by the federal due process clause set forth in the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.

background 
statutory framework 
adopted on november,as part of an initiative measure that imposed spending limits on state and local government,section imposes on the state an obligation to reimburse local agencies for the cost of most programs and services they are required to provide pursuant to a state mandate if those local agencies were not under a preexisting duty to fund the activity.kinlaw state of california cal d,kinlaw.section provides,with exceptions not applicable here 
whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service.italics added.
in,the legislature enacted legislation,et that set forth comprehensive administrative procedures for resolution of claims arising out of section.kinlaw,supra,cal d at.
in part of division of title of the government code,which commences with government code section,the legislature created the commission,to adjudicate disputes over the existence of a program,and to adopt procedures for submission and adjudication of reimbursement claims.see generally kinlaw,supra,cal d at.the commission includes the controller,the treasurer,the director of finance,the director of the office of planning and research,a public member experienced in public finance,and two additional members appointed by the governor.
the legislation established a test claim procedure discussed,post to expeditiously resolve disputes affecting multiple agencies,established the method of payment of claims,and created reporting procedures to enable the legislature to budget adequate funds to meet the expense of state mandates,subd.a.
under procedures the commission was authorized to establish,local agencies and school districts may file claims with the commission for reimbursement of costs.this statutory procedure is the exclusive means by which a local agency or school district may claim reimbursement for costs.
a test claim is the first reimbursement claim filed by a local agency or school district with the commission alleging that a particular statute or executive order imposes costs mandated by the state.the term costs mandated by the state is defined in government code section 
costs mandated by the state means any increased costs which a local agency or school district is required to incur after july,as a result of any statute enacted on or after january,or any executive order implementing any statute enacted on or after january,which mandates a new program or higher level of service of an existing program within the meaning of section.italics added.
the state is required to reimburse a school district for all costs mandated by the state,as defined in government code section,subd.a,italics added.
government code section sets forth specific exceptions to the section reimbursement requirement.subdivision c of that section provides in part 
the commission shall not find costs mandated by the state,as defined in section,in any claim submitted by a school district,if,after a hearing,the commission finds that c the statute or executive order implemented a federal law or regulation and resulted in costs mandated by the federal government,unless the statute or executive order mandates costs which exceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation.italics added.
the commission must promptly hold a public hearing on a test claim or any other reimbursement claim under section.at the hearing,evidence may be presented by the claimant,the department,any other affected department or agency,and any other interested organization or individual,subd.a,subd.a kinlaw,supra,cal d at.after the hearing,the commission must first determine whether there are costs mandated by the state,subd.a kinlaw,supra,cal d at.if the commission determines there are such costs,it must determine the amount to be subvened to local agencies and school districts for reimbursement as required by section,subd.a,subd.a kinlaw,supra,cal d at.
student expulsion decisions 
three test claim statutes pertaining to decisions to expel students are involved in the instant appeal sections b,c,and.
mandatory expulsions section b 
the first test claim statute,section b,governs mandatory expulsions.two versions of that statute are involved here.the first,which was effective from october,through december,required a school principal or superintendent to immediately suspend,and recommend to the school district governing board the expulsion of any pupil found to be in possession of a firearm,a knife of no reasonable use to the pupil,or an explosive at school or at a school activity off school grounds and further required the governing board,after a due process hearing,to either expel the pupil or refer that pupil to an alternative education program in the event the alleged misconduct was confirmed the second version of section b involved here,which took effect on january,following an amendment,limited the grounds for mandatory expulsions to possession of a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds 
ii.discretionary expulsions section c 
the second test claim statute,section c,pertains to discretionary expulsions.as amended,section c provides that upon the recommendation of the principal,superintendent of schools,hearing officer or administrative panel,the school district governing board may order a pupil expelled upon finding,after a due process hearing,that the pupil,while at school or at a school activity off school grounds,violated any of the provisions of subdivisions f through l of section or sections or which pertain to among other things damaging or stealing school or private property,using or selling illicit drugs,receiving stolen property,possessing tobacco or drug paraphernalia,or engaging in disruptive behavior,sexual harassment,or hate violence.
iii.procedures for expulsion 
the third test claim statute at issue here,section,specifies the policies and procedures a school district governing board must follow when conducting a due process hearing in student expulsion cases.section requires that school district governing boards establish rules and regulations for expulsion of pupils.the rules and procedures must provide among other things for an evidentiary hearing on the expulsion,notice of the hearing,preparation of findings of fact if expulsion is recommended by the hearing panel,and preparation of a record of the hearing.
procedural background 
amended test claim and hearing 
in march,the district filed test claim no.with the commission.about a month later,the district filed an amendment to update the test claim to reflect new legislation.
the district amended test claim,which involved about statutes and education code sections covering legislation from to relating to expulsion of public school students,including the three test claim statutes at issue here b,c,alleged that the subject statutes had imposed on the district reimbursable costs mandated by the state within the meaning of section and government code section discussed,ante.in and,the commission held public hearings on the amended test claim.
the commission decision 
in august,the commission issued its corrected statement of decision hereafter the commission decision.the commission decision contained several findings that are pertinent to the instant appeal.
mandatory expulsions sections b and 
with respect to the district test claim involving the mandatory expulsion provisions of section b,the commission found the version of that statute as amended by chapter of statutes effective,imposed a new program or higher level of service in an existing program within the meaning of section and government code section by requiring school district governing boards to expel pupils,or alternatively refer them to an alternative education program,for the offense of possessing a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds 
with respect to the district claim for reimbursement,the commission examined the mandated expulsion procedures set forth in section discussed,ante and found that some of the provisions of that section had been enacted to comply with federal due process requirements under the fourteenth amendment,and thus did not impose reimbursable costs within the meaning of section and government code section discussed,ante.the commission also found,however,that other provisions of section did impose a new program or higher level of service in an existing program,and thus the costs incurred in providing the expulsion procedures that exceeded federal due process requirements were reimbursable.for the most part,these reimbursable costs for mandatory expulsions involve various notice procedures that exceed federal due process requirements 
ii.discretionary expulsions section c 
with respect to the district test claim involving the discretionary expulsion provisions of section c,the commission found that because expulsions under section c were discretionary,that section did not impose a new program or higher level of service,and thus the district was not entitled to reimbursement for any of the costs incurred in those expulsions.
the district petition for writ of mandate 
in october,the district challenged the commission decision by filing its petition for writ of mandate in the superior court under code of civil procedure section,alleging the commission had committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in a manner required by law.the district claimed that all costs incurred in carrying out mandatory expulsions under section b are reimbursable under section and government code section.the district argued that because there is no federal requirement to expel a student,all of the expulsion process provisions set forth in section are mandated by the state,and thus all of the costs of carrying out such mandatory expulsions are reimbursable regardless of whether the procedural requirements stem from federal law.
the district also claimed in the petition that after finding section c granted the district discretion to expel students for offenses listed therein,the commission was required under section and government code section to find that the costs incurred in carrying out such discretionary expulsions are reimbursable to the extent the mandated procedures exceed the requirements of federal due process.the district acknowledged that costs incurred in complying with federal due process procedures are not reimbursable.the district asserted it is irrelevant whether the original decision to expel a pupil under section is mandatory or discretionary because once it decides to expel a student it must follow expulsion procedures and thereby incur costs it otherwise would not have incurred.
the department opposed the petition,arguing that the state has no choice in deciding whether to comply the united states constitution,and costs imposed on local government agencies by the federal government are not costs mandated by the state by definition and thus do not require reimbursement by the state.it also argued that no reimbursement was required for discretionary expulsions because the discretion to expel students has always rested with the school districts,which have always borne the financial responsibility for carrying out expulsion procedures.the commission also filed similar opposition to the petition.
trial court ruling and amended judgment 
after issuing a tentative ruling denying the petition,the court reversed the tentative ruling and granted the petition after hearing oral argument.the amended judgment orders the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the commission to 
set aside its decision dated august,case no.csm,to the extent the commission found that reimbursable costs in an expulsion proceeding under section b are limited to the costs of those proceedings enumerated in the decision,and not required by federal law,and to issue a decision in said case finding that all costs of expulsion proceedings brought under section b are reimbursable costs and 
set aside its decision dated august,case no.csm to the extent the commission found that expulsions authorized by section c result in no reimbursable costs and to issue a decision finding that state mandated expulsion procedure costs incurred in cases when expulsion is discretionary are reimbursable to the extent they exceed costs mandated by federal law or regulation.italics added.
appellants timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
the court of appeal in city of richmond commission on state mandates th,d city of richmond explained the applicable standard of appellate review 
under government code section,a proceeding to set aside the commission decision on a claim may be commenced on the ground that the commission decision is not supported by substantial evidence.where the scope of review in the trial court is whether the administrative decision is supported by substantial evidence,our review on appeal is generally the same.citation.however,we independently review the superior court legal conclusions as to the meaning and effect of constitutional and statutory provisions.citation.italics added.
furthermore,a finding by a state agency is accorded great weight unless shown to be clearly erroneous.city of merced state of california d.city of merced.
because the facts in the instant case are essentially undisputed,the question of whether the statutes pertaining to mandatory and discretionary student expulsions impose on the district a program or higher level of service within the meaning of section is a question of law we review de novo.see city of richmond,supra,th at,d.
discussion 
mandatory expulsions 
with respect to the district test claim involving mandatory expulsions under section b,the commission found that this statute imposed a new program or higher level of service in an existing program within the meaning of section by requiring school district governing boards to expel pupils,or alternatively refer them to an alternative education program,for the offense of possessing a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds.the commission also found,however,that the district was only entitled to reimbursement for the costs it incurred in providing the expulsion procedures mandated by section that exceeded federal due process requirements.in granting the district petition for writ of mandate,the court ordered the commission to set aside its decision and enter a new decision finding that all costs of expulsion proceedings incurred by the district in carrying out mandatory expulsions under section b are reimbursable.we conclude the court did not err.
as already discussed section provides with exceptions not applicable here that w henever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service.italics added.government code section,subdivision a provides that the state shall reimburse a school district for all costs mandated by the state,as defined in government code section.italics added.government code section,in turn,provides in part that the term costs mandated by the state means any increased costs which a school district is required to incur as a result of any statute which mandates a new program or higher level of service of an existing program within the meaning of section.italics added.
relying on subdivision c of government code section,appellants contend the costs incurred by the district in carrying out mandatory expulsions under section b and complying with the mandatory expulsion procedures set forth in section are reimbursable only to the extent the costs are incurred in providing those section procedures that exceed federal due process requirements.we reject this contention and hold that the district is entitled to reimbursement of all costs incurred in carrying out mandatory expulsions under section b.
appellants reliance on subdivision c of government code section is misplaced.that section sets forth various exceptions to the section reimbursement requirement.subdivision c of that section directs that the commission shall not find in a school district claim any costs mandated by the state as defined by section if t he statute implemented a federal law or regulation and resulted in costs mandated by the federal government,unless the statute mandates costs which exceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation.italics added.
we are called upon to determine in the context of the instant case whether the term the statute as used in subdivision c of government code section refers to section b,which is the subject mandatory expulsion test claim statute at issue here,or to section,which as already noted specifies the procedures that a school district must follow in carrying out a mandatory expulsion under section b.
the applicable canons of statutory construction that guide our analysis in this matter are well established.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.select base materials board of equal.cal d.in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning.lungren deukmejian cal d.if the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction.ibid.we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.people coronado cal th,d.
we conclude that the term the statute as used in subdivision c of government code section discussed,ante plainly refers to the test claim statute under which a given school district may seek reimbursement under section.government code section is part of the implementing legislation enacted in,et that sets forth comprehensive administrative procedures for resolution of test claims arising out of section.kinlaw,supra,cal d at.in the instant case,section b,not section,is the mandatory expulsion test claim statute in question.
such an interpretation comports with the general purpose of the statutory scheme governing reimbursement of costs incurred by local governments.in county of fresno state of california cal d,county of fresno,the california supreme court explained that the purpose of section is to protect the tax revenues of local governments from state mandates that would require expenditure of such revenues.italics added.here,the parties agree that mandatory pupil expulsion under section b is a state,not a federal,mandate.section b does not implement a federal law or regulation within the meaning of government code section,subdivision c,because no federal law or regulation mandates pupil expulsion for possession of a firearm.
appellants reliance on the decision in county of los angeles commission on state mandates th,d county of los angeles is misplaced.there,the court of appeal rejected the claim that penal code section,which required counties to provide indigent criminal defendants with certain defense funds,imposed an unfunded state mandate.county of los angeles,supra,at,d.los angeles county filed the test claim after the state,which had enacted appropriations between and to reimburse counties for their costs under that statute,made no appropriation for the fiscal year.id.at,d.in rejecting the claim,the court of appeal held there was no state mandate because among other things penal code section merely implemented the mandates of federal law.county of los angeles,supra,at,d.the court explained that even in the absence of penal code section,appellant and other counties would be responsible for providing ancillary services under the constitutional guarantees of due process under the fourteenth amendment and the sixth amendment right to counsel.county of los angeles,supra,at,d.
in the county of los angeles case,the requirements of the test claim statute,penal code section,did not constitute a state mandate for purposes of section because those requirements implemented the mandates of federal law.here,however,neither of the test claim statutes at issue here b implements a federal mandate requiring expulsion of students found to be in possession of a firearm while at school or at a school activity off school grounds.thus,the county of los angeles case is inapposite.
we conclude that the exception to the section reimbursement requirement set forth in subdivision c of government code section discussed,ante does not apply in the instant case.the court properly found that the due process procedures required by federal law,would not automatically occur in the absence of the mandatory expulsion requirements of section b.we further conclude that because the mandatory expulsion of a student for possession of a firearm under section b is a state mandate that does not implement a federal mandate,and no exception to the section reimbursement requirement applies,the district is entitled to reimbursement of all costs incurred in carrying out that state mandate,including the cost of complying with all of the mandatory procedures set forth in section.the court properly rejected the commission finding that the district was only entitled to reimbursement for the costs it incurred in providing the section expulsion procedures that exceeded federal due process requirements.
ii.discretionary expulsions 
in granting the district petition for writ of mandate,the court also ordered the commission to enter a new decision finding that the costs incurred by the district in carrying out discretionary expulsions under section c are reimbursable to the extent those costs result from hearing procedures that exceed federal due process requirements.we conclude the court did not err.
as already discussed in the background section of this opinion,section c is a test claim statute under which a school district governing board may expel a pupil upon finding,after a due process hearing,that the pupil,while at school or at a school activity off school grounds,committed a specified offense,such as damaging or stealing school or private property,using or selling illicit drugs,receiving stolen property,possessing tobacco or drug paraphernalia,or engaging in disruptive behavior,sexual harassment,or hate violence.
citing city of merced,supra,d,appellants contend that once a school district makes a discretionary decision under section c to expel a student,the costs of complying with the downstream procedures mandated by section are not reimbursable under section.we reject this contention.
it is undisputed that once a school district exercises its discretion to expel a student under section c,it must comply with the expulsion procedures mandated by section,the third test claim statute at issue in the instant appeal.the statutory framework does not permit school districts to conduct discretionary expulsions in alternative methods in which one method results in costs and another method does not.as already discussed,the purpose of section is to protect the tax revenues of school districts and other local government bodies from state mandates that would require expenditure of such revenues.county of fresno,supra,cal d at.appellants do not rely upon,nor can they rely upon,any of the exceptions to the section reimbursement requirement set forth in government code section we hold that section imposes a new program or higher level of service within the meaning of section and government code section to the extent it mandates expulsion procedures that exceed federal due process requirements in connection with discretionary pupil expulsions under section c.
appellants reliance on the city of merced decision is misplaced the issue presented in that case was whether code of civil procedure section which requires compensation for loss of goodwill when business property is taken by eminent domain,imposes a cost.city of merced,supra,d at.citing code of civil procedure section for the proposition that the city had discretion as to whether to acquire the subject property by purchase or eminent domain,the court of appeal held that the city payment of goodwill under the statute is was not a cost.city of merced,supra,at.the court explained that whether a city or county decides to exercise eminent domain is,essentially,an option of the city or county,rather than a mandate of the state.the fundamental concept is that the city or county is not required to exercise eminent domain.if,however,the power of eminent domain is exercised,then the city will be required to pay for loss of goodwill.ibid.
the city of merced case is factually and legally distinguishable.city of merced involved compensation for loss of goodwill in an eminent domain proceeding city of merced,supra,d at.here,we are concerned with hearing procedures that exceed federal due process requirements and increase the operating expenses of school districts seeking to ensure a safe educational environment for the pupils under their care and supervision by carrying out expulsions under section c.the obligation of school districts to provide a safe educational environment is embodied in article i,section,subdivision c of the california constitution,which provides 
all students and staff of public primary,elementary,junior high and senior high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe,secure and peaceful.
payment of compensation for loss of goodwill as an element of damages in an eminent domain proceeding is simply not analogous to a school district incurring of additional costs to comply with due process expulsion hearing requirements that are mandated by the state under section,but are not mandated by federal due process requirements.in light of a school district constitutional obligation to provide a safe educational environment discussed,ante,the incurring of such costs can not properly be viewed as a nonreimbursable downstream consequence of a decision to expel a student under section c for damaging or stealing school or private property,using or selling illicit drugs,receiving stolen property,engaging in sexual harassment or hate violence,or committing other specified acts of misconduct discussed,ante that warrant such expulsion.
once the district makes the discretionary decision to expel a student under section c,it does not have discretion to carry out that expulsion in a manner that avoids the mandatory state procedures set forth in section.it is compelled under california statutory mandate to follow expulsion hearing procedures that exceed federal due process requirements.the procedures that exceed federal due process requirements compel school districts to incur additional costs.the purpose of section is to indemnify school districts to the extent they are required by state mandate to make such payments out of their limited budgets.
we conclude the procedures mandated by section that exceed federal due process requirements impose a new program or higher level of service within the meaning of section the costs the district incurs in complying with the procedures mandated by section are thus reimbursable costs for purposes of section to the extent the procedures to which they relate exceed federal due process requirements.see also,subd.c,discussed,ante.
in its opening brief,the commission relies on lucia mar unified school dist.honig cal d,lucia mar for the proposition that t he california supreme court has recognized that once a local agency performs a permissive act,or has alternatives other than performing the action under the test claim statute,the downstream or consequential activities,although statutorily required,are not mandated by the state.the lucia mar decision,however,does not support this proposition.
lucia mar involved section,which was enacted in and required local school districts to contribute part of the cost of educating district students at state schools for the severely handicapped.lucia mar,supra,cal d at.before,various statutes had required school districts to contribute to the education of students in their districts who attended the state schools.id.at.those statutes were repealed following the passage of proposition in,and in the state assumed full responsibility for funding the schools.lucia mar,supra,cal d at.when article xiii b was added to the constitution,effective july,the state had full financial responsibility for operating the state schools,and the state still had this responsibility when section was enacted in.lucia mar,supra,cal d at.
in the lucia mar unified school district and other school districts filed a test claim asserting that section required them to make payments for a new program or increased level of service,thus entitling them to reimbursement under section.lucia mar,supra,cal d at.the commission denied the claim,finding that,although increased costs had been imposed on the districts,section did not establish a new program or increased level of service.lucia mar,supra,cal d at.the trial court affirmed the commission decision.ibid.the court of appeal also affirmed,reasoning that a shift in the funding of an existing program is not a new program or a higher level of service.ibid.
the supreme court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the state.lucia mar,supra,cal d at.the court recognized that local entities are not entitled to reimbursement for all increased costs mandated by state law,but only those costs resulting from a new program or an increased level of service imposed upon them by the state.id.at.the court explained that the term program,as used in article xiii b of the california constitution,is one that carries out the govern
