introduction 
plaintiff katrina yu appeals an order denying her motion for a preliminary injunction against defendant university of la verne the university.we affirm.
yu,a law student at the university,was charged by the university with plagiarism and academic dishonesty.she was convicted of those charges by a panel known as the judicial board.yu then appealed to allen easley,the dean of the university college of law the dean.the dean not only affirmed the judicial board decision,he increased the sanctions imposed on yu.
yu contends that the dean decision to increase her punishment violated education code section section.this statute prohibits private universities from disciplining students solely on the basis of speech which would be protected from governmental restriction by the federal and state constitutions if made off campus.
yu failed to meet her burden of showing the likelihood that she would prevail on the merits of her claim.she did not show that the dean decision to increase her punishment was based solely on her exercise of free speech rights.the trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying yu motion for a preliminary injunction.
yu contract drafting assignment 
in the spring of yu was in her final semester of law school at the university,which is a private institution.during that semester she took a contracts drafting class with professor daniel.in march professor daniel asked the students in the class to prepare a contract for a hypothetical client.
the assignment required students to work in teams as.yu,hyung ahn and jeff wirtes worked together as a team.professor daniels asked this team to prepare a contract on behalf of a seller.alvin koan was assigned the task of playing the role of opposing counsel.
yu found a contract on the internet,which she forwarded by email to ahn and wirtes.the contract yu prepared for the class included provisions that were in the internet contract and provisions prepared by ahn.
the judicial board finds yu guilty of plagiarism and academic dishonesty 
in may,a few days before the law school graduation ceremony,yu was notified by an assistant dean that she was being investigated for plagiarism and academic dishonesty.yu was offered a plea bargain by the university,which she declined.
yu later learned that ahn and koan were also under investigation for plagiarism and academic dishonesty.ahn and koan accepted their plea bargains.wirtes was not charged with any wrongdoing.
on august,the university brought formal charges of plagiarism and academic dishonesty against yu.a trial was held on september,before a judicial board that consisted of two faculty members and one student member.the case against yu was presented by a special prosecutor who was a faculty member.
on september,yu received the judicial board decision finding her guilty.although the special prosecutor had asked the judicial board to expel yu from the law school,the judicial board imposed a lesser punishment,namely yu received no credit for the contracts drafting class and a grade of was entered in her academic record.
yu appeal to the dean 
yu appealed the judicial board decision to the dean.the appeal consisted of a letter from yu attorney.
under the manual of academic policies and procedure the mapp of the university college of law,the dean may reverse a decision of the judicial board only if the dean determines that no reasonable person would have issued the decision or if newly discovered evidence justifies a new hearing.the mapp further provides if the dean concludes that a different sanction is justified,he or she may impose a greater or lesser sanction than that imposed by the judicial board.
yu made four main arguments to the dean she was singled out for prosecution when other classmates who engaged in similar conduct were not prosecuted professor daniel syllabus was ambiguous about what use of form agreements meant the definition of plagiarism in the mapp was unclear and yu did not copy the work of another student,rather that student copied her work.she also presented character evidence.
on october,in a letter,the dean rejected yu appeal.the dean also increased the sanctions imposed on yu by suspending her for the remainder of the academic year and by the insertion of a formal letter of censure in yu file.
because the basis for the dean decision is critical to our analysis,we shall quote at length from the dean letter.with respect to the judicial board finding of guilt,the dean stated the following my decision on this appeal is limited by the terms of the mapp,which allow me to overturn the finding of guilt only if i determine that no reasonable person could make the finding of guilt.a reasonable person could find from the evidence presented that the prohibition against use of form agreements in the student final work product was clear,that the definition of plagiarism was clear,and that yu copied significant portions of her final work product from form agreements and from the work of another student,in violation of both professor daniel syllabus requirements and the mapp plagiarism rules.there is also evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that the prohibition on use of form agreements and collaboration among students applied only to the final graded work product,so that evidence of possible collaboration or use of form agreements in earlier drafts by other students was not relevant and was properly excluded.the bald assertion in a letter of appeal that professor daniel has had a history of difficulties with certain students and therefore singled out yu is both inadequate and insufficient.whether or not professor daniel had difficulties with other students has no bearing on whether yu violated course rules and plagiarism rules.furthermore,even if other students in professor daniel class committed plagiarism violated her course rules,but were not prosecuted,and there does not appear to be any competent evidence to support this assertion,that does not excuse yu offense.cheating does not become acceptable conduct because others engaged in it and were not caught.clear rules do not become unclear simply because some students might choose to ignore them.
the dean stated the following regarding the punishment imposed on yu with respect to the sanction recommended by the judicial board,the board was apparently influenced in its recommendation by the fact that two other students in professor daniel class were also charged with plagiarism and pled guilty,accepting summary dispositions that involved sanctions comparable to that recommended for yu.the opportunity to accept a similar summary disposition was also offered to yu.she elected to contest her guilt at a hearing,which is of course,her right to do.it is equally clear,however,that it is appropriate for a prosecutor to seek a more severe sanction from an accused who chooses not to accept a plea bargain.indeed,all three students who were charged were told that if they elected not to accept the proposed summary disposition,there were no guarantees that more serious sanctions would not be sought in a hearing.
it is quite clear that remorse is a well established factor in sentencing.the other two students accused of plagiarism in professor daniel class both exhibited remorse and showed an understanding of the nature and seriousness of their actions.yu has yet to show any remorse,nor has she shown any comprehension of the seriousness of the charges brought against her.she did attach to her appeal letter a series of letters and emails from various individuals attesting to her moral character.these letters and emails address her work ethic and moral character generally,and more specifically her accomplishments when she was president of the sports entertainment law society,a student organization.however,they do not address the charges brought against yu.
yu was found to have copied multiple provisions some several paragraphs long from an online form contract and from another student contract.so her violation of plagiarism rules and course rules was not minor or an incidental portion of an otherwise compliant assignment.yu use of unauthorized materials in her assignment is not unlike a student using unauthorized materials in a final exam.last year a student was caught hiding a course outline in a restroom so that he could access it surreptitiously during the final exam.the sanction sought was expulsion from law school.the student voluntarily withdrew to avoid being expelled from school.both that student conduct and yu conduct represent blatant examples of academic dishonesty.a sanction more serious than a failing grade in the course is clearly justified.as noted above,the sanction imposed,in addition to a grade of for the course,will be suspension for the remainder of the current academic year through summer and the insertion in yu file of a formal letter of censure.
proceedings in the superior court 
on october,yu filed a complaint in the superior court against the university.the complaint set forth a single cause of action for violation of section.
on november,yu filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.in this motion yu requested a preliminary injunction enjoining the university from enforcing the dean october,decision.
on december,the trial court denied yu motion.the court found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that yu was likely to prevail on the merits of her cause of action.yu timely appealed this order 
the overarching issue on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying yu motion for a preliminary injunction.in order to determine that issue we must decide two issues of law.the first is whether section protects the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.the second is whether yu appeal to the dean was the kind of speech protected by section.we must also decide whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court implied finding that yu exercise of her free speech rights was not the sole basis for the university decision to increase her sanctions.
discussion 
standard of review 
the trial court is required to review two interrelated factors when deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,gallo.the first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial.the second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.ibid.
we generally review a trial court order denying a motion for preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.sahlolbei providence healthcare,th.such an order should be affirmed if the trial court correctly found the moving party failed to satisfy either of the factors.ibid.
where the evidence before the trial court was in conflict,we do not reweigh it or determine the credibility of witnesses on appeal.t he trial court is the judge of the credibility of the affidavits filed in support of the application for preliminary injunction and it is that court province to resolve conflicts.citation.our task is to ensure that the trial court factual determinations,whether express or implied,are supported by substantial evidence.citation.thus,we interpret the facts in a light most favorable to the prevailing party and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.citations.people ex rel.reisig acuna th.

it is yu burden to show that the trial court committed reversible error.a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown.this is not only a general principle of appellate practice but an ingredient of the constitutional doctrine of reversible error.denham superior court cal d,denham.
yu did not meet her burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits 
section,subdivision a provides no private postsecondary educational institution shall make or enforce a rule subjecting a student to disciplinary sanctions solely on the basis of conduct that is speech or other communication that,when engaged in outside the campus or facility of a private postsecondary institution,is protected from governmental restriction by the first amendment to the united states constitution or section of article i of the california constitution.
yu contends that the university violated section,subdivision a by increasing her sanctions solely on the basis of her exercise of free speech and petition rights.before we directly address the merits of yu claim,we shall discuss the legal parameters of section.
general principles of statutory interpretation 
in construing any statute,w rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citation.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.citation.
if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous or reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation,we will examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes,and we can look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.citation.
we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citation.further,we presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.citation.doe brown th.
section protects liberty of speech but does not protect the right to petition the government for redress of grievances
