a special needs child,a child suffering from mental physical disability,can not reasonably be expected to take care of himself or herself.such a child at public school needs help and protection.this case illustrates the unique vulnerability of such a child and the unique responsibility of a school district to such a child.panama buena vista union school dist.th,d.
jennifer appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of the los angeles unified school district,respondent.appellant is a special needs student who was sexually assaulted by another special needs student on school grounds.she brought an action against respondent alleging negligent supervision and maintaining a dangerous condition of public property.appellant contends that the trial court erroneously granted the motion for summary judgment because triable issues of material fact existed as to both causes of action.we reverse.
on april,appellant was a student at virgil middle school virgil in los angeles.she is a person with mental disability.she suffers from hearing disability,aphasia,behavior problems,emotional difficulties and cognitive difficulties.however,she could function at public school on a borderline basis.she was not entitled to supervision.during lunch break,which lasted minutes,appellant was mainstreamed.this meant that she was allowed to interact with the general education student body.
after finishing her lunch appellant was approached by tony,another special needs student who said that he wanted to talk to her.appellant did not know tony and had never seen him on campus.she did not appreciate the danger of his request to follow him to a secluded area.
tony led appellant across the school campus to a concrete stairway on the school border.they walked down the stairway and went into a space,an alcove,under the stairway.a fence separated the alcove from an adjoining public sidewalk.the alcove was not visible from the virgil campus.but anyone walking along the adjoining public sidewalk would have an unobstructed view of the alcove.inside the alcove,tony sexually assaulted appellant.
a parent walking along the sidewalk told a school official that two students were having sex inside the alcove.the school official notified maria sanchez,a campus aide.sanchez walked to the alcove,where she saw appellant and tony seated on the ground.appellant skirt was up above her waist,and tony pants were unzipped exposing his boxer shorts.tony ran away.sanchez took appellant to the dean office.appellant told assistant principal arturo valdez that tony had sexually assaulted her.
nineteen virgil employees and volunteer parents had been assigned to provide supervision during the lunch break.three adults and sanchez had been assigned to supervise the particular area where the alcove was located.in addition,a former principal and two assistant principals walked around and monitored the entire campus during the lunch break.
the end of the lunch break was marked by the ringing of a bell.a tardy bell rang six minutes later,and at that time a tardy sweep of the campus was supposed to have been conducted to assure that all students were in class.
assistant principal phil toyotome was aware that students could attempt to evade school supervision by hiding in the alcove.this was a problem area and so he asked sanchez to regularly check the alcove during the lunch break.on april,sanchez checked the alcove five times,or approximately once every six minutes.no one was there.her final check occurred approximately three minutes before the bell rang to mark the end of lunch break.about minutes after the final check,she found appellant and tony inside the alcove.the area around the alcove was marked by a bright yellow chain to indicate that students were not allowed there.the student body had been informed that this area was off limits during lunch break.
before april,neither the virgil administration,nor supervision staff charged with supervising the area,was aware of any sexual assaults or other illicit activity occurring during school hours around or under the stairs in question.
standard of review 
the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a triable issue of material fact exists only if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,see also code civ,subd.p.the defendant also bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,where,as here,the burden of proof at trial is by a preponderance of the evidence,the defendant must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than not,at,d.if the defendant carries this burden,the burden of production shifts to the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact,at,d.the plaintiff must present evidence that would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying material fact more likely than not,at,d.

negligent supervision 
the law with respect to school authorities duty of supervision to students,in general,is well settled california law has long imposed on school authorities a duty to supervise at all times the conduct of the children on the school grounds and to enforce those rules and regulations necessary to their protection.citations.citations.citations.the standard of care imposed upon school personnel in carrying out this duty to supervise is identical to that required in the performance of their other duties.this uniform standard to which they are held is that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence,charged with comparable duties,would exercise under the same circumstances.citations.either a total lack of supervision citation or ineffective supervision citation may constitute a lack of ordinary care on the part of those responsible for student supervision citation.citation.hoff vacaville unified school dist.cal th,d.our supreme court has recognized the commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical harm.dailey los angeles unified sch.dist.cal d.
the law with respect to a special needs child is still emerging.the general rules above cited surely apply but,are there special rules for the special needs child in panama buena vista school,supra,th,d,the court of appeal was confronted with the problem of a special needs student who was sexually assaulted in a restroom at a public school prior to the beginning of classes.the jury found that the school district had failed to adequately supervise students before school actually commenced.the school had not undertaken to provide for supervision of children prior to the start of classes.in a comprehensive opinion canvassing the duties of school officials towards students in general,the court turned its attention to the special needs student remarking on the unique vulnerability of such a student id.at,d and the unique responsibilities of school officials to adequately supervise such children.id.at,d.the court held given the foreseeability of harm to special education students,the statutory duty of school districts to take all reasonable steps to protect them,the relatively minimal burden on school districts to ensure adequate supervision for any students they permit on their campuses prior to the start of school,and the paramount policy concern of providing our children with safe learning environments,we find the district owed the minor a duty of care to protect him from an assault on campus.see thompson sacramento city unified school,supra,th at,d articulating factors considered in determining whether duty was owed.id.at,d.in his dissent justice levy saw the majority opinion as a clear departure from established california law.id.at,d.this was so because of the majority focus on the victim status without adequate consideration to the foreseeability of the particular type of harm which was inflicted.id.at,d.as we shall explain,we agree with the letter and spirit of panama buena vista school,supra,and disagree with the dissent therein.
generally speaking,the absence of prior similar tortious conduct is one factor pointing to the absence of negligent supervision.when an injury occurs despite a defendant efforts to provide security or supervision,it is relatively easy to claim that,ipso facto,the security or supervision provided was ineffective.without more,such claims fail.thompson sacramento unified school dist.th,d.here,there is more.given the unique vulnerability of special needs students,it is foreseeable that they may be victimized by other students.where school officials allow a hidden area to be maintained on campus,it is foreseeable that other students may use the hiding place to take advantage of a special needs student.school officials were on constructive notice that this hidden alcove was a potential place for victimization,a problem area.
respondent goes one step further and argues that appellant must show,as a matter of law,the same type of conduct or victimization had previously occurred on campus before there can be a finding of foreseeability.foreseeability is one of the factors in the traditional duty analysis.see thompson sacramento unified school,supra,th at,d,citing rowland christian cal d,see also ballard uribe cal d,discussion of the court role and the jury role concerning duty,foreseeability,and proximate cause.the types of victimization of a special needs child are only limited by the imagination of the victimizer.this could include teasing,harassment,assault,battery,sexual assault,taking lunch money,or robbery.in this context,it is the special needs student vulnerability to all of the above that gives rise to the duty to adequately supervise and to eliminate hidden areas where victimization can occur.
a s a general matter,there is no duty to protect others from the conduct of third parties.citations.delgado trax bar grill cal th,d.however,a defendant may owe an affirmative duty to protect another from the conduct of third parties if he or she has a special relationship with the other person.citations,at,d,see also prosser keeton,torts,ed,schools toward their pupils.in the traditional special relationship setting,the plaintiff is particularly vulnerable and dependent upon the defendant who,correspondingly,has some control over the plaintiff welfare.citation.kockelman segal th,d.this is the presenting situation.
we do not hold,indicate,or suggest that school officials are the insurers of a special needs child safety,or are strictly liable for injuries suffered by such a student,or owe a higher duty of care with respect to such a child.a special needs child at public schools needs help and protection.we believe school officials,in theory,would agree with this unremarkable statement.but,in our view,they may need an incentive to drive compliance with the duty to provide adequate supervision.our ruling today provides that incentive.we hold that maintenance of a hiding place where a special needs child can be victimized satisfies the foreseeability factor of the duty analysis even in the absence of prior similar occurrences.
in his dissent in the panama buena vista school district case,justice levy reiterated the statement through hindsight everything is forseeable.citation.panama buena vista school,supra,th at,d.in our view,there is no need for any hindsight.in the present circumstances,a modicum of foresight shows a probability of victimization.a court task in determining whether there should be a duty,vel non,is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant conduct but rather to evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party.ballard uribe,supra,cal d at,fn.this statement from our supreme court opinion undercuts the views of the dissent in panama buena vista school,supra,th,d,and is the philosophical underpinning of our holding.
our supreme court has indicated that there are a number of considerations which come into play when a court is considering whether or not there is a duty in any given case t he foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.citations.rowland christian,supra,cal d at.we consider these factors first,we have already indicated that here there was foreseeability predicated not on prior similar occurrences,but rather on the vulnerability of the plaintiff.second,there is a degree of certainty that the plaintiff did suffer injury.third,there is a closeness of the connection between defendant maintenance of the hidden area and the injury suffered.fourth,there is some degree of moral blame attached to the defendant conduct because it could have easily prevented this occurrence from happening in the area by simply blocking access thereto.fifth,the policy of preventing future harm of a similar nature to a similar plaintiff is present.sixth,the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community is acceptable because the goal here is to have safe school grounds not only for special needs children,but for all children.seventh,respondent is a governmental entity and may be with or without an excess insurance policy.the record is silent thereon.whatever the impact of insurance can have here,it does not carry the day one way or the other.
expert declaration defeats summary judgment 
respondent met its initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.respondent evidence tended to show that its employees had provided adequate supervision.appellant was not entitled to supervision,and she was mainstreamed during lunch breaks.the area around the alcove was marked by bright yellow chains to indicate that it was off limits,and the student body had been so informed.three adults and sanchez had been assigned to supervise this particular area.sanchez checked the alcove five times,or approximately once every six minutes,during the lunch break.no one was there.her final check occurred about three minutes before the bell rang to mark the end of lunch break.virgil employees were not aware of any sexual assaults or other illicit activity occurring during school hours around or under the stairs in
