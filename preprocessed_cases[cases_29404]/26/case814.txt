david johnson brought suit against his employer,the university of iowa university,alleging that the university parental leave policy violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,the equal protection clause of the iowa constitution,title vii of the civil rights act of,and the iowa civil rights act.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims.we affirm.
background 
in,johnson and his wife,jennie embree,were expecting a baby girl.at that time,johnson worked in the office of the registrar at the university,and embree worked in the university college of nursing.while attending a class that explained the details of the university parental leave policy,johnson was told that he,unlike embree,could not use accrued sick leave to be paid for absences after the birth of their daughter.
the applicable portion of the parental leave policy,as contained in chapter of the operations manual which governs the employment of embree and johnson,states 
parental leave policy 
purpose.to permit parents who have care giving responsibilities to have time off to spend with a child newly added to the family and,to the extent permitted by state law,to be paid during such leave.to adapt an employee work schedule duties to help reduce conflict with parental obligations.
entitlement to leave.
faculty,professional,scientific,and merit system staff.
a biological mothers are entitled to leave for any period of temporary disability,to be charged against accrued sick leave.based on current medical practice,a leave of six weeks or less would not require the employee to provide disability documentation.if an employee accumulated sick leave is insufficient to cover the period of disability,the employee will,at the employee request,be granted a leave of absence to be charged to vacation time,compensatory time,or a leave of absence without pay.any request for absence beyond the period of disability is considered as a leave of absence without pay or as vacation.
b a newly adoptive parent,including a domestic partner,is entitled to one week days of paid adoption leave to be charged against accrued sick leave.departments are encouraged to arrange for additional leave as necessary.departments should work with prospective adoptive parents seeking to adopt through an adoption agency with specific requirements for parental leave,to the extent the adoption leave is not sufficient to undertake an adoption.time not charged to accrued sick leave may be charged to accrued vacation or taken as leave without pay.
johnson disagreed with the class instructor interpretation of the policy,so he sought clarification from other representatives from the university human resources department as well as the president of the university.after being consistently told that biological fathers were not allowed to use accrued paid sick leave for absences following the birth of a child,johnson filed a complaint with the iowa civil rights commission and the equal employment opportunity commission.he obtained letters and initiated this case in the district court.he was subsequently certified to represent the class of biological fathers employed by the university.
johnson argues that the university parental leave policy is discriminatory on its face because it allows biological mothers and adoptive parents to use accrued sick leave after the birth or arrival of a new child without extending a similar benefit to biological fathers.johnson also contends that the policy is discriminatory as applied because the university denied his request to use accrued sick leave but granted embree request for what johnson deems caregiving leave.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.charleston hous.auth.united states of,cir.although the facts are largely undisputed in this case,the parties disagree about the exact nature of the leave the university granted to embree.summary judgment is still appropriate,however,when the disputed facts will not affect the outcome of the suit.dodd runyon,cir.for the reasons discussed infra,we find that even if we take johnson characterization of embree leave as accurate,his claims still fail as a matter of law.
iii.analysis 
the university parental leave policy provides biological mothers and adoptive parents of both genders with the ability to use accrued paid sick leave for time away from work that is related to the addition of a child.johnson argues that the policy is unlawful because the university does not extend this benefit to biological fathers.all of johnson claims of discrimination rely on this premise.
as the district court correctly noted,to determine whether biological fathers are being unlawfully discriminated against,we must separately compare them to the two groups allowed to use accrued paid sick leave biological mothers and adoptive parents of both genders.we decline to adopt johnson repeated characterization that the parental leave policy contains a biological father exclusion.rather,the policy provides two different sets of benefits to two different groups the university did not provide these benefits to johnson because he is not a member of either group designated to receive benefits.it did not exclude him on the basis that he is a biological father.
biological mothers versus biological fathers 
the university provides biological mothers with the option of using up to six weeks of accrued paid sick leave after birth.although only women are eligible to receive this benefit,the policy does not necessarily present discrimination.if the leave given to biological mothers is granted due to the physical trauma they sustain giving birth,then it is conferred for a valid reason wholly separate from gender.if the leave is instead designed to provide time to care for,and bond with,a newborn,then there is no legitimate reason for biological fathers to be denied the same benefit.thus,the primary question for us to consider is whether the leave given to biological mothers is in fact disability leave.
johnson relies heavily on the parental leave policy introductory statement which says its purpose is to permit parents who have care giving responsibilities to have time off to spend with a child newly added to the family johnson also draws our attention to an informational guide produced by the university which states leave is for the biological mother to recover from childbirth and to spend time with the newborn child although these purpose statements cloud the issue,they are not part of the operative language of the policy the sentence that actually confers the benefit at issue states biological mothers are entitled to leave for any period of temporary disability,to be charged against accrued sick leave.this policy language does not allow mothers to use accrued sick leave after their period of disability has ended.thus,the period away from work constitutes disability leave,even though mothers are likely caring for their newborns during this period.allowing biological mothers disability leave on the same terms as employees with other disabilities is not only permissible,but is required by the pregnancy discrimination act of,stat.
johnson argues that the university paid maternity leave can not be interpreted as disability leave because the university does not require proof of a disability when the leave taken after giving birth is six weeks or less.we reject this argument because it is not unreasonable for the university to establish a period of presumptive disability so that it does not need to review medical records for each and every employee who gives birth.in support of its motion for summary judgment,the university provided testimony that a period of disability after childbirth is supported by medical evidence.although johnson submitted embree affidavit claiming that she was fully recovered from childbirth after four weeks,he has offered no medical evidence indicating that the general period of recovery is less than six weeks.for all of these reasons,we find that the policy provisions distinguishing between biological mothers and biological fathers are not
