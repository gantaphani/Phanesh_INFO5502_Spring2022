the individuals with disabilities education act idea guarantees children with disabilities a free appropriate public education fape.d a.we consider the interplay between the idea procedural and substantive safeguards.
background 
suffers from norrie disease,a genetic disorder that renders him blind.he also has a host of other deficits that cause him developmental delays in all academic areas.mother,met with several school administrators and instructors to discuss educational challenges and draft an individualized educational program iep.at the conclusion of this meeting,she signed an iep document and authorize d the goals and services but did not agree it provides a fape.
then filed a due process complaint alleging that the antelope valley union high school district the district committed procedural and substantive violations of the idea.the due process hearing took place before an administrative law judge who denied all of claims and the district court affirmed.

the idea primary goal is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services mercer island sch,cir.quoting d a.a fape must be tailored to the unique needs of the handicapped child by means of an individualized educational program iep.hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.rowley,quoting.an iep must contain,among other things,a statement of the child present levels of academic achievement,a statement of measurable annual goals and a statement of the special education and related services to be provided to the child.d a i.when formulating an iep,a school district must comply both procedurally and substantively with the idea,fed.way sch,cir.citing rowley,at,so that the process will be informed not only by the expertise of school officials,but also by the input of the child parents or guardians,endrew douglas cty.sch,slip op.at.
standard of review 
judicial review in idea cases differs substantially from judicial review of other agency actions,in which courts are generally confined to the administrative record and are held to a highly deferential standard of review.ojai unified sch.dist.jackson,cir.we review whether the state has provided a fape de novo.union sch.dist.smith,cir.we can accord some deference to the alj factual findings,but only where they are thorough and careful,and the extent of deference to be given is within our discretion.id.citations omitted.
the district court accorded the alj findings substantial deference because the alj questioned witnesses during a hearing and wrote a opinion that reviewed the qualifications of witnesses and culled relevant details from the record.but neither the duration of the hearing,nor the alj active involvement,nor the length of the alj opinion can ensure that the alj was thorough and careful.ex rel.fresno unified sch,cir.and,in this case,the alj was neither thorough nor careful.as plaintiffs point out,the alj did address all issues and disregarded some of the evidence presented at the hearing.even the district court recognized that the alj analysis is not entirely satisfying.accordingly,the district court erred in deferring to the alj findings.
ii.procedural violations 
the idea contains numerous procedural safeguards that are designed to protect the rights of disabled children and their parents.see.these safeguards are a central feature of the idea process,not a mere afterthought congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.rowley,at.because disabled children and their parents are generally not represented by counsel during the iep process,procedural errors at that stage are particularly likely to be prejudicial and cause the loss of educational benefits.
therefore,compliance with the idea procedural safeguards is essential to ensuring that every eligible child receives a fape,and those procedures which provide for meaningful parent participation are particularly important.amanda clark cty.sch,cir.procedural violations that interfere with parental participation in the iep formulation process undermine the very essence of the idea.id.at.
plaintiffs allege that the district violated the idea by failing to adequately document the services provided by a teacher of the visually impaired tvi,failing to specify the assistive technology at devices provided and failing to file a response to the due process complaint.
failure to adequately document tvi services 
plaintiffs claim that the district did provide a written record of reasonable expectations to hold the district accountable for the provision of vision services to quoting amanda,at.a brief history of the district shifting offer of tvi services is necessary the iep document signed by and the district included an offer of minutes of tvi services per month.according to the district,it realized a week later this was a mistake.but the district did nothing to notify.more than a month later,the district purported to unilaterally amend the iep by changing the offer of tvi services to minutes per week.the district did send a copy of the revised iep or otherwise notify her of this change.in fact,she did learn of it until the first day of the due process hearing,a month later.moreover,at the hearing,district witnesses testified that the district offered minutes of tvi services per week.
plaintiffs claim that the district failure to accurately document the offer of tvi services denied a fape by precluding from meaningfully participating in the iep process.before discussing the merits of this claim we must address the district argument that the claim is waived.
the district judge recognized that plaintiffs due process complaint arguably encompassed plaintiffs argument that the provision of tvi services was inadequate.the judge nevertheless found that plaintiffs waived any argument that the district failure to specify the frequency of tvi services in the august,iep resulted in an actual denial of an educational benefit to because the due process complaint was superseded by the alj restatement of issues,which omitted the adequacy of tvi services.
the district judge held that plaintiffs waived the issue by failing to object to this omission but plaintiffs were aware that the district had unilaterally changed the iep until after the alj had restated the issues,so they could hardly have raised that as a procedural violation.and it turns out that the amendment did even provide an accurate statement of the services that was offered.district witnesses later testified that the district intended to offer minutes of tvi services per week.
the district judge purported to understand the difficult position that plaintiffs were in due to this sequence of events but still found that there was no indication in the record that plaintiffs ever sought during the administrative hearing to amend the issues to be addressed to include the district failure to provide with adequate tvi services.but we generally treat issues as if they were raised in the complaint if they are tried by consent.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that an issue tried by the parties express or implied consent must be treated in all respects as if raised in the pleadings.fed.civ.b see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.while we have previously recognized this practice in idea cases,it often been applied in a variety of other agency adjudications before the irs,lysek,cir,the department of labor,pierce county ex rel.dep t of labor,cir,and the patent and trademark office,us pto stip.we see no reason idea cases should be treated differently.
both sides presented extensive evidence regarding the district offer of tvi services.multiple witnesses testified as to the initial offer of minutes per month,the district purported secret amendment of minutes per week,and the district actual offer of minutes per week as presented at the hearing.the district presentation of evidence on this point vitiated any waiver on part.accordingly,we hold that plaintiffs claim that the district committed a procedural violation of the idea by failing to adequately document its offer of tvi services is waived 
the iep is a formal,written offer that creates a clear record that will do much to eliminate troublesome factual disputes about when placements were offered,what placements were offered,and what additional education assistance was offered to supplement a placement,if any.union sch,at.the iep must specify the anticipated frequency,location,and duration of education services.d a i vii.such a formal,specific offer from a school district will greatly assist parents in present ing complaints with respect to any matter relating to the educational placement of the child.union sch,at quoting b e.
the district judge agreed with the alj finding that the september,amendment merely corrected an unintentional error in the august,iep.we fail to see how this can be so.an iep is a contract.it is signed by the child parents and the school representatives,and thus embodies a binding commitment.it also provides notice to both parties as to what services will be provided to the student during the period covered by the iep.the school district is not entitled to make unilateral changes to an iep document any more than may any other party to a contract.if the district discovered that the iep did not reflect its understanding of the parties agreement,it was required to notify and seek her consent for any amendment.see d d,f discussing amendments to the iep.absent such consent,the district was bound by the iep as written unless it sought to the iep process and proposed a different iep.
because the district did neither of these things,the iep actually in force at the time of the hearing was that signed by the parties,not that presented by the district as the amended iep.allowing the district to change the iep unilaterally undermines its function of giving notice of the services the school district has agreed to provide and measuring the student progress toward the goals outlined in the iep.moreover,any such unilateral amendment is a per se procedural violation of the idea because it vitiates the parents right to participate at every step of the iep drafting process 
finally,we must express our disapproval of the district conduct with respect to this issue.the district discovered what it believed was a mistake in the iep just a week after it was signed,yet failed to bring this problem to attention until weeks later,on the first day of the due process hearing.even then,its lawyers did identify the purported amendment but rather buried it in a document production,leaving it to plaintiffs counsel to stumble upon it.had the district raised the issue immediately upon discovering the suspected error,it entirely possible that would have found the amount of tvi services to be satisfactory.plaintiffs might have avoided hiring a lawyer and taking the case to a due process hearing saving attorneys fees on both sides and perhaps disruption to education.we find no justification in the record for the district failure to be forthright on this point and the district has offered none in its brief or when questioned about it at oral argument 
because the district denied an opportunity to participate in the iep drafting process by unilaterally revising the iep,and because the iep as initially drafted did provide with an accurate offer of the tvi services provided to,the district committed two procedural violations of the idea.union sch,at.the district court nevertheless found that was denied a fape,reasoning that a procedural violation denies a child a fape when the violation seriously infringe s the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formation process.emphasis in original internal quotation and citation omitted.but,as explained above,was denied an opportunity to participate in the iep drafting process.moreover,in enacting the idea,congress was as concerned with parental participation in the enforcement of the iep as it was in its formation.see rowley,at discussing congress intent to giv e parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process emphasis added.under the idea,parental participation does end when the parent signs the iep.parents must be able to use the iep to monitor and enforce the services that their child is to receive.when a parent is unaware of the services offered to the student and,therefore,ca monitor how these services are provided a fape has been denied,whether or not the parent had ample opportunity to participate in the formulation of the iep.
whether,and to what extent,was prejudiced by these procedural improprieties is a more difficult question.assuming that was receiving minutes of tvi services per week,as the district apparently intended to offer,may not have suffered any substantive harm.nevertheless suffered procedural harm by not being apprised of the actual status of the services being provided,causing her to incur legal fees in attempting to protect that right.because any tvi services provided beyond what was specified in the written iep would have been gratuitous,could not be sure that the district would continue to provide them.with only minutes per month about an hour a week specified in the iep,the district was entitled to cut back these services to that level.was amply justified in seeking the aid of counsel to clarify the amount of services provided.incurring unnecessary legal fees is,of course,a form of prejudice that denies a student and his parents an educational benefit.see parents on behalf of student julian charter,oah,at,order denying motion to dismiss.the fact that the district could have avoided the harm by promptly notifying that it was agreeing to provide far more services than specified in the iep only makes matters worse.
failure to identify the at devices provided 
when a student requires a particular device or service california requires that the iep include a statement to that effect.cal.educ.code b,c.iep initially indicated that did require at devices or services.the district conceded that this was erroneous and issued an amendment that changed the checkbox for at devices from no to yes.but neither the iep nor the amendment specified the devices that required.
the district judge recognized that the language of section requires the district to identify the particular types of at devices and services to be provided to but the judge found that this procedural violation did seriously infringe opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process.as we made clear,however,parents must be able to participate in both the formulation and enforcement of the iep.see supra at.even if was able to participate in the iep formulation,the district failure to identify the at devices that required rendered the iep useless as a blueprint for enforcement.
the district judge noted that the iep team discussed at least some of the at services and equipment to be provided to at the iep meeting.but a discussion does not amount to an offer.could force the district to provide only those services and devices listed in the iep,not those discussed at the iep meeting but left out of the iep document.see union sch,at requiring a formal,written offer.indeed,items discussed at the iep meeting but not included in the iep document could be deemed to have been omitted on purpose.
nor was this a case where everyone involved in the individualized education team including the student parents knew of the amounts of services that were offered,at.testified at the due process hearing that she did know which at devices were offered to tvi services provider testified that received a laptop,a book port,software developed for the visually impaired,a screen reading program,a talking calculator and an solo.but was only aware that received a laptop,braille machine,braille calendar and a book port.also testified that the laptop did have the software that needed,but she did know which software was missing.because the iep did specify which at devices were being offered,had no way of confirming whet
