opinion of the court 
this case involves school redistricting in lower merion,pennsylvania and allegations that the implemented redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause.here,the lower merion school district the district used pristine,goals as the focal points of its redistricting plan,plan.the district goals included that 
the enrollment of the two high schools and two middle schools will be equalized 
elementary students will be assigned so that the schools are at or under the school capacity 
the plan may not increase the number of buses required 
the class of will have the choice to either follow the redistricting plan or stay at the high school of their previous year referred to as grandfathering and 
redistricting decisions will be based upon current and expected future needs and not based on past practices.
the district court concluded that the district assignment plan employing these goals required strict scrutiny because race was a factor in the formation of the plan,but concluded that the plan is constitutional because it does not use race impermissibly.upon review,we disagree with the district court determination that strict scrutiny is the appropriate level of review,but we affirm the conclusion that the district school assignment plan is consonant with the constitution.
the supreme court and this court have yet to set forth any standard requiring the application of strict scrutiny when decisionmakers have discussed race,but the school assignment plan neither classifies on the basis of race nor has a discriminatory purpose.we hold that the plan here passes constitutional muster because it does not select students based on racial classifications,it does not use race to assign benefits or burdens in the school assignment process,it does not apply the plan in a discriminatory manner,and it does not have a racially discriminatory purpose.strict scrutiny does not apply.the appropriate test to determine the constitutionality of the district school assignment plan is rational basis.in our view,the district has met the rational basis test with its redistricting plan plan.we shall affirm the district court order.
background 
the district operates six elementary schools belmont hills,cynwyd,gladwyne,merion,penn valley,and penn wynne two middle schools bala cynwyd and welsh valley and two high schools harriton and lower merion high school lmhs.the high schools are both ranked as being among the best in the state,if not the nation.app.at.nine elected school directors board members comprise the lower merion board of school directors board,which has the authority to assign lower merion students to schools within the district the district administration includes the district superintendent and several cabinet members 
in,the district began a capital improvement program to modernize each district school.in may,a member community advisory committee cac of school officials and community members investigated a plan to modernize the two high schools.at the time,approximately students attended lmhs and students attended harriton.the cac considered four proposals creating a separate school for grade nine only and another school for grades ten through twelve building one new high school that all high school students would attend building two new high schools to replace harriton and lmhs with the same student populations as harriton and lmhs and building two new high schools with students enrolled at each school.
the cac rejected the first three proposals due to academic and logistical shortcomings.the cac voted in favor of the fourth proposal building two high schools with equal student enrollment because students would benefit from a stronger sense of community,better interactions,and better educational outcomes.the cac also determined that this option would give students at both high schools the most equitable access to programs and facilities while securing the best use of both school sites.this option would also alleviate traffic and parking problems near lmhs.
the board accepted the cac recommendation to equalize the student populations at the two high schools and chose to keep the schools at their existing locations because the district did not have other possible sites.equalizing student enrollment between the two schools would require redistricting because,under the prior plan,lmhs had more students than harriton.harriton,which is located farther from the center of the student population than lmhs,has always had a substantially lower enrollment than lmhs despite harriton magnet programs aimed at attracting more students.
students doe through students are african american students who live in an area referred to as south ardmore or the affected area,which is within the district.ardmore,which is comprised of north ardmore and south ardmore,is a neighborhood in lower merion.six of the parents doe testified that they and their children live within a mile of lmhs and the district director of transportation,michael andre,testified that at least three students doe live within a mile of lmhs.of the neighborhoods in the district,the affected area and north ardmore have the highest concentration of african american families 
decades before this litigation,the district assigned students who lived in north ardmore and the affected area to an elementary school in ardmore.after that elementary school was torn down,the district assigned students in north ardmore and the affected area to five of the district other elementary schools and the district provided bus service to those schools.in the,the district reassigned students of north ardmore and the affected area north ardmore students attended penn wynne elementary school and bala cynwyd middle school affected area students attended penn valley elementary school and welsh valley middle school.during that time,students in both north ardmore and the affected area could choose to attend either harriton high school or lmhs.
prior to the adoption of plan,the plan at issue here,students assigned to belmont hills,gladwyne,and penn valley elementary schools would attend welsh valley middle school and then would attend harriton for high school,with the exception that students who lived in the narberth borough area,haverford,and the affected area were assigned to lmhs.students assigned to cynwyd,merion,and penn wynne elementary schools would attend bala cynwyd middle school and,then,were assigned to lmhs for high school.all students assigned to lmhs could,instead,choose to attend harriton.prior to redistricting,african american students attended harriton percent of harriton total student population and ten percent of the district high school students were african american.app.at.
the district has always provided bus service to students except those students who live in the walk zones of the school that they attend.walk zones are the areas within a mile of district schools students who live within a walk zone for their assigned school walk to school instead of receiving bus service.the boundaries of the lmhs walk zone were selected in the late.because the pennsylvania department of transportation declared that the street on which harriton is located is hazardous for student walking,harriton is the only school without a walk zone.
redistricting 
the redistricting process began in the summer of and ended on january,when the board adopted proposed plan.initially,the board authorized the administration to develop proposed redistricting plans and to choose plans for the board consideration.the board also developed a list of non negotiables to guide the redistricting process on april,the board adopted the following non negotiables 
the enrollment of the two high schools and two middle schools will be equalized 
elementary students will be assigned so that the schools are at or under the school capacity 
the plan may not increase the number of buses required 
the class of will have the choice to either follow the redistricting plan or stay at the high school of their previous year referred to as grandfathering and 
redistricting decisions will be based upon current and expected future needs and not based on past practices.
in may,the district hired two outside consultants,harris sokolov and ellen petersen,to compile a list of lower merion residents values for the purpose of informing the redistricting process.as a result of a series of public forums and a collection of online surveys from lower merion residents,information was gathered and all had an opportunity to participate.
the consultants issued a report identifying the following community values 
social networks are at the heart of where people live,and those networks expand as people grow older 
lower merion public schools are known for their excellence academic as well as extracurricular 
those who walk should continue to walk while the travel time for should be minimized 
children learn best in environments when they are comfortable socially as well as physically and 
e xplore and cultivate whatever diversity ethnic,social,economic,religious and racial there is in lower merion.
in june,the board hired ross haber to review and analyze district enrollment data and to create redisricting plans called scenarios.
haber prepared eight sets of that were considered by the administration,in the first instance.under the scenarios,the projected enrollment for harriton ranged from to and the projected enrollment for lmhs ranged from to.both the affected area and north ardmore would be redistricted to harriton in scenarios,and the affected area,but not north ardmore,would be redistricted to harriton in scenario north ardmore,but not the affected area,would be redistricted to harriton in scenarios,and and neither the affected area nor north ardmore would be redistricted to harriton in scenario.no scenario redistricted only the affected area to harriton.the percentage of students at each high school that would be african american ranged from percent to percent under the scenarios.most scenarios would yield a percentage of african american students between and percent 
haber prepared informational handouts of the scenarios for the administration.the handouts regarding scenarios,and included the number of african american students,but did not include any other data or any data regarding socioeconomic status or disability haber reported data on race,ethnicity,and socioeconomic disability for scenarios,and.the summaries of the scenarios on the district website did not include the statements regarding the numbers for each scenario.haber that this information was probably reported because the administration expressed concerns regarding african american students and that he was never directed to create or change a scenario based on diversity outcomes a chart dated august,lists the african american and socioeconomically disadvantaged population estimates for the scenarios the following day,the chart was updated to include additional,general diversity data.
the administration considered scenarios,and before eliminating scenarios and.mcginley and haber testified that scenario was eliminated due to inequitable racial balancing this scenario redistricted both the affected area and north ardmore to harriton.id.at.additionally,scenario was eliminated because it violated the non negotiable to equalize the high school population and it would result in longer travel times.scenario was eliminated because it d oes not support the community value of diversity as does other scenarios.id.scenario is the only considered scenario that redistricted neither north ardmore nor the affected area to harriton.mcginley crossed out his copy of the slide presenting diversity data under scenario and wrote,do present.id.at.he also wrote,say do post,next to the slide listing reasons for not selecting scenario.id.
proposed plans 
proposed plan 
after considering scenarios,and,the administration presented proposed plan,which was based on the scenario series,to the board at a public meeting on september.under proposed plan,there was no redistricting at the elementary school level and high school districting was determined by where the student lived.under this plan,students remained with the same group of students from kindergarten through grade eight.the projected student enrollment of harriton was and that of lmhs was.under proposed plan,north ardmore,along with all of penn wynne elementary school and some areas of penn valley elementary school,would be redistricted for harriton while the affected area would be districted for lmhs.proposed plan was projected to result in african american students accounting for percent of harriton student population.any high school student could still choose to attend harriton to enroll in the school international baccalaureate program under the plan grandfathering provision,all current high school students could choose to remain at the high school they attended when the plan went into effect.
the slide show presentation for proposed plan included a slide with student population information on,socioeconomic status,and disability.a press release regarding this plan initially included a sentence stating that enrollments would reflect balance with regard to students of various ethnic,and special needs backgrounds,but that sentence was removed prior to publication.id.at.after proposed plan was presented at the public meeting,the district did not include the number of african american students that would attend each high school when it posted haber summaries of the scenarios on the district website.mcginley had asked doug young,the director of public relations,not to post that information.
on september,board member diane dibonaventuro sent an email to mcginley explaining that people might have the perception that harriton is completely homogenous,attended by filthy rich spoiled white kids.id.at.she also stated that the board should emphasize that it is not merely trying to increase harriton racial diversity and the board should be selling both our schools to the community.id.
board member david ebby responded to an email from a concerned citizen by saying that diversity is looked at in total,and that mcginley is not trying to use the diversity of the penn wynne elementary attendance area to benefit a homogenous group in the western end of the township by making their school more diverse.id.
after receiving comments regarding the plan,the board rejected proposed plan because it resulted in excessive travel times for students.
ii.proposed plan 
after the board rejected proposed plan,the administration considered the scenario series.scenario,which mcginley stated was more consistent with the and the community values,was modified to become proposed plan.id.at.under the plan,the projected student enrollment of harriton was and that of lmhs was.proposed plan determined high school districting based on where the student lived.the only students who could choose which high school to attend were those districted for lmhs but who chose to attend harriton to enroll in the school ib program.under this plan,students remained with the same group of students from kindergarten through grade eight,then they were separated for high school.under proposed plan,north ardmore,along with all of penn wynne elementary school,some areas of penn valley elementary school,narberth borough of belmont hills,and some areas of merion,would be redistricted for harriton while the affected area would be districted for lmhs.proposed plan was projected to result in african american students accounting for percent of harriton student population.
on october,proposed plan was presented at a board meeting open to the public.instead of adopting proposed plan,the board asked petersen and sokolov,who had compiled a report of the community values in may,to reassess the factors that were important to the community in a redistricting plan.during this period of time,the board thought that the community primary concern was educational continuity in terms of keeping students who attended the same kindergarten together at the same elementary,middle,and high schools through grade twelve.the board also identified additional goals of distance,access,and walkability.
iii.proposed plan 
next,the administration developed scenario,which would later become proposed plan before proposed plan was selected and presented publicly,all of the board members saw scenario and some individual board members discussed race when speaking to others about potential proposals 
on november,proposed plan was presented at a public board meeting.under the plan,the projected student enrollment of harriton was and that of lmhs was.proposed plan determined high school districting based on where the student lived.the affected area,along with narberth borough of belmont hills and all areas of penn valley elementary school except an abbreviated lmhs walk zone,would be redistricted for harriton while north ardmore would be districted for lmhs.the students who lived in the abbreviated lmhs walk zone could choose to attend either high school.the only other students who could choose their high school were those who were districted for lmhs,but who chose to attend harriton to enroll in the school ib program.proposed plan was projected to result in african american students accounting for percent of harriton student population.
proposed plan was a feeder pattern,which sends the students districted for three elementary schools to attend a single middle school and a single high school.under proposed plan,students districted for cynwyd,merion,and penn wynne elementary schools were districted to bala cynwyd middle school and lower merion high school.students districted for belmont hills,gladwyne,and penn valley elementary schools were districted to welsh valley middle school and harriton high school.under this plan,students remained with the same group of students from kindergarten through grade twelve.
students in the affected area would travel eighteen to nineteen minutes by bus to attend harriton.that ride is half the distance and half the time of the longest bus ride in the district.the slideshow for the presentation of plan included diversity data.
the board understanding of community members concerns regarding proposed plan was that there was a walkability issue due to the abbreviated lmhs walk zone.in response,the board decided to revise the proposal to become proposed plan,which restored the lmhs walk zone to the lmhs walk zone area.
iv.proposed plan 
the main difference between proposed plan and proposed plan is that plan expanded plan abbreviated lmhs walk zone to the lmhs walk zone historical boundaries.the historic lmhs walk zone did not include the affected area and it did not have a high concentration of african american students.under proposed plan,all students assigned to lmhs and all students in the historic walk zone can choose to attend either high school.students assigned to harriton who do not live within the lmhs walk zone do not have the option of attending lmhs.plan still followed the feeder pattern with students in the affected area,along with narberth borough of belmont hills and all areas of penn valley elementary school except the historic lmhs walk zone,redistricted for harriton and north ardmore districted for lmhs plan also included a grandfathering provision that allowed students who had already begun attending high school to choose to stay at that high school,even if they were assigned to the other high school under plan.
on december,proposed plan was presented at a public board meeting.mcginley testified that it was impossible to know the diversity data for plan because the grandfathering provision allowed so many students to choose to attend either high school mcginley and haber exchanged emails regarding how to discuss the role of race in the redistricting process the presentation for plan did not include any diversity data.hours before the board vote on plan,mcginley emailed to the board projected plan enrollment data for race and ethnicity,socioeconomic status,and disability.mcginley testified that he sent these projections in response to a flyer that alleged the plan was artificially designed to create token diversity at harriton.id.at.mcginley explained in the email that he did not agree with the flyer and stated that t he community value of diversity is what caused us to look at this issue in the process.this was clearly misinterpreted in the public and the press.id.at.mcginley continued that,of the students who would be redistricted to harriton,the african american students made up percent of those students who would be redistricted under plan id.
on january,the board voted to adopt plan.six board members voted in favor of the plan,david ebby and diane dibonaventuro voted against the plan,and president lisa pliskin indicated that she supported the plan,but could not vote because she was hospitalized.all of the board members testified that they did not cast their vote or give their support based on race.four of the board members who supported the plan stated they did so primarily because they believed that the educational continuity of the feeder pattern provided substantial benefits.six of the board members who supported the plan indicated they did so due to the plan educational benefits and the administration support for the plan 
diane dibonaventuro,who voted against plan,sent mcginley an email stating that proposed plan created an additional stressor for african american students by asking ardmore kids to take one for the team,when there just are a lot of a frican a merican families.id.at.dibonaventuro stated that she did not think it was worth it to redistrict ardmore in order to marginally increase diversity.id.she testified that she wanted students in the affected area to be able to choose which high school to attend because they live within walking distance from lmhs.
david ebby,who voted against plan,testified that he did so because he considered the affected area and north ardmore to be one community and he believed that the feeder pattern and educational continuity allows stagnation by not mixing students from different areas in the district.id.at.ebby testified that he did not believe race was at all relevant in the redistricting process.id.
developments after redistricting 
plan was implemented beginning with the school year.during that year,the impact of redistricting was unclear because grandfathering was allowed.for,harriton had a student enrollment of students according to the district records,are white,are african american,are asian american,are hispanic american,are american indian,and are more than one race.students from the affected area were redistricted to harriton,fourteen of whom were african american.students from areas districted for penn valley elementary school were also redistricted to harriton,none of whom were african american.less than of the students redistricted were african americans from the affected area.
students doe bring lawsuit 
on may,students doe through,by and through their doe through,filed a complaint alleging that the district discriminated against them based on their race by adopting plan,which assigned students doe to harriton.for the academic year,student doe chose to attend harriton and all other students doe attended penn valley elementary school or welsh valley middle school.
appellants allege that the district violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,and title vi of the civil rights act,all pursuant to,by discriminating against the students doe based on their race.
the district court denied the district motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for a more definite statement.appellants moved for preliminary injunctive relief,seeking to restore their ability to choose to attend either high school,but they subsequently withdrew the request.after oral argument,on february,the district court denied the district motion for summary judgment.
appellants and the district filed numerous motions in limine,including the appellants motion in limine to preclude the trial testimony of claudia lyles and robert lee jarvis because the district had not identified these witnesses during the course of discovery the district court granted the appellants motion to proceed pseudonymously but denied the motions in limine without prejudice.during trial,the district court denied the renewed motion to preclude testimony of claudia lyles and robert lee.the district court held a bench trial.
district court findings of fact and conclusions of law 
district court findings of fact 
after the close of testimony on may,the district court held oral argument on the parties proposed findings of fact and,on may,the district court issued a memorandum on factual findings.in addition to the findings of fact indicated above,the district court found that the district had a goal of equalizing the student enrollment at the two high schools and that legitimate motivated the administration action.the district court noted that racial considerations were one of several motivating factors that resulted in the administration development of various plans,including the recommendation to adopt plan id.at.this consideration of race went above and beyond collecting or reporting general diversity data and the evidence reflected a specific concern about the african american student population throughout the redistricting process.id.the district court found that the administration plainly allowed racial consideration to influence what neighborhoods would be assigned to attend harriton high school,without the choice to attend lower merion high school.id.at.the district court continued,opining that the affected area was targeted for redistricting to harriton,in part,because it has a high concentration of african american students.according to the district court,the administration intent was to achieve not only overall numeric equality,but also racial parity,between the two schools.id.at.
the district court rejected any allegation of invidious discrimination toward african american students by the administration or the board.moreover,the district court noted that there were valid educational reasons for recommending and adopting plan,but that there was also a desire for racial diversity in both high schools.the district court found that providing information at the public board meetings for the proposed plans regarding,socioeconomic status,and disability was not objectionable.the district court found that some of the board members considered diversity among other factors when considering proposed plans,but the court also found credible the board members testimony that race was not the basis of their votes on plan 
ii.district court conclusions of law 
on june,the district court issued a memorandum on conclusions of law.the court stated that the central issue in this case is whether the district targeting of the affected area for redistricting to harriton,in part because that community has one of the highest concentrations of african american students in the district,violates the equal protection clause or title vi of the civil rights act.app.at.
in determining the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to this equal protection challenge,the district court concluded that parents involved in community schools seattle school district,d seattle grutter bollinger,d gratz bollinger,d adarand constructors pena,d city of richmond croson,d croson and johnson california,d are not controlling here.the district court held that the level of scrutiny applied in seattle,grutter,gratz,adarand,croson,and johnson is inapposite here.specifically,strict scrutiny as applied in seattle,grutter,gratz,adarand,croson,and johnson is not required here because each of those cases involves a policy that employs express,individual racial classifications,whereas plan does not.plan assigns students based on the neighborhood in which they reside without using individual racial classifications.the district court noted that plan is a facially neutral redisricting plan with facially neutral guidelines,so,unlike the cases above,the action brought by appellants does not involve the additional difficulties posed by policies that,although facially race neutral,may result in racially disproportionate impact and may be motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.app.at quoting adarand,at.
the district court found,however,that the reasoning of village of arlington heights metropolitan housing development corporation,d,and pryor national collegiate athletic association,cir,nonetheless require plan to be reviewed under strict scrutiny.the district court interpreted the pryor holding that,a discriminatory purpose based on race requires strict scrutiny analysis,pryor,at emphasis added,to mean that,once race has been shown to be a motivating factor in decisionmaking,all racial classifications must survive strict scrutiny.app.at emphasis added.the district court noted that it is unclear whether pryor requires the application of strict scrutiny to student assignment plans that do not involve individual racial classifications.
in its analysis of arlington heights,the district court interpreted the supreme court holding that,w hen there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision,judicial deference is no longer justified,arlington heights,at emphasis added,to mean that such deference is no longer justified when race was a motivating factor.app.at emphasis added.the district court noted that,under arlington heights,a court must conduct a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available to determine whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor.app.at quoting arlington heights,at emphasis added.
the district court referenced its own rejection of any allegation of invidious discrimination by the administration or the board.app.at quoting doe ii,wl,at.however,the district court held that the affected area high concentration of african american students factored into the district adoption of plan and,thus,racial demographics factored into the district recommendation that the board adopt the plan.app.at.the district court held that,because race was a motivating factor during redistricting,it must determine whether plan would have been adopted regardless of the racial composition of the affected area.id.at.the district court also noted that no congressional statute or supreme court precedent expressly provides that mere consideration of a neighborhood racial demographics in assigning students to schools constitutes decisionmaking in which race has been a motivating factor.id.at.
before embarking on a strict scrutiny review of plan,the district court noted that,if the plan survived strict scrutiny,it would necessarily survive intermediate scrutiny or rational basis review.because plan is the only plan that meets the district compelling educational interests of a equalizing the populations at the two high schools,b minimizing travel time and transportation costs,c fostering educational continuity,and d fostering walkability,the district court held that plan is narrowly tailored and survives strict scrutiny.id.at.the district court held that the mere fact that the district considered racial demographics does not render the district adoption of plan unconstitutional plan would still have been adopted even had racial demographics not been considered.id.at.the district court held that the adoption of plan comports with the equal protection clause.because the prohibitions of title vi and against discrimination are coextensive with the equal protection clause,the district court held that the appellants remaining claims must also fail.on june,the district court entered judgment in favor of the district.
students doe filed a timely motion for a new trial,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,but the district court ruled against the motion on august.

iii.analysis 
article iii of the constitution restricts the judicial power of the united states to the resolution of cases and controversies.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.to satisfy the article iii case or controversy requirement,a plaintiff must establish that he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.in the equal protection context,an injury resulting from governmental racial discrimination accords a basis for standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct.united states hays,d quoting allen wright,d internal quotation marks omitted 
o ne form of injury under the equal protection clause is being forced to compete in a system that may prejudice the plaintiff.seattle,at.appellants have asserted an injury by alleging that plan is such a system.see app.at appellants allege in their complaint that plan discriminates against students doe on the basis of race by mandating that said students attend harriton high school because they are minorities and it imposes an undue burden on minority students.that students doe have not alleged that,when they attend high school,they will want to attend lmhs instead of harriton is irrelevant for purposes of standing.in seattle,the supreme court held that the possibility of a child being assigned to that child preferred school under the plan at issue did not eliminate the injury claimed.seattle,at.because the children in seattle lived in the district and attended elementary,middle,and high schools in the district,they asserted an imminent injury that was not speculative by claiming that they were being forced to compete in a system that may prejudice them.id.similar to the children in seattle,students doe live within the district,attend district schools,and assert that the district is discriminating against them by assigning them to a school on the basis of race.students doe have asserted an injury that is not conjectural or hypothetical 
equal protection clause 
level of scrutiny 
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment provides that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.the central purpose of the clause is to prevent the states from purposely discriminating between individuals on the basis of race.shaw reno,d citing washington davis,d.a government action does not necessarily purposely discriminate merely because it is.crawford bd.of,d a distinction may exist between state action that discriminates on the basis of race and state action that addresses,in neutral fashion,matters the equal protection clause is not violated by the mere repeal of legislation or policies that were not required by the federal constitution.thus,p roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the equal protection clause.antonelli new jersey,cir quoting city of cuyahoga falls buckeye cmty.hope,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted in antonelli.
precedent in this court and the supreme court has established that 
intentional discrimination can be shown when a law or policy explicitly classifies citizens on the basis of race,see hunt cromartie,d a facially neutral law or policy is applied differently on the basis of race,see yick wo hopkins.or a facially neutral law or policy that is applied evenhandedly is motivated by discriminatory intent and has a racially discriminatory impact,see vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.
antonelli,at.similarly,in equal protection clause cases,we apply strict scrutiny to actions with racially discriminatory purpose all racial classifications imposed by government,grutter,at policies or laws that are applied differently on the basis of race,see yick wo.or policies or laws for which a plaintiff establishes a discriminatory purpose based on race,pryor,at however,absent a racially discriminatory purpose,explicit or inferable,on the part of the decisionmaker,the statutory distinction is subject only to rational basis review.united states frazier,cir citing feeney,d davis,d 
scrutiny inquiry 
intentional discrimination shown by racial classification 
the first alternative,a classification based explicitly on race,is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.crawford,at citing pers.adm r of feeney,d see also adarand,at.thus,when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny.seattle,at citing johnson california,d grutter,at adarand,at.the term racial classification normally refers to a governmental standard,preferentially favorable to one race or another,for the distribution of benefits.anderson ex rel.dowd city of boston,cir quoting raso lago,cir,cert.denied,d.a statute or policy utilizes a racial classification when,on its face,it explicitly distinguishes between people on the basis of some protected category.hayden cnty.of nassau,cir.
plan is facially race neutral,assigning students to schools based only on the geographical areas in which they live.the plan,on its face,neither uses racial classification as a factor in student assignment nor distributes any burdens or benefits on the basis of racial classification.the lack of racial classification in plan distinguishes plan from the policies in every supreme court equal protection education case upon which appellants rely in their in this manner,plan starkly differs from the policies at issue in seattle,gratz,grutter,bakke,brown,mclaurin oklahoma state regents,and sweatt painter.in each of those cases,the school district or university policy at issue used racial classifications as the sole factor,or as one factor among many,to make determinations regarding student school assignments or admission to a higher education institution.
in bakke,the court even noted that the policy involves a purposeful,acknowledged use of racial criteria.this is not a situation in which the classification on its face is racially neutral,but has a disproportionate racial impact.in that situation,plaintiff must establish an intent to discriminate.bakke,at citing arlington heights,d davis,d.
the facial neutrality of plan also distinguishes it from the policies in many of the supreme court equal protection cases upon which appellants rely in their brief adarand,croson,and plessy moreover,in adarand,the court emphasized that the case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race,and presents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that,although facially race neutral,result in racially disproportionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.at.
appellants repeatedly frame the central question in this case as whether race was a factor,or whether race was considered.appellant br.at.although appellants argue that,if race is a factor in a decision,we must apply strict scrutiny,counsel for appellants admitted at oral argument that being aware of or considering race when making some decisions can be proper within certain circumstances,including doing so to achieve a better racial composition within a school.in any event,these arguments are irrelevant to our inquiry.appellants and the district court conflate the consideration or awareness of race with racial classifications and racially discriminatory purpose.equal protection law does not make the same conflation.as a result,both the district court and appellants improvidently believed that the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply was strict scrutiny.
the district court conflated discriminatory purpose with the consideration or awareness of race and in doing so stated an incorrect standard for determining the appropriate level of scrutiny.the district court cited the pryor holding that an action adopted because of a discriminatory purpose based on race requires strict scrutiny analysis.pryor,at emphasis added.in restating that holding,however,the district court substituted race for discriminatory purpose,and incorrectly characterized pryor to hold that,once race has been shown to be a motivating factor in decisionmaking,all racial classifications must survive strict scrutiny.app.at emphasis added.
a racial classification occurs only when an action distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of race.seattle,at.in united states hays,d,the court noted that the record contained evidence tending to show that the legislature was aware of the racial composition of the districts in which the plaintiffs lived,but the court also noted that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws district lines.id.at emphases added quoting shaw reno,d shaw i internal quotation marks omitted.that sort of race consciousness does not lead inevitably to impermissible race discrimination and proof of that race consciousness in the redistricting process is inadequate to establish injury in fact.id.at.moreover,the court noted that the justices had never held that the racial composition of a particular voting district,without more,can violate the constitution.id.at.
similarly,the district court misstated the legal standard for determining the appropriate level of scrutiny as described in arlington heights because the district court conflated race as a factor with discriminatory purpose.in arlington heights,the supreme court noted that,w hen there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision,judicial deference is no longer justified.at emphasis added.the district court incorrectly stated that arlington heights held that such deference is no longer justified when race was a motivating factor.app.at emphasis added.neither pryor nor arlington heights stands for the proposition that strict scrutiny must be applied when race,but not a discriminatory purpose,was a motivating factor.
racially discriminatory purpose means that the decisionmaker adopted the challenged action at least partially because the action would benefit or burden an identifiable group.feeney,at discriminatory purpose implies that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,the action beneficial or adverse effects upon an identifiable group.thus,the mere awareness or consideration of race should not be mistaken for racially discriminatory intent or for proof of an equal protection violation.pryor,at a mere awareness of the consequences of an otherwise neutral policy will not suffice.citing feeney,at 
appellants also conflate a school assignment policy that explicitly classifies based on race with the consideration or awareness of neighborhood racial demographics during the development and selection of a policy.the former is a facially racial policy,such as the policies in seattle,gratz,grutter,bakke,brown,mclaurin,and sweatt.the consideration or awareness of race while developing or selecting a policy,however,is not in and of itself a racial classification.thus,a decisionmaker awareness or consideration of race is not racial classification.designing a policy with racial factors in mind does not constitute a racial classification if the policy is facially neutral and is administered in a fashion.hayden,at holding that designing a policy with a racially discriminatory purpose should not be construed as a facial classification when the policy does not explicitly,or in its application,distinguish between people on the basis of a protected category.
when the supreme court,in seattle,grutter,and bakke,has referenced applying strict scrutiny to a plan that uses race as one of many factors,it has meant just that strict scrutiny should be applied to a school admissions or student assignment policy or plan that uses race as a factor to determine whether a student is admitted or assigned to a school.grutter,at see also seattle,at bakke,at opinion of powell.the court has never held that strict scrutiny should be applied to a school plan in which race is not a factor merely because the decisionmakers were aware of or considered race when adopting the policy.when there is no racial classification in the plan,strict scrutiny is only applied if plaintiffs show discriminatory intent.
the first alternative by which intentional discrimination can be shown racial classification is inapposite to plan and the facts of this case.strict scrutiny analysis is not appropriate on this basis.
intentional discrimination shown by discriminatory application of a facially neutral policy 
the second alternative to show intentional discrimination that a facially neutral policy is applied differently on the basis of race is also inapplicable to plan.there is no record evidence that the district has applied plan in a discriminatory manner.the supreme court first established the standard for this method of proving an equal protection violation in yick wo.in that case,the city and county of san francisco denied every chinese laundry owner a permit to operate a laundry business,but denied permits for only one of approximately eighty laundry owners.with that example of discriminatory application of a law in mind,to demonstrate that plan is applied differently on a discriminatory basis,appellants would have needed to show below that the district enforces plan within some areas or regarding some students,on the basis of race,while not enforcing plan within other areas or regarding other students.appellants have not alleged that plan is enforced in a disproportionate manner.
intentional discrimination shown by discriminatory purpose for a facially neutral policy 
to establish government action within the third alternative,a plaintiff is required to prove that the actions of officials had a discriminatory effect and were motivated by a discriminatory purpose.bradley united states,cir citing arlington heights,u.at race discrimination davis,at race discrimination chavez.state police,cir race discrimination.
discriminatory impact 
although disproportionate impact,alone,is not dispositive,a plaintiff must show discriminatory impact in order to prove an equal protection violation under this third alternative.n o case in the supreme court has held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely because of the motivations of the men who voted for it.palmer thompson,d.in palmer,the supreme court noted that there is an element of futility in a judicial attempt to invalidate a law solely because of the bad motives of its supporters.if the law is struck down for this reason,rather than because of its facial content or effect,it would presumably be valid as soon as the legislature or relevant governing body repassed it for different reasons.id.at.moreover,discriminatory impact must be shown to establish an equal protection violation because plaintiffs must show that they have been injured as a result of the governmental action to ensure that courts can impose a meaningful remedy.garza county of los angeles,cir.
to establish discriminatory impact in a racial discrimination case,appellants must show that similarly situated individuals of a different race were treated differently.the appellants do not meet this burden.
despite appellants numerous references to the alleged consideration of race by board members and administrators during discussions of scenarios and proposed plans,appellants have not provided any evidence that plan treats similarly situated individuals of a different race in a different manner.along with students doe,all white students in the affected area are also assigned to attend harriton without the choice to attend lmhs unless they live within the lmhs walk zone.appellants have not provided any evidence that plan treats black individuals outside of the affected area in the same way in which it treats students doe or other black individuals who live in the affected area.north ardmore,like the affected area,has a high percentage of african american residents in comparison to other areas.however,all of the students in north ardmore,both black and white,are assigned to attend lmhs,not harriton,where students doe and affected area students are assigned.of the students redistricted to harriton were students who were not african americans and who lived in the affected area or other areas redistricted to harriton under plan plan does not treat black students in the affected area and north ardmore similarly,nor does it treat white students in either area similarly to other white students or differently from the black students in the same area no evidence has been provided indicating assignments based on racial classification here.
to show a discriminatory impact in the form of a stigma,appellants would still need to demonstrate that they are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct.allen,at quoting heckler mathews,internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,the court discussion of stigma has been in the context of racial classifications.see generally,johnson california,d a s we have recognized in the past,racial classifications threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group quoting shaw reno,at internal quotation marks omitted.because plan includes no racial classifications,arguments regarding stigma are of no avail.
appellants can also show discriminatory impact by demonstrating that there are racial classifications in the school assignment system.such classifications force students to compete in a system that may prejudice them.seattle,at internal quotation marks omitted.in such circumstances,the discriminatory impact is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier and in the context of a challenge to a program,the injury in fact is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process.gratz,at quoting ne.chapter,associated contractors of am.jacksonville,d.unlike the systems at issue in seattle,plan is not a system and,under plan,there is no possibility that any of the students doe will be denied a school assignment because of his or her race.appellants can not rely on seattle,grutter,gratz,or bakke to demonstrate discriminatory impact because plan imposes no racial barrier and assigns students on an equal basis geography.
ii.discriminatory purpose 
even if we were to conclude that appellants have shown discriminatory impact,the fourteenth amendment guarantees equal laws,not equal results.feeney,at.the supreme court held in washington davis,d,that p roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the equal protection clause.arlington heights,at.when there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision,judicial deference is no longer justified and courts should apply strict scrutiny id.at.however,absent a racially discriminatory purpose,explicit or inferable,on the part of the decisionmaker,the statutory distinction is subject only to rational basis review.frazier,at citing feeney,d davis,d.
the term discriminatory purpose implies that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,the action beneficial or adverse effects upon an identifiable group.feeney,at.racially discriminatory purpose means that the decisionmaker adopted the challenged action at least partially because the action would benefit or burden an identifiable group.even conscious awareness on the part of the decisionmaker that the policy will have a racially disparate impact does not invalidate an otherwise valid law,so long as that awareness played no causal role in the adoption of the policy.frazier,at citing feeney,at.
in arlington heights,the supreme court outlined how courts should determine whether a discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor.the determination requires a sensitive inquiry into the available circumstantial and direct evidence of intent,including whether the official action has a racially disproportionate impact the historical background of the decision and the legislative or administrative history of the decision.arlington heights,at.proof put forth to demonstrate discriminatory intent must necessarily usually rely on objective factors.feeney,at.
if discriminatory impact can not be plausibly explained on a neutral ground,impact itself would signal that the real classification made by the law was in fact not neutral.id.at.however,j ust as there are cases in which impact alone can unmask an invidious classification,there are others,in which notwithstanding impact the legitimate noninvidious purposes of a law can not be missed.id.as stated above,plan does not have a discriminatory impact.even if we were to find that plan has a discriminatory impact,the district has plausibly explained any such impact on a neutral ground.the board goals in redistricting included the non negotiables of equalizing the enrollments of harriton and lmhs and not increasing the number of buses required.the community values during redistricting included allowing students who walked to school to continue walking to school,minimizing for bused students,and to ensure that children were in comfortable learning environments.
in addition to these neutral bases for the selection of plan,the district court noted other explanations for the adoption of plan,including helping students attain educational excellence,developing a feeder pattern,and closing the achievement gap between students.moreover,there is no evidence establishing that the district court clearly erred when it found credible the board members testimony that race was not the basis of their votes for plan.
in feeney,the supreme court held that the neutral purposes of a statute,aimed to benefit veterans provide d the surest explanation for its impact benefitting more men than women.id.the court continued,stating that the law could not rationally be explained as a pretext for preferring men over women because significant numbers of those placed at a disadvantage by the law were men.comparably,plan redistricts to harriton a significant number of students who are not african american.even while grandfathering was still in effect,students were redistricted to harriton for the school year and thirty of those students,nearly,are not african american.
when inquiring into the historical background of the decision to redistrict and adopt plan,there is nothing that sparks suspicion of discriminatory intent and appellants have not alleged otherwise.the decision to redistrict was born of a capital improvement program intended to modernize every school in the district.under the plan in effect prior to plan,the enrollment of the district two high schools was very uneven lmhs had roughly twice the number of students that harriton had and the district was committed to equalizing the two high schools.the process to select a new student assignment plan was carried out over a number of months with the involvement of the public.
to ascertain whether there was discriminatory intent in the development and selection of plan,appellants and the district court appear focused on the administrative history,especially on statements made by board members and the information included in reports and presentations.appellants pay particular attention to when racial demographics only or racial demographics in addition to other socioeconomic demographics were or were not included in report estimates,slide presentations,personal notes,and on the district website.awareness of such data or omitting such data,however,does not constitute discriminatory intent.c onscious awareness of a racially disparate impact of a facially neutral policy is irrelevant to equal protection analysis.see frazier,at citing feeney,at.additionally,the mere awareness of data regarding racial demographics under various scenarios and proposed plans is not necessarily awareness of racially disparate impact.the racial data showed,under some scenarios and proposed plans,that there would not be a racially disparate impact.for a facially neutral policy,awareness of a racially discriminatory impact is only relevant if the policy is adopted at least in part because of a racially discriminatory impact.id.
while the statements upon which appellants rely may indicate awareness or consciousness of race,the statements do not constitute discriminatory intent,that plan was developed or selected because it would assign benefits or burdens on the basis of race.instead of being adopted for the purpose of discrimination,the statements indicate,if anything,that board members and administrators adopted plan in an attempt not to discriminate on the basis of race.testimony that scenario was eliminated due to inequitable racial balancing could indicate that the administration did not want to propose a plan that seemed to treat students differently on the basis of race,by having a disproportionate percentage of students of a certain race redistricted.app.at.notably,the administration decided not to formulate any proposed plans based on scenarios,or.scenarios and would redistrict both areas with higher african american populations,the affected area and north ardmore,to attend harriton and scenario would keep students in both of those areas assigned to lmhs.thus,the only scenarios selected to develop into proposed plans were those that did not treat the two areas with the highest african american populations in the same manner.because all of the scenarios assigned students geographically,no scenario or proposed plan treated similarly situated african american students differently from other students.moreover,the district eliminated the scenarios that arguably treated differently situated african american students similarly,by assigning both areas with higher african american populations to the same school.
given these circumstances,it is nearly inconceivable that the district intended to discriminate on the basis of race.dibonaventuro september email reaffirms the goals of the redistricting process.in her email,she stated that the board should emphasize that it is not trying to increase harriton diversity,but that it,instead,is trying to ensure numerically equal total student enrollments at both high schools.
board and administrator references to diversity do not imply a discriminatory purpose.on the contrary,references to diversity in the context of this facially neutral policy implied that decisionmakers did not want the selected plan to have a racially disproportionate impact.avoiding discriminatory impact seemed to be one of the district goals in developing and adopting a plan.because the african american students were more concentrated geographically,assigning students based on geography could easily lend itself to disproportionate impact unless the board members were aware of the demographics of the areas during the redistricting process.
in arlington heights and feeney,the supreme court found that,despite awareness of disparate impact on a group,there was no showing of discriminatory intent in the formulation or adoption of the actions at issue.the court in arlington heights held that a zoning decision that bore more heavily on racial minorities was nonetheless not adopted due to discriminatory intent because the majority of the statements by the decisionmakers focused on neutral factors and the zoning policy had been applied consistently.at.
similarly,plan has been applied consistently,regardless of race,and the majority of board members discussions regarding lower merion redistricting focused on neutral factors a equalizing the populations at the two high schools,b minimizing travel time and transportation costs,c fostering educational continuity,and d fostering walkability.additionally,plan did not bear more heavily on racial minorities 
in feeney,the court held that there was no discriminatory purpose in the adoption of a statute that benefited an overwhelmingly male class veterans because the benefit was consistently offered to any person who was a veteran,including women.similarly,plan consistently assigns students,including students who are not african american,based on the location of their residence.
in pryor,the court held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged discriminatory intent because the complaint and exhibits alleged that the ncaa stated that it adopted a policy because it believed the adoption of this policy would increase the graduation rates of black athletes relative to white athletes.at.the court noted that the complaint did not merely allege that the ncaa was aware of the likely racially disproportionate impact plaintiffs alleged that this discriminatory impact was the ncaa purpose,stated goal,and pretext for adopting the policy.id.at.in contrast,appellants have not demonstrated that the district formulated or adopted plan at least partially to benefit or burden african american students.
significantly,the district court found credible the board members testimony that race was not the basis of their votes for plan.we see no evidence of clear error in that finding.if race was not the basis of the board members votes for plan,it follows logically that they did not vote to adopt plan for racially discriminatory reasons.
thus,none of the three alternatives necessary to show intentional discrimination and to trigger strict scrutiny is applicable to plan.
racially discriminatory intent in electoral redistricting 
the district court held that strict scrutiny was appropriate because it opined that the affected area was targeted for redistricting to harriton,in part,because it has a high concentration of african american students.similarly,our colleague,in her concurrence,concludes that we are required to apply strict scrutiny because,as she notes,the racial composition of neighborhoods was considered in determining school assignments.the concurrence suggests a paradigm not present or contemplated in our law be aware of or talk about race and strict scrutiny is triggered.this theory is untenable.there is no precedent in this court or the supreme court holding that we apply strict scrutiny in equal protection challenges alleging racial discrimination in education admissions or assignments because decisionmakers were cognizant of the racial demographics of neighborhoods when they selected the assignment plan.
at oral argument,counsel for appellants compared plan to electoral redistricting,an area for which the supreme court has set out tests for determining whether strict scrutiny should be applied to redistricting that involves the consideration of racial demographics.it is not clear that the electoral redistricting precedent controls in the educational context,but,even if we were to apply that precedent to the facts in doe,we would still hold that plan was not developed or adopted for a discriminatory purpose and,thus,should not be subjected to strict scrutiny.
in equal protection challenges to electoral redistricting,the supreme court has held that strict scrutiny does not apply to facially race neutral legislation merely because a redistricting is performed with consciousness of race or b because there was an intentional creation of districts.bush vera,d.the court has held,instead,that,for strict scrutiny to apply to facially race neutral electoral redistricting legislation,the plaintiff must prove that the statutes,although race neutral,are,on their face,unexplainable on grounds other than race,shaw i,at quoting arlington,at or that legitimate districting principles were subordinated to race such that race must be the predominant factor motivating the legislature redistricting decision,vera,at,or the statute.
because plan is facially race neutral,consciousness of race,alone,will not require the application of strict scrutiny.vera,at noting that strict scrutiny does not apply merely because electoral redistricting is performed with consciousness of race.although the affected area has the highest concentration of african american students in lower merion,that fact does not require strict scrutiny.id.at noting that strict scrutiny does not apply to all cases of intentional creation of electoral districts.
for strict scrutiny to apply to plan,the plan would have to be unexplainable on grounds other than race or it must be shown that other legitimate redistricting principles were subordinated to race such that race was the predominant factor motivating the district redistricting decision.shaw i,at.appellants have not cast doubt o
