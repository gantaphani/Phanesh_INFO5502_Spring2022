article xiii b,section,of the california constitution provides whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service hereafter article xiii b,section.
plaintiff san diego unified school district district,like all other public school districts in the state,is,and was at the time relevant in this proceeding,governed by statutes that regulate the expulsion of students,et whenever an expulsion recommendation is made and before a student may be expelled,the district is required by education code section to afford the student a hearing with various procedural notice of the hearing and the right to representation by counsel,preparation of findings of fact,notices related to any expulsion and the right of appeal,and preparation of a hearing record.providing these procedural protections requires the district to expend funds,for which the district asserts a right to reimbursement from the state pursuant to article xiii b,section,and implementing legislation,government code section et.
we granted review to consider two questions are the hearing costs incurred as a result of the mandatory actions related to expulsions that are compelled by education code section fully are those hearing costs reimbursable only to the extent such costs are attributable to hearing procedures that exceed the procedures required by federal law are any hearing costs incurred in carrying out expulsions that are discretionary under education code section reimbursable after we granted review and filed our decision in department of finance commission on state mandates kern high school dist.cal th,d,kern high school dist,we added the following preliminary question to be addressed do the education code statutes cited above establish a new program or higher level of service under article xiii b,section finally,we also asked the parties to brief the effect of the decision in kern high school,supra,cal th,d,on the present case.
we conclude that education code section,insofar as it compels suspension and mandates a recommendation of expulsion for certain offenses,constitutes a higher level of service under article xiii b,section,and imposes a reimbursable state mandate for all resulting hearing those costs attributable to procedures required by federal law.in this respect,we shall affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
we also conclude that no hearing costs incurred in carrying out those expulsions that are discretionary under education code section costs related to hearing procedures claimed to exceed the requirements of federal reimbursable.as we shall explain,to the extent that statute makes expulsions discretionary,it does not reflect a new program or a higher level of service related to an existing program.moreover,even if the hearing procedures set forth in education code section constitute a new program or higher level of service,we conclude that this statute does not trigger any right to reimbursement,because the hearing provisions that assertedly exceed federal requirements are merely incidental to fundamental federal due process requirements and the added costs of such procedures are de minimis.for these reasons,we conclude such hearing provisions should be treated,for purposes of ruling upon a request for reimbursement,as part of the nonreimbursable underlying federal mandate and not as a state mandate.accordingly,we shall reverse the judgment of the court of appeal insofar as it compels reimbursement of any costs incurred pursuant to discretionary expulsions.
education code sections and 
we first describe the relevant provisions of two code sections and to the expulsion of students from public schools.
education code section specifies the right of a student to an expulsion hearing and sets forth procedures that a school district must follow when conducting such a hearing.stats,ch.
in identifying the right to a hearing,subdivision a of this statute declares that a student is entitled to an expulsion hearing within days after the school principal determines that the student has committed an act warranting expulsion in practical effect,this means that whenever a school principal makes such a determination and recommends to the school board that a student be expelled,an expulsion hearing is mandated 
in specifying the substantive and procedural requirements for such an expulsion hearing,education code section sets forth rules and procedures,some of which,the parties agree,codify requirements of federal due process and some of which may exceed those requirements these rules and procedures govern,among other things,notice of a hearing and the right to representation by counsel,preparation of findings of fact,notices related to the expulsion and the right of appeal,and preparation of a hearing record.see,subds.a through former subd.j currently subd.k.
the second statute at issue in this matter is education code section.discrete subdivisions of this statute address circumstances in which a principal must recommend to the school board that a student be expelled,and circumstances in which a principal may recommend that a student be expelled.
first,there is what the parties characterize as the mandatory expulsion provision,education code section,former subdivision b.as it read during the time relevant in this proceeding through,this subdivision compelled a school principal to immediately suspend any student found to be in possession of a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds,and mandated a recommendation to the school district governing board that the student be expelled.the provision further required the governing board,upon confirmation of the student knowing possession of a firearm,either to expel the student or refer him or her to an alternative education program housed at a separate school site compare this former provision with current,subds.c and d.
this provision,as it read at the time relevant here,did not mandate expulsion per se but it did require immediate suspension followed by a mandatory expulsion recommendation and it provided that a student found by the governing board to have possessed a firearm would be removed from the school site by limiting disposition to either expulsion or referral to an alternative school.moreover,as noted above,whenever expulsion is recommended a student has a right to an expulsion hearing.accordingly,it is appropriate to characterize the former provision as mandating immediate suspension,a recommendation of expulsion,and hence,an expulsion hearing.for convenience,we accept the parties description of this aspect of education code section as constituting a mandatory expulsion provision.
the second aspect of education code section relevant here consists of what we shall call the discretionary expulsion provision,former subd.c,subsequently subd.d,currently subd.e.during the period relevant in this proceeding as well as currently,this subdivision of education code section recognized that a principal possesses discretion to recommend that a student be expelled for specified conduct other than firearm possession conduct such as damaging or stealing school property or private property,using or selling illicit drugs,receiving stolen property,possessing tobacco or drug paraphernalia,or engaging in disruptive behavior.the former provision like the current provision further specified that the school district governing board may order a student expelled upon finding that the student,while at school or at a school activity off school grounds,engaged in such conduct 
proceedings under government code section et.
procedures governing the constitutional requirement of reimbursement under article xiii b,section,are set forth in government code section et.the commission on state mandates commission,is charged with the responsibility of hearing and deciding,subject to judicial review by an administrative writ of mandate,claims for reimbursement made by local governments or school districts.government code section,subdivision a,provides that the state shall reimburse each school district for all costs mandated by the state,as defined in section.government code section,in turn,defines costs mandated by the state to mean,in relevant part,any increased costs which a school district is required to incur as a result of any statute which mandates a new program or higher level of service of an existing program within the meaning of section of article xiii b of the california constitution.finally,government code section sets forth circumstances in which there shall be no reimbursement,including,under subdivision c,circumstances in which t he statute or executive order implemented a federal law or regulation and resulted in costs mandated by the federal government,unless the statute or executive order mandates costs which exceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation.
in march,the district filed a test claim with the commission,asserting entitlement to reimbursement for the costs of hearings provided with respect to both categories of cases described is,those hearings triggered by mandatory expulsion recommendations,and those hearings resulting from discretionary expulsion recommendations.see,kinlaw state of california cal d.the district sought reimbursement for costs incurred between july,and june,under statutes effective through the latter date.
in august,after holding hearings on the district claim as amended in april,to reflect legislation that became effective in,the commission issued a corrected statement of decision in which it determined that education code section requirement of suspension and a mandatory recommendation of expulsion for firearm possession constituted a new program or higher level of service,and found that because costs related to some of the resulting hearing provisions set forth in education code section primarily various notice,right of inspection,and recording provisions exceeded the requirements of federal due process,those additional hearing costs constituted reimbursable costs as to the vast majority of the remaining hearing procedures triggered by education code section requirement of suspension and a mandatory recommendation of expulsion for firearm example,procedures governing such matters as the hearing itself and the board decision a statement of facts and charges notice of the right to representation by counsel written findings recording of the hearing and the making of a record of the commission found that those procedures were enacted to comply with federal due process requirements,and hence fell within the exception set forth in government code section,subdivision c,and did not impose a reimbursable state mandate.the commission further found that with respect to education code section discretionary expulsions,there was no right to reimbursement for costs incurred in holding expulsion hearings,because such expulsions do not constitute a new program or higher level of service,and in any event such expulsions are not mandated by the state,but instead represent a choice by the principal and the school board.
in october,the district brought this proceeding for an administrative writ of mandate challenging the commission decision.the trial court issued a writ commanding the commission to render a new decision finding i all costs associated with hearings triggered by compulsory suspensions and mandatory expulsion recommendations are reimbursable,and ii hearing costs associated with discretionary expulsions are reimbursable to the limited extent that required hearing procedures exceed federal due process mandates.the commission defendant and the department of finance real party in interest,hereafter department appealed,and the court of appeal affirmed the judgment rendered by the trial court.
costs associated with hearings triggered by compulsory suspensions and mandatory expulsion.new program or higher level of service 
we address first the issue that we asked the parties to brief does education code section,former subdivision b current subds.c d,which mandated suspension and an expulsion recommendation for those students who possess a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds,and which also required a school board,if it found the charge proved,either to expel or to refer such a student to an alternative educational program housed at a separate school site,constitute a new program or higher level of service under article xiii b,section of the state constitution,and under government code section 
we addressed the meaning of the constitution phrase new program or higher level of service in county of los angeles state of california cal d,county of los angeles.that case concerned whether local governments are entitled to reimbursement for costs incurred in complying with legislation that required local agencies to provide the same increased level of workers compensation benefits for their employees as private individuals or organizations were required to provide for their employees.we stated 
looking at the language of article xiii b,section then,it seems clear that by itself the term higher level of service is meaningless.it must be read in conjunction with the predecessor phrase new program to give it meaning.thus read,it is apparent that the subvention requirement for increased or higher level of service is directed to state mandated increases in the services provided by local agencies in existing programs.but the term program itself is not defined in article xiii b.what programs then did the electorate have in mind when section was adopted we conclude that the drafters and the electorate had in mind the commonly understood meanings of the term programs that carry out the governmental function of providing services to the public,or laws which,to implement a state policy,impose unique requirements on local governments and do not apply generally to all residents and entities in the state.county of los angeles,supra,cal d.
we continued in county of los angeles the concern which prompted the inclusion of section in article xiii b was the perceived attempt by the state to enact legislation or adopt administrative orders creating programs to be administered by local agencies,thereby transferring to those agencies the fiscal responsibility for providing services which the state believed should be extended to the public.in their ballot arguments,the proponents of article xiii b explained section to the voters additionally,this measure will not allow the state government to force programs on local governments without the state paying for them.ballot,proposed amend.to cal.const.with arguments to voters,spec.statewide.italics added.in this context the phrase to force programs on local governments confirms that the intent underlying section was to require reimbursement to local agencies for the costs involved in carrying out functions peculiar to government,not for expenses incurred by local agencies as an incidental impact of laws that apply generally to all state residents and entities.county of los angeles,supra,cal d,italics added.
it was clear in county of los angeles,supra,cal d,that the law at issue did not meet the second test for a program or higher level of service it did not implement a state policy by imposing unique requirements upon local governments,but instead applied workers compensation contribution rules generally to all employers in the state.nor,we held,did the law requiring local agencies to shoulder a general increase in workers compensation benefits amount to a reimbursable program or higher level of service under the first test described above,at.the law increased the cost of employing public servants,but it did not in any tangible manner increase the level of service provided by those employees to the public.
we reaffirmed and applied the test set out in county of los angeles,supra,cal d,in lucia mar unified school district honig cal d,lucia mar.the state law at issue in lucia mar required local school districts to pay a portion of the cost of educating pupils in state schools for the severely that the state previously had paid in full.
we determined that the contributions called for under the law were used to fund a program within both definitions of that term set forth in county of los angeles.lucia mar,supra,cal d.we stated t he education of handicapped children is clearly a governmental function providing a service to the public,and the state law imposes requirements on school districts not imposed on all the states residents.nor can there be any doubt that although the schools for the handicapped have been operated by the state for many years,the program was new insofar as plaintiffs are concerned,since at the time the state law became effective they were not required to contribute to the education of students from their districts at such schools.to hold,under the circumstances of this case,that a shift in funding of an existing program from the state to a local entity is not a new program as to the local agency would,we think,violate the intent underlying section of article xiii b section was intended to preclude the state from shifting to local agencies the financial responsibility for providing public services in view of restrictions on the taxing and spending power of the local entities.lucia mar,supra,cal d,see also county of san diego state of california cal th,d,legislation excluding indigents from coverage transferred obligation for such costs from state to counties,and constituted a reimbursable new program or higher level of service.
we again applied the alternative tests set forth in county of los angeles,supra,cal d,in city of sacramento state of california cal d,city of sacramento.in that case we considered whether a state law implementing federal incentives that encouraged states to extend unemployment insurance coverage to all public employees constituted a program or higher level of service under article xiii b,section.we concluded that it did not because,as in county of los angeles,providing unemployment compensation protection to a city own employees was not a service to the public and the statute did not apply uniquely to local,the same requirements previously had been applied to most employers,and extension of the requirement by eliminating a prior exemption for local governments merely placed local government employers on the same footing as most private employers.city of sacramento,supra,cal d at.
subsequently,the court of appeal in city of richmond commission on state mandates th,d city of richmond,following county of los angeles,supra,cal d,and city of sacramento,supra,cal d,concluded that requiring local governments to provide death benefits to local safety officers,under both the public employees retirement system and the workers compensation system,did not constitute a higher level of service to the public.the court of appeal arrived at that determination even might also have been argued in county of los angeles and city of benefits may generate a higher quality of local safety officers and thereby,in a general and indirect sense,provide the public with a higher level of service by its employees.city of richmond,supra,th,d.
viewed together,these cases county of los angeles,supra,cal d,city of sacramento,supra,cal d,and city of richmond,supra,th,d illustrate the circumstance that simply because a state law or order may increase the costs borne by local government in providing services,this does not necessarily establish that the law or order constitutes an increased or higher level of the resulting service to the public under article xiii b,section,and government code section 
by contrast,courts of appeal have found a reimbursable higher level of service concerning an existing program when a state law or executive order mandates not merely some change that increases the cost of providing services,but an increase in the actual level or quality of governmental services provided.in carmel valley fire protection dist.state of california d.carmel valley,for example,an executive order required that county firefighters be provided with protective clothing and safety equipment.because this increased safety equipment apparently was designed to result in more effective fire protection,the mandate evidently was intended to produce a higher level of service to the public,thereby satisfying the first alternative test set out in county of los angeles,supra,cal d.similarly,in long beach unified school district state of california d.long beach,an executive order required school districts to take specific steps to measure and address racial segregation in local public schools.the appellate court held that this constituted a higher level of service to the extent the order requirements exceeded federal constitutional and case law requirements by mandating school districts to undertake defined remedial actions and measures that were merely advisory under prior governing law.
the district and the commission assert that the mandatory aspect of education code section,insofar as it compels suspension and mandates an expulsion recommendation for firearm possession and thereafter restricts the board options to expulsion or referral to an alternative school,carries out a governmental function of providing services to the public and hence constitutes an increased or higher level of service concerning an existing program under the first alternative test of county of los angeles,supra,cal d.they argue,in essence,that the present matter is more analogous to the latter cases carmel valley,supra,d,and long beach,supra,d.both of which involved measures designed to increase the level of governmental service provided to the to the former cases county of los angeles,supra,cal d,city of sacramento,supra,cal d,and city of richmond,supra,th,d in which the cost of employment was increased but the resulting governmental services themselves were not directly enhanced or increased.as we shall explain,we agree with the district and the commission.
the statutory requirements here at suspension and mandatory recommendation of expulsion for students who possess a firearm,and the limitation upon the ensuing options of the school board expulsion or referral reasonably are viewed as providing a higher level of service to the public under the commonly understood sense of that term i the requirements are new in comparison with the preexisting scheme in view of the circumstance that they did not exist prior to the enactment of statutes of,chapters assem.bill reg.sess.assembly bill and senate bill reg.sess.senate bill and ii the requirements were intended to provide an enhanced service to the schools for the vast majority of students that is,those who are not expelled or referred to other school sites.in other words,the legislation was premised upon the idea that by removing potentially violent students from the general school population,the safety of those students who remain thereby is increased.see,stats,ch,pp.in order to ensure public safety on school campuses it is necessary that this act take effect immediately com.on ed,analysis of assem.bill,noting legislative purpose to enhance public safety see also assem.com.on ed.july,analysis of bill,noting legislative purpose to remove those who possess firearms from the general school population by increasing the frequency of expulsion for such conduct.
in challenging this conclusion,the department relies upon county of los angeles department of industrial relations d.department of industrial relations.in that case,the state enacted enhanced statewide safety regulations that governed all public and private elevators,and thereafter the county of los angeles sought reimbursement for the costs of complying with the new regulations.the court of appeal found that the regulations constituted neither a new program nor a higher level of service concerning an existing program under either of the two alternative tests set out in county of los angeles,supra,cal d.the court concluded that the elevator regulations did not meet the first alternative test,because the regulations did not carry out a governmental function of providing services to the public the court found instead that p roviding elevators equipped with fire and earthquake safety features simply is not a government function of providing services to the public.department of industrial relations,supra,d at.moreover,the court found,the second uniqueness test was not regulation applied to all elevators,not only those owned or operated by local governments.
the department asserts that department of industrial relations,supra,d,is analogous,and argues that the service afforded by mandatory suspensions followed by a required expulsion recommendation,is not qualitatively different from the safety regulations at issue in department of industrial relations.school districts carrying out such expulsions are not providing a service to the public we disagree.providing public schooling clearly constitutes a governmental function,and enhancing the safety of those who attend such schools constitutes a service to the public.moreover,here,unlike the situation in department of industrial relations,the law implementing this state policy applies uniquely to local public schools.we conclude that department of industrial relations does not conflict with the conclusion that the mandatory suspension and expulsion recommendation requirements,together with restrictions placed upon a district resolution of such a case,constitute an increased or higher level of service to the public under the constitutional provision and the implementing statutes.
of course,even if,as we have concluded above,a statute effectuates an increased or higher level of governmental service to the public concerning an existing program,this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the program is a state mandate under california constitution,article xiii b,section.county of los angeles commission on state mandates th,d,italics added county of los angeles ii.we turn to the question whether the hearing costs at issue,flowing from compulsory suspensions and mandatory expulsion recommendations,are mandated by the state.
are the hearing costs state mandated 
as noted above,a compulsory suspension and a mandatory recommendation of expulsion under education code section in turn trigger a mandatory expulsion hearing.all parties agree that any such resulting expulsion hearing must comply with basic federal due process requirements,such as notice of charges,a right to representation by counsel,an explanation of the evidence supporting the charges,and an opportunity to call and witnesses and to present evidence.see ante,fn.but as also noted above,article xiii b,section,and the implementing statutes,et,by their terms,provide for reimbursement only of costs,not federally mandated costs.the commission and the department assert that this circumstance raises the question do all or some of a district costs in complying with the mandatory expulsion provision of education code section constitute a nonreimbursable federal mandate 
in the absence of the operation of education code section mandatory provision specifically,compulsory immediate suspension and a mandatory expulsion recommendation,a school district would not automatically incur the due process hearing costs that are mandated by federal law pursuant to goss,supra,d,and related cases,and codified in education code section.instead,a district would incur such hearing costs only if a school principal first were to exercise discretion to recommend expulsion.accordingly,in its mandatory aspect,education code section appears to constitute a state mandate,in that it establishes conditions under which the state,rather than local officials,has made the decision requiring a school district to incur the costs of an expulsion hearing.
the department and the commission agree to a point,but argue that a district costs incurred in complying with this state mandate are reimbursable only if,and to the extent that,hearing procedures set forth in education code section exceed the requirements of federal due process.in support,they rely upon government code section,setting forth circumstances in which the commission shall not find costs to be mandated by the that t he commission shall not find costs mandated by the state,as defined in section,in any claim submitted by a local agency or school district,if,after a hearing,the commission finds that c the statute or executive order implemented a federal law or regulation and resulted in costs mandated by the federal government,unless the statute or executive order mandates costs which exceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation.
we agree with the district and the court of appeal below that,as applied to the present case,it can not be said that education code section mandatory expulsion provision implemented a federal law or regulation.italics added.education code section,at the time relevant here,did not implement any federal law as explained below,federal law did not then mandate an expulsion firearm possession moreover,although the department argues that in this context government code section,subdivision c phrase the statute should be viewed as referring not to education code section mandatory expulsion recommendation requirement,but instead to the mandatory due process hearing under education code section that is triggered by such an expulsion recommendation,it still can not be said that section itself required the district to incur any costs.as noted above,education code section sets out requirements for expulsion hearings that must be held when a district seeks to expel a neither section nor federal law requires that any such expulsion recommendation be made in the first place,and hence section does not implement any federal mandate that school districts hold such hearings and incur such costs whenever a student is found in possession of a firearm.accordingly,we conclude that the exception to reimbursement described in government code section,subdivision c,is inapplicable in this context.
because it is state law education code section mandatory expulsion provision,and not federal due process law,that requires the district to take steps that in turn require it to incur hearing costs,it follows,contrary to the view of the commission and the department,that we can not characterize any of the hearing costs incurred by the district,triggered by the mandatory provision of education code section,as constituting a federal mandate and hence being nonreimbursable.we conclude that under the statutes existing at the time of the test claim in this case state legislation in effect through,all such hearing designed to satisfy the minimum requirements of federal due process,and those that may exceed those,with respect to the mandatory expulsion provision of section,state mandated costs,fully reimbursable by the state 
against this conclusion,the department,in its supplemental briefing,offers a wholly new theory,not advanced in any of the proceedings below,in support of its belated claim that all hearing costs triggered by education code section mandatory expulsion provision are in fact nonreimbursable federal mandates,and not,as we have concluded above,reimbursable state mandates.as we shall explain,we reject the department contention,as applied to the test case here at issue involving state statutes in effect through.
the department cites united states code section,part of the federal no child left behind act of,which provides,as relevant here each state receiving federal funds under any subchapter of this chapter shall have in effect a state law requiring local educational agencies to expel from school for a period of not less than year a student who is determined to have brought a firearm to a school,or to have possessed a firearm at a school,under the jurisdiction of local educational agencies in that state,except that such state law shall allow the chief administering officer of a local educational agency to modify such expulsion requirement for a student on a basis if such modification is in writing.
the department further asserts that more than billion in federal funds under the no child left behind act are included for local use in the state budget.cal.state budget,budget highlights.the department argues that in light of the requirements set forth in united states code section,and the amount of federal program funds at issue under the no child left behind act,the financial consequences to the state and to the school districts of failing to comply with united states code section are such that as a practical matter,education code section mandatory expulsion provision in reality constitutes an implementation of federal law,and hence resulting costs are nonreimbursable except to the extent they exceed the requirements of federal law.see,subd.c see also kern high school,supra,cal th,d,city of sacramento,supra,cal d.moreover,the department asserts,to the extent school districts are compelled by federal law,through education code section mandatory expulsion provision,to hold hearings pursuant to section in cases of firearm possession on school grounds,under united states code section defining prohibited uses of program funds,all costs of such hearings properly may be paid out of federal program funds,and hence we should view the provision of program funding as satisfying,in advance,any reimbursement requirement.kern high school,supra,cal th,d.
although the department asserts that this federal law and program existed at the time relevant in this matter that is,through,our review of the statutes and relevant history suggests otherwise.title of the united states code,section,and the remainder of the no child left behind act,became effective on january.the predecessor legislation cited by the schools act of former a,although containing a substantially identical mandatory expulsion provision,b was not effective until july,stat.in turn,the predecessor legislation to that act cited by the department,the elementary and secondary education act of former et as it existed at the time relevant here july,through june,contained no such mandatory expulsion provision.accordingly,it appears that despite the department late discovery of united states code section,at the time relevant here regarding legislation in effect through,neither united states code section,nor either of its predecessors,compelled states to enact a law such as education code section mandatory expulsion provision.therefore,we reject the department assertion that,during the time period at issue in this case,education code section mandatory expulsion provision constituted an implementation of a federal,rather than a state,mandate.
although we conclude that all hearing costs triggered by education code section mandatory expulsion provision constitute reimbursable expenses under the statutes as they existed during the period covered by the district present test claim,we do not foreclose the possibility that united states code section or its predecessor,united states code section,may lead to a different conclusion when applied to versions of education code section effective in years and thereafter.indeed,we note that at least one subsequent test claim that has been filed with the commission may raise the federal statutory issue advanced by the department 
costs associated with hearings triggered by discretionary expulsion recommendations 
we next consider whether reimbursement is required for the costs associated with hearings triggered under discretionary expulsion provisions.again,we address first the issue that we asked the parties to brief does the discretionary expulsion provision of education code section former subd.c,thereafter subd.d,currently subd.e,which,as noted above,recognized that a principal possesses discretion to recommend that a student be expelled for specified conduct other than firearm possession conduct such as damaging or stealing property,using or selling illicit drugs,possessing tobacco or drug paraphernalia,and further specified that the school district governing board may order a student expelled upon finding that the student,while at school or at a school activity off school grounds,engaged in such conduct,constitute a new program or higher level of service under article xiii b,section of the state constitution,and under government code section 
we answer this question in the negative.the discretionary expulsion provision of education code section does not constitute a new program or higher level of service,because provisions recognizing discretion to suspend or expel were set forth in statutes predating.see,former,stats,ch,providing that a student may be suspended for good cause,former stats,ch,defining good cause,former section stats,ch,further defining good cause.accordingly,the discretionary expulsion provision of education code section is not a new program under article xiii b,section,and the implementing statutes,nor does it reflect a higher level of service related to an existing program.county of los angeles,supra,cal d.
the district maintains,nevertheless,that once it elects to pursue expulsion,it is obligated to abide by the procedural hearing requirements of education code section and accordingly is mandated by that section to incur costs associated with such compliance.the district asserts that in this respect,section constitutes a new program or higher level of service related to an existing program under article xiii b,section and under government code section.we shall assume for analysis that this is so 
the district recognizes,of course,that under government code,section,subdivision c,it is not entitled to reimbursement to the extent education code section merely implements federal due process law,but the district argues that it has a right to reimbursement for its costs of complying with section to the extent those costs are attributable to hearing procedures that exceed federal due process requirements.see,subd.c.the district asserts that its costs in complying with various notice,right of inspection,and recording requirements see ante,fn.fall into this category and are reimbursable.
the department and the commission argue in response that any right to reimbursement for hearing costs triggered by discretionary costs limited to those procedures that assertedly exceed federal due process hearing foreclosed by virtue of the circumstance that when a school pursues a discretionary expulsion,it is not acting under compulsion of any law but instead is exercising a choice.in support,the department and the commission rely upon kern high school,supra,cal th,d,and city of merced state of california d.city of merced.
in kern high school,supra,cal th,d,school districts asserted that costs incurred in complying with statutory notice and agenda requirements for committee meetings concerning various state and federally funded educational programs constituted a reimbursable state mandate,because once school districts elected to participate in the underlying state and federal programs,the districts had no option but to hold committee meetings and abide by the challenged notice and agenda requirements,at,d.we rejected the school districts position,reasoning in part that because the districts participation in the underlying programs was voluntary,the notice and agenda costs incurred as a result of that voluntary participation were not the product of legal compulsion and did not constitute a reimbursable state mandate on that basis,at,d.
in reaching that conclusion in kern high school,supra,cal th,d,we discussed city of merced,supra,d.in that case,the city wished either to purchase or to condemn,pursuant to its eminent domain authority,certain privately owned real property.the city elected to proceed by eminent domain,under which it was required by then recent legislation code civ,to compensate the property owner for loss of business goodwill.the city so compensated the property owner and then sought reimbursement from the state,arguing that the new statutory requirement that it compensate for business goodwill amounted to a reimbursable state mandate.city of merced,supra,d at.the court of appeal concluded that the city increased costs flowing from its election to condemn the property did not constitute a reimbursable state mandate,at.the court reasoned w hether a city or county decides to exercise eminent domain is,essentially,an option of the city or county,rather than a mandate of the state.the fundamental concept is that the city or county is not required to exercise eminent domain.if,however,the power of eminent domain is exercised,then the city will be required to pay for loss of goodwill.thus,payment for loss of goodwill is not a cost,at,italics added.
summarizing this aspect of city of merced,supra,d,in kern high school,supra,cal th,d,we stated t he core point articulated by the court in city of merced is that activities undertaken at the option or discretion of a local government entity that is,actions undertaken without any legal compulsion or threat of penalty for nonparticipation do not trigger a state mandate and hence do not require reimbursement of if the local entity is obliged to incur costs as a result of its discretionary decision to participate in a particular program or practice.kern high school,at,d,italics added.
the department and the commission argue that in the present case the district,like the claimants in kern high school,errs by focusing upon the final school district legal obligation to comply with statutory hearing than focusing upon whether the school district has been compelled to put itself in the position in which such a hearing with resulting costs is required.
the district and amici curiae on its behalf consistently with the opinion of the court of appeal below argue that the holding of city of merced,supra,d,should not be extended to apply to situations beyond the context presented in that case and in kern high school,supra,cal th,d.the district and amici curiae note that although any particular expulsion recommendation may be discretionary,as a practical matter it is inevitable that some school expulsions will occur in the administration of any public school program 
upon reflection,we agree with the district and amici curiae that there is reason to question an extension of the holding of city of merced so as to preclude reimbursement under article xiii b,section of the state constitution and government code section,whenever an entity makes an initial discretionary decision that in turn triggers mandated costs.indeed,it would appear that under a strict application of the language in city of merced,public entities would be denied reimbursement for costs in apparent contravention of the intent underlying article xiii b,section of the state constitution and government code section and contrary to past decisions in which it has been established that reimbursement was in fact proper.for example,as explained above,in carmel valley,supra,d,an executive order requiring that county firefighters be provided with protective clothing and safety equipment was found to create a reimbursable state mandate for the added costs of such clothing and equipment,at.the court in carmel valley apparently did not contemplate that reimbursement would be foreclosed in that setting merely because a local agency possessed discretion concerning how many firefighters it would hence,in that sense,could control or perhaps even avoid the extra costs to which it would be subjected.yet,under a strict application of the rule gleaned from city of merced,supra,d,such costs would not be reimbursable for the simple reason that the local agency decision to employ firefighters involves an exercise of discretion concerning,for example,how many firefighters are needed to be employed.we find it doubtful that the voters who enacted article xiii b,section,or the legislature that adopted government code section,intended that result,and hence we are reluctant to endorse,in this case,an application of the rule of city of merced that might lead to such a result.
in any event,we have determined that we need not address in this case the problems posed by such an application of the rule articulated in city of merced,because this aspect of the present case can be resolved on an alternative basis.as we shall explain,we conclude,regarding the reimbursement claim that we face presently,that all hearing procedures set forth in education code section properly should be considered to have been adopted to implement a federal due process mandate,and hence that all such hearing costs are nonreimbursable under article xiii b,section,and government code section,subdivision c.
in this regard,we find the decision in county of los angeles ii,supra,th,d,to be instructive.that case concerned penal code section,which requires counties to provide indigent criminal defendants with defense funds for ancillary investigation services related to capital trials and certain other trials,and further provides related procedural,the confidentiality of a request for funds,the right to have the request ruled upon by a judge other than the trial judge,and the right to an in camera hearing on the request.the county in that case asserted that funds expended under the statute constituted reimbursable state mandates.the court of appeal disagreed,finding instead that the penal code section merely implements the requirements of federal constitutional law,and that even in the absence of penal code section,counties would be responsible for providing ancillary services under the constitutional guarantees of due process and under the sixth amendment th at,d.moreover,the court of appeal concluded,the procedural protections that the legislature had built into the of confidentiality of a request for funds,the right to have the request ruled upon by a judge other than the trial judge,and the right to an in camera hearing on the merely incidental to the federal rights codified by the statute,and their financial impact was de minimis,at,fn,d.accordingly,the court of appeal concluded,the penal code section,in its is,even those incidental aspects of the statute that articulated specific procedures,not expressly set forth in federal law,for the filing and resolution of requests for an implementation of federal law,and hence those costs were nonreimbursable under article xiii b,section.
we conclude that the same reasoning applies in the present setting,concerning the district request for reimbursement for procedural hearing costs triggered by its discretionary decision to seek expulsion.as in county of los angeles ii,supra,th,d,the initial discretionary decision in the former case,to file charges and prosecute a crime in the present case,to seek expulsion in turn triggers a federal constitutional mandate in the former case,to provide ancillary defense services in the present case,to provide an expulsion hearing.in both circumstances,the legislature,in adopting specific statutory procedures to comply with the general federal mandate,reasonably articulated various incidental procedural protections.these protections are designed to make the underlying federal right enforceable and to set forth procedural details that were not expressly articulated in the case law establishing the respective rights viewed singly or cumulatively,they did not significantly increase the cost of compliance with the federal mandate.the court of appeal in county of los angeles ii concluded that,for purposes of ruling upon a claim for reimbursement,such incidental procedural requirements,producing at most de minimis added cost,should be viewed as part and parcel of the underlying federal mandate,and hence nonreimbursable under government code,section,subdivision c.we reach the same conclusion here.
indeed,to proceed otherwise in the context of a reimbursement claim would produce impractical and detrimental consequences.the present case demonstrates the point.the record reveals that in the extended proceedings before the commission,the parties spent numerous hours producing voluminous pages of analysis directed toward determining whether various provisions of education code section exceeded federal due process requirements.that task below was complicated by the circumstance that this area of federal due process law is not well developed.the commission,which is not a judicial body,did as best it could and concluded that in certain respects the various provisions as observed ante,footnote,predominantly concerning notice,right of inspection,and recording requirements exceeded the requirements of federal due process.
even for an appellate court,it would be difficult and problematic in this setting to categorize the various notice,right of inspection,and recording requirements here at issue as falling either within or without the general federal due process mandate.the difficulty results not only from the circumstance that,as noted,the case law in the area of due process procedures concerning expulsion matters is relatively undeveloped,but also from the circumstance that when such an issue is raised in an action for reimbursement,as opposed to its being raised in litigation challenging an actual expulsion on the ground of allegedly inadequate hearing procedures,the issue inevitably is presented in the abstract,without any factual context that might help frame the legal issue.in such circumstances,courts should of venturing pronouncements especially concerning matters of constitutional law.
in light of these considerations,we agree with the conclusion reached by the court of appeal in county of los angeles ii,supra,th,d for purposes of ruling upon a request for reimbursement,challenged state rules or procedures that are intended to implement an applicable federal whose costs are,in context,de be treated as part and parcel of the underlying federal mandate.
applying that approach to the case now before us,we conclude there can be no doubt that the assertedly excessive due process aspects of education code section for which the district seeks reimbursement in connection with hearings triggered by discretionary expulsions see ante,footnote,as noted,various notice,right of inspection,and recording rules fall within the category of matters that are merely incidental to the underlying federal mandate,and that produce at most a de minimis cost.accordingly,for purposes of the district reimbursement claim,all hearing costs incurred under education code section,triggered by the district exercise of discretion to seek expulsion,should be treated as having been incurred pursuant to a mandate of federal law,and hence all such costs are nonreimbursable under government code section,subdivision c 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed insofar as it provides for full reimbursement of all costs related to hearings triggered by the mandatory expulsion provision of education code section.the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed insofar as it provides for reimbursement of any costs related to hearings triggered by the discretionary provision of section.all parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
the provision continues except that the legislature may,but need not,provide such subvention of funds for the following mandates a legislative mandates requested by the local agency affected b legislation defining a new crime or changing an existing definition of a crime or c legislative mandates enacted prior to january,or executive orders or regulations initially implementing legislation enacted prior to january.cal,art.xiii b.
for purposes of our present inquiry,section,at the time relevant here through read essentially as it had for the prior decade,and as it has in the ensuing decade.that provision first was enacted in see stats,ch,as education code,former section.this enactment apparently was a response to the united states supreme court decision in goss lopez,d goss recognizing due process requirements applicable to public school students who are suspended for more than days.the statute was renumbered as education code,former section in stats,ch,and was substantially augmented in stats,ch.after relatively minor amendments in and,the section in was substantially restated,further augmented,and renumbered as education code section stats,ch.amendments adopted in and made relatively minor changes,and further similar modifications were made in,reflecting the version of the statute here at issue.subsequent amendments in,and made further changes that are irrelevant to the issue presented in the case now before us.
the provision reads the pupil shall be entitled to a hearing to determine whether the pupil should be expelled.an expulsion hearing shall be held within schooldays after the date the principal or the superintendent of schools determines that the pupil has committed any of the acts enumerated in section,subd.a.subdivision b of presently it did at the time relevant offense of possession of a firearm.
of course,if a student does not invoke his or her entitlement to such a hearing,and instead waives the right to such a hearing,the hearing need not be held.

an earlier and similar,albeit broader,version of the not only to possession of firearms but also to possession of explosives and certain briefly and was effective for approximately two and months in late.that initial statute,former section,subdivision b as amended stats,ch,which was effective only from october,through december,provided the principal or the superintendent of schools shall immediately suspend pursuant to section,and shall recommend to the governing board the expulsion of,any pupil found to be in possession of a firearm,knife of no reasonable use to the pupil,or explosive at school or at a school activity off school grounds.the governing board shall expel that pupil or,as an alternative,refer that pupil to an alternative education program,whenever the principal or the superintendent of schools and the governing board confirm that the pupil was in knowing possession of the firearm,knife,or explosive.possession of the firearm,knife of no reasonable use to the pupil,or explosive was verified by an employee of the school district.there was no reasonable cause for the pupil to be in possession of the firearm,knife,or explosive.as subsequently amended by statutes,chapter,section,pages,effective january,education code section,former subdivision b,read the principal or the superintendent of schools shall immediately suspend,pursuant to section,any pupil found to be in possession of a firearm at school or at a school activity off school grounds and shall recommend expulsion of that pupil to the governing board.the governing board shall expel that pupil or refer that pupil to a program of study that is appropriately prepared to accommodate students who exhibit discipline problems and is not provided at a comprehensive middle,junior,or senior high school or housed at the schoolsite attended by the pupil at the time the expulsion was recommended to the school board,whenever the principal or superintendent of schools and the governing board confirm the following the pupil was in knowing possession of the firearm.an employee of the school district verifies the pupil possession of the firearm.
the current subdivisions of education code section set forth a list of mandatory expulsion conduct broader than that set forth in former subdivision b,and require a school board both to expel and refer to other institutions all students found to have committed such conduct.the present subdivisions read c the principal or superintendent of schools shall immediately suspend,pursuant to section,and shall recommend expulsion of a pupil that he or she determines has committed any of the following acts at school or at a school activity off school grounds possessing,selling,or otherwise furnishing a firearm.this subdivision does not apply to an act of possessing a firearm if the pupil had obtained prior written permission to possess the firearm from a certificated school employee,which is concurred in by the principal or the designee of the principal.this subdivision applies to an act of possessing a firearm only if the possession is verified by an employee of a school district.brandishing a knife at another person.unlawfully selling a controlled substance listed in chapter commencing with section of division of the health and safety code.committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault as defined in subdivision n of section or committing a sexual battery as defined in subdivision n of section.possession of an explosive.d the
