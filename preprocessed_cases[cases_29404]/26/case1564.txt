this appeal by the west sonoma county union high school district and its governing board is from a judgment granting a petition for writ of mandate and directing the district to reemploy respondent alta kavanaugh as a probationary certificated teacher,effective with the commencement of the school year 
the judgment was based on the trial court reading of education code section,which provides that new certificated employees must receive a written statement indicating their employment status and salary a t the time of initial employment.for a temporary employee,if the statement does not indicate the temporary nature of the employment,the employee is deemed to be a probationary employee.we conclude that the statute requires a school district to provide the statement when its governing board takes formal action to employ a new certificated temporary employee rather than on the date that employee first renders paid service to the district,and we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
introduction 
certain of the underlying facts are undisputed.during the summer of,respondent,a certified secondary language arts teacher who had been teaching in the hemet unified school district,submitted various applications for teaching positions in sonoma county.on august,she wrote to the personnel director of the west sonoma county union high school district district,stating that she planned to relocate to sonoma county and asking to be considered for an open position in the district for an english teacher.respondent explained that she would be in the santa rosa area the following week and would be available for an interview at the district convenience.
on or about august,respondent was interviewed by thomas lorch,the principal of the district analy high school,timothy williams,an english teacher at the school,and others.at the conclusion of the interview,lorch offered respondent the vacant position.her first day of work for the district was august.
at its regular meeting on thursday evening,september,the district board of trustees took action to employ respondent,among other new teachers,effective august.on september,the district received verification from the hemet unified school district of respondent years of experience and information that the latter district had granted her a leave of absence for the school year.on monday,september,susan panas,the district personnel manager,informed respondent by letter that the board had approved your employment as a temporary teacher at analy high school effective august.
on october,panas notified respondent in writing that her salary would be increased retroactively because the district had received final confirmation of additional credits she had earned.panas also asked respondent to stop by the office at her earliest convenience to sign her contract.on november,panas sent respondent another reminder about signing the contract.on november,respondent signed the contract,which described her term of employment as commencing august,and terminating june,specified her placement on the certificated salary schedule,and identified her classification as temporary.
on april,because of the district financial condition,the board took action not to reemploy several temporary certificated employees,including respondent.on the same day,the district notified respondent pursuant to section that she would not be reemployed.
b.the lawsuit 
respondent filed a petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief,seeking reemployment as a probationary teacher,back pay and benefits,and other relief.she alleged that the district had a duty under section to classify her as a probationary employee for the school year because it failed to provide timely written notice that her employment was temporary,and that she must be deemed reemployed as a probationary employee for the following year because she was not notified otherwise before march.
respondent submitted a declaration in support of the petition,stating in part that during her interview,no one told her the position was temporary.she declared that lorch said the position would lead to permanent status with the district and that she would have to teach two probationary years before she could become a permanent teacher.she accepted the position based on these representations.she would not have left her permanent position in southern california without being placed in a tenure track position.according to respondent,she first learned she was a temporary employee when she received the september letter.she questioned personnel manager panas about that classification before signing her contract on november.panas replied,that just something this district does.do worry.if you get a good evaluation,they retroactively make you probationary.with that assurance,respondent signed the contract.
opposing the petition,the district submitted declarations from lorch,panas,and williams,which conflicted with certain of respondent assertions.lorch declared that he did not tell respondent her employment would lead to a permanent position,did not explain the tenure process to her,and did not represent the open position as permanent.he also declared that he always tells candidates for temporary positions that the employment is a temporary contract.panas declared that she prepared an announcement for the english teacher position in june,which provided specifically that a successful candidate would be hired as temporary.she stated that the announcement was distributed to district schools,neighboring districts,and applicants requesting information panas also denied telling respondent that a good evaluation would provide her with probationary status.according to panas,when respondent signed her contract,she did not mention her present claim that she had been hired as a probationary teacher.panas also explained that verification of a new teacher prior employment and academic unit accumulation is necessary to determine his or her correct placement on the district salary schedule.by october,panas had obtained final verification of the necessary information about respondent,and requested that she come to the office to sign her contract.
the trial court granted respondent petition for writ of mandate and directed the district to reemploy her as a probationary certificated teacher effective with the commencement of the school year.

the parties make much of the conflicts in the declarations,but the record demonstrates that the basis for the trial court decision was its interpretation of section.respondent alleged that the district had a ministerial duty under section to classify her as a probationary,teacher for the school year.citing that section and california teachers governing board d,the court reasoned that respondent did not receive a written statement clearly indicating the temporary nature of her employment at the beginning of her employment for the school year,and thus she was deemed a probationary employee who could not be terminated after march.whether the court correctly interpreted section is a question of law requiring our independent review,and the substantial evidence te
