the state of texas requires a private school to meet prescribed standards before it may call itself a seminary or use words like degree,associate,bachelor,master,and doctor or their recognize attainment in religious education and training.we must decide whether this requirement impermissibly intrudes upon religious freedom protected by the united states and texas constitutions.we hold it does and therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
the state of texas goes to great lengths to ban diploma mills what webster dictionary defines as institution s of higher education operating without supervision of a state or professional agency and granting diplomas which are either fraudulent or because of the lack of proper standards worthless the higher education coordinating act of,codified as chapter of the texas education code states that the policy and purpose of the state of texas are to prevent deception of the public resulting from the conferring and use of fraudulent or substandard college and university degrees and to regulate the use of academic terminology in naming or otherwise designating educational institutions,the advertising,solicitation or representation by educational institutions or their agents,and the maintenance and preservation of essential academic records.
to achieve this purpose,subchapter g of the act denies a private educational institution use of certain terminology common to graduate education unless it has a certificate of authority from the texas higher education coordinating board section restricts what an institution can call itself.as originally enacted in,it restricted use of only the terms college and university but its reach was broadened in and now states in part 
a unless the institution has been issued a certificate of authority under this subchapter,a person may not 
use the term college,university,seminary,school of medicine,medical school,health science center,school of law,law school,or law center in the official name or title of a nonexempt private postsecondary educational institution or 
describe an institution using a term listed in subdivision or a term having a similar meaning 
section restricts the designations of educational attainment an institution may use.in,when the events in this case occurred,section stated 
a person may not grant or award a degree on behalf of a private postsecondary educational institution unless the institution has been issued a certificate of authority to grant the degree by the board in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.a person may not represent that credits earned or granted by that person or institution are applicable for credit toward a degree to be granted by some other person or institution except under conditions and in a manner specified and approved by the board.the board is empowered to specify and regulate the manner,condition,and language used by an institution or person or agents thereof in making known that the person or institution holds a certificate of authority and the interpretation of the significance of such certificate 
current section defines degree expansively 
degree means any title or designation,mark,abbreviation,appellation,or series of letters or words,including associate,bachelor,master,doctor,and their equivalents,which signifies,purports to,or is generally taken to signify satisfactory completion of the requirements of all or part of a program of study leading to an associate,bachelor,master,or doctor degree or its equivalent 
as section explains 
because degrees and equivalent indicators of educational attainment are used by employers in judging the training of prospective employees,by public and private professional groups in determining qualifications for admission to and continuance of practice,and by the general public in assessing the competence of persons engaged in a wide range of activities necessary to the general welfare,regulation by law of the evidences of college and university educational attainment is in the public interest.to the same end the protection of legitimate institutions and of those holding degrees from them is also in the public interest 
to obtain a certificate of authority an institution must satisfy the coordinating board that it meets standards the board has adopted there are at present in,the standards were substantively similar but numbered according to the board,its standards represent generally accepted administrative and academic practices and principles of accredited institutions of higher education in texas and are generally set forth by regional and specialized accrediting bodies.the standards are lengthy,detailed,rigorous,and comprehensive,covering every aspect of an institution operation.some are quite explicit,like these 
each faculty member teaching in an academic associate or baccalaureate level degree program shall have at least a master degree from an institution accredited by a recognized agency or a regional accrediting agency with at least graduate semester credit hours in the discipline being taught.furthermore,at least of course work in an academic associate or baccalaureate level major shall be taught by faculty members holding doctorates,or other terminal degrees,in the discipline being taught from institutions accredited by a recognized agency or a regional accrediting agency graduate level degree programs shall be taught by faculty holding doctorates,or other terminal degrees,in the discipline being taught from institutions accredited by a recognized agency or a regional accrediting agency.
each associate or baccalaureate degree program shall contain a general education component consisting of at least of the total hours offered for the program.this component shall be drawn from each of the following areas humanities and fine arts,social and behavioral sciences,and natural sciences and mathematics.
other standards leave much to the coordinating board discretion to determine compliance 
the character,education,and experience in higher education of governing board members,administrators,supervisors,counselors,agents,and other institutional officers shall be such as may reasonably ensure that the students will receive education consistent with the objectives of the course or program of study.
there shall be sufficient distinction among the roles and personnel of the governing board of the institution,the administration,and faculty to ensure their appropriate separation and independence.
the character,education,and experience in higher education of the faculty shall be such as may reasonably ensure that the students will receive an education consistent with the objectives of the course or program of study.
there shall be a sufficient number of teaching faculty resident and accessible to ensure continuity and stability of the education program,adequate educational association between students and faculty and among the faculty members,and adequate opportunity for proper preparation for instruction and professional growth by faculty members.
the quality,content,and sequence of each course,curriculum,or program of instruction,training,or study shall be appropriate to the purpose of the institution and shall be such that the institution may reasonably and adequately achieve the stated objectives of the course or program.
the institution shall have adequate space,equipment,and instructional materials to provide education of good quality.
the institution shall have adequate financial resources and financial stability to provide education of good quality and to be able to fulfill its commitments to students.
the institution shall adopt and distribute to all members of the faculty a statement of academic freedom assuring freedom in teaching,research,and publication.
a certificate of authority is valid for two years and an institution must apply for renewal days before the certificate expires a certificate can be renewed for only eight years,by which time the institution must obtain full accreditation 
an institution is exempt from subchapter g if it is fully accredited by a recognized accrediting agency designated by the coordinating board in,the board had designated only three accrediting agencies,two of which were specifically oriented toward religious institutions since then,four others have been added,none with a religious focus although no recognized accrediting agency standards are included in the record,for board recognition,an accrediting agency standards must be at least as comprehensive and rigorous as the board standards for a certificate of authority and be as rigorously applied.an exempt institution may,and according to the board should,obtain a certificate of authorization which is not to be confused with a certificate of authority 
in sum,with a few exceptions,none material to this case,subchapter g of the act requires that a private institution either have accreditation or satisfy standards before it can describe itself and its students attainments with words commonly used for those purposes by such institutions.a violation is a class a misdemeanor may be investigated and enjoined by the attorney general is punishable by a civil penalty of per day and an administrative penalty of per offense imposed by the commissioner of higher education,the board executive officer and is a false,misleading,or deceptive act or practice actionable under the texas deceptive trade protection act 
the parties have stipulated to all the facts.
petitioner heb ministries,a church in fort worth operates a school,tyndale theological seminary and bible institute,which was founded in the early to offer a biblical education in preparation for ministry in churches and missions.by,its campus consisted of a library,four or five classrooms,administrative offices,a small bookstore,and a computer department,and its enrollment was students,with over in correspondence courses.tyndale is a private postsecondary educational institution as defined by subchapter 
tyndale course catalog stated 
at tyndale our focus is upon professional minister or motivated layman who wishes to make a difference for christ in our world.you are the most important part of the tyndale equation.our job is to meet your meet you with quality bible courses that help you in your ministry endeavor.
the catalog also contained a lengthy doctrinal statement setting out tyndale positions on issues of faith the catalog listed courses,of which were in religious subjects.of the other ten,three were in general education basic english grammar composition,read,research study basics,and ancient world history and seven were in typing,word processing,and use of the internet,offered by the department of theological and biblical research.the catalog offered diplomas,all in religious subjects 
tyndale catalog offered no diploma in any secular subject and no degree of any kind,but it characterized programs of study required for a diploma as equivalent to programs of study required for a degree at the same level.for example,the catalog referred to its diploma of theological studies program as a bachelor equivalent program and bachelor equivalent course of studies,and the master of arts level diploma in counseling as a masters level program 
the course catalog did not state that tyndale diplomas were the equivalent of college degrees,but neither did it state that they were not it was silent on the subject.the catalog stated that tyndale and louisiana baptist theological seminary were going forward with parallel programs in prophetic studies and exchange of credits between the two institutions,but did not otherwise say that tyndale academic credits could be applied toward earning degrees.
in,tyndale had never been accredited by an agency recognized by the coordinating board and had never obtained a certificate of authority from the board.tyndale never sought accreditation or a certificate of authority for what it describes as doctrinal reasons.in its course catalog,tyndale described its position on accreditation as follows 
many seminaries are on shifting sands.they feel they must impress the world or the culture with their intellectualism.thus,some schools are spending large sums of money on appearance and are no longer focusing on the theology,solid bible courses,practical language exegesis.
what validates tyndale tyndale believes it is affirmed by its board of advisors,board of governors,the students attending and,the guest faculty who give our students the best of academics and the greatest training in the spiritual message of the scriptures.but again,many schools seek recognition and affirmation from the state,from secular associations or professional groups that really have no business meddling in biblical matters.
the approach of many seminaries and bible schools is obsolete and antiquated.they are still trying to be,as they call it,traditional schools.but mainly,they simply try to keep up with the joneses.they attempt to look and act like secular universities.but in reality,a school like tyndale,and other schools with our convictions,are the ones that are traditional,not the other way around.
for example,in the,most christian schools were not accredited,nor did the best want to be.they were satisfied with serving the lord by being complete and whole within their framework and calling.as well,a student could get the best education at these institutions and know he had not been compromised with the culture.but in the,a push was on for state approval and accreditation.we want state and federal government approval.we want the world to like us sic did any of this have anything to do with the quality or teaching message of those schools it did not when one of the big seminaries became accredited in the,almost all of the older faculty and all of the graduates testify that the school went down in a certain secular quality manner,but in its message and commitment to truth and the gospel.
one of the largest christian universities in america has said,we will not become accredited that school today is highly respected and other schools want their graduates.accreditation or lack of it has not had anything to do with the school quality or mission.
at commencement exercises on june,tyndale recognized graduates with awards,listed in the program with titles as follows

tyndale theological seminaryfort worth,texasto whom it may concern recipient name has completed satisfactorily the course oftheological studies offered bythe faculty of this institution and is entitledto the following diploma the aequusmaster of arts level diplomaand the same is hereby conferred by the authority of the boardand faculty as recommended by the,
in conferring these awards,tyndale did not use the word degree.nevertheless,the commissioner of higher education sent tyndale a letter dated july,which stated 
as you know,the texas education code,chapter,subchapter g,requires an institution to have a certificate of authority to grant degrees,credits applicable to degrees,or to use specific academic terminology.i have determined that tyndale theological seminary biblical institute is violating this statute.under section,the commissioner must assess penalties for violations.those penalties may range from to for use of a protected term in the institution name and from to for awarding or offering to award degrees.each degree awarded or offered constitutes a separate offense.
from the evidence we possess,i conclude the following 
tyndale meets the definition of a private postsecondary institution in texas as found in 
tyndale was informed that the law requires it must hold a certificate of authority from the coordinating board to grant degrees,grant credits applicable to degrees,or use protected terminology in a letter from the coordinating board dated september,
on or about june,tyndale awarded six undergraduate certificates consisting of courses alleged to be applicable to degrees,one associate degree,eight bachelor degrees,two diplomas of christian studies accepted as a baccalaureate equivalent for admission to your master programs,eleven master degrees,and six doctoral degrees for a total of degrees and 
tyndale is using the protected term seminary in its name.
therefore,i am assessing an administrative penalty of,consisting of violations of granting a degree without authority at each and one violation of using a protected term at.
you have twenty days from the date of receipt of this letter to either pay the penalty or appeal the decision 
also,you must immediately cease your actions in violation of state law.you must contact us within twenty days of the receipt of this letter with your plans to correct your actions.at minimum those plans must include the following you must cease using the term seminary,or any other protected term,in the name of your institution cease awarding or offering to award degrees cease offering credit towards degrees inform your graduates,students,and potential students by letter that you have no degree granting authority and offer by letter full refunds to all graduates and students.the content of the letter informing your students of your status and the offer of refunds must be submitted to the coordinating board for approval prior to its distribution.failure to contact us with your plans to correct your actions will result in our referring this matter to the office of the attorney general for injunctive and any other relief allowed by law.
tyndale did not appeal the board decision instead,heb ministries sued the coordinating board,the commissioner,and the attorney general for a declaratory judgment that sections and a,as applied to a school like tyndale,violate the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution as well as article i,section of the texas constitution heb ministries also sought attorney fees.the coordinating board and the commissioner counterclaimed for collection of the previously assessed administrative penalty,an injunction prohibiting heb ministries from engaging in the conduct for which it had been sanctioned,and attorney fees.
at some point,two other institutions intervened as plaintiffs.one,southern bible institute,describes itself as a religious educational institution in dallas,texas founded for the purpose of preparing disadvantaged men for the gospel ministry.the other,hispanic bible institute,states that it is a religious educational institution in san antonio,texas,and that t he educational offerings of this ministry are theology,church and pastoral ministry,and general studies.the record contains no other information about the intervenors.
both sides moved for summary judgment.in their motion,the plaintiffs including the intervenors argued,in addition to the allegations in heb ministries petition,that sections and also violate the first amendment free speech clause and article i,section of the texas constitution the defendants did not object to this additional claim and addressed it in their response.the trial court held that section regulation of the word seminary violates the first amendment and article i,sections and of the texas constitution.in all other respects,the trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants.it ordered heb ministries to pay the state,the penalty assessed for granting degrees,and ordered the plaintiffs to pay in attorney fees.the court also enjoined heb ministries from awarding degrees,as defined in subchapter g,or representing that tyndale educational credits would be applied toward a degree at another institution,until it obtained a certificate of authority from the coordinating board.
the court of appeals held that neither nor violates the first amendment or article i,sections and of the texas constitution.thus,it reinstated the administrative penalty against heb ministries for tyndale use of seminary,and upheld the administrative penalty for granting degrees.the court remanded the case for entry of a permanent injunction consistent with its opinion 
we granted the plaintiffs petition for review petitioners,to whom we shall refer collectively as heb ministries,contend that the establishment and free exercise clauses of the first amendment and corresponding state constitutional provisions preclude the state from requiring a school with a religious mission to meet specified standards for its operation and curriculum before it can call itself a seminary or use words like associate,bachelor,master,and doctor to mark student attainment in religious education and training.heb ministries does not challenge the state authority to impose such standards on secular institutions and on religious institutions offering a secular education.nor does heb ministries contend that the state can not regulate use of the word degree.it contends only that the state can not deny the use of such higher education terminology to religious schools that do not meet its standards.respondents,the coordinating board and the commissioner collectively the coordinating board insist that sections and a are constitutionally sound because they are part of a neutral law that is secular in purpose and generally applicable to all institutions of higher education,and that only incidentally impacts institutions offering religious instruction.the coordinating board argues that use of the statutorily restricted words is unimportant to the religious mission of a school like tyndale when there are other words it can use to describe itself and its students attainment.
heb ministries also contends that sections and a violate the free speech clause of the first amendment and corresponding state constitutional provisions.the separate opinions find it necessary to reach this issue,but we do not.
the establishment clause prohibits any law respecting an establishment of religion correspondingly,article i,section of the texas constitution states that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious society we have referred to this provision and article i,section as texas equivalent of the establishment clause.the parties do not argue that there is any difference in the application of these federal and state constitutional provisions to this case,and we will assume for present purposes that they are coextensive 
fundamentally,t he establishment of religion clause of the first amendment means at least this neither a state nor the federal government can set up a church.neither can pass laws which aid one religion,aid all religions,or prefer one religion over another.since the government can not determine what a church should be,it can not determine the qualifications a cleric should have or whether a particular person has them likewise,the government can not set standards for religious education or training as the united states supreme court said long ago in watson jones 
the law knows no heresy,and is committed to the support of no dogma,the establishment of no sect.the right to organize voluntary religious associations to assist in the expression and dissemination of any religious doctrine is unquestioned 
that said,the supreme court has also written 
a system of government that makes itself felt as pervasively as ours could hardly be expected never to cross paths with the church.in fact,our state and federal governments impose certain burdens upon,and impart certain benefits to,virtually all our activities,and religious activity is not an exception.the court has enforced a scrupulous neutrality by the state,as among religions,and also as between religious and other activities,but a hermetic separation of the two is an impossibility it has never required 
neutrality is what is required.the state must confine itself to secular objectives,and neither advance nor impede religious activity 
the coordinating board asserts that subchapter g meets this requirement of neutrality.though the statute regulates religious education,it does so,the board argues,only incidentally in pursuit of its secular objective of regulating all educational institutions generally,irrespective of whether their programs are secular or religious.in the sense that subchapter g applies to institutions across the board,we agree that it is neutral that is,it does not single out religious programs for special treatment.but the fact that subchapter g burdens all private institutions does not lessen its significant,peculiar impact on religious institutions offering religious courses of study.subchapter g requires a clear,public,instantly identifiable differentiation between a religious education that meets the coordinating board standards and one that does not only an institution that meets those standards may call itself a seminary and its graduates associates,bachelors,masters,doctors,and the like.but setting standards for a religious education is a religious exercise for which the state lacks not only authority but competence and those deficits are not erased simply because the state concurrently undertakes to do what it is able to standards for secular educational programs.the state can not avoid the constitutional impediments to setting substantive standards for religious education by making the standards applicable to all educational institutions,secular and religious 
subchapter g expresses a preference for one manner of religious education over another.the religious school that chooses to educate in the manner of secular schools may use education terminology with the state approval.other religious schools can not.the coordinating board standards we have set out above,adopted as authorized by subchapter g,require academic freedom and faculty independence inconsistent with a doctrinal statement like tyndale that is at the core of its mission.those standards set minimum faculty qualifications and require that of the hours required for graduation from a baccalaureate program be in each of three groups the humanities and fine arts,the social and behavioral sciences,and the natural sciences and mathematics.the standards also give the board wide discretion to determine the adequacy of an institution operations and curriculum.an accrediting agency standards must be at least as comprehensive and rigorous for the agency to receive recognition by the board.such standards,prescribing as they do a detailed model for any institution offering education,can hardly be said to impact religious institutions offering religious instruction incidentally.subchapter g does not target religious institutions,but it directly and substantively impacts them by impeding their ability to describe themselves or their students religious educational attainment.
heb ministries does not argue that the coordinating board standards offend constitutional protections when applied to secular educational programs,even if provided by religious institutions,and we need not consider that issue.heb ministries argues only that it is constitutionally impermissible for the state to require an indication of its preference for one manner of religious education over another.heb ministries course offerings are almost exclusively in religious out of the ten general education courses available are offered only to supplement religious training.heb ministries offers no secular program of study.its academic awards are all in religious studies,and the only certificate in our record clearly denotes this by stating that it is given for satisfactory completion of a course of theological studies.it is one thing for the state to require that english majors in a baccalaureate program take science or math courses,that they be taught by professors with master degrees from accredited institutions,and that professors have the freedom to teach that the works sometimes attributed to shakespeare were really written by edward de vere,christopher marlowe,francis bacon,or queen elizabeth i.it is quite another for the state to require that a religious institution education in religion include psychology courses,or that preaching or evangelism or missions be taught only by professors with master degrees instead of practitioners from the field,or that a school faculty have the freedom to teach that the bible was not divinely inspired,contrary to the school tenets of faith.as the united states supreme court has observed,
training for religious professions and training for secular professions are not fungible.training someone to lead a congregation is an essentially religious endeavor.indeed,majoring in devotional theology is akin to a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit 
the coordinating board acknowledges that the state can not control religious education and training and insists that subchapter g does not do so.compliance is voluntary.any institution is free to choose to operate without a certificate of authority from the coordinating board or accreditation from a recognized agency as long as it does not use restricted terminology.but subchapter g can not avoid the establishment clause merely because it allows institutions a degree of choice the issue is whether it operates to prefer one kind of religious instruction over another.by restricting the terminology a religious institution can use,the state signals its approval or disapproval of the institution operation and curriculum as vividly as if it hung the state seal on the institution front door.a seminary teaches religion the way the state of texas approves.a program or award in religious studies described as being at an associate,bachelor,master,or doctor level,or anything equivalent,has the state approval.all others do not.
as tyndale explained in its course catalog,views vary on how religious instruction should be provided.for some,the secular education model is preferred,with programs structured like those of any liberal arts school,and accreditation,though expensive,is affordable.for others,religious instruction is more insular,steeped in the doctrine and experience of a specific faith,and limited resources practically preclude obtaining accreditation the coordinating board admits that subchapter g takes sides in this debate,but insists that subchapter g does so only incidentally as part of its overall regulation of private education.we disagree that the state expression of a preference for how religion should be taught can fairly be characterized as incidental.the clearest command of the establishment clause is that one religious denomination can not be officially preferred over another.the texas constitution expressly prohibits such a preference.by limiting the educational terminology a religious institution may use without the approval of the coordinating board,subchapter g prefers one course of religious instruction over another.
the coordinating board argues that subchapter g standards are no different than sanitation standards a state might set for churches butchering meat to religious specifications.a state in such circumstances need not interfere with religious beliefs and practices to ensure that food is minimally safe for human consumption,and it can not interfere in religious requirements when health is no longer an issue.thus,government standards for determining that food is not only safe but religious requirement only partly concerned with involve an impermissible state preference among religious views as one court has written,a law that allows a state agency to determine whether food is kosher impermissibly take s sides in a religious matter,even if the purpose of the law is to prevent fraud in the marketing of food subchapter g helps prevent harm to students by requiring that educational institutions be financially responsible and candid about their operations but the state legitimate concern for student safety does not authorize it to take sides in the religious debate over how religion should be taught by setting substantive standards for religious educational curriculum and process.we have upheld regulations protecting the health,safety,and of students in daycare facilities subchapter g is much different.
we think sections and a clearly effectuate a state preference for one model of religious education over others,a preference that the establishment clause simply does not permit.we are mindful,however,that 
t he supreme court has rejected any absolute approach in applying the establishment clause.at times it has relied on the principles enunciated in lemon kurtzman to guide it through this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law.under lemon,a government practice is constitutional if it has a secular purpose its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion and it does not excessively entangle the government with religion 
in our view,the statutory provisions at issue do not pass this test.
there is nothing to suggest that either the legislature in enacting subchapter g or the coordinating board in enforcing it intended any purpose other than the secular one of maintaining high standards for education to protect legitimate institutions and their graduates and prevent public deception by diploma mills,even though the distinct impact on religious instruction is apparent.nor can we say that the principal or primary effect of subchapter g is to advance or inhibit religion,although as we have explained at length,a substantial effect of the statute is to indicate the state preference for religious instruction that meets the board standards.but it is fair to say that a principal or primary effect is to advance religious education the state approves and inhibit what it does not.we think it beyond serious dispute that the statute clearly and excessively entangles the government in matters of religious instruction.the board standards,and those of recognized accrediting agencies,can not be applied without a thorough,detailed,and repeated examination of an institution operations and curriculum.without such an examination,the board could not determine,as it says it must,whether,for example,t he character,education,and experience in higher education of the faculty shall be such as may reasonably ensure that the students will receive an education consistent with the objectives of the course or program of study.this is but one of more than a score of standards the institution must meet to obtain approval and access to restricted terminology.and it must demonstrate its compliance every two years until it obtains full accreditation from a recognized agency,which,as we have noted,is considered by the coordinating board to be at least as rigorous an exercise as compliance with the board standards.
it is true,as the coordinating board argues,that an institution may choose not to burden itself with state standards,but that option does not disentangle the state from religious matters.the choice,which every institution must make,determines whether the institution may use restricted terminology,indicating that its programs have state approval.it is this expression of approval or lack of approval of religious instruction that entangles the state in religion.
several justices of the supreme court have criticized the lemon test and while we are not at liberty to take criticism for rejection,from our vantage point,the court seems over time to have become particularly attuned to whether the challenged government practice purposefully or effectively endorses religion,an inquiry courts generally consider a component of the lemon test first and second parts.as we have explained,subchapter g clearly expresses the state endorsement of particular religious education by allowing institutions that meet its standards to use restricted terminology.a seminary is a school,and a bachelor diploma a award.the state imprimatur is unmistakable.
we are aware of only one other court that has considered whether state regulation of postsecondary religious education conflicts with the establishment clause.in new jersey state board of higher education shelton college,the new jersey supreme court upheld that state regulation against an establishment clause challenge but the school in that case,shelton college,offered secular as well as religious programs,including elementary education,secondary education,english,history,business management,music education,and natural science and the court reasoning illustrates the significant differences between the level of regulation involved in that case and this one 
the establishment clause permits minor,unobtrusive state supervision of religiously oriented schools.only excessive entanglement is proscribed.none of the education statutes or regulations here in question mandates active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.none authorizes state regulation of the content of an educational program.nor does the regulatory scheme on its face require comprehensive,discriminating and continuing state surveillance.although the regulations in this area appear to be burdensome,especially as applied to a college of approximately students,they explicitly call for flexibility in their administration so as to accommodate various institutions with diverse educational goals.because shelton college declined even to complete the licensing process,the allegation of excessive entanglement rests on speculation about the manner in which these statutes and regulations might be applied.although one could imagine an unconstitutional application of this regulatory scheme,we are confident that the board of higher education will pursue the least restrictive means to achieve the state overriding concerns.of course,should the board exercise its discretion in a manner that unnecessarily intrudes into shelton religious affairs,the college would then be free to challenge the constitutionality of such action.at this juncture,however,we need not invalidate these statutes merely because they may be amenable to an unconstitutional application 
subchapter g certification process is certainly not minor or unobtrusive it is,the coordinating board insists,comprehensive and rigorous the statute prohibits an institution from using common terminology if the sovereign is not actively involved in the institution religious education.state examination extends to content and presentation.there is no special provision for religious instruction,and not only is the board given no discretion to treat such education differently than secular education,it has given no indication that it would be willing to do so if it could we need not speculate what process tyndale would have been required to follow to obtain certification the demands of the board standards are perfectly clear.these are not the circumstances described in shelton college,and had they been,we think from what the court said there,it would have reached the same result we do in the present case.
the purpose of the establishment clause is to protect against state sponsorship and active involvement in religious activity.here,the religious activity is offering religious instruction and recognizing attainment with certificates clearly reflecting that such instruction is religious.we do not address what restrictions may be imposed on religious institutions that offer a secular education or award diplomas or other certificates for courses of study not clearly denominated as religious.it is hard to imagine a more active involvement in religious training than by determining whether it meets the comprehensive standards set by the coordinating board,and equally hard to imagine a more direct state sponsorship of religious education than by indicating in every institution name and on every academic award whether the state approves the programs of study.we therefore hold that sections and a violate the establishment clause and article i,section of the texas constitution as applied to a religious institution programs of religious instruction.
the first amendment also forbids any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion likewise,article i,section of the texas constitution states 
all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship almighty god according to the dictates of their own consciences.no man shall be compelled to attend,erect or support any place of worship,or to maintain any ministry against his consent.no human authority ought,in any case whatever,to control or interfere with the rights of conscience in matters of religion 
we have treated the state and federal free exercise guarantees as coextensive absent parties argument to the contrary and we do so again here.we are well aware of scholarly commentary criticizing the united states supreme court recent free exercise decisions but we do not find it necessary to discuss those issues in this case.
heb ministries contends,as we have said,that subchapter g violates its free exercise rights by requiring that it either comply with state standards,and thereby compromise its religious training mission,or forego the use of restricted terms,including seminary and common designations for its diplomas.the coordinating board asserts that subchapter g does not violate the free exercise clause because it is a neutral law of general applicability,or if not,then because the state has a compelling interest in regulating schools.the board stresses that compliance with subchapter g is voluntary and that other terms are available to schools that do not comply.
this dispute centers on whether and how to apply the united states supreme court decision in employment division smith in smith,two native american church members who used peyote for sacramental purposes were fired and then denied unemployment benefits because their conduct violated state drug laws they complained that the criminal law thus infringed on their free exercise rights.the supreme court disagreed,noting that it had consistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.the only exceptions,it stated,had 
involved not the free exercise clause alone,but the free exercise clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,such as freedom of speech and it is easy to envision a case in which a challenge on freedom of association grounds would likewise be reinforced by free exercise clause concerns 
the present case does not present such a hybrid situation,but a free exercise claim unconnected with any communicative activity respondents urge us to hold,quite simply,that when otherwise prohibitable conduct is accompanied by religious convictions,not only the convictions but the conduct itself must be free from governmental regulation.we have never held that,and decline to do so now.there being no contention that oregon drug law represents an attempt to regulate religious beliefs or the communication of religious beliefs,the rule to which we have adhered plainly controls.
the court specifically noted that the case did not involve the communication of religious beliefs or any communicative activity.the fact that the use of peyote was prohibited by a general criminal law was critical in that situation,the state could not be held to showing a compelling interest to justify the law 
the government ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct,like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy,can not depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector spiritual development 
three years later,the supreme court expounded on smith neutrality and general applicability requirements in church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah there,a church of the santeria religion challenged city ordinances passed to prohibit it from sacrificing animals as part of its religious ritual the requirement that a law be neutral toward religion,the court said,is basic at a minimum,the protections of the free exercise clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons,the court said,was indicated but not established by the ordinances use of the words sacrifice and ritual because the words,though religious in origin,also have secular meanings but even if a law is neutral on its face,if its object is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,the law is not neutral the court readily found that suppression of the central element of the santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances.the requirement of general applicability,the court explained,was based on t he principle that government,in pursuit of legitimate interests,can not in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.the court deemed that principle essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the free exercise clause.clearly,the court found,the ordinances pursue d the city governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief.having determined that the ordinances were neither neutral nor generally applicable,the court concluded 
a law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.to satisfy the commands of the first amendment,a law restrictive of religious practice must advance interests of the highest order and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.the compelling interest standard that we apply once a law fails to meet the smith requirements is not watered down but really means what it says.a law that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases.it follows from what we have already said that these ordinances can not withstand this scrutiny 
concurring separately,justice scalia,who wrote for the court in smith,explained further 
the terms neutrality and general applicability are not to be found within the first amendment itself,of course,but are used in smith and earlier cases to describe those characteristics which cause a law that prohibits an activity a particular individual wishes to engage in for religious reasons nonetheless not to constitute a law prohibiting the free exercise of religion within the meaning of the first amendment.in my view,the defect of lack of neutrality applies primarily to those laws that by their terms impose disabilities on the basis of religion,a law excluding members of a certain sect from public benefits whereas the defect of lack of general applicability applies primarily to those laws which,though neutral in their terms,through their design,construction,or enforcement target the practices of a particular religion for discriminatory treatment 
justice souter also concurred separately,expressing his misgivings over smith,decided before he arrived at the supreme court.t he noncontroversial principle,he said,expressed in smith though established long before,is that the free exercise clause is offended when prohibiting religious exercise results from a law that is not neutral or generally applicable.but as he read smith,he said,its significance is not only in its statement that the free exercise clause requires no more than neutrality and general applicability,but also in its adoption of a particular,narrow conception of neutrality.justice souter continued 
our common notion of neutrality is broad enough to cover not merely what might be called formal neutrality,which as a requirement would only bar laws with an object to discriminate against religion,but also what might be called substantive neutrality,which,in addition to demanding a secular object,would generally require government to accommodate religious differences by exempting religious practices from formally neutral laws.if the free exercise clause secures only protection against deliberate discrimination,a formal requirement will exhaust the clause neutrality command if the free exercise clause,rather,safeguards a right to engage in religious activity free from unnecessary governmental interference,the clause requires substantive,as well as formal,neutrality 
to illustrate his concern,justice souter suggested 
a secular law,applicable to all,that prohibits consumption of alcohol,for example,will affect members of religions that require the use of wine differently from members of other religions and nonbelievers,disproportionately burdening the practice of,say,catholicism or judaism.without an exemption for sacramental wine,prohibition may fail the test of religion neutrality 
the prohibition law in place earlier this century,he noted,did in fact exempt wine for sacramental purposes.free exercise protections,he concluded,extend beyond what he took to be the rule in smith 
rather,we have said,o ur cases have established that t he free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious belief or practice and,if so,whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the burden.
neither the court nor justice scalia responded to justice souter concerns.
lukumi was an easy court was unanimous on the the clear genesis and purpose of the ordinances was to restrict the church sacramental animal sacrifices.as the court summarized the case,the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand,failed to perceive,or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the nation essential commitment to religious freedom.though smith also involved a law restricting a church sacramental practice,its purpose was to prevent drug abuse generally and its enactment was completely unrelated to the church practice.as justice blackmun observed in lukumi,the case would have been much harder if the church had been requesting an exemption from a generally applicable anticruelty law.that hypothetical and justice souter illustrate the difficulties in applying the rule in smith.
heb ministries and amici curiae argue the rule does not apply in this case because subchapter g directly interferes with a religious group education and training of its ministers,activities that are specifically protected by the first amendment.in support of this argument,amici cite a supreme court decision prior to smith that prohibited a court from deciding whether a bishop deposed by his church should be reinstated and state and federal decisions prohibiting suits against churches for employment discrimination but these cases address government interference in selection of the clergy,not in education and training.subchapter g only obliquely affects religious groups selection of their clergy.it may influence students choices in seeking a religious course of study,but it does not prohibit a group from calling a minister who does not hold a degree from a seminary or otherwise limit a group freedom to select whomever it chooses.while subchapter g impact on religious education is direct and undeniable,the authorities cited shed little light on whether it infringes on free exercise rights.assuming that government regulation of clergy selection is prohibited apart from smith,which seems a safe assumption even though smith is silent on the subject,we do not think subchapter g can be so characterized.and though,as we have noted above,the government can not regulate religious education any more than clergy selection the argument here is that subchapter g standards are not constitutionally infirm because they apply to graduate education generally.thus,we decline the invitation to analyze the free exercise issues here apart from smith,although we reiterate that smith made a point of noting that it did not involve the communication of religious beliefs or any communicative activity,which is at the heart of the present case.
accordingly,we turn to the matter of how smith applies,first to section limitation on the use of seminary,and then to section limitation on terms reflecting educational attainment.
undoubtedly,a statute regulating the use of words like church,mosque,and synagogue by groups that do not meet state standards would not be a neutral law of general applicability permissible under smith because the words meanings are exclusively religious and a law regulating their use would thus target religion.the supreme court said as much in lukumi when it concluded that regulation of sacrifice and ritual was consistent with but not conclusive of facial discrimination because those words did not refer exclusively to religious practices implying that if they had,it would have reached the opposite conclusion.
the meaning of seminary is also not exclusively religious.its origin is secular and only metaphorically related to education.derived from the latin semen,meaning seed,seminary once meant a seedbed but later a school,where,figuratively speaking,seeds of knowledge are planted the council of trent of the roman catholic church gave seminaries a distinctly religious cast,compared to other educational institutions like colleges and universities which were also often religious schools,by adopting a method of establishing seminaries for clerics,and of educating the same therein but the church employment of the word did not its meaning.seminaries in the united states were understood to include both secular and religious schools and today,seminary is still defined as a school,not solely a religious school 
primarily,however,seminary is used to refer to a religious school.the coordinating board has not pointed us to a single secular seminary in texas,or even in the united states,for that matter,either at present or in when the legislature amended section to include seminary with college,university,and other institutional names as restricted words.that is not to say there are none at all,but the fact that they are rare describes the context in which the amendment was proposed and adopted.
so does a provision added to the texas constitution in.article i,section prohibits appropriation of public funds for any theological or religious seminary in,we observed that the adjectives theological or religious necessarily give seminary the meaning of a place specifically for the preparation of men for the ministry,or at least,for the teaching of religious doctrines thereby suggesting that the word without the modifiers would not be clearly understood to mean a religious school.but two other aspects of the framers phrasing are worth noting.they obviously recognized that theological or religious and seminary fit together,that it made sense to refer to seminaries as theological or religious because seminaries often were.and they appear to have thought it made more sense than referring to theological or religious colleges or universities,surely not because such institutions were nonexistent,but because the use of seminary alone fully achieved their purpose of banning a ppropriations for sectarian purposes,as the caption stated.the framers choice of words indicates their understanding that seminaries were distinctly,though not exclusively,religious schools.
that same understanding is reflected elsewhere in the education code.in,the legislature created a program to provide eligible,financially needy students with jobs,funded in part by the state of texas eligibility requirements are minimal but a person is specifically ineligible if he or she receives an athletic scholarship or is enrolled in a seminary or other program leading to ordination or licensure to preach for a religious sect or to be a member of a religious order.these are narrow categories,obviously intended to exclude small groups of students.the legislature did not exclude all seminary students from the program,but only those in a religious course of study,and among them,only the ones aspiring to religious service.the language thus suggests that not all seminary education is religious.but it also suggests that the one word seminary fully conveys the idea of religious education,leaving other to include any such programs in colleges,universities,and other institutions.
no legislative history explains the legislature intent in amending section to add seminary to names institutions are restricted in using,but it must have recognized that the amendment would ensure regulation of the kind of religious study and clerical training for which seminaries primarily are known.indeed,it is hard to imagine that the legislature had anything less specific in mind,given that the other additions to the list were specific names for medical and law schools.although the amendment may not have been aimed at religious practices quite as squarely as the ordinances in lukumi,its target was certainly smaller than the general public health protected by the statute in smith.
the coordinating board argues that the amendment did not alter the fact that section is neutral in its purposes of setting high standards for education and prohibiting diploma mills.even if all seminaries were religiously affiliated,the board contends,a seminary education is respected in the secular world and should meet the standards the public expects for graduate education.furthermore,the board notes,religious subjects can be taught in secular programs.sacred texts may be studied as literature,religious history without belief in divine direction,even creeds without a profession of faith,and the same standards should apply as for other programs.but these arguments exaggerate heb ministries contention in this case.heb ministries does not contend that secular education,whether provided by seminaries or other institutions,even in religious subjects,is beyond state regulation it contends only that the state can not regulate the religious education and training of students as part of a religious mission.
the coordinating board insists that section does not violate heb ministries free exercise rights by restricting its use of a single word,seminary,when others are available,like biblical institute,academy,center,school,school of religion,or school of theology.it is not clear that the board reading of the statute is correct.section restricts not only the use of a listed term but also a term having a similar meaning if the meanings of seminary,school,and school of religion are not similar,then the meaning of similar is itself unclear.if the board is wrong and section restricts not only the use of seminary but any other word of related import,then the statute denies a religious school that does not meet state standards all access to names used by such schools.and if the board is right,the statute nevertheless limits access to the name that,unlike all others available,distinctly describes religious schools.either way,the statute,in its application to schools offering only religious instruction,targets religious practices,discriminating between those that comply with state standards from those that do not,and is not merely a neutral regulation of education.
a law restrictive of religious practice must advance interests of the highest order and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.we have found only one other state that regulates use of the word seminary as subchapter g does the coordinating board tells us the state has a strong interest in ensuring that seminaries are in fact genuine places of study and academic learning.with respect to religious courses of study,we think the state has no such interest at all and is in fact incapable of determining what is genuine religious study and learning and what is not.the board argues that to exclude seminaries from the state regulation of education would seriously undermine its effectiveness,but heb ministries does not argue for so broad an exclusion.it contends only that a school religious programs need not meet state standards before it can call itself a seminary.none of the instances of diploma mills fraud on the public cited by the board involves such programs.in sum,the board has failed to show that the state has any interest in restricting use of the word seminary by schools offering religious instruction,let alone an interest of the highest order.
accordingly,we conclude that section restriction on the use of the name seminary by schools offering only religious programs of study violates the free exercise guarantees of the first amendment and the texas constitution.
heb ministries does not challenge the state authority to require that a private postsecondary educational institution meet prescribed standards before it can grant degrees,which is what section does,but contends that section defines degree so broadly that a school is effectively left with no words to describe educational attainment.for religious study programs,heb ministries asserts,this pressure to comply with subchapter g standards governing a school operation and curriculum content violates the free exercise clause.
the first premise of heb ministries constitutional complaint is correct.section casts a wide net,defining degree to include not only the designations associate,bachelor,master,and doctor,but their equivalents,as well as any title or designation,mark,abbreviation,appellation,or series of letters or words which signifies,purports to signify,or is generally taken to signify satisfactory completion of the requirements of all or part of a program of study leading to a degree or its equivalent.the last clause forms a linguistic möbius strip a degree is not only anything that could possibly signify a degree,but also the equivalent of anything that could possibly signify a degree,which includes the equivalent of,and so on.the coordinating board suggests in its brief that the definition excludes four terms,certificate,advanced certificate,diploma,and higher diploma,but those exceptions are nowhere to be found in subchapter g or in the board regulations.the board offers no explanation why they alone do not signify,do not purport to signify,and are not generally taken to signify a degree or its equivalents,and no explanation is apparent,especially in the context of this case.heb ministries was fined for awarding two certificates and four diplomas in biblical studies because the commissioner concluded that tyndale alleged that completed courses could be applied toward a degree.heb ministries was fined another for awarding two diplomas in christian studies because the commissioner found that tyndale would accept them for admission to more advanced study in what it called master programs.not one of these eight awards was called a degree or designated associate,bachelor,master,or doctor or otherwise seems to have signified a degree.
we realize we must construe statutes to avoid constitutional problems when we can but we can not create exceptions where none appears to exist.it is hardly surprising,of course,that degree is defined broadly the purpose of subchapter g is to ensure compliance,not to provide a safe haven for noncompliant schools.even if the definition of degree admits exceptions,the use of any words remotely resembling ordinary educational terminology is risky.a violation of section carries criminal,civil,and administrative liability if subchapter g does not actually restrict all terminology ordinarily used to mark educational attainment,it effectively does so.
the second premise of heb ministries complaint is also correct section prohibition against granting degrees,defined to include all useful terminology,strongly encourages,to the point of coercion,compliance with standards set by the coordinating board.again,this is hardly surprising.subchapter g is designed to ensure that private schools operating in texas meet prescribed standards.if it were easier for a school not to comply,the statute effectiveness would be impaired.the board insists that compliance is voluntary,by which it means that it is possible for a school to refuse,but the consequences of refusal are severe.
we come,then,to the issue of whether this state regulation of the terminology used in recognizing student attainment,as applied to religious educational programs,violates the free exercise clause.the coordinating board argues that because the regulation does not target religious programs,but applies to secular and religious programs alike,it is a neutral law of general applicability that,according to the rule in smith,does not impact free exercise rights.this argument,we think,focuses too narrowly on the concepts of neutrality and general applicability,separate from the first amendment concerns they are meant to help analyze,and reduces them to a rule that a regulation is permitted as long as it is universal.justice souter hypothetical involving prohibition and the eucharist illustrates the fallacy in such a rule a law is not neutral or generally applicable for purposes of applying the free exercise clause merely because it affects everyone it is important how religion is affected differently because it is religion.this concern is critical when the law affects communication,as the supreme court plainly implied in smith by reemphasizing that the law there had no such effect 
standards for the content of educational instruction are not neutral with regard to religious studies merely because they also apply to secular studies,as the standards under subchapter g plainly show.academic freedom,for example,which the coordinating board standards require,has no more than a limited role,and perhaps no place at all,in a school whose mission is to advance the doctrinal tenets of a specific faith.study in general subjects outside a student major,a desirable requirement for a liberal arts education,may be considered a distraction or worse by someone preparing for the ministry or other religious service.these are but two examples.a secular educator meat may be a religious educator poison,and vice versa.standards that improve the quality of secular education while impairing sectarian education discriminate against religion.the coordinating board argues that its standards benefit religious education,but that is a judgment call the first amendment does not permit the state to make in any event,the board argues,the intent is to benefit all educational programs.but while we can easily assume this to be true,we must also consider the effect of the standards on schools like tyndale with a religious mission.the board argues that section regulates only the granting of degrees,something that is well within the state authority,not how religious subjects are taught.but the statute prohibition on granting degrees is so pervasive that its effect is necessarily coercive,as indeed it is intended to be.
in the sense that section is directed to a problem,diploma abuse,that did not originate in or have any distinct association with any religious practice,the statute more closely resembles the drug law upheld in smith than the animal sacrifice ordinances struck down in lukumi.but section strongly encourages compliance with state educational standards,which in turn affect the content and operation of religious educational programs,and in that sense,the statute not only differs from the laws in both cases,it affects the communication of religious beliefs against which smith pointedly warned we therefore conclude that the free exercise clause requires that it must advance interests of the highest order and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.
the compelling interest standard that we apply once a law fails to meet the smith requirements is not water ed down but really means what it says.the legislature has identified the state interests as prevent ing deception of the public resulting from the conferring and use of fraudulent or substandard college and university degrees,regulation by law of the evidences of college and university educational attainment,and protection of legitimate institutions and of those holding degrees from them amici curiae argue that these interests are hardly compelling when the public can easily protect itself with relatively simple inquiries into the credentials of an educational institution and its graduates.but the coordinating board insists that d egree mills continue to be a serious worldwide problem.the board points to various articles and studies chronicling instances of harm caused by bogus academic credentials.the stipulated record on which this case was submitted in the trial court contains no evidence regarding the importance of the state interests in subchapter 
we do not doubt the importance of the state interests,but we nevertheless conclude that section is not narrowly tailored to pursue those interests and avoid unnecessary interference with religious studies.the board has not identified any instance of diploma fraud involving religious programs,or any complaint that an award of a diploma in religious studies did not represent the expected academic achievement.thus,it is not clear that the purpose of subchapter g would be impaired in any way if religious programs were exempted altogether.at the very least,section restrictions on all terminology relating to degrees need not be so pervasive for religious programs.the board worries that any exception for religious schools might violate the establishment clause,but heb ministries does not argue that religious institutions offering secular education programs should be exempt from state standards.amici argue that the state interest would be fully served by requiring noncompliant institutions to disclose their lack of accreditation,even on academic award certificates.the board does not argue that this,too,would raise first amendment concerns but asserts only that it would be ineffective.it has not,however,provided support for its assertion.
the board cites cases by the supreme courts of new jersey and tennessee upholding state regulation of graduate schools against challenges by religious institutions.in the new jersey case,shelton college,which we have already discussed,a religious school that offered both secular and religious instruction argued that state regulation of religious schools violated the first amendment the court held that the free exercise clause did not require a blanket exemption of religious schools from state regulation but as we have said,the regulation was not as pervasive as subchapter g,and shelton college did not limit its argument to its religious programs.in tennessee ex rel.mclemore clarksville school of theology,the tennessee supreme court upheld broad state regulation of a theological school that trained only ministers,offered no secular courses,and granted only theological degrees we respectfully disagree with that court decision.
finally,in an opinion the board does not cite,the texas attorney general addressed whether subchapter g would violate the free exercise clause as applied to a university that offered only religious instruction relying heavily on the shelton college decision,and without expressing a view on whether the statute burdened free exercise rights,the opinion concluded that a court would conclude that subchapter g and the regulations adopted thereunder by the coordinating board,as a general matter are the least restrictive means of achieving the state interest in maintaining the integrity of the postsecondary degrees and protecting its citizens from fraud and misleading representations.we respectfully disagree 
accordingly,we conclude that section restriction on the words that a religious institution may use to refer to completion of religious programs of study is so broad that it violates the free exercise guarantees of the first amendment and the texas constitution.the state may not deny a religious program of study clearly denominated as such the use of all words capable of describing educational achievement.as we have said,heb ministries does not complain of the statute restriction on the use of the word degree,and we do not consider whether it is permissible.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court to vacate its injunction and award of penalties,to consider heb ministries application for attorney fees and for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
the board imposed a civil penalty against tyndale for illegally issuing degrees.tyndale chose not to appeal that administrative penalty or the board findings.instead,heb ministries and two unrelated bible institute and hispanic bible a facial constitutional attack on portions of the education code.specifically,heb ministries and its sought a declaration that sections and of the education code violated rights guaranteed by the due process,free speech,establishment,and free exercise clauses of both the united states and texas constitutions.both the trial court and the court of appeals concluded that the statute regulating the issuance of degrees did not violate heb ministries constitutional rights.today,however,a majority of the differing otherwise.because the statute does not unconstitutionally impinge on heb ministries freedom of speech or rights guaranteed by the establishment clause and the free exercise clause,i respectfully dissent.i agree with the court that section restriction on the use of the name seminary by schools offering only religious programs of study violates the free exercise clause,and i concur in that portion of the court judgment 
establishment clause 
i agree with justice wainwright that this case is more appropriately analyzed under the free exercise clause than the establishment clause.the establishment clause forbids any law respecting an establishment of religion.const.amend.i.in state corpus christi people baptist church,we held that an establishment clause challenge to a statute permitting state licensing and regulation of facilities,as applied to facilities,was misplaced.we observed 
the establishment clause cases address the issue of whether some form of government aid,either direct or indirect,to a religious institution violates the establishment clause.
unlike the traditional establishment clause cases,this case involves government regulation of a institution which is part of the church ministry.this distinction is important for two reasons.first,to accept the church argument and invalidate the licensing and regulatory scheme because of excessive entanglements would create a dilemma in applying the establishment clause test the second prong would be at odds with the third.requiring nonreligious childcare facilities to comply with the state licensing and regulatory scheme while exempting religious facilities would result in unequal state treatment of the two classes of institutions.this unequal treatment could,arguably,be impermissible under the of the establishment clause test because the primary effect would be to advance religion.
second,state licensing and regulation is a type of entanglement that differs from the entanglement discussed in the traditional establishment clause cases.in those cases,the state must examine and determine what programs are religious and what programs are secular to ensure that government aid reaches only the nonreligious ones.in our case,the state regulatory scheme prohibits inquiry into the religious content of the homes curriculum.the purpose of these regulations is to assure that all facilities,secular and nonsecular,meet certain minimum standards in areas such as financial solvency,ratio,nutrition and medical care.
people baptist church,at citations omitted.we concluded that the licensing requirement did not offend the establishment clause and noted that a more appropriate and direct means of questioning the constitutionality of this government regulation is through the free exercise clause.id.at.
such is the case here.as in people baptist,requiring nonreligious institutes to comply with the accreditation scheme while exempting religious institutions would result in unequal treatment of the two,an impermissible advancement of religion under the second prong of the lemon test.cutter wilkinson,d noting that an accommodation for religious observance must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests jimmy swaggart ministries bd.of equalization,d noting the irony that exempting religious activities from tax,as plaintiffs requested,would require the state to engage in the arguably impermissible task of determining which expenditures were religious and which were secular.moreover,this case involves state regulation,not aid.the regulatory oversight at issue here is designed to ensure that all educational and secular with minimum educational standards for issuing degrees.subchapter g governs a secular matter the creation of a system that recognizes certain types of educational achievement.accreditation signals not the approval of the school message,but a certification that the institution meets a variety of educational standards,and any or apply for authorization to issue degrees.accordingly,as in people baptist,a more appropriate and direct means of challenging the constitutionality of this regulation is through the free exercise clause.people baptist,at.
even if the establishment clause were implicated,however,the statutory scheme here passes muster.
under lemon,a government practice is constitutional if it has a secular purpose its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion and it does not excessively entangle the government with religion.
williams lara.the plurality concedes that the accrediting statute has a secular purpose and that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion.instead,the plurality concludes that it is beyond serious dispute that the statute clearly and excessively entangles the government in matters of religious instruction.at.
in agostini felton,the supreme court noted that lemon excessive entanglement prong was more properly analyzed as a subset of the second prong whether the regulation primary effect advanced or inhibited religion.agostini,d.the court also noted that n ot all entanglements,of course,have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion,and that because i nteraction between church and state is inevitable,e ntanglement must be excessive before it runs afoul of the establishment clause.id.at.
at least one state court has explored the contours of this inevitable interaction between church and state in a context similar to ours.as the plurality notes and respectfully disagrees with,the tennessee supreme court upheld broad state regulation of a religious school that issued only religious degrees.state clarksville school of theology.the court reasoning is instructive 
the tennessee statute places neither a direct nor indirect burden upon the free exercise of religion by the defendants nor threatens an entanglement between the affairs of church and state t he act does not regulate the beliefs,practices or teachings of any institution it merely sets forth minimum standards which must be met in order for an institution to be authorized to issue degrees.moreover,the evidence shows that the granting of degrees is a purely secular activity.it is only this activity that brings the school under the regulation of the act.
the school can choose to not comply with the act and yet may continue to train ministers as it chooses such with the act will simply prohibit the school from granting degrees.
id.at see also state bd.of higher educ.bd.of dirs.of shelton college,rejecting establishment clause challenge to a statute regulating education,as there was no excessive entanglement between church and state.
similarly,the regulations here,while comprehensive,are entirely voluntary and do not purport to interfere with the parochial mission of any school.see,roemer.public works,d plurality op.determining that contacts between state and colleges for purposes of administering aid program are not likely to be any more entangling than the inspections and audits incident to the normal process of the colleges accreditations by the state.the plurality contends that t here is no special provision for religious instruction,and not only is the board given no discretion to treat such education differently than secular education,it has given no indication that it would be willing to do so if it could.at.but the statute,as well as the coordinating board accompanying regulations,expressly permit religious institutions to be certified without meeting the standard qualifications for accreditation.section e provides 
if,after a effort,an institution can not achieve accreditation within the period of time prescribed by the board,the institution may appeal for extension of eligibility for certification because of having been denied accreditation due to policies of the institution based on religious beliefs or other good and sufficient cause as defined by the board.the board shall consider the application of any accreditation standard that prohibited accreditation of the institution on the basis of religious policies practiced by the institution as a prima facie justification for extending the eligibility for certification if all other standards of the board are satisfied.
e emphasis added during the relevant time,the pertinent regulations provided 
if the board determines that an institution has been unable to achieve accreditation by a recognized agency on the basis of religious policies practiced by the institution,the board will consider the institution eligible to apply for a certificate of authority,provided that all other standards are met at the level of accreditation and that such religious institutions shall be eligible to grant degrees of a religious nature only.
admin.code d that tyndale has steadfastly refused,at,to participate in any of these alternate processes does not make them any less available,and we should not invalidate the statutes merely because they may be amenable to an unconstitutional application.shelton college,at see also roemer,at.noting that i t has not been the court practice,in considering facial challenges to statutes of this kind,to strike them down in anticipation that particular applications may result in unconstitutional actions.
the plurality concludes that the state regulations on violate the establishment clause because allowing some religious institutions those that meet accreditation requirements to grant degrees while forbidding others to do so clearly effectuate s a state preference for one model of religious education over others,a preference that the establishment clause does not permit.at.the plurality asserts that i t is hard to imagine a more active involvement in religious training than by determining whether it meets the comprehensive standards set by the coordinating board,and equally hard to imagine a more direct state sponsorship of religious education than by indicating in every institution name and on every academic award whether the state approves the programs of study.id.at emphasis added.if this is indeed the case,the logical implication is that the state can not accredit any religious colleges or universities that offer degrees in any religious discipline as such accreditation would also appear to run afoul of the establishment clause as an impermissible preference under the plurality analysis.nor,it seems to me,could the state regulate or license religious institutions operating in other spheres,broadcasting stations.further,the plurality analysis would seem to apply to invalidate state regulation of marriage or adoption,if that regulation was inconsistent with the tenets of a particular religion.the state can regulate in these areas,as i believe it can regulate the issuance of degrees,because allowing religious institutions to participate in secular regulatory schemes simply does not violate the establishment clause.
the supreme court rejected a similar argument in bob jones university united states,a case in which bob jones university contended,among other arguments,that denying it a tax exemption violated the establishment clause by preferring religions whose tenets did not require racial discrimination over those that believed racial intermixing was forbidden.bob jones,d.the court held that 
i t is well settled that neither a state nor the federal government may pass laws which prefer one religion over another,but it is equally true that a regulation does not violate the establishment clause merely because it happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions.the irs policy at issue here is founded on a neutral,secular basis,and does not violate the establishment clause.in addition,the uniform application of the rule to all religiously operated schools avoids the necessity for a potentially entangling inquiry into whether a racially restrictive practice is the result of a sincere religious belief.
id.at.citations and internal quotations omitted.i agree with that analysis and would hold that subchapter g,similarly,is founded on a neutral,secular basis and does not violate the establishment clause.
free exercise clause 
i also agree with justice wainwright that subchapter g does not violate the free exercise clause.indeed,the plurality extended analysis is inappropriate because heb ministries does not maintain that the conduct in which it is prohibited from engaging the issuance of degrees and similar documents is religiously motivated.as the supreme court explained in united states lee,the preliminary inquiry in determining the existence of a constitutionally required exemption from a neutral law of general application under the free exercise clause is whether compliance with the law violates the challengers religious beliefs and thus interferes with their free exercise rights.united states lee,d.the cases cited by the plurality affirm this rule.in employment division smith,the law at issue forbade the religiously motivated use of peyote in church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah the law prohibited the ritual sacrifice of animals demanded by the santeria religion even in shelton,the new jersey supreme court case,the plaintiff college alleged that state accreditation was inconsistent with the bible command that it reject state licensure 
by contrast here,heb ministries is not claiming that accreditation violates any religious principles.heb ministries does not contend that its religious tenets require its graduates to hold documents the general public would likely confuse with degrees granted by accredited colleges.heb ministries does not allege that there is any religious significance to degree,bachelor,or similar terms.moreover,the state has not prohibited tyndale from describing accurately its graduates achievements.to give but one example,subchapter g would not prohibit a religious institution from issuing a document certifying that john doe has completed an advanced course of study in x and is qualified to minister in y church.
even assuming that a prohibition on the issuance of degrees or similarly worded documents violated heb ministries religious beliefs,its free exercise claims would fail because the coordinating board would maintain the right to ensure educational standards.as justice scalia,writing for the court,noted in employment division smith,the supreme court has never held that an individual religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate.smith.the only exceptions to this rule have involved not the free exercise clause alone,but the free exercise clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,such as the protection of freedom of speech.id.at.
thus,in order to arrive at the conclusion that subchapter g violates the free exercise clause,the plurality engages in a strained reading of the record and the case the statute as restricting the communication of religious beliefs such that the state must have a compelling interest and must tailor its accreditation scheme narrowly.the plurality would implement this heightened scrutiny when the law affects communication.at emphasis added.but the smith court used the word regulate in discussing this line of cases and a careful examination of precedent reveals a much higher level of state involvement necessary to implicate the freedom of speech analysis.the examples of hybrid freedom of speech and free exercise decisions cited in smith involved a discretionary licensing system for religious solicitation,requiring the state to determine whether a given cause was religious and a flat tax on solicitation as applied to dissemination of religious ideas 
the regulations that were struck down under a hybrid analysis directly limited religious communication.in contrast,tyndale and similar institutions are free under subchapter g to say and teach whatever they wish without government are merely barred from issuing a degree misrepresenting the nature of the education they choose to provide.despite assertions to the contrary subchapter g can not fairly be construed as so pervasively,or even substantially,affecting communications as to trigger strict scrutiny,and,thus,even if heb ministries conduct were religiously motivated,subchapter g would not violate the free exercise clause.
free speech 
i disagree with justice wainwright contention,however,that the state may only regulate degrees and not associated terminology like the terms associate,bachelor,master,and doctorate.justice wainwright would hold that the state may regulate a single that all other regulations violate the united states constitution.this distinction overlooks the significance of the terminology used to connote educational achievement.words like bachelor,master,and doctorate have acquired meanings that permit them to stand on their own,even absent the noun degree they are generally understood to modify.when these absolute adjectives are used as marks of educational attainment,they represent the conferment of degrees and permit,as here,an unaccredited institution graduates to overstate their credentials.
additionally,justice wainwright concurrence goes beyond the protections heb ministries itself sought.heb ministries has conceded that diplomas in secular disciplines are subject to state regulation.it asserts only that diplomas awarded in religious disciplines are exempt.but if the statute violated the first amendment free speech guarantee,any religiously affiliated or be permitted to award the equivalent of doctorates,master,bachelor,and associate degrees,in any academic discipline.imagine a doctor of engineering,who received his degree from an unaccredited school,hired by the state to inspect and repair bridges.westbrook penley,holding that tort liability would impinge upon matters of church governance,in violation of the first amendment,but noting that neither the respondent nor the public health or safety were at issue.
such a holding would strip the board of authority to regulate diploma mills,the very evil the legislature sought to control through the regulatory scheme set forth in the education code.see.as the legislature noted in enacting the statute 
it is the policy and purpose of the state of texas to prevent deception of the public resulting from the conferring and use of fraudulent or substandard college and university degrees it is also the purpose of this subchapter to regulate the use of academic terminology in naming or otherwise designating educational institutions,the advertising,solicitation or representation by educational institutions or their agents,and the maintenance and preservation of essential academic records.because degrees and equivalent indicators of educational attainment are used by employers in judging the training of prospective employees,by public and private professional groups in determining qualifications for admission to and continuance of practice,and by the general public in assessing the competence of persons engaged in a wide range of activities necessary to the general welfare,regulation by law of the evidences of college and university educational attainment is in the public interest.to the same end the protection of legitimate institutions and of those holding degrees from them is also in the public interest.
justice wainwright correctly recognizes that the speech at issue is commercial speech.as such,it occupies one of the lowest rungs on the first amendment hierarchy,enjoying only a limited measure of protection,commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of first amendment values,and is subject to modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression.bd.of trustees fox,d quoting ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d.commercial speech does no more than propose a commercial transaction and may be freely regulated.pittsburgh press pittsburgh comm on human relations,d.
in central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d,the supreme court outlined its method of analyzing the lawfulness of restrictions on commercial speech 
in commercial speech cases,then,a analysis has developed.at the outset,we must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.
in this case,justice wainwright cites but misapplies the central hudson test by excising its first prong.because heb ministries speech is misleading commercial speech,it is not protected by the first amendment.thompson states med,d.as the central hudson court noted,there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity.the government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it central hudson,at.emphasis added.thus,the government may freely regulate commercial speech that is misleading,florida bar went for it,d citations omitted,and the remaining central hudson factors apply only if the speech is not misleading.
the record in this case leaves little doubt that heb ministries speech was misleading.the program from tyndale june commencement exercises lists various headings,such as doctor of philosophy,doctor of theology,doctor of ministries,master of theology,master of arts,bachelor level diploma of theological studies,and associate of biblical studies.beneath each heading are the names of students who had completed those courses of study.the course catalog nowhere states that tyndale does not offer degrees,and the catalog in fact conveys the opposite impression.it features department heads and faculty members who identify themselves as doctors,even though they have only diplomas from tyndale,an institution without a certificate of authority issued by the coordinating board.faculty members use the familiar abbreviations for degrees,such as and.even though they do not have actual degrees.in its advertising materials,tyndale boasted that its g raduates are receiving professional pay increases with tyndale diplomas,a sign of recognition and acknowledgement.moreover,the board found that tyndale awarded degrees,and heb ministries did not appeal that determination.
because misleading commercial speech may be freely regulated,heb ministries free speech claim must fail,and the court need not reach the remaining central hudson factors.but even if the speech were not misleading,the statute easily satisfies the other central hudson requirements.as the court recognizes and heb ministries does not dispute,the state interest here is substantial.diploma mills are an ongoing problem,made more prevalent by the advent of the internet.see,roger cramer,managing director,general accounting office,testimony before the senate committee on governmental affairs,diploma mills federal employees have obtained degrees from diploma mills and other unaccredited schools,some at government expense may,may,all internet materials as visited august,and available in clerk of court case file noting that some federal employees,including employees responsible for emergency operations at the national nuclear security administration,had obtained degrees from diploma mills and other unaccredited schools.sues college that gave cat an mba,describing alleged texas diploma mill that,in exchange for,awarded an mba to a cat in pennsylvania press release,texas office of attorney general,attorney general abbott gets judgment against brothers who operated fraudulent dallas diploma mill,id describing judgment obtained against trinity southern university,which awarded bachelor master,and doctorate degrees based only on students testimony about life experiences.
because the state interest is substantial,central hudson other factors come into play whether the regulation directly advances the state interest,and whether the regulatory technique is in proportion to that interest.cent.hudson,at.as the supreme court has noted,however,the constitution does not require the narrowest possible restriction 
what our decisions require is a fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,a fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but,as we have put it in the other contexts discussed above,a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.within those bounds we leave it to governmental decisionmakers to judge what manner of regulation may best be employed.
bd of trs.fox,d citations omitted.
here,the statute represents a reasonable means of accomplishing the legislature ends.justice wainwright concludes that a disclaimer would better inform the public about tyndale students educational accomplishments than would compliance with the statute thus,he concludes that the state has not carried its burden of showing that its regulation of this commercial speech directly advances its interest because the regulation is more extensive than necessary to serve the legislature legitimate purposes.at.but merely because the state has not chosen the narrowest means to achieve its objective does not mean the statute is unconstitutional.as fox recognized,the state need only demonstrate a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.fox,at.the education code satisfies those requirements.the statutory requirements here do not diminish commercial speech but merely ensure its accuracy.see friedman rogers,d noting that r ather than stifling commercial speech,the statute at issue ensures that information regarding optometrical services will be communicated more fully and accurately to consumers than it had been in the past.while a disclaimer may also fulfill that goal,the absence of such a requirement does not render the statute unconstitutional.
justice wainwright warns that the statute coopts virtually every term that could reasonably provide a useful description of educational achievement at a postsecondary educational institution.at.i disagree.the statute prohibits use of only those terms that signif y,purport to,or are generally taken to signify satisfactory completion of the requirements of a program of study leading to an associate,bachelor,master,or doctor degree or its equivalent.thus,as the state correctly contends,tyndale may issue diplomas or certificates without running afoul of the statute,as long as it does not claim that they are equivalent to associate,bachelor,master,or doctor degrees.
justice wainwright would permit partial state regulation of a single word degree while allowing an institution to represent that its diplomas are indistinguishable from valid degrees.a graduate of one of these unaccredited institutions may now proudly display a framed diploma that says abc institute has conferred on john doe the designation doctor of medicine which is equivalent to a doctoral degree.justice wainwright proposed holding would strip the board of its ability to regulate institutions of higher learning.diploma mills would stand on equal footing with accredited institutions,and consumers would have no assurance that their professor,engineer,counselor,or chemist graduated from an institution that satisfied the legislature minimum requirements for accreditation.
conclusion 
because the statute permissibly regulates commercial speech,and because it presents no establishment clause or free exercise clause violation,i respectfully dissent from the part of the court judgment that concludes otherwise.i would reverse the court of appeals judgment relating to the use of the term seminary and would render judgment for the petitioners on that issue.i would affirm the remainder of the judgment.
today the court reaffirms the sacred principle that americans have a fundamental right to their religious beliefs.the united states constitution prohibits the government from interfering with this liberty,as the state has no authority to regulate religious beliefs.i concur in the court result on all issues decided,some for different reasons,except one.i agree that the government can not dictate whether private religious institutions may call themselves seminaries as the term admits primarily a religious connotation.because the training of clerics and teaching of religious doctrines at religious institutions is inherent to religious beliefs,the state also can not license clerics or regulate their training.i also agree that the government may not preclude religious institutions from employing virtually any useful terminology to describe the postsecondary educational achievements of their students,but i would hold,contrary to the plurality,that the state,within constitutional limits,may require private educational institutions to comply with minimum educational criteria before they may confer postsecondary degrees on their students.a holding that the legislature is barred by the constitution from setting minimum standards for the issuance of college and graduate degrees by religious institutions,establishes a constitutional right for one type of institution to issue postsecondary degrees regardless of compliance with public standards.this holding precludes the legislature from considering permissible alternatives,such as allowing religious institutions to issue college degrees with appropriate disclosures on their graduation documents indicating that their degrees are not from programs if,for example,they do not include required minimum study in mathematics,science,humanities,written communication,basic computer instruction,or other subjects.this would permanently tie the hands of the legislature,precluding it from considering constitutionally permissible alternatives so that it may concurrently protect religious freedom while ensuring that all private postsecondary degrees from texas institutions represent meaningful educational achievement.the religion clauses of the first amendment of the constitution do not compel this result.the plurality logic goes astray in melding the act of issuing a postsecondary graduation document with the absolute right to religious beliefs,and fails to recognize that the legislature ensuring that all postsecondary degrees are meaningful designations is not an improper targeting of tyndale religious beliefs.the government may not under the constitution dictate which religious institutions call themselves seminaries,whom they may hire to teach and what curriculum they may teach,but calling a graduation document a bachelor degree,instead of a bachelor certificate,is not an issue of religious beliefs,notwithstanding tyndale attempt to conflate the two.i also concur with the plurality,for different reasons,that religious institutions have the right to accurately label their graduation documents,as the free speech clause of the constitution precludes the state from broadly barring private postsecondary institutions from using virtually all terminology that reasonably describes the educational attainment of their students.
background 
petitioner heb ministries,is a texas corporation and orthodox christian church that operates,as one of its ministries,the tyndale theological seminary and bible institute tyndale provides undergraduate and graduate level education to students in ecclesiastical subjects such as theology,apologetics,and christian studies,and also provides courses such as english grammar,composition,and ancient world history.the texas higher education coordinating board fined tyndale for using terms protected by the education code in its name and for issuing some graduation documents to its graduates which,while not using the protected term degree,are advertised by tyndale as equivalent to a degree or as satisfying part of a postsecondary degree program.
the board fined tyndale for using the term seminary in violation of section a of the education code for doctrinal reasons and fear of jeopardizing its ecclesiastical rights,tyndale did not seek a temporary certificate of authority from the board,nor accreditation from a accrediting agency tyndale now argues that the standards required for accreditation or a certificate of authority are impermissibly intrusive.see.admin.code.for example,tyndale claims that the regulation regarding faculty qualifications would prohibit reverend billy graham,mother teresa,the apostles,and a jewish carpenter born in a manger from teaching at the institution.
the board also fined tyndale for purportedly issuing degrees as statutorily violation of section of the education code.section prohibits private postsecondary institutions from granting degrees without first obtaining a certificate of authority from the board or becoming accredited by a accrediting agency.see also id.a exempting accredited institutions.degree is broadly defined as 
any title or designation,mark,abbreviation,appellation,or series of letters or words,including associate,bachelor,master,doctor,and their equivalents,which signifies,purports to,or is generally taken to signify satisfactory completion of the requirements of all or part of a program of study leading to an associate,bachelor,master,or doctor degree or its equivalent.
id.none of the documents awarded by tyndale at its graduation were actually titled degree,but the board alleges that tyndale used terminology on the documents and in brochure descriptions that bring the documents within the broad definition of degree in section.though not evident from the statutory language,the board now concedes that issuing diplomas or certificates,without the protected words or brochure descriptions,is not a violation of section.
in response to the board fines,tyndale filed this lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that applicable sections of the texas education code are unconstitutional under the free speech,free exercise,and establishment clauses of the first amendment of the united states constitution,and under the freedom of worship clause in article i,section of the texas constitution.both tyndale and the board filed motions for summary judgment.in its ruling on these motions,the trial court upheld the fines assessed against tyndale for granting degrees,under section,but vacated the fine for tyndale use of the term seminary,under section a,holding that the state regulation of that term violated the first amendment of the united states constitution and article i,sections,and of the texas constitution.
the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment allowing unregulated use of the term seminary and rejected tyndale free exercise,establishment clause,and free speech challenges.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment with respect to the granting of degrees,holding that section does not violate the establishment clause,the free exercise clause,or tyndale right to free speech.id.at.

the united states constitution protects the free exercise of religion from undue state infringement.const.amend i,cl,amend xiv,cantwell connecticut.see also.const.art.i,the free exercise clause of the first amendment protects religious freedom by ensuring that the freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute.braunfeld brown,d.this was reiterated in employment division smith,where the supreme court held that the first amendment obviously excludes all governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such,d quoting sherbert verner,at.the first issue is whether the statutes at issue regulate religious beliefs 
state regulation of the term seminary 
section a of the texas education code requires that all private postsecondary educational institutions in texas must submit to state regulation in order to call themselves seminaries.specifically,section a provides 
unless the institution has been issued a certificate of authority under this subchapter,a person may not use the term college,university,seminary,school of medicine,medical school,health science center,school of law,law school,or law center in the official name or title of a nonexempt private postsecondary educational institution or describe an institution using a term listed in subdivision or a term having a similar meaning.
a.to comply with this section of the education code,tyndale must submit to standards.see.admin.code.tyndale complains that such state regulation violates its rights under the free exercise clause.
the state contends that its regulation of the term seminary is neutral and generally applicable,and thus permissible under smith.i disagree.the state does not have the authority to determine whether a private postsecondary educational institution that professes a sincere faith may call itself a seminary.see smith,at.hernandez commissioner,d.requiring religious organizations to submit to state regulation in order to call themselves seminaries is at odds with the free exercise clause of the first amendment of the united states constitution.
the board argued in its briefing that the term seminary is not an exclusively religious one,and the court of appeals apparently agreed.at.the board contended,citing church bullock,that a seminary is a place of education and only departs from this secular meaning when the adjectives theological or religious are placed in front of it to take on the meaning of a place specifically for the preparation of men for the ministry,or at least,for the teaching of religious doctrines.in postsubmission briefing,the board acknowledged that seminary is a religious term but asserts that the term also conveys a secular meaning.
statutory interpretation begins with the plain and common meaning of the statute words.mcintyre ramirez.as enacted in,section a only included the terms college and university.act of may,ch.laws.the legislature added the term seminary in,along with the terms school of medicine,medical school,health science center,school of law,law school,and law center.act of may,ch.laws.if seminary has a predominantly secular meaning,as the board contends,there is no reason for the legislature to add it to the list of protected terms,as the addition would only repeat the statute reference to other secular educational institutions.we presume that each word in the statute has meaning and that the legislature added seminary to the statute to include within the scope of the statute entities that were not covered by other terms.see perkins state.the inclusion of seminary added religious institutions to the scope of the statute.
in addition,this court has pondered the meaning of this word before.this court reasoned in bullock that 
a seminary is a place of education specifically a school for the education of men for the priesthood or ministry.a seminary being a place of education,the adjectives theological or religious necessarily give to it the meaning of a place specifically for the preparation of men for the ministry,or at least,for the teaching of religious doctrines.the words are commonly so used.
at quoting am.eng.ency.law.in that case,this court did not hold that it was only when combined with the words religious or theological that the word seminary took on the meaning proposed by heb ministries in this case.see id.seminary has a primarily religious connotation,and when combined with the word theological,as in tyndale theological seminary,it has an exclusively religious meaning.
the court of appeals relied,in part,on the definition of seminary given in black law dictionary a n educational institution,such as a college,academy,or other school.black law dictionary ed.webster dictionary,however,defines the same term as an institution for the training of candidates for the priesthood,ministry,or rabbinate.webster third new international dictionary.even the board acknowledges that tyndale avowed purpose is to train ministers to work in churches.in the context and usage of the statute,the word seminary included in the state statutory scheme refers to institutions that provide religious education,instruction,and training.
the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that,in some circumstances,a seminary qualifies as a church for purposes of the ministerial exception.eeoc sw.baptist theological seminary,cir.in southwestern baptist,the court observed that the defendant seminary was an integral part of a church,essential to the paramount function of training ministers who will continue the faith.id.the court also held that the seminary faculty qualified as ministers for purposes of the exception because the faculty members were intermediaries between the southern baptist convention and the future ministers of many local baptist churches.id.while seminarian policies and philosophies will differ among institutions,see,eeoc,cir,southwestern baptist is instructive because it recognizes that seminaries often function similarly to churches or other organized congregations.the board acknowledges that tyndale purpose is to train ministers to work in churches.furthermore,their faculty members may well be akin to church clergy in addition to providing general educational instruction on secular subjects.
i conclude,as does the court,that the word seminary admits a primarily religious meaning,and now consider whether,consistent with the free exercise clause,the state may dictate which institutions may call themselves seminaries.
the supreme court has espoused a spirit of freedom for religious organizations,an independence from secular control or manipulation,in short,power to decide for themselves,free from state interference,matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.kedroff nicholas cathedral of the russian orthodox church in.declaring unconstitutional a state law that granted ownership of church property to the american branch of the russian orthodox church.this spirit of freedom is reflected in many of the court decisions regarding state interference in the internal affairs of churches and religious organizations.see,nlrb catholic bishop of chicago,d gonzalez roman catholic archbishop of manila.
in,the supreme court refused to decide whether an individual was qualified to be a chaplain in the roman catholic church.gonzalez,at.because the appointment is a canonical act,it is the function of the church authorities to determine what the essential qualifications of a chaplain are and whether the candidate possesses them.id.
in catholic bishop of chicago,the supreme court considered whether schools were subject to the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board nlrb.at.although the court ultimately concluded that congress did not intend to include schools within the purview of the national labor relations act,the court admonished that such an exercise of jurisdiction would raise serious first amendment questions because the nlrb actions would go beyond resolving factual issues.id.at.they would 
necessarily involve inquiry into the of the position asserted by the and its relationship to the school religious mission.it is not only the conclusions that may be reached by the board which may impinge on rights guaranteed by the religion clauses,but also the very process of inquiry leading to findings and conclusions.
to decide which institutions are seminaries and which are not,the board necessarily would have to make judgments concerning which convictions,doctrines,and faiths are religious in nature and which are not.because tyndale is heb ministries training institution for ministries,the board would have to consider whether the school is fulfilling its religious mission to the ministry and if its teachings are sufficiently theological in nature to be a seminary.for the government to determine whether sincerely professed religious beliefs are actually secular is an endeavor fraught with the sort of entanglement that the constitution forbids.hernandez,at.this it can not do.see catholic bishop of chicago,at.once a person professes a sincere religious conviction or faith,the person right to her faith is protected by the constitution and not subject to governmental determinations that they are not religious in nature.see id.the board can no more prohibit a church from calling its school a seminary than it can prohibit a religious congregation from calling itself a church.heb ministries beliefs are protected by the constitution from government regulation.
because the term seminary admits of a primarily religious meaning,the state has no authority to prohibit tyndale from using the term in its title,and may not constitutionally require private postsecondary institutions to submit to state regulation in order to do so.accordingly,section a of the texas education code is unconstitutional to the extent that it regulates this use of the term seminary.
the court result is the same,but its reasoning is a bit different.it adds a distinction between religious institutions that teach a primarily religious curriculum and those which teach a secular curriculum.that distinction is unnecessary.in my view,a religious institution may teach the curriculum it desires,religious,secular,or mixed,and call itself a seminary without first submitting to state regulation.
state regulation of issuance of degrees by a religious institution 
religious beliefs are immune from government regulation.see cantwell connecticut.conduct motivated by religious beliefs also enjoys important constitutional protection.see church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.however,the supreme court has held that religiously motivated conduct is not always immune from state regulation.for example,states may ban the taking of controlled narcotics as a religious practice.employment div.smith.government prohibition of the religious practice of polygamy is not contrary to the constitutional right to religious freedom.reynolds united states.the amish are required,as are other employees,to pay social security taxes even though their faith precludes their participation in government support programs.united states lee,d see cantwell,at.and day care facilities generally are not exempt from compliance with regulations to protect the health and safety of the children in their care.state corpus christi people baptist church.to implicate religious free exercise clause protections,the conduct at issue must be motivated by religious beliefs,which underlies the debate over whether placing at the top of graduation parchment is religiously motivated conduct.see lukumi,at.
the supreme court has developed different levels of scrutiny to apply to state regulations that burden religious conduct.laws that target religious practices are subject to the most rigorous constitutional scrutiny under religion clause jurisprudence.id.at.such state burdens must be narrowly tailored to satisfy a compelling governmental interest.smith,at.laws that substantially burden a person exercise of religion,even without expressly targeting religious practices for regulation,are likewise subject to strict scrutiny.sherbert verner,d thomas review bd.of the.employment sec,d the state may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state interest.hobbie unemployment appeals comm of,d the appeals commission does not seriously contend that its denial of benefits can withstand strict scrutiny rather it urges that we hold that its justification should be determined under the less rigorous standard we reject the argument again today.state action that does not target religion or substantially burden religious conduct but only incidentally burdens religious practices may pass constitutional muster if it is otherwise valid and does not impact religion disparately,the laws are neutral and generally applicable.smith,at.i f prohibiting the exercise of religion is not the object of the tax but merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision,the first amendment has not been offended.the supreme court rejected the argument that neutral and generally applicable laws that incidentally burden religious practices are subject to strict scrutiny and suggested that a reasonable relationship test determines whether they are constitutional.see id.at.
the supreme court established these standards in several cases over the years.although the opinions have been the subject of an active discussion in legal publications,the supreme court pronouncements are binding until changed.see kathleen brady,religious organizations and free exercise the surprising lessons of smith,byu christopher eisgruber lawrence sager,the vulnerability of conscience the constitutional basis for protecting religious conduct,chi.douglas laycock,formal,substantive,and disaggregated neutrality toward religion,depaul.douglas laycock,the supreme court and religious liberty,cath.law.michael mcconnell,free exercise revisionism and the smith decision,chi.michael mcconnell richard posner,an economic approach to issues of religious freedom,chi.in the seminal case of sherbert verner,the supreme court held that a substantial burden on the exercise of religious beliefs is subject to strict scrutiny,d.a member of the adventist church quit employment that required her to work on her saturday sabbath,and was subsequently denied unemployment benefits for declining without good cause to accept other employment that also required work on saturday.id.at.the court framed the issue as whether some compelling state interest enforced in the eligibility provisions of the statute justifies the substantial infringement of the appellant first amendment right.id.finding no compelling governmental interest at issue,the court held that the denial of unemployment benefits violated the plaintiff rights.id.at.see thomas,at.
in,the supreme court addressed an incidental rather than substantial infringement on religious conduct.explicitly addressing for the first time religious conduct restricted by a state criminal law of general applicability,the supreme court in smith applied a lower standard to the constitutional challenge in that case than it did in sherbert.at.two members of the native american church brought a free exercise challenge to an oregon law criminalizing the knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance unless the substance has been prescribed by a medical practitioner.id.at.referring to.stat.the plaintiffs were discharged from their jobs for ingesting peyote,a controlled substance under oregon law,for sacramental purposes during a native american church ceremony.id.they claimed the oregon law was unconstitutional as applied to them because it interfered with their exercise of religion.id.
the court reaffirmed that first and foremost the free exercise clause means the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires,and precludes all governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such.id.at.quoting sherbert,at.distinguishing the regulation of religious beliefs from the regulation of conduct,the court observed that it has never held that an individual religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate.id.at.the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.id.at.quoting lee,at.to require strict scrutiny of the criminal statute in the case would produce a private right to ignore generally applicable laws which is a constitutional anomaly.id.at.the court held that neither the text of the constitution nor court precedent require that states allow use of a controlled substance as a religious practice.id.at.
the court expressly declined to extend the strict scrutiny balancing test of sherbert to govern the analysis of generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct.id.at.thus,the state need not establish a compelling interest to institute incidental burdens on a person religious practices,so long as it does so through a neutral and criminal law that does not otherwise violate the constitution.id 
the court affirmed the holding in smith three years later in lukumi.lukumi involved a set of city ordinances that prohibited the religious sacrifice of animals by the santeria religion and imposed criminal sanctions for their violation.id.at.the court reaffirmed the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability and only incidentally burdens religious practices need not be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest.id.at.the city ordinances at issue were held unconstitutional,however,because they were neither neutral nor generally applicable but targeted the religious practices of the santeria religion.id.at.
in lukumi,the court observed that if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,the law is not neutral.id.at.although passing facial review,the laws in question were not neutral because santeria worship was the object or target of the city ordinances.id.at.the court determined that the design of the laws accomplished a religious gerrymander,an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.id.at.citation omitted.
addressing the general applicability requirement,the lukumi court observed that government,in pursuit of legitimate interests,can not in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief and that this principle is essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the free exercise clause.id.at.although the court did not define the standard for general applicability,the court held that these ordinances fall well below the minimum standard necessary to protect first amendment rights.id.in arriving at this conclusion,the court observed that the ordinances were vastly underinclusive and included many secular exemptions.id.at.failing both the neutrality and general applicability prongs,the lukumi court applied the most rigorous of scrutiny to the city of hialeah ordinances and held them unconstitutional because they were designed to persecute or oppress a religion.id.at.
the parties disagree which level of scrutiny should apply to section of the education code.heb ministries contends that because the state regulatory scheme provides for secular exemptions,but not religious ones,it is not neutral and,accordingly,the statutory scheme must be analyzed under strict scrutiny.see lukumi,at.see also fraternal order of police newark lodge city of newark,cir.specifically,heb ministries points to section of the education code,which exempts some institutions from being required to have a certificate of authority if they have been accredited by a state approved accrediting agency.heb also cites section,which exempts some educational institutions from the prohibition on protected terms if they used the terms college or university in their title prior to september.heb ministries further contends strict scrutiny applies because this is a hybrid rights case involving multiple constitutional claims,including claims based on the free speech clause,free exercise clause,and establishment clause.see smith,at.
the state contends that section is neutral and generally applicable,and therefore under smith,this court must not apply the sherbert strict scrutiny analysis.according to the state,the laws at issue apply to all private postsecondary educational and secular grant postsecondary academic degrees.the state also contends there is no evidence that the object of the statutory scheme was to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation or to suppress religious beliefs.
as explained in lukumi,the beginning point is the statute text,for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.lukumi,at.a law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or context.id.a facial reference to religion in a statute does not necessarily render it presumptively unconstitutional,see locke davey,d,nor is facial neutrality alone determinative.lukumi,at.the free exercise clause,like the establishment clause,forbids subtle departures from neutrality,gillette united states,d,and covert suppression of particular religious beliefs.bowen roy,d opinion of burger.official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment can not be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality.the court must survey meticulously the circumstances of governmental categories to eliminate,as it were,religious gerrymanders.walz tax comm n,d harlan,concurring see lukumi,at.
according to tyndale,section is unconstitutional because it forces tyndale to submit to the state regulations in order to award college degrees to describe the educational attainment of its students.see labor relations bd.catholic bishop of chicago,d.section precludes private postsecondary institutions from awarding degrees unless the board has issued the institution a certificate of authority,and to obtain such a certificate requires submission to the standards governing curriculum,faculty,and school governance.
the legislature explained its purposes for enacting these requirements for private postsecondary education institutions.it is the policy and purpose of the state of texas to prevent deception of the public resulting from the conferring and use of fraudulent or substandard college and university degrees id.the legislature also explained 
because degrees and equivalent indicators of educational attainment are used by employers in judging the training of prospective employees,by public and private professional groups in determining qualifications for admission to and continuance of practice,and by the general public in assessing the competence of persons engaged in a wide range of activities necessary to the general welfare,regulation by law of the evidences of college and university educational attainment is in the public interest.to the same end the protection of legitimate institutions and of those holding degrees from them is also in the public interest.
this court recognized recently,quoting brown board of education,that education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.neeley west consol.indep.sch.the united states supreme court held that congress stated purpose in enacting the higher education act of assisting colleges in ensuring that large numbers of youth obtain educations is a legitimate secular objective entirely appropriate for governmental action.tilton richardson,d.the supreme court further explained that t here is no doubt as to the power of a state,having high responsibility for education for its citizens,to impose reasonable regulations for the control of education.wisconsin yoder,d see also lemon kurtzman,d pierce soc y of sisters.and the new jersey supreme court held that the privilege of granting degrees,evidential of academic achievement,is very intimately related to the public welfare,and is unquestionably subject to regulation by the state.shelton coll.state bd.of,quoting elliott,the colleges and the courts.the purpose of ensuring the quality of postsecondary education provided by institutions in this state and protecting the integrity of college degrees issued therefrom is plainly within the state substantial interest in education.
the legislature objective is to ensure that the granting of a degree is a meaningful act grounded in established curricular and instructional standards and that persons who rely on a postsecondary degree,lawfully issued by a texas institution,may accurately presume a level of competence and qualification.see.the legislature enforces this objective in education,an area in which it has a substantial and legitimate interest.see yoder,at.neeley,at.moreover,all postsecondary institutions,whether secular or religious,private or public,must submit to the state standards to grant college or graduate degrees.see.admin.code requiring certain degree programs at private postsecondary institutions to include humanities and fine arts,social and behavioral sciences,and natural sciences and mathematics as well as courses to develop skills in written and oral communication.an institution may operate outside those standards if it chooses to use nomenclature on its graduation documents other than college or graduate degrees,bachelor level certificate,but to issue degrees it must comply with public standards.there is no disparate treatment of any category of institutions.
the law here is neutral and generally applicable and prohibits the unauthorized issuance of college and graduate degrees,currently enforced by both civil and criminal penalties.the supreme court held in smith that individuals must comply with valid laws prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate.at.in this case,i do not believe the constitution bans states from promulgating generally applicable standards that must be met before postsecondary institutions may confer degrees on its students 
the office of the attorney general for the state of texas has opined on this very issue whether rights under the free exercise clause permit a religious organization to operate a university without compliance with state standards.op.att y no.attorney general john cornyn concluded that the application to religious educational institutions of state laws regulating the awarding of degrees does not violate the law restricting governmental burdens on the free exercise of religion.id 
the only other state supreme court to address this issue also reached the same outcome.the tennessee supreme court held that the tennessee postsecondary education authorization act prohibition on the issuance of degrees by postsecondary institutions,unless they complied with state standards,did not violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment.state ex rel.mclemore clarksville sch.of theology.it held that the granting of degrees is unquestionably subject to regulation by the state and is not a religious activity.at see shelton coll.state bd.of,rejecting a claim that the first amendment right of free speech prohibited the state from regulating the power to confer a bachelor degree.
to the extent an institution desires to enter into this sphere of legitimate state,the granting of college,university,and graduate degrees by private postsecondary educational must comply with state mandates that are not unnecessarily intrusive and are prompted by legitimate objectives.see smith,at.lee.a contrary conclusion would allow entities,regardless of their motives,to circumvent the statutory requirements under the guise of religious practices by issuing degrees supported by little or no meaningful educational attainment.this would undermine the legitimate objectives of precluding issuance of fraudulent degrees and ensuring that society could rely on the attainment of a college degree as evidence of meaningful postsecondary educational accomplishment.
because in this case tyndale is engaging in commercial conduct the state is free to granting of educational degrees,associate degrees,bachelor degrees,master degrees,and doctorate degrees,i conclude that section of the education code does not offend the free exercise clause of the united states constitution.see id.at.lukumi,at.
the plurality concludes that tyndale has a constitutional right to issue college and graduate degrees without compliance with the legislature standards.of course,tyndale does not frame its case in this fashion because the idea in this context that only one type of postsecondary institution,a seminary,has an unfettered constitutional right to put the title college degree at the top of its graduation documents,without regard to compliance with public standards,is a tenuous notion.instead,tyndale enmeshes its argument on this issue with the bedrock principle that the state can not regulate the doctrinal beliefs and teachings of a church school.wrapped in this theological flag,tyndale arguments then focus on religious beliefs and bury the real issue of the appropriate words to title a graduation document beneath it.i disagree that the constitution bars the legislature from establishing generally applicable standards for the granting of postsecondary educational degrees.this question concerns tyndale can put college degree,with no disclaimer or explanation that it does not comply with public standards at the top of its graduation documents.no one,including the board,disputes tyndale right to believe and teach whatever it chooses and hire whomever it desires to do so.
of course,it sounds patently offensive to religious freedoms to assert that the state is barring mother teresa and reverend billy graham from teaching at a seminary,and if correct,it would be.but doctrine and instruction are not tantamount to stamping a title on a piece of parchment handed out at graduation.governments can not regulate what a seminary teaches,who it hires to teach,or how its administration is structured.these matters are central to the seminary beliefs and convictions,and the freedom to believe as one chooses is absolute.see braunfeld brown,d.typing the letters on a parchment is an act that is not inherent to tyndale religious beliefs or engaged in for religious reasons,and should not be accorded constitutional protection under the religion clauses.see smith,at.the legislature could decide to allow it,but the constitution does not require it.the plurality strains to persuade that because the board does not allow tyndale to confer degrees without compliance with the statutes,that it is dictating the doctrine that may be taught at the seminary.i remain unconvinced tyndale,however,is correct that it should be able to use meaningful designations on official looking paper to convey what it believes to be substantial educational achievement.see infra,section iii.this does not require,as the plurality concludes,creation of a constitutional right of religious,but not,postsecondary institutions to issue college and graduate degrees.although different from this case,the plurality reasoning would grant a constitutional right to a religious group to confer a doctor of philosophy degree on a graduation parchment after providing an hour of instruction.
the education code broad definition of the term degree precludes use of many words similar to degree.tyndale asserts that section of the education code,by virtue of the definition of degree in,regulates virtually all useful terminology that it may use to convey the educational achievement of its students.although i believe that the granting of degrees is conduct the legislature may regulate,the state attempt to regulate tyndale use of any language suggesting a similar or competing level of educational competency also must be valid under the free speech clause of the first amendment.
free speech 
heb ministries contends that the state regulatory scheme violates its rights to free speech under the first amendment of the united states constitution because the state has usurped virtually all terms it could reasonably use to describe the educational achievement of its students.see const.amend.i,cl.congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.art.i,every person shall be at liberty to speak,write or publish his opinions on any subject,being responsible for the abuse of that privilege and no law shall ever be passed curtailing the liberty of speech or of the press.the state,in contrast,asserts that the speech at issue is commercial speech and,pursuant to federal constitutional law,the state has a substantial interest in curtailing the proliferation of diploma mills and assuring that indicia of educational attainment are accurate,and that the challenged statutes directly advance that governmental interest.heb contends that,even if the speech at issue is commercial,the state must still show that the speech restrictions are narrowly drawn to serve that substantial interest.tyndale contention is that the state regulation of any title,word,appellation,and other terminology not only equivalent to degree but suggesting a course of study toward a postsecondary degree or its equivalent is an unconstitutionally broad prohibition on tyndale rights.
the court of appeals agreed with the state that its regulation of the terms degree,associate,bachelor,master,doctor,and other equivalents in sections and targets commercial speech.at.the supreme court case law confirms that determination.commercial speech is speech that seeks to propose a commercial transaction or is expression that serves the economic interests of the speaker.bd.of trs.fox,d bolger youngs drug prods,d cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm n,d.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d.the first amendment protection of commercial speech is based on advertising informational function,which equips persons to act in their own best interests.cent.hudson,at.to help fulfill this goal,there is a constitutional presumption favoring disclosure over concealment,because disclosure of truthful,relevant information is more likely to make a positive contribution to decisionmaking than is concealment of such information.peel attorney registration disciplinary comm.n,d see ibanez.of bus.prof l regulation,d.the first amendment presumes that some accurate information is better than no information at all.cent.hudson,at.on this basis,the supreme court held that use of the designations cpa certified public accountant and cfp certified financial planner are commercial speech.ibanez,at.the terms and have also been held to be commercial speech.strang satz.the title has also been analyzed under the commercial speech doctrine.state ex rel.state bd.of healing arts thomas,d.the conferral of degrees is largely a commercial activity and a privilege granted to institutions by the states in which they operate.see nova educ.inst.licensure comm n,degree conferral is business conduct,a corporate privilege conferred by the state of incorporation,and accordingly,e ducational institutions have no inherent or constitutional right to confer degrees.courts have treated the display of terms such as fellow,associate fellow,board certified,certified,and specialist as commercial speech.see borgner brooks,cir relying upon the eleventh circuit treatment of the title psychologist in abramson gonzalez,cir potts hamilton,d,bingham hamilton,d,all three cases involve statutes prohibiting dentists,who specialize in implant dentistry and are certified by organizations not recognized by the state,from advertising certain credentials.
tyndale provides educational and ministerial training courses to its students and the students pay tuition and fees.tyndale conferral of titles on its graduating students and advertisement of information about degrees it awards to graduating students is commercial speech.
restrictions on commercial speech are reviewed under the test established in central hudson.the constitution accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression.id.at.the state may ban commercial speech which concerns unlawful activity or is false,deceptive,and misleading.ibanez,at.cent.hudson,at.otherwise,commercial speech may not be restricted unless the government has a substantial interest in restricting the speech,the regulation directly advances the asserted governmental interest,and the speech restrictions are narrowly drawn such that they are no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.cent.hudson,at.the court clarified in fox,at,that the requirement of narrowly constructing the restriction does not compel the state to employ the restriction that is absolutely the least severe that will achieve the desired end.the law requires that the restriction of commercial speech be in proportion to the interest served.id.the proponent of the restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it.edenfield fane,d.
the parties do not dispute that the speech at issue concerns lawful activity and the board does not contend that the expression is false.the state contends only that it seeks to regulate tyndale potentially deceptive speech.as previously observed,the state interest in ensuring the quality of postsecondary educational institutions that issue degrees in this state is substantial.and tyndale does not contest that the state has a substantial interest in regulating private postsecondary education,or that the state may endeavor to assure that degrees accurately portray educational attainment and to prevent the operation of illegal diploma mills.i consider the other two prongs of the test for permissible regulation of commercial speech and determine whether sections and of the education code directly advance the state interest,and whether narrower limitations could be crafted to ensure the potentially misleading information is presented in a nonmisleading manner.
restricting an unaccredited institution ability to award degrees directly advances the state interest because 
degrees and equivalent indicators of educational attainment are used by employers in judging the training of prospective employees,by public and private professional groups in determining qualifications for admission to and continuance of practice,and by the general public in assessing the competence of persons engaged in a wide range of activities necessary to the general welfare.
the legislature may also address conduct that attempts to accomplish indirectly that which is prohibited directly in the statute.thus,for example,the state may preclude an institution that does not meet its standards from lawfully calling its graduation documents master degrees yet representing through other means that certificates it issues have complied with the state educational standards for a master degree.
tyndale responds that the state nearly complete usurpation of reasonable terms to describe postsecondary educational attainment is not tailored to directly serve the state objectives.unless certified by the board,the statute bars a postsecondary institution use of any title or designation,mark,abbreviation,appellation,or series of letters or words,including associate,bachelor,master,doctor,and their equivalents to describe private postsecondary achievement which leads to a degree or partially fulfills a degree program or its equivalent.id.emphasis added.the state responds that heb could issue certificates,advanced certificates,diplomas,or higher diplomas so long as it refrains from describing them as equivalent to an associate,bachelor,master,or doctor degree.the state also contends that the statutes are narrowly tailored because heb ministries is still free to advertise its qualifications,services,and missions,so long as it does not use the protected,associate,bachelor,master,and doctor that suggest approval by the state and satisfaction of minimum educational standards that society has come to expect of these terms.the state also argues the statutes are narrowly tailored because tyndale could not be fined for,and would not be prohibited from issuing,for example,a diploma or certificate because these terms by themselves do not signify,purport to signify,and are not generally taken to mean a program of study leading to an associate,bachelor,master,or doctor degree or its equivalent.see id.
a plain reading of the statute conveys a much broader prohibition than the board concedes.first,under the statute a degree includes the protected terms associate,bachelor,master,doctor and degree.id.generally,the definition requires that for protected words or titles to trigger state regulation,they be described or perceived as leading to a degree at the associate,bachelor,master or doctorate level.
the board asserts that an institution must be certified to use any of these protected terms by themselves because they suggest and are generally understood to indicate that a recipient completed part or all of a program leading to a degree.the statutory language indeed extends that broadly.second,the statute also defines a degree to include any word,title,designation,series of letters,or similar terminology to the protected terms that suggest study toward a degree.further extending the scope of the statute,the legislature barred use of any title,designation,words,mark,series of letters,or appellation that conveys study leading to a degree,or any similar posteducational achievement.id.the language of encompasses virtually every term that could reasonably provide a useful description of educational achievement at a postsecondary educational institutional.the legislation bans unapproved programs from using any of the protected terms,any words,letters,or titles that are similar to the protected terms and any words that suggest a program leading to a college or graduate degree or any words that are similar to the titled programs.the language of section supports the board fines for use of the word diploma and certificate and provides a basis for fining unaccredited institutions for using the phrases bachelor level diploma and comparable to an associate degree.the statute impermissibly bars tyndale from issuing a master level certificate or an associate level diploma,terms which do not convey state certification of a degree,but do convey postsecondary education accomplishment.a majority of the court decides that for religious instruction by religious schools,the regulation of educational terminology under the statute broad definition of degree violates constitutional standards.in section,the plurality states that the use of any words remotely resembling ordinary education terms is risky the appellations that the public understands to indicate college and graduate level study would all be equivalent or similar to the protected terms and their equivalents.
the board concession that tyndale may use certificate or diploma on its graduation documents without state approval is not helpful.under the statute,the words diploma and certificate certainly are titles,words,or appellations and they are similar to the protected term degree.thus,by its terms the statute bars any use of diploma and certificate that may indicate completion of all or part of a program leading to a degree.however,even if the board concession is correct under the language of the statute,the concession is not useful without being able to tie the terms diploma or certificate to some description of a recognized or similar level of postsecondary educational attainment,and the statute precludes making that connection.for example,tyndale could likely issue a diploma of theological studies which would not convey its apparent belief that its program is comparable to college level course work because diplomas generally are issued at the high school educational level.see brief for independent colleges and universities of texas,as amicus curiae at explaining that there is a public perception that a degree qualifies an individual to perform in their chosen field of study.if tyndale issued a diploma of bachelor level studies,which would more accurately convey its contentions about its program,that title would violate the statute.the board concedes the use of terms that would not allow tyndale to accurately describe its belief about the level or quality of it programs.the board concession does not resolve the free speech problems tyndale raises.
section prohibitions on first amendment expression further preclude private postsecondary educational institutions from advertising comparisons with institutions.for example,the board objects to tyndale description of its diploma of theological studies as stronger than the typical bachelors in biblical studies.such a description suggests that tyndale program is better than bachelor degree programs fining private institutions for making legitimate comparisons that their programs are similar to or better than programs leading to a degree does not equip persons to act in their own interests.instead,it punishes institutions for disclosure of truthful,relevant information that is likely to make a positive contribution to decision making.see peel,at.cent.hudson,at.this restriction contradicts the first amendment purpose for commercial speech.
moreover,the applicable portions of sections and operate as a ban on not only potentially misleading speech but also on truthful speech.tyndale issued diplomas and certificates which may be as good as or better than some programs,and other private institutions,whether religious or nonreligious,would have the same complaint that legitimate comparisons are being improperly silenced.the regulation is more extensive than necessary to serve the state legitimate interests.under,tyndale can not use any terms that are similar to the protected terms,and it can not describe its programs as similar to or better than programs leading to a degree.the statute cuts an impermissibly broad swath through protected commercial speech.
as previously stated,the standard for judging restrictions on commercial speech is that the restriction be in proportion to the interest served.fox,at.the availability of more limited alternatives that are less restrictive of speech is strong support for a conclusion that the regulation does not directly advance the desired goal.thompson states med,d.the supreme court analysis indicates that courts should inquire whether the government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech or is less restrictive of commercial speech.id.the answer to this inquiry will help illuminate whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest and is more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.id.at.noting that we have made clear that if the government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech,or that restricts less speech,the government must do so and that even with commercial speech,regulating speech must be a.
tyndale notes that narrower limitations could achieve the legislature desired objectives by requiring,for example,reasonable disclaimers or disclosures that certificates and diplomas tyndale may issue are not approved by the state and that tyndale itself is not accredited by the state.the supreme court has recognized the possibility that some limited supplementation,by way of warning or disclaimer or the like,might be required rather than a ban on commercial speech.bates,at.see,peel,at.providing similar disclosure examples cent.hudson,at.holding the state interest could be addressed by including accurate descriptive information rather than banning the speech strang.at holding the same with respect to statute that prohibited use of or the title doctor unless obtained from an institution recognized by the state.such measures may achieve the state desired objective and be more likely to provide useful and accurate information to contribute to the public decisionmaking than would banning all such information from the institution.see ibanez,at.in the present context,reasonable disclaimers regarding the theological certificates and diplomas could serve to better inform the public of tyndale students educational achievements than would a complete ban on their ability to accurately describe such achievements.the education code currently includes such a disclosure for the granting of honorary degrees.thus,i conclude the state has not carried its burden of showing that its regulation of this commercial speech directly advances its interest because the regulation is more extensive than necessary to serve the legislature legitimate purposes.see cent.hudson,at.
conclusion 
accordingly,i would reverse the court of appeals judgment and vacate the fines assessed by the texas higher education coordinating board against heb ministries.

const.amend.i congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion cantwell.the fundamental concept of liberty embodied in the fourteenth amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the first amendment.the first amendment declares that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.the fourteenth amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as congress to enact such laws.
const.art.i,n o preference shall ever be given by law to any religious society or mode of worship.but it shall be the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as may be necessary to protect equally every religious denomination in the peaceable enjoyment of its own mode of public worship.

in re commitment of fisher,where,as here,the parties have not argued that differences in state and federal constitutional guarantees are material to the case,and none is apparent,we limit our analysis to the united states constitution and assume that its concerns are congruent with those of the texas constitution.see also tilton marshall,because tilton has not argued persuasively for a different application of the provisions of the first amendment and article i,section as they pertain to the free exercise of religion,we assume without deciding that the state and federal free exercise guarantees are coextensive with respect to his particular claims.

see brief of amicus curiae southwestern baptist theological seminary at southwestern finds,however,that the rigors of these accreditation processes take considerable time and personnel away from its educational programs and mission.southwestern understands that educational institutions that are small,financially struggling,or that serve the needs of a religious order falling outside what might be considered to be the mainstream of popular faiths or ideologies may not posses either the individual or financial resources to participate in the accreditation process.southwestern recognizes that the religious teaching of these institutions may be substantially chilled if the state of texas is permitted to set and enforce accreditation standards against these institutions,prevent the institutions from calling themselves seminaries,or keep these institutions from conferring religious certifications upon their students.

as the court of appeals noted,at,subchapter g authorizes the coordinating board to extend an institution eligibility for certification if it has been denied accreditation based on its religious policies.e if,after a effort,an institution can not achieve accreditation within the period of time prescribed by the board,the institution may appeal for extension of eligibility for certification because of having been denied accreditation due to policies of the institution based on religious beliefs or other good and sufficient cause as defined by rule of the board.the board shall consider the application of any accreditation standard that prohibited accreditation of the institution on the basis of religious policies practiced by the institution as a prima facie justification for extending the eligibility for certification if all other standards of the board are satisfied.the court of appeals thought that this provision made subchapter g supervision of religious schools unobtrusive.at.the coordinating board has not made that argument in its briefs in this court and has not cited section e,although it did cite a corresponding regulation.admin.code c,and pointed out in oral argument that because heb ministries has never been evaluated by the state,there has never been an opportunity for any court to see if there is indeed a conflict between any of the state requirements and heb ministries religious beliefs or practice.the board stops short of saying that it would even could any special allowances for religious institutions.

i join most of part of the court opinion,but i do not agree with its proposition that e ither way,the statute in its application to schools offering only religious instruction targets religious practices,discriminating between those that comply with state standards from those that do not,and is not merely a neutral regulation of education.
in a footnote,the plurality cites section e and notes the court of appeals holding that this provision rendered the statutory scheme unobtrusive.at.the plurality brushes this section aside because t he coordinating board has not made that argument in its briefs in this court,and has not cited section e,although it did cite a corresponding regulation and pointed out in oral argument that because heb ministries has never been evaluated by the state,there has never been an opportunity for any court to see if there is indeed a conflict between any of the state requirements and heb ministries religious beliefs or practice.the plurality also notes that t he board stops short of saying that it would even could any special allowances for religious institutions.regardless of the coordinating board contentions or citations,we may no more ignore this exemption for religious institutions than we may disregard unmentioned,but controlling,precedent.
the current regulations contain a similar provision the board shall consider the application of any accreditation standard that prohibits accreditation of an institution solely on the basis of religious policies practiced by the institution as sufficient justification for extending the institution eligibility for certification to grant degrees of a religious nature only,if the institution a has applied for and pursued accreditation in good faith b meets all other standards at the level of accreditation and c satisfies all other requirements of the board.admin.code c.
