s,a mother committed to the education of her disabled daughter,g,brought suit against the vashon island school district visd alleging that the visd had committed procedural and substantive violations of the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,et.s alleges that the visd violated the idea by proposing a temporary individualized educational placement iep for g that placed g in a special education classroom,segregated from the general student population.the visd argues that the temporary placement was appropriate until the visd had the opportunity to assess and evaluate more fully g needs and abilities.the district court granted summary judgment to the visd,holding that the visd proposed temporary iep met the substantive requirements of the idea because it was the closest approximation to g last educational placement,and that any deficiencies in visd procedural compliance with the idea were minor and technical.we affirm,concluding that the visd efforts to serve g educational interests complied with the substantive and procedural requirements of the idea and satisfied the visd obligation to provide a free appropriate public education fape to 
background 
seattle school districta.school year 
g,who is currently,has down syndrome and tested in the mildly mentally retarded range on a standard iq evaluation at the ages of six and ten.during the school year kindergarten,seattle educators,on g behalf,developed an iep.this is a special education plan that must be customized for each special education student and that is required by the idea.g iep included a half day in a regular kindergarten classroom and a half day in a special education classroom,and was implemented at the bagley elementary school in seattle 
although g was successful in the special education classroom,she experienced behavior problems in the general education classroom.g was bossy and demanded frequent attention of both the teacher and her peers,with occasional outbursts.seattle director of special education,frosyne mensendick,thought that this experience was likely to be indicative of g future performance,and stated that she could not imagine placing g in a general education classroom.eventually,at s request,seattle returned g on april,to a program in the special education class.
school years 
on may,in anticipation of the school year grade,s requested that g be placed in a general education classroom,but seattle felt that such a placement was inappropriate.in june,g iep team agreed to reassign g to alternative school,which featured an unique and experimental classroom combining special education and general education students,staffed by a special education teacher and a paraprofessional aide.s did not sign this iep,but permitted g to be enrolled in the program.this iep included a special education curriculum with general education students in g classroom.although the form appears to prescribe minutes per week hours per day of special education and minutes per week of general education,it then shows a total of minutes per week hours per day for the program described above.because a full school week in the seattle school district is minutes per week,and g attended school for only minutes per week,we assume that the part of the form that reflects the total time is correct.
for the school year,g spent most of the day at alternative school with other students ranging in age from six to ten years old.of the students,five received special education services,and the remaining eighteen received individually tailored general education although the majority of g peers in this classroom were general education students,she received instruction that was largely prepared by a certified special education teacher.g did not require a dedicated assistant in this classroom.mensendick did not consider this placement to be a regular education setting.
although her teacher noted that g had continuing difficulties with appropriate personal space,the placement at alternative school was described as generally successful for g.her teacher indicated that with the proper support,g could be successful in a setting with normally developing peers.
s and seattle agreed that g would return to the classroom at alternative school for the school year.g,however,was not there.g regularly scheduled assessment was due in february,but was not conducted at that time.g was released from the seattle school district on august.
ii.vashon island school district 
in july,with plans to move to vashon island,s contacted the vashon island school district visd to inquire about enrolling g in a general classroom at chautauqua elementary school,the visd only elementary school.
this inquiry began a long series of disputed conversations and letters regarding g placement in the visd.the visd,which was focused on enrolling and assessing g,wanted to place g temporarily in a special education environment until it could be determined from the assessment whether the temporary placement was appropriate.in contrast,s was focused on having g placed first in a general education environment,or at the least,having g assessed before she was temporarily placed.because of provisions that s understood to mandate that a child remain in her last placement during any dispute,s did not want to have g in special education while disputes regarding g education were being resolved.
on september,lynda walls,the visd director of student services,formally welcomed s to the district by mailing a letter to her vashon address.walls enclosed a form asking for s consent to place g temporarily in a self contained special education classroom,for less than thirty days,to evaluate an appropriate permanent placement.s did not sign the form.on the same day,s wrote to walls that the visd was refusing to assess g until she was placed in the special education classroom.s protested that this placement was inconsistent with g last iep,and demanded an independent assessment before any placement.
on september,walls sent two letters to s.the first clarified in writing that the visd rejected s september request for an interdistrict transfer on the basis that the visd could not provide the level of service s was seeking.the second notified s that even if g had properly been enrolled presumably as a resident on september,she had since been withdrawn for lack of attendance,and that s could re enroll g if she planned to send her to chautauqua elementary school the second letter also advised that the psychologist would again attempt to schedule an assessment.
throughout late september,october,and november,there were several unsuccessful attempts to schedule meetings to evaluate g and to discuss an iep with s.the meetings never occurred,according to s,d ue to visd failure to provide proper notice,visd refusal to include a general education teacher in any proposed iep meeting,and g illness hearing aid difficulties.also,no assessment occurred,due in part to the lack of the necessary consent form.
on october,and again on october and november,walls informed s that,until g could be assessed for a permanent placement,the visd would use her last iep as a guide in developing a temporary iep.walls believed that,given the last iep available and the available options at chautauqua elementary school,it was appropriate to place g temporarily in a special education classroom,with some time in a general education classroom on october,s again protested the proposed placement,claiming that the district had not explained why it could not accommodate g in an inclusive classroom with general education students and supplemental aids and services,which she claimed reflected g last iep.the visd special education teacher later testified that she would not have had enough information,using only g iep and her last assessment,to tailor the visd general education curriculum to suit g needs in.
by october,visd had drafted a proposed interim iep reflecting four hours per day minutes per week of special education and at least one hour per day minutes per week of general education this amounted to the same quantity of general education time as in g iep.furthermore,the visd proposed that this time in general education settings be increased as appropriate and with appropriate support.
on november,because of g continuing absence from school,the visd filed for a due process hearing hearing,described infra to show the appropriateness of its proposed placement and program and to overcome the refusal to allow g to attend.
on november,the first full iep meeting was held.s claimed to be the only person at the meeting who had had contact with g that was more extensive than a brief introduction,and she felt that a lack of knowledge was apparent in the inappropriate goals the team had provisionally devised.s continued to be adamant in her demand that,given the disagreement regarding proper placement,g be placed in a general education environment as she claimed was reflected in g last iep from seattle.s offered as an example chautauqua elementary school blended second and class of students.
at this meeting,it became apparent that the visd had based its draft iep on g iep,instead of g iep walls claimed that she had not previously known there was a valid iep,because it was not included with the materials sent from seattle.after receiving a copy of the iep,the visd altered its proposed plan,including an extra hour per day of special education to more closely match g iep.the time spent in general education did not change.the visd recognized,after being notified by s,that it was required to implement the iep,but claimed that chautauqua elementary school had no program with the same structure as that in alternative school,and that the closest available alternative was reflected in the updated draft.on november,the visd invited s to propose modifications to the altered proposal,and on november s again communicated her disagreement with the proposed placement.
on december,the second full iep meeting was held.s proposed changes to the iep,some of which the visd included.however,s and the visd could not come to agreement on the classroom placement.
the revised draft iep placed g in a special education classroom for five hours per day minutes per week with special education students g age.for at least one hour per day minutes per week,to be increased if appropriate after the assessment,g would join children in a general education setting for activities such as music,physical education,and tutoring.s continued to object.
no further draft iep was prepared.the december plan differed from the october plan in three ways the number of minutes allotted for not an additional minutes per week as of december the modification of reading,writing,math,communications,language arts,social,and fine motor skills goals to correspond to those in the iep and a few corrections to the summary of g current skill levels to conform to descriptions in the iep 
on december,several days into administrative hearing,discussed infra,the administrative law judge alj ordered visd to reassess pursuant to the alj order,visd reassessed g in january,while hearing was progressing.the assessment team consisted of walls,christine hinds,the principal at chautauqua elementary school,the visd school psychologist,a speech and language pathologist,two chautauqua elementary school general education teachers,a chautauqua special education teacher,a physical therapist,and an occupational therapist.several members of the team had experience in working with children with down syndrome.the psychologist testified that the parent was unusually intrusive in the assessment process,but the evaluation team agreed to use several tests based on s preferences.
after a multifaceted evaluation,the assessment team found that g was mildly mentally retarded,with math,written,and reading comprehension skills approximately three years behind her peers motor skills,visual perception,and coordination at least four years behind her peers and significant problems,including difficulties with impulsivity,attending to task,stress responses,dependence on adults,and interacting with peers.
on january,the reassessment team met with s to report the results of the reassessment.s disagreed with the results of the assessment,which she alleges were designed to support the visd proposed interim placement.given the disagreement and s demand that an independent evaluation be conducted at the school district expense,the visd on april,filed for another due process hearing.hearing,discussed infra.
on february,s submitted a declaration of intent to her child for the remainder of the school year.there is no evidence in the record indicating that g has since returned to the visd.
procedural history 
administrative hearings 
on november,before the iep process had been completed,the visd filed for a due process hearing to determine whether the proposed interim placement was appropriate.s appeared pro se.
administrative hearing 
alj lori patton presided over all of the testimony offered at hearing,some of which was apparently given via telephone.however,because of a medical emergency,she became unavailable before entering a final order.alj janice grant was substituted under.code.
alj grant listened to imperfect audiotapes of the hearing to reach her decision on april,alj grant issued an opinion,including a determination that the visd witnesses were more credible than s on disputed material facts.alj grant held that neither s nor g resided in the district until september,when s began sleeping on vashon island,and that the visd legal obligations to serve g began only at that time.
ultimately,alj grant approved the visd placement.she agreed with the visd that s preferred general education classroom with unspecified supplementary aids and be inappropriate for alj grant found that even if placement in a classroom with individually customized curriculum eventually proved appropriate for g,the visd special education staff would need individual time with g to prepare and tailor this curriculum,and that the interim placement was an appropriate means to provide this time.
furthermore,alj grant held that,when the parent and the school district disagree on an appropriate placement for a transfer student,the appropriate iep to implement is the last iep in the old district.she found that s proposal did not approximate g last agreed placement the iep in seattle as closely as possible.she further found that the visd did not have a placement identical to the seattle placement,but that the visd was not required to create one.rather,the interim placement offered was sufficiently close to the iep to be appropriate.because this interim placement was both procedurally and substantively appropriate for g,alj grant held that the visd met the procedural and substantive requirements of the federal idea and state special education laws.
administrative hearing 
after s disputed the visd reassessment,the visd filed for another due process hearing on april.this time,it sought confirmation that its reassessment was appropriate,and that because g was,s was not entitled to an independent evaluation at public expense.
alj cynthia minter judicially noticed the facts found in hearing.she conducted a detailed analysis of the relevant provisions of the.admin.code and found that despite delays in certain procedures,the visd reassessment substantially conformed to each procedural requirement.moreover,though s disagreed with the methodology used by some of the evaluators,alj minter found nothing improper in the methods of assessment,and specifically credited the expertise of the examiners.
because alj minter found the reassessment appropriate,she declined to rule on the issue of whether a student could demand an independent evaluation at public expense to compensate for an inappropriate assessment.on february,the alj entered judgment in favor of the visd.
ii.federal court 
s timely sought review of both proceedings in federal court.both parties moved for summary judgment.pursuant to the idea provisions for supplementing the administrative record,the district court agreed to hear and consider any witness s wished to put forward.an evidentiary hearing for that purpose was held on september.
on october,the district court affirmed the administrative rulings and entered judgment for the visd and the office of the superintendent of public instruction ospi it held that the visd proposed placement in a segregated special education classroom was the closest approximation to g last placement,and that any deficiencies in the visd procedural compliance with the idea were minor and technical.
on august,this case was dismissed for failure to prosecute the appeal,but after s explained that she had been waiting for a district court ruling on a motion to produce a transcript at government expense,the appeal was reinstated as to s on january,and reinstated as to g on august,
standard of review 
the standard of review in cases involving the idea is different from the standard normally employed by federal courts reviewing the decisions of administrative agencies.the idea itself allows federal courts to receive evidence in addition to that put forth at the administrative hearing,and to weigh this additional evidence equally.see e.accordingly,appellate courts give less deference than is normally the case to the administrative law judge findings of fact.complete de novo review,however,is inappropriate.because congress intended states to have the primary responsibility of formulating each individual child education,we must defer to their specialized knowledge and experience by giving due weight to the decisions of the states administrative bodies.amanda,at internal citations omitted.the due weight to be given is within the discretion of the appellate court union sch.dist.smith,cir.as relevant to this case,the factual determinations afforded due weight include the alj finding as to the academic benefits a student would have received from a mainstream placement,the benefits a student would have received from a mainstream placement,the effects that a student presence would have had on mainstream teachers and students,and the cost of educating the student in a mainstream classroom.clyde puyallup sch,cir.
in idea cases,the district court may review the alj findings and make its own factual determinations,after granting the alj findings due weight,on a preponderance of the evidence the district court factual findings,even when based on the written record of administrative proceedings,are reviewed for clear error.amanda,at but see ojai unified sch,at stating that the appellate court grants only due weight to the factual findings of the alj,even if the district court relied on the administrative proceedings for its own findings.the conclusion of both the alj and the district court as to whether a student placement under the idea constitutes a free appropriate public education is a legal conclusion reviewed de novo.clyde,at seattle sch,cir amanda,at.
at the administrative hearing,the school district has the burden of proving that it complied with the idea.clyde,at.in the district court and on appellate review,however,the burden of proof is on the party challenging the administrative ruling.id.at.
discussion 
credibility determinations 
before reaching the merits of s claims under the idea,we examine whether credibility determinations were properly made by the substitute alj.normally,a finder of fact determination of credibility receives deference on appeal,because access to live testimony is important to the credibility finding.as we stated in united states mejia 
there can be no doubt that seeing a witness testify live assists the finder of fact in evaluating the witness credibility.as the supreme court stated in anderson city of bessemer,d o nly the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener understanding of and belief in what is said.id.at.live testimony enables the finder of fact to see the witness physical reactions to questions,to assess the witness demeanor,and to hear the tone of the witness that can not be gleaned from a written transcript.
because the district judge is able to hear testimony live and to view the witnesses as they testify,his credibility findings are entitled to deference on appeal.
cir internal citations omitted see also amanda,at finding,in the idea context,that the administrative hearing officer who receives live testimony is in the best position to determine issues of credibility.
although some aspects of testimony important to a credibility as the tone of a witness be conveyed through audiotapes alone,other key factors can be assessed only if one goes beyond the capacity of an aural medium.mejia mentions the witness physical reactions and variations in demeanor.id.also,in response to a question,a witness may fidget,or blush,or sweat,or frown,or grin,or shift his eyes nervously about,or look for assistance to his counsel or to a friend in the none of these reactions will be conveyed on the audiotape.without the ability to assess these reactions,a factfinder ability to determine a witness credibility reliably is constrained.
indeed,in mejia we found that,when credibility was an issue in the case,a district judge finding of fact without observing critical witnesses or hearing them testify in person was sufficiently without foundation to warrant reversal of the denial of a motion to suppress.id.at patelco credit union sahni,cir noting that under rule,a judge succeeding an unavailable judge after trial may only make findings of fact without a new trial if credibility is not at issue.
in this case,alj patton heard the testimony of hearing though some witnesses apparently testified by phone,most testimony was live.the complexity of gauging witness demeanor was compounded by the fact that s appeared pro se and both asked and answered her own questions.she could,and often did,in this manner blur the line between question and answer.although alj patton heard this testimony live,she suffered a medical emergency before she could issue findings of fact,and alj grant turned solely to audiotapes to determine the credibility of the parties.moreover,alj grant credibility determinations were material much of s case turns on whether the school district witnesses could be believed in their assertions that they attempted to involve s in the iep process and that they contemplated g initial placement to be a temporary placement only.
we conclude that alj grant determination that the district witnesses were more credible than s,based solely upon her review of audiotapes of live testimony,is due little deference.but even if reliance on these credibility determinations was error,the error was harmless.as the idea requires,see e a amanda,at,the district court here granted s the opportunity to supplement the record of the administrative hearings with any additional testimony s therefore could have recalled any she thought that demeanor evidence could have resulted in a different credibility finding.she presented both additional witnesses and additional exhibits,and also recalled herself to present further testimony.moreover,in its findings of fact,the district court did not explicitly rely on the alj credibility determinations.because the district court gave s the opportunity to cure any erroneous credibility determination,and because the district court did not itself rely on any erroneous credibility determination,any error by alj grant was harmless.
procedural compliance 
the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,et,guarantees to all children with disabilities a free appropriate public education fape.the supreme court has held that a court inquiry in suits brought under the idea is twofold.first,has the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and second,is the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits bd.of educ.rowley,d footnote omitted see also amanda,at.
compliance with the idea procedures is essential to ensuring that every eligible child receives a fape,and those procedures which provide for meaningful parental participation are particularly important.amanda,at.when the elaborate and highly specific procedural safeguards embodied in the idea are contrasted with the general and somewhat imprecise substantive admonitions contained in the act,we think that the importance congress attached to these procedural safeguards can not be gainsaid.rowley,at.furthermore,a school district must comply not only with federal statutory and regulatory procedures,but with state regulations as well state standards that are not inconsistent with federal standards under the idea are also enforceable in federal court.bd.of trustees,cir see also,at.
yet,as we have recognized,there is some leeway in the procedural requirements 
not every procedural violation,however,is sufficient to support a finding that the child in question was denied a fape.technical deviations,for example,will not render an iep invalid.on the other hand,procedural inadequacies that result in the loss of educational opportunity,or seriously infringe the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process,or that caused a deprivation of educational benefits,clearly result in the denial of a fape.
amanda,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
s alleges four procedural violations of the idea 
first,s claims that the visd violated,pt.app.c,and.admin.code by failing to have an iep in place at the beginning of the school year.second,claims that the visd violated,which mandates that school districts take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents are afforded the opportunity to participate in iep meetings.third,s claims that the visd failed to implement g last iep during the pendency of hearing,in violation of e.fourth,s claims that the visd attempted to schedule the first meeting to initiate or change g placement on september,without prior written notice,contrary to statutory and regulatory command.
we address each alleged procedural violation in turn.
s first claims that the visd violated the procedural requirements of the idea by failing to have an iep in place at the beginning of the school year.
the interpretive guidelines for the idea regulations issued by the office of special education programs osep,the agency charged with administering the idea,specify that i f a child with a disability has been receiving special education in one district and moves to another community,the new district may implement the last iep from the old district if the last iep is unavailable or if the new district believes the last iep to be inappropriate or not feasible to implement as written,then the new district must conduct a meeting to develop a new iep.see pt.app.c.this meeting should normally take place within one week after the child enrolls in the new district.see id.
the interpretive guidelines also state that i f the district or the parents believe that additional information is needed or that a new evaluation is necessary before a final placement decision can be made,it would be permissible to temporarily place the child in an interim program to ensure that the temporary placement does not become a final placement,the district may develop an interim iep with a specific timeline,days for completing the evaluation and making judgments about the most appropriate placement for the child.pt.app.c.
all of these alternative implementation of the last iep,the new iep meeting,and the temporary interim triggered by the transfer student enrollment in the new district.although neither federal nor state regulations specify when a child enrolls for purposes of the idea,washington state regulations do determine when a child enrolls for purposes of apportioning money to the school districts.as relevant to this case,a student is enrolled if he or she resides in the school district,actually participated in a course of instruction on a school day during the current school term before the date in question,and neither dropped out nor was absent for more than twenty consecutive school days.admin.code a.in turn,a student resides in the school district if the physical location of the student principal abode where the student lives the majority of the time is in the district.admin.code.the student mailing address and principal abode may be different.id.if a student has no legal residence at all,the school district must enroll the student at the parent request.code.
because it is undisputed that g never attended a day of class,we conclude that g was not enrolled in the visd,until at least september,when the visd offered an interim placement for evaluation purposes with a clearly identified time limit,satisfying its obligation under pt.app.c,because the visd had an iep in place at the beginning of the school year the visd did not violate,pt.app.c,and.admin.code.
s also claims that the visd effectively came to a unilateral conclusion on g placement before involving s or reviewing g records,and that the visd maintained its insistence on a predetermined placement despite substantial parental protest.
denying parental access to the iep process is a serious procedural violation of the idea.as we explained in amanda j 
among the most important procedural safeguards are those that protect the parents right to be involved in the development of their child educational plan.parents not only represent the best interests of their child in the iep development process,they also provide information about the child critical to developing a comprehensive iep and which only they are in a position to know.
amanda,at.see also shapiro paradise valley unified sch,cir it seems to us no exaggeration to say that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.quoting rowley,at.
for that reason,procedural inadequacies that seriously infringe the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process clearly result in the denial of a fape.amanda at internal quotation marks omitted.
a school district violates idea procedures if it independently develops an iep,without meaningful parental participation,and then simply presents the iep to the parent for ratification.see,at.parental involvement is not enough,and a school district may not be excused for lack of parental participation if it prioritize s its representatives schedules over those of the parents.shapiro,at.also,a school district may not enter an iep meeting with a take it or leave it position,and if it does so,then even the parents decision not to cooperate thereafter may not excuse the district error.see at,see also,at stating that the district would be held liable even if the parent were not as cooperative as she could have been.but the visd has no obligation to grant s a veto over any individual iep provision.as we clarified in doe by gonzales 
in discussing parents participatory role in developing ieps for their children,the supreme court observed that congress,a pparently recognizing that a cooperative approach would not always produce a consensus between the school officials and the parents,and that in any dispute the school officials would have a natural advantage,incorporated an elaborate set of what it labeled procedural safeguards to insure the full participation of the parents and proper resolution of substantive disagreements.we construe the court language as a recognition that,although the formulation of an iep is ideally to be achieved by consensus among the interested parties at a properly conducted iep meeting,sometimes such agreement will not be possible.if the parties reach a consensus,of course,the idea is satisfied and the iep goes into effect.if not,the agency has the duty to formulate the plan to the best of its ability in accordance with information developed at prior meetings,but must afford the parents a due process hearing in regard to that plan.
at internal citation omitted.
s claims that the visd entered the iep process with a take it or leave it position and did not allow meaningful parental participation in the iep process.she alleges that a unilateral decision was evidenced by the fact that the visd placed g in a special education classroom as of september,and that this determination never changed.moreover,according to s,the fact that the visd filed for a due process hearing even before the first official iep meeting,and the fact that the visd arrived at this first official meeting,on november,with a prepared iep,shows that the visd had arrived at a predetermined placement to be implemented without parental input.
however,s does not acknowledge that,at least by september,the visd made clear that its proposed initial placement was explicitly temporary,for the purposes of assessing g last assessment was outdated she had not been in school the prior year and through september,the visd did not have a validated copy of any prior iep,in part because s did not authorize release of records from seattle until october.under these circumstances,the visd decision to evaluate g before implementing a program and the visd decision to implement a temporary iep during the visd evaluation of g was appropriate.
furthermore,the regulations permit the district to temporarily place the child in a bounded interim program in order to conduct a proper evaluation.pt.app.c.the visd determination that it would not initially place g in a regular education classroom,when she had previously received special education services,was not a take it or leave it offer,but was a legitimate means to assess g needs and abilities.the visd steadfast insistence on an individualized special education environment was appropriate in establishing a temporary placement for evaluation purposes.
after the early encounters in september,the visd offered s more opportunity to participate in the process,not less.it attempted to schedule several assessments and several other iep meetings,notifying s several days in advance on each occasion.once the visd received g iep,on october,it prepared draft provisions tailored to the goals expressed in that iep,and when s later demanded changes to conform to the iep that the visd had not received,the district complied by modifying the educational goals accordingly and soliciting further modifications from s.the only take it or leave it feature of the visd proposed drafts was the refusal to place g as an initial matter entirely in a regular education classroom.this reflects a difference of educational philosophy with s,not a denial of opportunity to participate.school districts have expertise in educational methods that may be given appropriate weight in assessing an iep compliance with the idea.
we hold that where the school district has repeatedly provided the parent with the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the iep process,the school district has not violated its obligations under,which requires the school district to take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents are afforded the opportunity to participate in iep meetings,so long as it affords the parent a subsequent due process hearing with regard to its proposed plan when the parent and the school district are in disagreement about aspects of the proposed plan.see roland concord sch,cir strictness in the iep process must be tempered by considerations of fairness and practicality.here,the visd provided a meaningful opportunity for s to participate in the iep process,developed an iep plan to the best of its ability after s and the visd could not come to a consensus about an iep,and afforded s two due process hearings to establish the validity of its proposed plan.we conclude that the visd did not violate.
s also claims that the visd failed to implement her last iep during the pendency of hearing in violation of e the section provides that during the pendency of any proceedings to resolve a dispute under the idea,the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child.id.see also a same pt.app.c.because there was a dispute about the visd proposal,s claims that the district had the obligation to implement g last iep from the new placement was under review.
we have held that,to keep a student in the then current educational placement,a district typically has the obligation to provide the placement described in the child most recently implemented iep.johnson,at.this obligation,however,is not absolute.we have held that when a student falls under the responsibility of a different educational example,when a student becomes old enough to receive services from a school district rather than a preschool new agency need not provide a placement identical to that provided by the old agency.johnson,at.although the provision is meant to preserve the status quo,we recognize that when a student transfers educational jurisdictions,the status quo no longer exists.id.
the osep has stated that when a student transfers to a new district,and there is disagreement on appropriate placement,the new district must implement the last iep to the extent possible.letter to campbell,educ.for the handicapped osep,hereinafter letter to campbell.to the extent implementation of the old iep is impossible,the new district must provide services that approximate,as closely as possible,the old iep.id.we defer to and adopt the position of the osep in the letter to campbell because the osep is the agency responsible for monitoring and administering the idea and because the letter to campbell comports with the purposes of the idea see honig,at.we hold that when a dispute arises under the idea involving a transfer student,and there is disagreement between the parent and student new school district about the most appropriate educational placement,the new district will satisfy the idea if it implements the student last iep but if it is not possible for the new district to implement in full the student last iep,the new district must adopt a plan that approximates the student old iep as closely as possible.the plan thus adopted will serve the student until the dispute between parent and school district is resolved by agreement or by administrative hearing with due process.
in this case,while hearing was pending,the visd first attempted to approximate,and then replicated precisely,the educational goals contained in g iep,the last iep.at s insistence,the december,iep reflected precisely the same goals as the iep,even though g had been out of school for a full year in the interim,presumably gaining certain skills and relapsing in others.the visd did not,however,precisely replicate the educational environment of alternative school,the site of g iep.from the record it appears that the alternative school classroom represented an educational environment unique in washington,featuring an curriculum delivered by certified special education professionals in a largely mainstreamed social classroom.also,the visd special education teacher testified that although she could have designed an curriculum for g use in a general education classroom after observation in a special education context,she would have been unable to do so if g had simply been placed in a mainstream classroom from the first day.
given the idea explicit requirement of both an curriculum,see a,and social mainstreaming to the maximum extent appropriate,see,both the curriculum and the environment stake strong claims to be essential attributes of an iep.rowley,at.the use of appropriate in the language of the act,although by no means definitive,suggests that congress used the word as much to describe the settings in which handicapped children should be educated as to prescribe the substantive content or supportive services of their education.in most cases,there is an obvious tension between the two.see daniel,at.in g case,there was testimony that,at least as far as an immediate and temporary placement was concerned,the two were mutually exclusive.over time,it might have been possible to develop individualized curriculum for g in a mainstream environment,but the visd special education teacher stated that this would not have been possible without an interim evaluation period.
because implementation of g last iep would have been impossible in the visd,and because the explicitly temporary and malleable nature of the placement that the visd offered approximated the last iep as closely as possible under the circumstances,we conclude that the visd abided by the provisions of the idea during the pendency of hearing.
finally,s claims that the visd attempted to schedule the first meeting to initiate or change g placement on september,without prior written notice,contrary to statutory and regulatory command the visd does not contend that s received prior written notice of the september meeting,but disputes that the meeting triggered the visd legal obligation to provide notice before proposing to initiate or change placement.s asserts that the visd legal obligation to provide notice was triggered because the visd approved an interdistrict transfer for g on august.
the parties contest g status as of september.though neither party contends that g was a vashon island resident at that time,s claims that an interdistrict transfer had been approved on august,and that the september,meeting was therefore a meeting to determine g placement.the visd claims that no approval was granted on august,and submits as evidence the uncontroverted fact that s had not yet completed a transfer request form at that time.alj grant accepted the visd argument,but may have done so because of a faulty credibility determination.see supra at.the district court did not make a factual finding as to the august conversation,but noted that the visd stated that it would not accept g as a transfer student on s terms.this can be construed as an implied factual finding that no august approval took place.we conclude that the district court finding that g was not accepted as a transfer student as of august is not clearly erroneous.
s further alleges that the visd improperly attempted to schedule meetings for october,and november,without a general education teacher,over her protests and in violation of a,and.admin.code.
a requires the presence of the teacher.we have interpreted the teacher language in a to demand the presence of the student current teacher,even if the teacher is.see shapiro,at.because g was not enrolled in any district at the time of the scheduled meetings,and indeed,was entirely for the preceding year,we conclude that s presence,as g then current home school teacher,sufficed to meet the requirement in a.
pursuant to and.admin.code,the school shall include the teacher among several enumerated participants in the iep process,but also shall include o ther individuals at the discretion of the district or parent.while these federal and state regulatory provisions allow the parent to bring a participant of the parent choice or the district to bring a participant of its choice,these provisions do not allow the parent to demand that the district bring a individual,or vice versa.because the regulations do not mandate the visd to bring a general education teacher to the iep meeting,we conclude that the visd did not violate the requirements of or.
the visd was also required to notify s who will be in attendance,b.admin.code,at the october,and november,meetings although the visd october notice of the october meeting did not describe the attendees,s canceled the meeting because she had insufficient time to prepare,not because the participants were inadequate.the november notice described the attendees as required by the regulations.
although there were minor procedural violations in providing notice to s in the visd october,notice of the october,meeting,no harm was done because the visd november notice complied with procedural requirements of the idea.as we have previously stated,not every procedural violation amounts to a denial of a fape.amanda,at.we conclude that the visd technical errors did not amount to a procedural violation that denied g a fape.
substantive compliance 
s also claims that the visd violated the substantive provisions of the idea by failing to place g,to the maximum extent appropriate,in a general education environment with normally developing peers.see b b.this requirement is sometimes referred to as the idea strong preference for mainstreaming or placement in the least restrictive environment.see rowley,at.id.at.the act requires participating states to educate handicapped children with nonhandicapped children whenever possible.poolaw bishop,cir the idea requires states receiving federal assistance for the education of disabled children to establish procedures to assure that,to the maximum extent appropriate,handicapped children are educated with children who are not handicapped.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.this alleged substantive violation is related to,albeit distinct from,the alleged procedural error in refusing to implement g last iep,which featured substantial mainstreaming 
we have developed a test to determine whether a student placement represents the least restrictive environment.we consider 
the academic benefits of placement in a mainstream setting,with any supplementary aides and services that might be appropriate the benefits of mainstream placement,such as language and behavior models provided by students the negative effects the student presence may have on the teacher and other students and the cost of educating the student in a mainstream environment.

the first factor requires us to analyze the educational benefits available to the child in a regular classroom,supplemented with appropriate aids and services,as compared to the educational benefits of a special education classroom.bd.of educ.holland,aff sub,rachel,at.a school district is not required to attempt a placement in a regular education classroom before choosing an alternative to mainstreaming.poolaw,at.instead,a district may,without running afoul of the idea,rely upon the reports of another school district when developing its own iep as long as the information relied upon is still relevant.id.g last iep,the iep from alternative school,indicated that she received a fully individualized special education academic curriculum.evidence from g placement at alternative school during the school year also indicated that she would not perform well academically in a regular education classroom because her math and written language skills were about three years behind comparable general education students and because she scored in the percentile for math calculation,applied problems and broad written language.moreover,g had been out of school for a full year before arriving in the visd without the opportunity to conduct an assessment,it is reasonable to assume that g would have fallen,academically,further behind her peers.although federal courts have found that a child must be educated in a regular classroom if the child can receive a satisfactory education there,even if it is not the best academic setting for the child,holland.at emphasis added,we conclude that given the available information,it was not clear that g academic progress would have been satisfactory with temporary placement in a general education classroom.the first factor weighs in favor of special education.
the second factor looks to the benefits of mainstream placement.we conclude that g would have benefitted from the benefits of mainstream placement.a mainstream placement would give g the opportunity to form social relationships with children who are not disabled and might have helped to improve g.additionally,a mainstream placement would give g the benefit of the language and behavior models provided by students.although g had some difficulty in earlier mainstream environments at bagley in,her placement with normally developing peers was generally successful.the second factor weighs in favor of mainstreaming.
the third factor requires us to examine the negative effects the student presence may have on the teacher and other students.there was some evidence that g had demanded substantial attention from others in her placement,and that lingering problems with personal space continued into.more important,given the requirement that g be provided an individually appropriate educational curriculum,placing g in a general education environment would have drawn substantial time and effort from the teacher.the certified special education teacher at the visd testified that she would have found it extremely difficult to create an individualized curriculum for g in a general education classroom,without an initial evaluation period it is reasonable to conclude that the general education staff would have found this even more cumbersome.although g did not have a history of behavior problems as severe as in other cases evaluating the propriety of mainstreaming,see,clyde,at,we conclude that the visd interim placement for g was appropriate to mitigate negative effects on the teacher and other students.the third factor weighs in favor of a special education environment.
finally,the fourth factor requires us to examine the cost of educating the student in a mainstream environment.because the visd concedes that it did not consider the fourth factor of cost,we conclude that cost would have not prevented placement of g in a mainstream environment.
weighing the rachel factors above,we conclude that,in light of the flexible and temporary nature of the plan,the visd interim placement was substantively proper under the idea,and provided for mainstreaming to the extent appropriate.

g spent lunch with all other students,and then spent a portion of the afternoon in physical education,art,and movement electives with smaller,changing subgroups of other students.both lunch and the elective periods involved a mix of general education and special education students.
s,however,claims that on august,walls informed her that an interdistrict transfer had been verbally approved although the official transfer request form had not yet been completed and that the visd had decided that g would be placed in a,special education program.walls claims that options were discussed,but disputes both that the transfer had been approved and that any particular placement offer was made.
on october,s wrote walls to inform her that she did not intend to g s maintained that because g was a permanent resident on september,the initial enrollment was valid,and remained so.

at oral argument we clarified why the visd failed to obtain the iep when it developed its first proposed temporary iep the court how did the mistake come to be it comes to be realized when the parent does agree to meet with the visd,and she comes in and says why are you looking at this iep it not the most recent court so it the parent who finally draws the district attention to that correct.
the only differences between the december plan and the iep consisted of the total amount of time in school and the extent to which that time was characterized as general education or special education.

some courts,following the normal practice in reviewing an administrative decision,have considered such a judgment to be a grant of summary judgment some have considered it to be a judgment after a bench trial on a stipulated record from the administrative hearing supplemented by additional evidence.we recognized and approved the unusual procedure in ojai unified sch.dist.jackson,cir see also capistrano unified sch.dist.wartenberg,cir.
the ospi was joined as a defendant when s appealed the administrative rulings to the district court.s alleged that ospi improperly failed to intervene in the dispute between s and the visd and that ospi improperly failed to provide direct educational services to g when the visd did not give an appropriate placement.because s did not raise these arguments directly in her opening brief,upon receiving the brief,ospi moved to be dismissed as a party.on december,the appellate commissioner denied ospi motion without prejudice to renewing the arguments in the answering brief.ospi has now done so,and we assess the issue as follows in united states ullah,cir,we explained the standard for considering arguments raised only on reply we will not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant opening brief.three main exceptions to that rule exist.first,we will review an issue not present in an opening brief for good cause shown,fed.app,or if a failure to do so would result in manifest injustice.second,w e have discretion to review an issue not raised by appellant when it is raised in the appellee brief.third,we may review an issue if the failure to raise the issue properly did not prejudice the defense of the opposing.at internal citations omitted.here,ospi briefed applicable arguments in its own reply brief.there is no prejudice to ospi which can not be considered to be surprised by arguments it briefed itself.the use of our discretion is appropriate to consider s claims against,to gain federal financial assistance under the idea,a state must demonstrate that it has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all eligible children receive a fape this includes monitoring and regulatory action by the state educational agency,in washington the ospi.code.but the state also has a more specific duty to provide direct services when a local district refuses or wrongfully neglects to provide a handicapped child with a free appropriate education.doe by gonzales maher,cir,aff by an equally divided court sub,honig doe,d see also d.the state is not obliged to intervene directly in an individual case whenever the local agency falls short of its responsibiliti
