plaintiff paul scarbrough,the former elected school superintendent for morgan county,tennessee,was not appointed to the new position as the director of schools for the county system following the publication of a newspaper article which announced that he would be the featured speaker at a convention sponsored by a church with a predominantly homosexual congregation.he sued the morgan county board of education and some of its individual members under several constitutional rights,including freedom of speech,freedom of association,free exercise of religion,and equal protection of the law.the district court dismissed the case,finding that inasmuch as scarbrough had not gone to the convention or spoken in the church,he had no first amendment right to protect.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
factual and procedural background 
in,scarbrough was elected superintendent of morgan county schools.the position of elected school superintendent expired by law in tennessee on august,the new law provided for appointment of a director of would perform the same duties as the the local board of education.the morgan county board of education enlisted the aid of the tennessee school boards association tsba to prepare for the search and interview process for a new school director.five candidates were selected by the tsba for the board consideration.scarbrough and david freels,superintendent of morgan county schools,were among these five candidates.
in march or april,a friend approached scarbrough and asked him to say a prayer at a convention breakfast being hosted by the metropolitan community church of knoxville metro.scarbrough was unaware at the time that metro had a predominantly gay and lesbian congregation.he initially agreed to the request,but later realized he had a scheduling conflict and notified his friend that he would be unable to attend.the friend then asked scarbrough to speak at the convention,which scarbrough agreed to consider.ultimately he was unable to accept the invitation and so declined.
on may,the knoxville newspaper published an article scarbrough,the morgan county superintendent,would be a speaker at the convention.the article further stated that metro was a predominantly gay and lesbian christian church.however,scarbrough had declined the speaking engagement after metro supplied the information to the.thereafter,scarbrough provided written statements to two local newspapers explaining the inaccuracies in the article.the published statements maintained that scarbrough had declined the speaking engagement and further noted that he did not endorse,uphold,or understand homosexuality,but that he would not refuse to associate with gay people or refuse the opportunity to share with them his beliefs.
after the article ran,board members perry spurling,conrad strand,and debra lively received complaints from morgan county constituents critical of scarbrough agreement to speak at the metro convention.some constituents expressed the concern that scarbrough should not be appointed director of schools.spurling,strand,lively,and randy harlan became concerned that scarbrough was putting the school stamp of approval on homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle.additionally,although scarbrough did not know of or consent to the article prior to publication,the board members believed that the article called scarbrough judgment into question,undermined public confidence in him,and impaired his ability to function effectively as chief administrator of the school system.
the board interviewed the five candidates between may and may.it subsequently narrowed the field from five candidates to three,of which david freels was the third choice.scarbrough was the board fourth choice out of five candidates.after the first and second choices withdrew from consideration,the board selected freels as the new director of schools,effective september.consequently,scarbrough submitted an application for retirement.
scarbrough alleged that after the publication of the article,the attitudes of defendant board members changed and another,candidate freels was selected over him for director of schools.scarbrough brought this action pursuant to and article i,and of the tennessee constitution for violations of his rights to freedom of speech,association,and exercise of religion,and to equal protection of the laws.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.farhat jopke,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact as to an essential element of the party case.c.where there are no disputed facts,we determine,de novo,whether the district court properly applied the substantive law.see sutton cleveland bd.of,cir.
ii.discussion 
scarbrough claims that the board violated his rights to freedom of speech,association,and religion as guaranteed by the first amendment,and deprived him of equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.specifically,he claims that when the board denied him the position of director of schools,it was retaliating against him for exercising his first amendment freedoms and treating him differently than similarly situated applicants based only upon their animus toward homosexuals.
first amendment retaliation 
scarbrough first complains that he was deprived of a government employment opportunity in retaliation for his exercise of first amendment protected activities.specifically,he alleges that the board selected freels over him for director of schools because of his tentative agreement to speak at the metro convention.
in order for an employee to establish a claim of first amendment retaliation,the employee must demonstrate that he engaged in constitutionally protected speech or conduct an adverse action was taken against him that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct and there is a causal connection between elements one and is,the adverse action was motivated at least in part by his protected conduct.blatter,cir en banc.thus,in the instant case,the dispositive question is whether scarbrough protected conduct caused the board not to choose him for the position.
freedom of speech 
the first amendment prohibits retaliation by a public employer against an employee on the basis of certain instances of protected speech by the employee.see connick myers,d pickering board of,d.however,w hile public employees may not be required to sacrifice their first amendment free speech rights in order to obtain or continue their employment,a state is afforded greater leeway to control speech that threatens to undermine the state ability to perform its legitimate functions.rodgers banks,cir internal citations omitted.thus,courts apply a inquiry for discerning when the discharge of a public employee violates the first amendment.see rose stephens,cir.the threshold question is whether the employee speech may be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern.id.quoting dambrot central michigan,cir.if the speech relates to a matter of public concern,then the court employs the balancing test outlined in pickering board of education,d,to determine if the employee free speech interests outweigh the efficiency interests of the government as employer.id.this sort of balancing test recognizes the tension that sometimes arises in guaranteeing first amendment protection to citizens who are linked to the government.
in pickering,the court held impermissible under the first amendment the dismissal of a high school teacher for openly criticizing the board of education allocation of school funds between athletics and education and its methods of informing taxpayers of the need for additional revenue.regarding the board assertion that the letter was detrimental to the operation of the schools,the court stated that 
t he only way in which the board could conclude,absent any evidence of the actual effect of the letter,that the statements contained therein were per se detrimental to the interest of the schools was to equate the board members own interests with that of the schools.certainly an accusation that too much money is being spent on athletics can not reasonably be regarded as per se detrimental to the district schools.such an accusation reflects rather a difference of opinion between pickering and the board as to the preferable manner of operating the school system,a difference of opinion that clearly concerns an issue of general public interest.
id.at.after recognizing the public interest in having free and unhindered debate on matters of public importance,the court held that a teacher exercise of his right to speak on issues of public importance may not furnish the basis for his dismissal from public employment.id.at.
cases following pickering also involved protecting speech on matters of public concern.see connick,at.pickering and its progeny emphasized the right of a public employee as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern.see givhan western line consol.sch,d healthy city school dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d and perry sindermann,d.to this end,the court announced in connick,at,that when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern,but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest,absent the most unusual circumstances,a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee behavior.connick erected a dichotomy between citizens speaking on matters of public concern and employees speaking on matters only of personal interest,and laid out the analysis for both.an initial challenge before us is placing the instant case in one of the two categories,where the facts do not yield an apparent classification.
we disagree with the conclusion of the district court that no speech occurred here.scarbrough agreed to pray or speak before the metro congregation.the knoxville and others reacted as though scarbrough was going to make or did make the speech in question.therefore,we will proceed to analyze scarbrough case under the traditional tests.
a threshold question that must be answered is whether scarbrough intended speech touched on a matter of public concern.matters of public concern include speech that relates to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.rankin mcpherson,d see also connick,at.noting that when employee expression can not be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices.speech made to a public audience,outside the workplace,and involving content largely unrelated to government employment indicates that the employee speaks as a citizen,not as an employee,and speaks on a matter of public concern.united states treasury employees union,d w hether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.moreover,the entire speech does not have to address matters of public concern,as long as some portion of the speech does so.farhat,at quoting connick,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
while scarbrough intended speech eludes easy categorization,we conclude that it did touch on a matter of public concern,given its content,form,and context.although it perhaps would not have fallen within the line of cases primarily addressing speech of government employees on matters relating to their employment,see,connick,at,givhan,at,and pickering,at,it would have fallen within the line of cases involving speech unrelated to government employment and made on an employee own time.in national treasury employees union,at,the supreme court held that the government can not prohibit federal employees from receiving compensation for writing and speaking about matters not related to their employment.there,as here,the vast majority of the speech at issue does not involve the subject matter of government employment and takes place outside the workplace.id.scarbrough intended prayer or speech before the metro congregation did not take place at his office or relate to his work with the morgan county schools in any way,nor did his intended appearance before that conference.instead,his speech concerned religion and perhaps homosexuality,and was to occur on his own free time,much like the speech at issue in national treasury employees union.moreover,there is precedent for recognizing that certain private remarks touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to pickering balancing.san diego roe,d citing rankin mcpherson,d,in which the supreme court found a clerical employee wrongly dismissed for remarking,after hearing of an attempt on the life of the united states president,if they go for him again,i hope they get him.
pickering balancing 
because scarbrough intended speech on his religious views and on homosexuality are matters of public concern,we will apply the pickering balancing test to scarbrough speech to discern whether his interest in engaging in such speech outweighs the board interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering,at.
in performing the pickering balancing test,the speech will not be considered in a vacuum the manner,time,and place of the employee expression are relevant,as is the context in which the dispute arose.rankin,at.pertinent considerations include whether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among,has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary,or impedes the performance of the speaker duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.id.citing pickering,at.see also rodgers,at.speech and conduct that occur outside the office walls and that do not relate to work interfere less with office efficiency than conduct that occurs inside the office or that relates to the employee work.see connick,at.noting that because speech occurred at work it interfered more than the speech at issue in pickering.
scarbrough interest in sharing his religious beliefs with the metro congregation and the community at large is protected conduct.his intended speech did not occur at work or during work hours it was to occur before the religious convention.his meetings regarding the convention also took place outside the office.moreover,his conduct and intended speech did not relate to his employment in any way.as he clarified in a newspaper interview,he did do it as a morgan county superintendent of schools but as an individual and friend of the man who invited him.
the board primary contention with scarbrough speech is that it had a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary,or impede d the performance of the speaker duties or interfere d with the regular operation of the enterprise.rankin,at.some board members claim that scarbrough agreement to speak at the metro convention created an atmosphere in which work would be difficult.they insist that neither they,the board,nor the morgan county community condone homosexuality,and,thus,both the board and the community disagree with scarbrough decision to speak at the convention and with his religious beliefs,which counsel him to share his faith with others and to embrace those individuals whose lifestyles may diverge from his own.this disagreement aroused tensions between the board and scarbrough,which led to an inefficient work atmosphere.however,this line of argument reveals that the detrimental impact on the work environment results directly from scarbrough intended speech and his religious beliefs.it would contravene the intent of the first amendment to permit the board effectively to terminate scarbrough for his speech and religious beliefs in this way.thus,the issue for the finder of fact is whether the protected conduct was the cause of the board refusal to hire scarbrough.
there is,however,a narrow band of speech that is not constitutionally protected even if it relates to a matter of public concern and outweighs the government interest in efficiency.in rose stephens,cir,we held that where a confidential or policymaking public employee is discharged on the basis of speech related to his political or policy views,the pickering balance favors the government as a matter of law.id.at adopting the exception,which permits termination of public employees in policymaking or other confidential positions based solely on their political affiliation without violating the first amendment.in creating this exception to what would otherwise constitute first amendment violations,the rose court emphasized that the exception was based on protecting the interests of the government in situations where loyalty by employees is an essential requirement for the efficient functioning of the workplace.id.at.
the concerns expressed in rose are not applicable to the case at hand.certainly scarbrough expression does not directly implicate the loyalty requirements of his position and would unfairly be characterized as insubordination.although the position of director of schools is a policymaking position,as state law delegates discretion to the director,scarbrough speech and conduct do not implicate either his political position or his substantive policy views.
furthermore,scarbrough adequately demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact that renders summary judgment for board members strand,spurling and lively improper.there is sufficient evidence on the record to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that but for scarbrough protected expression,strand,spurling and lively would have voted for him and not freels.kay johnson said in an affidavit that strand,spurling and lively told her that they would not vote for scarbrough because of his association with homosexuals.johnson alleged that strand told her,i just ca support him going up there to that church up there for them gay people.she further alleged that spurling stated that he could not vote for a man who would pray or speak in a place where gay people were present,and lively stated that she and scarbrough agreed on almost everything,but that she could not vote for a person who associated with gay people.similarly,scarbrough stated in his deposition that before strand and spurling learned of his views they both informed him that they would vote for him and that they did not like freels.he also stated that spurling told him that lively and harlan might vote for him.in the final board vote,after learning of scarbrough views,both strand and spurling voted against him.
there is also substantial evidence that spurling and strand treated scarbrough differently after learning that scarbrough believed associating with homosexuals was not immoral or improper.more specifically,scarbrough testified at his deposition that after strand learned of his views,he stopped speaking with scarbrough.he further testified that spurling stopped dropping by his office in the mornings.additionally,board member ruppe stated in her deposition that she noticed both strand and spurling treated scarbrough differently after they learned of his views.
the board argues that because strand voted for scarbrough in a preliminary vote on may,after learning of scarbrough views,strand clearly did not vote against scarbrough in the final vote based on these views.however,the record suggests that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to strand motivation.first,on may,strand had the opportunity to vote for three candidates,the third of whom was scarbrough.at the final vote,only david freels was considered.thus,his vote for scarbrough does not evidence an intent to support scarbrough over freels.in fact,one could argue that the order of his votes evidences the opposite,although it is unclear that the order of the votes had any meaning.even if strand had voted for scarbrough over freels at the may vote,it does not mean that he did not change his mind before the final vote based on scarbrough speech.in light of the apparent local controversy and strand opposition to homosexuality,this is not an unreasonable inference.therefore,the may vote is not dispositive but simply evidence for a jury to consider against scarbrough claim.
a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to lively motivation.she testified that she never supported scarbrough and scarbrough admitted that he did not expect lively to support him on may,but johnson affidavit is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact.scarbrough only other evidence that lively would have voted for him if he had not exercised his first amendment rights is from an affidavit from patricia jones,who worked with lively,stating that prior to the knoxville article,lively never spoke against scarbrough.however,that is proof of nothing.
the district court properly dismissed scarbrough first amendment claims against harlan.the only evidence scarbrough submitted to show that harlan voted against scarbrough based on scarbrough protected expression is that harlan believed homosexuality to be immoral and disagreed with scarbrough decision to associate with homosexuals.there is no evidence that harlan was ever going to vote for scarbrough,and harlan testified that even absent scarbrough conduct he would not have voted for scarbrough.harlan beliefs about homosexuality,without more,are insufficient to allow a jury to determine that harlan voted against scarbrough based on such beliefs.
we thus reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on scarbrough first amendment retaliation claim as to strand,spurling and lively and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to harlan.
freedom of association and free exercise of religion 
scarbrough claims that the board actions,in addition to violating his first amendment right to freedom of speech,violate his rights to freedom of association and the free exercise of religion.because the analytic tools for adjudicating first amendment retaliation claims under the free speech clause have been so extensively developed,courts in this and other circuits have tended to import fully that reasoning when litigants have characterized their claims as arising under another first amendment clause,at.accordingly,scarbrough free exercise and association claims should be analyzed under the first amendment analysis discussed above and dismissed insofar as scarbrough construes them as independent claims.
equal protection 
scarbrough also contends that the board violated the equal protection clause in failing to rehire him as director of schools.he claims a violation first because the board allegedly was motivated by animus,or involved a discriminatory classification,and second because the board adverse action allegedly was based upon scarbrough exercise of his first amendment rights.
the equal protection clause prohibits a state from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.am.xiv.the clause embodies the principle that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.fundamentally,the clause protects against invidious discrimination among individuals or implicating fundamental rights.the threshold element of an equal protection claim is disparate treatment once disparate treatment is shown,the equal protection analysis to be applied is determined by the classification used by government.
the board is not subject to strict scrutiny because its conduct neither infringes on a class of people fundamental rights nor targets a member of a suspect class.first,scarbrough pleadings and the evidence adduced in discovery indicate that only he was deprived of his fundamental right to associate.the supreme court has only applied strict scrutiny to equal protection claims where the plaintiff alleges that the government infringes on the fundamental right of a class of people.see zablocki redhail,d striking down a statute that required the class of persons having minor issue not in their custody and which they are under obligation to support by any
