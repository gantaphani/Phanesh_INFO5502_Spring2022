despite his education,mason has had difficulty putting his education to use because of a learning disability that has affected his ability to concentrate,focus on details,read,and write.mason mother testified that he was diagnosed with the learning disability in the third grade,and that she initially thought that he would be unable to complete high school.mason did,however,finish high school,and then served in the army and national guard for eight years.following his service,mason enrolled at boise state,and earned a philosophy degree in.after college,mason took the law school admission test and applied to law school.despite his low test scores and gpa,mason was accepted at gonzaga university law school.although mason initially struggled in law school,the university provided for special testing accommodations,and mason earned his law degree in.

standard of review 
because we are in as good a position as the bap to review bankruptcy court rulings,we independently examine the bankruptcy court decision,reviewing the bankruptcy court interpretation of the bankruptcy code de novo and its factual findings for clear error.miller cardinale in re deville,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we have held that whether repayment of a student loan debt would impose an undue hardship requires a determination of the legal effect of the bankruptcy court findings regarding the student circumstances,a question of law which we review de novo.rifino united states in re rifino,cir.
discussion 
an educational loan is dischargeable in bankruptcy if excepting such debt from discharge would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.a.to determine if excepting student debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship,we apply the test first enunciated in in re brunner,at.see united student aid funds,pena in re pena,cir adopting the brunner test.under the brunner test,the debtor must prove that he can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if required to repay the loans additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period and the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.id.at brunner,at.t he burden of proving undue hardship is on the debtor,and the debtor must prove all three elements before discharge can be granted.in re rifino,at citation omitted.
minimal standard of living 
the first prong of the brunner test requires that mason prove that he can not maintain a minimal standard of living if he were required to repay the loans.see in re saxman,at in re rifino,at.the bankruptcy court found that mason average monthly income generally fluctuated between and per month,and that in some months it was below that amount.the bankruptcy court also found that mason necessary average monthly expenses,excluding his loan payments,were between and per month.based on these findings,the bankruptcy court concluded that mason satisfied the first prong of the brunner test because he would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living if required to repay the loans.
the method for calculating a debtor average monthly expenses is a matter properly left to the discretion of the bankruptcy court.in re pena,at.because ecmc does not dispute the bankruptcy court findings regarding mason monthly income and expenses,we will not disturb them.see.higher educ.assistance agency birrane in re birrane,cir 
ii.additional circumstances 
the second prong of the brunner test requires a debtor to prove that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.in re brunner,at.we recently clarified that a debtor does not have a separate burden to prove additional circumstances,beyond the inability to pay presently or in the future.educ.credit mgmt.nys in re nys,cir holding that that bankruptcy court erred in requiring debtor to show exceptional circumstances beyond the inability to pay in the present and a likely inability to pay in the future.
here,the bankruptcy court found that mason learning disability,and his inability to put his law degree to use,were additional circumstances indicating that mason financial circumstances would not improve for a significant period of time.ecmc argues that the bankruptcy court erred because mason presented legally insufficient evidence of any disability mason should not be permitted to rely on a preexisting circumstance,a disability that predated his decision to take out the loans and despite mason learning disability,there is every indication that mason situation will improve.
ecmc first mason presented legally insufficient evidence of his being raised for the first time on appeal heretofore,ecmc has never disputed the existence of mason learning disability.in fact,ecmc own vocational expert acknowledged that mason had a learning disability that might affect his performance.see in re burnett,at holding that an argument is generally considered waived if n
