a middle school recommended that a student,be expelled from school because she was involved in repeated acts of fighting.after a series of hearings,the san diego unified school district district agreed with this recommendation and expelled from its schools.under state law,this type of offense can lead to an expulsion,but a school principal has the discretion to decide not to refer the matter to the governing school board for an expulsion hearing.under the district zero tolerance administrative regulations,a school principal or designee has no such discretion and referral is mandatory.asserted a facial challenge to these administrative regulations,claiming they violate state law and are unconstitutional.the trial court agreed and entered judgment enjoining the district from enforcing the challenged regulations.the district appeals.we conclude the challenged regulations do not violate applicable state law or constitutional principles and reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
a at kroc middle school kroc observed,age,physically fighting with another student.had been involved in two previous fighting incidents during the school year.under the district zero tolerance rules,the suspended,and referred her to the district placement and appeal office for an expulsion hearing.a hearing was then held before a panel expulsion review panel,consisting of administrators from other schools.several people testified at the hearing,including kroc and kroc campus supervisor,who both witnessed latest fight.also testified,and her mother was present at the hearing.
after considering the evidence,the expulsion review panel found willfully used force in attempting to cause physical injury to another student,and this was third fighting incident in the past school year.the panel found expulsion was a proper remedy because o ther means of correction are not feasible and continued presence at the school causes a continuing danger to the physical safety of herself and others.the panel found that o ther means of correction have repeatedly failed to bring about proper conduct as evidenced by five previous suspensions for,sexual harassment,and physical injury the panel further found had previously engaged in assault and battery and drug offenses.the panel also noted that had signed a zero tolerance contract,and received numerous previous warnings and discipline by school officials.the panel found that misconduct was not caused by any disability,and that she had been appropriately placed at the time she committed the misconduct.
based on these findings,the expulsion review panel recommended that be expelled from district schools,but recommended that enforcement of the expulsion order be suspended and be placed in an alternative program,with specified conditions including that she not violate any school rules.the board of education board agreed with the panel factual findings and recommendations.
several days after being placed in the alternative program,was suspended because she violated a school rule when she engaged in a physical confrontation with a school staff member.based on this incident,the district reinstated the expulsion order.was thereafter placed in a community school,where she was allegedly sexually harassed and physically assaulted by older male students.
then brought a civil action against the district and several parties allegedly involved in,or responsible for,the community school incident.after granting the district demurrer on the personal injury causes of action,the court severed the remaining claims against the district because they were unrelated to the community school incident.in these claims,alleged the district zero tolerance policy of requiring a principal to recommend an expulsion hearing for a student who has committed certain offenses violates state statutes and is unconstitutional and the district policy of not providing a full evidentiary hearing before revoking a suspended expulsion order violates state statutes and is unconstitutional.
these claims were tried before the court on a documentary record,consisting of the district administrative regulations,form notices sent to parents,and the legislative history of various statutes.at the trial,counsel reiterated that claims against the district constituted a facial challenge to the district policies and were not dependent on the particular facts of case.sought only injunctive and declaratory relief.
after considering the submitted documents and lengthy arguments by counsel,the court found proved her claims that the district mandatory referral policies violate applicable statutes and violate a student due process rights,and that the district rules improperly permit expulsions for offenses not identified in the state statutes but the court found against on her challenge to the procedures for revoking a suspended expulsion decision.the court thus entered judgment enjoining the district from enforcing or utilizing its zero tolerance policy to the extent the policy requires a principal or superintendent to recommend expulsion of pupils in circumstances other than those circumstances explicitly identified in the education code as requiring a recommendation for expulsion from a principal or superintendent.the court then stayed enforcement of the injunction pending resolution of all appeals.
the district appeals from the portions of the judgment finding the district mandatory expulsion recommendation procedures violate state statutes and a student due process rights and the district regulations too broadly define the offenses that can support an expulsion and thereby violate a student statutory and due process rights.did not appeal from the portion of the judgment upholding the district procedures for revoking a suspended expulsion and we therefore do not address the revocation issue in this appeal.
discussion 
statutory scheme 
the legislature has developed a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the suspension and expulsion of students.education code section states a student may be suspended from school or recommended for expulsion for committing one of identified offenses three other statutes provide additional grounds for expulsion section sexual harassment section hate violence and section harassment,threats,or intimidation.these three statutes,together with section,establish the exclusive grounds for which a student may be suspended or expelled.see slayton pomona unified school dist.d.
another statutory provision,section,sets forth mandatory procedures that a school district must follow before the district may expel a student who has committed one of these identified expulsion offenses.these required procedures are detailed and extensive.every student is entitled to a hearing to be held within schooldays after the date the principal or superintendent of schools determines that the pupil has committed any of the acts permitting expulsion,subd.a.at the hearing,the school district must permit the student and parent to appear,be represented by legal counsel or a nonattorney adviser,obtain copies of all documents to be presented,and present oral and documentary evidence,subd.b.the school district must provide written notice at least calendar days before the hearing,and the notice shall include the date and place of the hearing a statement of the specific facts and charges upon which the proposed expulsion is based a copy of the disciplinary rules of the district that relate to the alleged violation a notice of the obligations regarding the consequences of expulsion notice of the opportunity for the student and parent to appear in person and to be represented by legal counsel or a nonattorney adviser and notice of the right to inspect and produce evidence,subd.b.the administrative panel may issue subpoenas at the request of the school superintendent or the pupil,subd.i.a record of the hearing must be maintained,subd.k.
the governing school board is the entity charged with conducting the expulsion hearing,subd.c.however,the governing school board may delegate the initial hearing function to an impartial administrative panel of three or more certificated persons,none of whom is a member of the board or employed on the staff of the school in which the pupil is enrolled,subd.d.after the hearing,the hearing panel must determine whether to recommend the expulsion of the pupil to the governing board,subd.e.if the panel recommends expulsion,supporting factual findings must be prepared and submitted to the governing board,and those findings must be based on the evidence presented at the hearing,subd.f.
the school board then must hold a hearing to determine whether it accepts the hearing panel recommendation for expulsion,subd.j.the school board must base this conclusion on the hearing panel factual findings on the results of any supplementary hearing.ibid.final action to expel a student must be conducted at a public hearing,and the governing board must thereafter provide written notice to the of the right to appeal the expulsion to the county board of education.ibid.
in addition to setting forth the procedures for conducting the expulsion hearing,the legislature specified the circumstances for triggering an expulsion hearing and the findings that must be made at these hearings.these in three primary set forth in section.
first,with respect to certain very serious offenses,the legislature provided that t he principal or superintendent of schools shall recommend expulsion of a pupil that he or she determines has committed any of the following acts at school or at a school activity off school grounds possessing,selling or otherwise furnishing a firearm brandishing a knife at another person.unlawfully selling a controlled substance committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault or committing a sexual battery or possession of an explosive,subd.c,italics added.if the governing board finds a student committed one of these offenses,the school board must order expulsion,subd.c.these offenses will hereafter be referred to as the most serious offenses.
second,with respect to the next level of expulsion offenses,the legislature provided that the principal or the superintendent of schools shall recommend the expulsion of a pupil,unless the principal or superintendent finds that expulsion is inappropriate,due to the particular circumstance,subd.a,italics added.the offenses to which this provision applies are causing serious physical injury to another person,except in possession of any knife or other dangerous object of no reasonable use to the pupil and unlawful possession of any controlled substance with certain exceptions for less than one ounce of marijuana,subd.a.with respect to these offenses,a school board can not expel a student unless it also finds one of the following o ther means of correction are not feasible or have repeatedly failed to bring about proper conduct or d ue to the nature of the act,the presence of the pupil causes a continuing danger to the physical safety of the pupil or others,subd.b.
third,with respect to the remaining statutory expulsion offenses,the legislature did not provide a mandatory or presumptive referral requirement,and instead stated upon recommendation by the principal,superintendent of schools,or by a hearing officer or administrative panel,the governing board may order a pupil expelled upon finding that the pupil violated the identified statutory expulsion ground,subd.e.with respect to these offenses,a student can not be expelled unless it is found that other means of correction are not feasible or have repeatedly failed to bring about proper conduct or due to the nature of the violation,the presence of the pupil causes a continuing danger to the physical safety of the pupil or others,subd.e.additionally,with respect to certain of these offenses,an expulsion may be ordered only if the student committed the act at school or during a school activity.see,subd.e.
ii.district regulations 
to implement these statutes,the district promulgated administrative procedure rule governing expulsions in district schools rule under rule,the district gave its placement and appeal office the responsibility for convening an expulsion review panel to conduct hearings on expulsion referrals and to make recommendations to the board.rule,part.the expulsion review panel must be composed of impartial certificated managers and school vice principals.ibid.
rule,part,states that a student may not be suspended from school or recommended for expulsion unless the superintendent or principal of the school determines that the student has violated one or more of the following causes as is relevant here,those identified causes are essentially identical to the causes identified in the education code.see,subds.a q.
rule,part,then sets forth the procedural requirements for the expulsion hearing process.these requirements mirror the statutory requirements contained in section,mandating that students be given extensive procedural rights,including the right to written notice of all charges,the right to an oral hearing during which evidence is presented,the right to counsel,the right to have the decision based on the evidence presented,the right to a neutral factfinder,and the right to appeal.
rule,parts,and,then specify the circumstances under which a principal must refer a student to the expulsion review panel for a hearing.these provisions are part of the district zero tolerance policies.part provides that the school principal or designee must immediately suspend and recommend for expulsion a pupil that he or she determines has committed any of the following acts at school or at a school activity off school grounds italics added.the listed acts are identical to the most serious offenses in the education code,subd.c.part provides that t he school principal or designee shall suspend and recommend for expulsion all students who possess a firearm,knife,explosive or any other dangerous object in school are involved in three or more incidents of fighting that inflicts injury or trespassing within one year furnish,sells,or possess an amount of an identified controlled substance determined to be for more than personal use commit a third violation involving the use and possession of any dangerous or prohibited substance,other than tobacco or commit a fourth violation of the policy prohibiting tobacco use.italics added.part provides that the school principal or designee shall suspend and recommend for expulsion a student who has committed any of the following acts at school or at a school activity off school grounds italics added.the offenses listed in this section are the same as those listed in section,subdivision a.
for purposes of this appeal,the critical point is that the expulsion recommendation requirements in rule,parts and,are broader than those identified in the education code.section,subdivisions a and e provide the school principal with a level of discretion to decide not to refer a student for an expulsion hearing if the principal subjectively believes the particular circumstances do not warrant an expulsion even though the principal has found the student did commit the offense.parts and eliminate this discretion and require the principal to recommend a student for an expulsion hearing if the principal finds the student committed the expulsion offense.despite this difference,the education code and the district administrative regulations are consistent in that the district regulations do not necessarily require an expulsion for these requirement is only that the matter be heard by an objective hearing panel.
iii.analysis 
statutory.governing review standards 
the trial court found rule facially violates the education code because it permits expulsions in two circumstances that are not permitted under the state statutes and eliminates a school principal statutory discretion to decide not to refer for an expulsion hearing a student who has committed an expulsion offense.
in evaluating the propriety of these findings,we independently determine the meaning of the relevant statutes and ascertain the legislature intent.in so doing,we consider first the words of the statute because they are generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.woodbury th,d.we must construe the language in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.ibid.statutory construction rules are not to be rigidly applied in isolation the correct construction of a statute is not divorced from its context.see fremont union high sch.dist.santa clara county bd.of education d.
we must also construe the statutes keeping in mind the legislature expressed intent to provide each school district with broad discretion and flexibility to accomplish its educational mission.a school district may initiate and carry on any program,activity,or may otherwise act in any manner which is not in conflict with or inconsistent with,or preempted by,any law and which is not in conflict with the purposes for which school districts are established.this statute was intended to give school districts broad authority to carry on activities and programs which,in the determination of the governing board of the school district are necessary or desirable in meeting their needs,subd.b.thus,section must be liberally construed to effect this objective,subd.b.the legislature recognized that school districts have diverse needs unique to their individual communities and programs i n addressing their needs,school districts should have the flexibility to create their own unique solutions,subd.a see san rafael elementary school dist.state bd.of education th,d.
in applying the correct review principles,it is additionally relevant that did not challenge the district regulations as applied to her own case.instead,statutory and constitutional challenges were facial challenges to the district regulations.see hatch superior court th,d.a facial challenge is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the law would be valid.id.at,d.the moving party must show that the challenged statutes or regulations inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable prohibitions.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.
mandatory versus discretionary reference 
the trial court found the district regulations violate state law because they eliminate a school principal statutory discretion to decide not to recommend a student for an expulsion hearing.
absent a specific statutory limitation,a school district is free to act as it sees fit within the purposes for which it was established.las virgenes educators las virgenes unified school dist.th,d see dawson east side union high school dist.th,d.c ourts should give substantial deference to the decisions of local school districts and boards within the scope of their broad discretion,and should intervene only in clear cases of abuse of discretion where the acts are clearly inconsistent with state law or constitutional principles.dawson,supra,th at,d.
although the district expulsion requirements are different from the statutory requirements in that they eliminate a school principal discretion to decide not to recommend a student for an expulsion hearing,this difference does not mean the regulations are inconsistent with the applicable statutes.there are no provisions in the education code requiring a school district to provide a school principal with the authority to dismiss an expulsion charge if the principal has found the student has committed the expulsion offense.instead the statutes require that under certain situations a principal must refer recommend a student to the school board or designated hearing panel for an expulsion hearing,subd.c.a requirement that a school district must comply with a minimum requirement mandatory recommendation for certain offenses is not the same as stating that the district may not require this minimum for other offenses.
a different situation would be presented if the district stricter recommendation procedures infringed on a student statutory rights to an objective and fair expulsion procedure.see woodbury,supra,th at,d school district could not make a blanket rule eliminating an expulsion hearing panel subpoena powers.but this is not the situation with respect to the district policies.under the district rules,a student who allegedly commits a zero tolerance expulsion offense remains entitled to expansive procedural protections set forth in the statutes,and the hearing panel retains the full discretion to decide not to order an expulsion and to determine that another disciplinary action is more suitable eliminating a school principal discretion to unilaterally reject an expulsion remedy at the outset of the process does not affect a student entitlement to these expansive procedural protections or diminish a student rights to fully challenge the expulsion charge.
moreover,the district mandatory recommendation requirements do not preclude the school principal from expressing his or her own views as to whether expulsion is appropriate in a particular case.the district regulations specifically require a principal to consult with a placement and appeal office legal specialist,and the regulations provide the principal and the legal specialist with the discretion to reach a joint decision that the incident was not as serious as it first appeared and that the incident may be handled at the school level.rule,part.additionally,the regulations permit a principal to voluntarily testify at the expulsion hearing,and the hearing panel may subpoena the principal to provide this testimony.a school principal further retains the discretion to determine a student did not in fact commit the alleged expulsion offense,and therefore to determine that any referral would be unwarranted.
in light of this administrative scheme,we do not share the trial court concerns that the district rules have the improper effect of diminish ing or destroy ing the value of the principal true evaluation of the situation.a principal true evaluation can be considered in the hearing process,and there is no statutory requirement that an expulsion turn on a principal subjective feelings about a particular expulsion charge.although the education code and district regulations use the verb recommend to describe the principal role in referring a student to the governing school board or its designated hearing panel,when viewed in context of the statutory and regulatory scheme,this term does not suggest that a principal is required to the hearing expulsion remedy in the particular case.under its broad statutory authority,a school district has the discretion to determine that the entity best suited to evaluating the circumstances underlying an expulsion charge is a hearing panel rather than the school principal.
in considering the propriety of the district challenged regulations,it is further relevant that the procedures serve an important and legitimate educational that all students in the district will be treated in a consistent manner.as explained by district counsel in the proceedings below,the mandatory reference policy was instituted after the district which governs approximately schools found that some school principals were referring every zero tolerance offense to an expulsion hearing panel,whereas at other schools the principal would impose less strict punishment for the same offense.given this disparate treatment,the district concluded that fairness and administrative efficiency required that all zero tolerance offenses be reported to the expulsion review panel,and the panel would then have the discretion to hear all the relevant evidence,and based on the evidence,determine the appropriate punishment and apply the rules in an objective and equal manner.to the extent that a school district promulgates a procedural rule relating to discipline that does not interfere with the student statutory rights or otherwise conflict with the education code,that rule should be upheld.
in seeking to show an inconsistency between the district regulations and the education code,contends the legislature deliberate creation of three different categories of recommendation procedures see,subds.a,c,e shows the legislature must have intended to provide students who commit the serious offenses
