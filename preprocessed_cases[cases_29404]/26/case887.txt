the arizona students association asa brought this first amendment retaliation case against the arizona board of regents abor or the board.the district court dismissed the asa complaint without leave to amend,concluding that the asa claims were barred by sovereign immunity,and in the alternative failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.reviewing de novo,we conclude that the complaint states a plausible claim for first amendment retaliation.see ashcroft iqbal,welty,wl,at cir.we further conclude that the district court erred when it declined to grant the asa leave to amend its complaint to comply with the requirements set forth in ex parte young.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the asa is an arizona corporation that represents students enrolled at the state three public universities.its primary purpose is to advocate for the affordability,accessibility,and quality of public higher education in arizona,and the asa frequently engages in political activity related to financial aid,public funding of higher education,and tuition policy.
from through,abor,a state board whose members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the arizona state senate,directly funded the asa.in,students at arizona three public universities voted to impose a semesterly fee per student to fund the asa.in,students voted to increase the fee to two dollars per semester from through,abor collected the student fee on the asa behalf and remitted proceeds to the asa at no cost.
throughout,the asa advocated for the passage of proposition,a state ballot initiative that would increase funding for public education.in preparation for the november election,the asa the text of the initiative collected over petition signatures to qualify the initiative for the election the ballot argument that appeared in the state official publicity pamphlet voter guide participated in media events in support of the initiative hosted information sessions and distributed literature explaining the initiative engaged in social media campaigning and canvassed neighborhoods to encourage voter turnout in support of the initiative and contributed of its income to the yes on proposition campaign.all of the asa activities complied with campaign disclosure and reporting laws and regulations.
janice brewer,the former governor of arizona and an member of abor,opposed proposition.additionally,during the campaign and after the election,several regents criticized the asa for supporting proposition.within weeks of the november election,abor called a special meeting to discuss the asa fee.at the special meeting,abor voted to suspend collection of the asa fee,and it withheld the fee income it already had collected for the spring semester.several regents commented that the suspension was political in nature and was undertaken in response to the asa proposition advocacy.abor held a second special meeting in january,in which it proposed changing the board policies to collect the asa fee only from students who and to require that the asa reimburse the universities for the administrative costs of collecting the asa fee.on february,abor adopted the policy revisions proposed at the january meeting.the asa alleged that it lost its only source of income when abor suspended fee collection and then modified its policies to an model,and it argued to this court that since november,the board has not remitted to the asa the fees abor collected for spring.
the asa filed suit pursuant to,alleging that abor had modified its policies to retaliate against the asa exercise of its first amendment free speech rights the asa alleged that abor retaliatory policy change caused it harm by chilling students political speech and depriving the asa of its income.abor moved to dismiss the complaint on sovereign immunity grounds and,in the alternative,for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.fed.civ.b,b.in opposing the motion,the asa emphasized that it had pleaded a claim of first amendment retaliation,and it argued that in addition to chilling the asa ability to exercise its free speech rights,abor had harmed the asa by depriving it of a valuable government benefit.the district court granted abor motion with prejudice,concluding that sovereign immunity barred all of the asa claims and,in the alternative,that the asa had failed to allege a plausible claim for relief.additionally,the district court denied the asa request for leave to amend to name individual regents,concluding that such amendment would be futile.

the district court concluded that sovereign immunity barred the asa from suing abor,and accordingly,the court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the asa complaint,amend xi fed.civ.b.alternatively,the district court concluded that if sovereign immunity did not bar the asa lawsuit,then the asa complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under rule b.we first analyze the district court sovereign immunity determination,and we conclude that although the district court did not err in determining that abor is an arm,division,or instrumentality of the state of arizona entitled to sovereign immunity,it erred when it failed to apply the young doctrine to the asa claims.
sovereign immunity provides that an individual may not sue a state,a division of a state,or an of a state without the state consent.frew hawkins,seminole tribe of florida,edelman jordan.as a result,the eleventh amendment bars individuals from bringing lawsuits against a state for money damages or other retrospective relief,frew,at,so long as the state is the real,substantial party in interest,regents of the university of california doe,citation omitted.

we are bound by the holdings of prior panels so long as those holdings and their reasoning have not been superseded by later or intervening authority.see rodriguez robbins,cir.lair bullock,cir.miller gammie,cir.en banc.we have not revisited or abrogated our determination that abor is a division of the state of arizona entitled to sovereign immunity.accordingly,the eleventh amendment bars any claim by the asa for retrospective relief,including money damages,against abor.as discussed below,however,the asa claim for prospective injunctive relief and related declaratory relief is not barred by sovereign immunity,provided such relief is sought against individual members of the board.
although sovereign immunity bars money damages and other retrospective relief against a state or instrumentality of a state,it does not bar claims seeking prospective injunctive relief against state officials to remedy a state ongoing violation of federal law.ex parte young,see also quern jordan,agua caliente band of cahuilla indians hardin,cir.the young doctrine allows individuals to pursue claims against a state for prospective equitable relief,including any measures ancillary to that relief.green mansour,hutto finney,allowing the recovery of attorney fees and costs.to bring such a claim,the plaintiff must identify a practice,policy,or procedure that animates the constitutional violation at issue.hafer melo,monnell dep t of soc.
the district court erred when it failed to apply young to the asa claim of ongoing first amendment retaliation,and its request for prospective injunctive and declaratory relief.as explained below,the asa properly alleged a first amendment retaliation claim,and it identified abor changes to its policies as the sources of ongoing violations of federal law within the meaning of young and its progeny.the asa error was in naming abor as the defendant instead of naming either the president,chair,or other members of abor in their official capacities 
the district court failed to distinguish between the asa request for prospective equitable relief and its request for money damages.as noted above,although the eleventh amendment bars the asa requests for money damages and other retrospective relief,it does not preclude the asa requests for prospective injunctive and declaratory relief.edelman,at.thus,the district court erred in dismissing the asa entire complaint instead of dismissing only those portions of the complaint that sought relief barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity money damages and other retrospective relief.had the district court allowed the asa to amend its complaint to conform to the young doctrine,as it requested,sovereign immunity would not have barred the asa suit.because the young doctrine provides that the asa claims,when properly crafted,would not violate the eleventh amendment,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court held in the alternative that amendment would be futile because the asa complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.as we discuss further,the district court erred when it dismissed the suit with prejudice on futility grounds.
in evaluating whether the asa complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted,the district court focused on the agreement between the parties,as well as abor policies regarding collection of the asa fee.the district court analogized collection of the asa fee to cases involving payroll deductions of union dues.viewing asa complaint in this manner,the court rejected the asa argument that its cause of action sounded in first amendment retaliation.the district court instead construed the asa claim as challenging abor decision to refrain from facilitating the asa exercise of its free speech rights.
the district court relied on two cases to support its interpretation of the asa complaint.first,it turned to davenport washington education association,noting that there the supreme court upheld a state statute that required unions to obtain affirmative consent from nonmembers before expending nonmembers fees on activities.id.at.davenport held that the statute did not restrict speech,but rather,allowed the state to decline to facilitate a union political speech.id.at.that is,a union could theoretically still engage in political speech activities and receive dues,but the state had no obligation to allow the union to piggyback on the state payroll deduction system to obtain those dues.
next,the court pointed to ysura pocatello education association,where the supreme court upheld a statute prohibiting payroll deductions for union dues used for political activities political fees.applying the more lenient standard of review for claims related to a state facilitation of speech,the ysura court held that unions had no affirmative right to receive money for expressive activities through government payroll mechanisms.id.at.
the district court reasoned that the asa was similar to a union that sought to collect dues through a payroll deduction system.the district court considered abor modification of its policies similar to a statutory change in union dues collection therefore,abor ha d no obligation to continue to subsidize asa speech.although the district court briefly acknowledged that the asa had attempted to allege a first amendment retaliation claim in which abor motive would be a necessary element of the claim,the district court held that the policy change,like the passage of a statute,was a,neutral,procedural modification.it reasoned that in cases involving neutral changes to policy,an inquiry into abor motive would be irrelevant because,when the allegation of improper motive was excluded,the policy modifications would have been constitutional.
the district court also rejected the asa argument that abor had retaliated against the asa for its political speech by terminating a valuable government benefit.drawing on perry sindermann,the district court explained that a valuable government benefit included the termination of public employment,denial or revocation of tax exemption,and deprivation of unemployment or welfare benefits.the court explained that abor original policy for collecting the asa fee was not an equivalent benefit to the kinds of benefits set forth in sindermann.the district court also reasoned that a benefit only qualified as a valuable government benefit if it were a benefit available to the general public based on objective criteria.because abor did not collect fees for other student organizations or members of the public,the court reasoned that the collection was a voluntary benefit,which it could revoke at any time.viewed in this context,the court concluded that changing a policy from an to an model was not the type of benefit deprivation that could support a first amendment retaliation case.
the asa argues that the district court misconstrued its complaint,as the only claim it seeks to pursue is one for first amendment retaliation and not to compel the facilitation of speech.we thus turn to whether the asa complaint states a plausible claim for retaliation in violation of the first amendment.we conclude below that it does.
a plaintiff may bring a section claim alleging that public officials,acting in their official capacity,took action with the intent to retaliate against,obstruct,or chill the plaintiff first amendment rights.gibson united states,cir.to bring a first amendment retaliation claim,the plaintiff must allege that it engaged in constitutionally protected activity the defendant actions would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity and the protected activity was a substantial motivating factor in the defendant conduct,that there was a nexus between the defendant actions and an intent to chill speech,wl,at citing pinard clatskanie sch.dist,cir.mendocino envt l ctr.mendocino county,cir.see also blair bethel sch,cir.further,to prevail on such a claim,a plaintiff need only show that the defendant intended to interfere with the plaintiff first amendment rights and that it suffered some injury as a result the plaintiff is not required to demonstrate that its speech was actually suppressed or inhibited.mendocino envt l,at.
