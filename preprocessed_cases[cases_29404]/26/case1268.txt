tom briggs appeals from the decision of the merit systems protection board granting summary judgment that briggs violated the hatch act and ordering the district of columbia public schools dcps to remove briggs from his teaching position.special counsel briggs,no,wl mspb.because briggs attacks on the constitutionality of the hatch act are not meritorious,we affirm.
background 
a.the hatch act and the teacher.the present statutory provisions 
the hatch act prohibits certain government employees from engaging in certain political activities.see generally.the act prohibits both federal and employees from being partisan candidates for elected office.a a federal employee may not run for the nomination or as a candidate for election to a partisan political office.see also id.a a state or local officer or employee may not be a candidate for elective office.covered federal employees include any individual employed or holding office in the government of the district of columbia,other than the mayor or a member of the city council or the recorder of deeds.id.c.dcps teachers fall under that definition.however,state and local public school teachers are exempted from the hatch act.id.a state or local officer or employee does not include an individual employed by an educational or research institution,establishment,agency or system.there is no similar exception for federal employees.
legislative history 
to better understand the hatch act in effect today,an understanding of its history is helpful.the act was first enacted in out of concerns about the harmful effects of political activities by government workers.the act affected only federal employees.a year later the act was amended in two ways important to this case.first,coverage was extended to state and local employees.that extension was an exercise of congress spending power,as the law was limited to state and local employment in connection with any activity which is financed in whole or in part by laws or grants made by the united states or any federal agency.a.second,the amendments brought district of columbia employees within the act coverage as federal employees.
in the act was amended again,this time introducing a teacher exception,applicable to teachers in any state,locality,or the district of columbia.id.briggs cites numerous statements from the legislative history expressing strong support for the teacher exception.in,the act was recodified and bifurcated into the two separate chapters of title where the provisions appear today applying to state and local employees and applying to federal employees.the recodification did not materially change the law,at least as it pertains to the teacher exception,which was maintained in both new sections.in part,c at that time read subsection a of this subsection does not apply to an individual employed by an educational or research institution,establishment,agency,or system which is supported in whole or in part by the district of columbia.c.
starting in the,several attempts were made to relax the act prohibitions generally.those attempts culminated in amendments that were enacted in,which,most significantly,retracted the act prohibition against tak ing an active part in political management or in political campaigns.compare id.a with a.the amendments also removed the dc teacher exception that had been codified at c.the rationale for its removal,as pointed out by briggs and not contested by the government,is unexplained in the legislative history.
briggs political candidacy and his removal by the mspb 
briggs was a social studies teacher at dunbar senior high school,one of the schools in the dcps,when in july he filed a declaration of candidacy to run on the dc statehood green party slate for the ward two seat on the district of columbia council.special counsel briggs,no,slip op.at mspb may,initial decision.the united states office of special counsel osc twice warned briggs that his candidacy violated the hatch act and offered him the opportunity to withdraw his candidacy without disciplinary action,but briggs remained a candidate throughout the election,which he ultimately lost.see id.
in october,the osc filed a complaint at the mspb alleging that briggs was in violation of the hatch act and seeking disciplinary action.in january,after the election,the osc filed a motion for summary judgment.briggs responded with a for summary judgment raising the affirmative defense that the hatch act violates the first amendment and equal protection clause of the united states constitution.finding no material facts in dispute,the administrative law judge alj assigned to the case agreed with the osc that briggs was covered by the hatch act and that his candidacy was a per se violation of the act.id.at.the alj declined to rule on briggs affirmative defense,holding that the mspb was without authority to declare legislation unconstitutional.id.at.the alj went on to determine that removal was the appropriate penalty for briggs because his continued candidacy in the face of warnings that the activity violated the hatch act demonstrates deliberate disregard of law and,therefore,warrants removal.id.at.
briggs appealed the alj initial decision to the full board,which denied his petition for review,thus rendering the initial decision final.see b.as a result,the dcps terminated briggs on april.shortly thereafter,on june,the dcps rehired him for the same position he had just vacated,and he is apparently still employed in that position at the present time.briggs has never received any salary for the interim period between his removal and rehiring.
briggs timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the board is limited.we must affirm the board decision unless it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c gibson dep t of veterans affairs.briggs only arguments,constitutional challenges to the hatch act,implicate the otherwise not in accordance with law aspect of our standard of review.because the board did not address those challenges,there is no constitutional analysis for us to review.even if the board had addressed those challenges,we would assess them without deference to the board analysis.see king dep t of navy,we review the board determinations of law for correctness,without deference to the board decision.
briggs first argues that the board did have the authority to rule on his constitutional claims because administrative agencies may address constitutional issues that arise in connection with the application of statutes that are the subject of their jurisdiction.in any event,according to briggs,the constitutional issues are properly before this court,irrespective of the board authority to decide constitutional issues.
as to his first amendment claim,briggs argues that the hatch act prohibition against his political candidacy is an unlawful restraint on his freedom of speech.because his candidacy is a form of speech regarding matters of public concern,briggs contends,citing pickering board of education,d,that the government bears the burden of justifying any adverse employment action taken in retaliation for that speech.furthermore,according to briggs,because an entire class of people is affected,the government burden is even heavier.briggs contends that the government can not satisfy the pickering test because congress has not found that specific problems exist arising from dc school teachers political candidacies.in fact,briggs stresses the fact that the legislative history of the hatch act shows a strong sentiment in favor of the teacher exception,and the change in the law that removed the dc teacher exception appears to have been an oversight.
as to his equal protection claim,briggs argues that strict scrutiny should be applied to the act disparate treatment of dcps teachers compared to state teachers.briggs thus contends that the government must show that the disparate treatment is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.briggs contends that the government can not meet that burden when,in his view,all the evidence that had been before congress indicated that there was no reason to treat dcps teachers differently from teachers employed by the states.in fact,according to briggs,there is not even a rational basis supporting the difference in treatment.
the government responds,first,that the board authority to decide hatch act complaints is circumscribed by,which does not grant the board authority to rule on the act constitutionality.the government contends that while agencies can generally determine constitutional applicability,they can not determine whether legislation is constitutional.nonetheless,the government agrees that this court may address briggs constitutional challenges.
as to briggs first amendment challenge,the government responds that the hatch act does not prohibit briggs from speaking on political matters it only prohibits him from being a partisan candidate,and,unlike free speech,there is no fundamental right to be a political candidate.the government further contends that the act meets the pickering test,citing united states civil service commission national association of letter carriers,d.according to the government,it need not point to evidence specifically identifying a need to include dcps teachers under the act,and that,in any event,there are several factors that support application of the act to any government employees,including teachers.finally,the government contends that a policy judgment to the contrary is for congress,not the courts,to make.
regarding briggs equal protection claim,the government responds that the distinction drawn by the hatch act between dcps teachers and public school teachers in states and localities neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor is drawn along suspect lines and that rational basis review is therefore appropriate.according to the government,rational bases for the lack of a teacher exemption for dcps teachers are that dcps teachers are not similarly situated to state or local teachers because congress has direct legislative authority over the dcps,and because the states retain all powers not delegated to the federal the district of columbia,which has only those powers that congress is willing to grant have the authority to set their own limits on their employees political activities,and states should be given leeway to exercise that authority if they so choose.
justiciability 
before proceeding to the merits of the case,we are obliged to consider our jurisdiction in light of the apparent fact that briggs has been rehired.thus,the question is whether there is still a case or controversy.the answer is that this appeal does present a case or controversy because briggs,if his removal was unlawful,may be entitled to back pay for the period between his removal and subsequent rehiring.
whether the board should have considered briggs constitutional arguments is an issue we need not decide.both parties agree,and we concur,that we may consider his arguments and decide the constitutionality of the hatch act in this appeal.given the board consistent refusal to pass on the constitutionality of legislation,malone dep t of justice,mspb,briggs attempt,albeit futile,to raise the issue before the board the purely constitutional nature of the issue the lack of a need to develop a factual record before adjudication and the lack of a need for board expertise to decide the issue,we conclude that the requirement of administrative exhaustion is not applicable in this case.see beard servs.we therefore proceed to the merits of briggs contentions.
freedom of speech 
the first amendment provides in relevant part that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.i.that text has been interpreted from time to time,and an extensive body of first amendment jurisprudence has evolved.most of that jurisprudence,dealing with freedom of speech by the general citizenry,is not relevant to this case.what is relevant here is a branch of that jurisprudence concerning speech restrictions the government may place on its own employees.the freedom of speech enjoyed by a government employee is not as extensive as that enjoyed by a because the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.pickering,at.one of those interests is the establishment and maintenance of a separation between political activity,on the one hand,and the performance of government functions by the government workforce,on the other hand,as addressed by the hatch act.our analysis of that interest in relation to the first amendment is guided principally by the following decisions of the supreme court pickering letter carriers united public workers mitchell.and united states national treasury employees union,d nteu.
pickering,although not involving political candidacy or the hatch act,does involve public speech by a public school teacher.in that case,an illinois public school teacher was removed for writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper criticizing the school board use of funds for athletics.at.in reversing the removal,the court set forth a balancing test between two competing factors the problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.at.see also haddon executive residence at the white house.the court refused to lay down a bright line rule,opting instead for the flexible balancing test.id.at.its conclusion in favor of pickering right to express his views in a newspaper reflects the importance of permitting knowledgeable school officials to state their views publicly on matters of public concern.
cases both before and after pickering have rejected claims that the hatch act violates the first amendment.in mitchell,a case,a mechanic employed at the mint violated the hatch act and was subsequently removed.he challenged his removal on the ground that the act violated various constitutional provisions,including the first amendment.at.without distinguishing among the particular provisions at issue,the court rejected those challenges.id.in particular,the court rejected mitchell argument that congress may not constitutionally regulate the political activities of industrial workers to the same extent as administrative workers because the former are not in positions where impartiality in public matters is required.id.at.in rejecting that argument,the court cited three reasons that may have motivated congress to extend the act prohibitions to all government employees,regardless of their responsibilities elimination of political factors as a possible basis for preferential treatment of employees by their supervisors prevention of political leaders using government employees to build political machine s and prevention of the cumulative effect on morale of political activity by all employees who could be induced to participate actively.id.at.
in letter carriers,a case,the court again upheld the hatch act against attacks on its constitutionality.in that case,several federal employees challenged the act proscription against taking an active part in political management or in political campaigns.a later abrogated.the court rejected that challenge,explaining that the hatch act survives the pickering balancing test although congress is free to strike a different balance than it has,if it so chooses,we think the balance it has struck is sustainable by the obviously important interests sought to be served by the limitations on partisan political activities now contained in the hatch act.letter carriers,at.the court noted four obviously important interests the impartial execution of the laws maintaining public confidence in the system of representative government not allowing the government workforce to be employed to build a powerful,invincible,and perhaps c
