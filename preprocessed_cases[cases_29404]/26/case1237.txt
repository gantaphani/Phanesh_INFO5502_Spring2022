unable to convince a hearing officer that his public school placement was inappropriate under the individuals with disabilities education act,terrance branham and his mother took their case to united states district court.siding with the branhams,the district court reversed the hearing officer and ordered the district of columbia to provide terrance with four years of remedial tutoring and to pay for his attendance at a private school.on appeal,the district,conceding that it denied terrance the free and appropriate public education to which federal law entitles him,argues that nothing in the record supports the tutoring and private placement awards.we agree.both the supreme court and this circuit have held that district courts may order school districts to implement educational programs for handicapped students only after finding,based on record evidence,that the programs are tailored to meet the students specific educational needs.because the district court here made no such findings with respect to either the tutoring or the private,the record is so barren of evidence that making such findings would have been reverse and remand for the court to develop an evidentiary record and fashion an educational program designed to meet terrance needs.
earlier this year in reid district of columbia,we described the individuals with disabilities education act known as idea this way 
under idea,states and territories,including the district of columbia,that receive federal educational assistance must establish policies and procedures to ensure,among other things,that free appropriate public education,or fape,is available to disabled children.see a a school districts may not ignore disabled students needs,nor may they await parental demands before providing special instruction.instead,school systems must ensure that a ll children with disabilities residing in the state regardless of the severity of their disabilities,and who are in need of special education and related services,are identified,located,and evaluated.id.a a.once such children are identified,a team including the child parents and select teachers,as well as a representative of the local educational agency with knowledge about the school resources and curriculum,develops an individualized education program,or iep,for the child.see id.a,d.pursuant to the supreme court decision in board of education of the hendrick hudson central school district,westchester county rowley,d,the iep must,at a minimum,provid e personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.see id.at,d if no suitable public school is available,the school system must pay the costs of sending the child to an appropriate private school.jenkins squillacote.
reid,at second omission in original.
at issue in reid was whether the district court had abused its discretion in ordering,without explanation,tutoring in the amount of one hour for each day that a boy went without a fape.although we confirmed that compensatory education awards are available for idea violations,id.at,we rejected the district court mechanical calculation of that award,id.at.reasoning that a approach,id.at,can not be squared with idea conferral of equitable authority to grant such relief as the district court determines is appropriate,i c iii,we held that the ultimate compensatory award must be reasonably calculated to provide the educational benefits that likely would have accrued from special education services the school district should have supplied in the first place,reid,at.unlike ordinary ieps that need only provide some benefit,compensatory awards must do must compensate.id.at emphasis in original.we emphasized repeatedly that this inquiry must be qualitative,and above all tailored to the unique needs of the disabled student.id.at.
like the student in reid,terrance branham is a teenager whom the district of columbia public schools or dcps classified as learning disabled.in october,dcps placed terrance at the prospect learning center,a special education facility.terrance first iep was prepared the following june.
two and a half years later,terrance test scores indicated he had made only very limited progress while at prospect.appellant app.testimony before hearing officer.his performance remained significantly below grade level.id.at terrance iep.school officials and terrance mother,appellee irene branham,met in january to develop a new iep that might better serve terrance needs.although terrance mother signed the iep,she indicated her disagreement with its contents in the space above her signature.
later that month,the branhams petitioned for an impartial due process hearing,see f a providing right to due process hearing,alleging that dcps had denied terrance a fape and seeking a placement and compensatory tutoring.the hearing officer found that dcps was providing terrance with a fape and dismissed the complaint.when terrance later aged out of prospect,he enrolled at cardozo high school,a general education school.
in the meantime,the branhams brought suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia,see i a providing right to bring civil action,and filed a motion for summary judgment.when dcps missed the deadline for responding,the district court entered a default judgment in the branhams favor.branham district of columbia.one week later,dcps moved to vacate the judgment,claiming it had misunderstood the briefing schedule.in opposition,the branhams argued that terrance had already secured an appropriate placement at the high road upper school of washington,and that vacating the judgment would harm terrance education.mem.in opp to def.mot.to alter or and or sic in the alternative to vacate order of,at.the following day,dcps filed its motion opposing the grant of summary judgment,but said nothing about the proposed placement at high road.in their reply to dcps opposition brief,the branhams asked the court to order dcps to place and fund terrance with transportation at high road upper school of washington,pl.reply mem.to def.opp.to summ,but provided no information about the school.the district court eventually vacated the default judgment and considered the summary judgment motion on the merits.branham district of columbia.
in order to get a handle on the deficiencies in the record,the district court held a status conference on april.the court began the conference by observing that the paucity of evidence introduced at the hearing regarding terrance disability,and in particular the lack of academic evaluations detailing what support terrance needed,would pose a serious practical problem w e do have any of that information on the record now in terms of ordering the relief that terrance is requesting.tr.of status conf.the judge told the parties she was considering remanding the case so that a hearing officer could get further evidence on terrance academic progress or particularly the lack of it,and the reasons for it,whether any evaluations were conducted.id.
vehemently objecting to a remand,the branhams argued that the deficiencies in the record resulted from dcps failure for more than four years to evaluate terrance.the branhams lawyer again reported that terrance had been accepted at high roads,which he described as a special education program that accepts and has a contract with the district of columbia public schools,id.at,and emphasized that high road would be a lateral move for terrance,id.at.
after questioning the branhams counsel though not about high road,the district court asked dcps attorney whether he had anything to add or to say.id.at.i do have much to add,he responded,except that this is an appeal from a hearing officer decision based upon the record.id.when the judge pointed out that the record says nothing,counsel repeated his belief that the hearing officer opinion is supported by the record.id.pressed about dcps failure to monitor and evaluate terrance,counsel said he was prepared to address those issues,but reiterated that i f it not in the record,or if it is in the record,the court has to give due deference to the hearing officer opinion.id.at.
