on appeal,county again asserts the superior court lacked jurisdiction to consider association action because association february,claim was untimely.we agree 
section,subdivision a a i sets the procedural time limit within which a party in association position must file a claim with county for a refund of taxes.that procedural time limit is one year.that time limit is not affected by the timing of the party payment of the property taxes due.since association did not file their claim for refund of taxes with the county within the time limit of section,subdivision a a i,the superior court lacked jurisdiction over association subsequent property tax refund action against county.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural history 
county appeal.
association and the trustees of the california state university trustees entered into a ground lease dated october,under which association agreed to lease from trustees certain undeveloped land on the university campus undertake the planning,financing,construction,and operation of save mart center and convey to trustees unencumbered title to the real property at the end of the lease term.at the time,association was the only vehicle for revenue bond financing for the university and was used as the financing vehicle to get save mart center built.construction began in december and ended on november.association issued in revenue bonds to pay most of the building costs.
in fiscal year,trustees approved the systemwide revenue bond program.it was through that program that the bond debt incurred to construct save mart center was refinanced in early.association and trustees entered into a facility purchase contract dated march,under which trustees agreed to purchase association right,title,and interest in and to save mart center for the amount of the outstanding bonds.association and trustees then entered into a ground and facility lease dated march,under which association agreed to lease save mart center from trustees occupy,operate,and maintain save mart center for the benefit of university and convey to trustees unencumbered title to the real property at the end of the lease term.
association received a notice of supplemental assessment dated february,in which assessor appraised save mart center as of november,the date of its completion,and established a taxable value of.a supplemental property tax bill charged.on march,association filed an assessment reduction application,which was not designated as a refund claim.association then received a notice of enrollment of escape assessments dated may,in which assessor retroactively appraised save mart center as of the lien dates for,and see and enrolled escape assessments of and,respectively.unsecured property tax bills charged for for and for.on june,association filed three additional assessment reduction applications,one for each escape assessment.these applications were not designated as refund claims.
board conducted a bifurcated hearing on association applications.the first phase,scheduled for april and,was limited to the existence of an assessable property interest.the second phase,scheduled for july and,relate d to valuation of the subject property.board announced its decision denying association applications on november.first,it concluded association had a taxable interest in save mart center.second,utilizing the cost method of appraisal board ordered the following equalized property values,which were lower than assessor original figures as of november,as of january,as of january,as of march,and as of january.board mailed a written notice of its decision to association on november,and a written copy of its findings of fact on december.the notice did not advise association to file a refund claim.
association paid in taxes and penalties on may,and filed a property tax refund claim on february.county,through its collector,denied the claim on august.
on november,association brought a property tax refund action against county,averring board use of the cost method instead of the income method was legally erroneous.in an answer filed january,county alleged,inter alia,the action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in section,subd ivision a a i because association february,refund claim was untimely.a bench trial commenced on october,and ended october.the issue of timeliness was addressed at the outset.after receiving evidence and considering counsels arguments on the matter,the superior court sided with association 
i satisfied that association received the notice and the findings.the presumption that they were mailed is not rebutted in my mind.my hang up comes with s ection.the first line,no order for a refund under this article shall be made except on a claim.right there number one,plain meaning,verified by the person who paid the tax.if there is no tax paid,my position is,and i am sure others may differ and maybe be settled at the c ourt of appeal.but it my feeling and interpretation that verified by the person who paid the tax means that you ca seek a refund until the tax is paid.
i n this case,the decision and the findings of facts were prepared and sent out.i satisfied that everybody had them by.i satisfied and the record shows as demonstrated that association paid the tax and penalties on may,less than six months thereafter.and that they filed their claim for refund on february.
i understand the arguments.and if i wrong,sobeit sic,but these are my findings and i will deny.i find for association with respect to the statute of limitations.
in a statement of decision adopted july,the court reversed board november,decision,finding board application of the cost method arbitrary,in excess of discretion,and in violation of the standards prescribed by law,inter alia.beforehand,the statement of decision clarified the court stance on the timeliness of association refund claim 
s ection,subdivision a a i is the applicable statute of limitations when an applicant has filed an assessment reduction application pursuant to section that does not state that the application is intended to also constitute a claim for refund,the county assessment appeals board makes a final determination on the application,and the assessment appeals board mails a written notice of its determination to the applicant that does not advise the applicant to file a claim for refund.in this case,it is undisputed that association filed four assessment reduction applications pursuant to section,that each of the assessment reduction applications specifically stated that they were not also claims for refund,that board made a final determination on association four applications,and that the written notice of its determination did not advise association to file a claim for refund.
the court finds that board mailed out a written notice of its decision on association four assessment reduction applications on november,and mailed out a written copy of its findings of fact on december.further,the court finds that board sufficiently mailed written notice of its final determination to association when it mailed written notice of its decision and written notice of its findings of fact to association.therefore,since all of the factual prerequisites have been met,the court finds that the statute of limitation s applicable to this action is the statute of limitations established in section,subdivision a a i.
consequently,county argues that,because association did not file its claim for refund until february,more than a year after board mailed written notice of its decision to association on november,and mailed written notice of its findings of fact on december,this action for a property tax refund is barred by section,subdivision a a i.the court disagrees.it is elementary that a statute of limitations does not begin to run until the cause of action accrues.citations.equally basic is that a cause of action does not accrue until the party owning it is entitled to begin and prosecute an action thereon citation,that is,not until the last element essential to the cause of action occurs.spear california state auto.cal th.it is clear that the statute of limitations in section,subdivision a a i establishes a number of factual conditions to accrual of the right to file a claim for refund,but the court finds that the statute does not state that accrual occurs,and the statute of limitations begins to run,when all of the factual conditions listed in the statute are met.this is because the statute does not mention the most important condition to accrual of the right to file a refund claim payment of the disputed taxes.
the law is similarly clear that a claim for refund pursuant to section can not be made until after the taxes and any penalties have been paid,subd.a jpmorgan chase bank,city and county of san francisco th,jpmorgan.accordingly,since a refund claim can not be properly made until after the disputed taxes are paid,the right to file a claim for refund does not accrue,and the statute of limitations in section,subdivision a a i does not start running,until after all of the factual conditions listed in the statute have been met and the disputed taxes have been paid.in this case,this means that,if association had paid the disputed taxes before filing its assessment reduction applications,then the statute of limitations would have commenced when board mailed association the final decision and findings of fact.however,since association did not pay the disputed taxes before filing the assessment reduction applications,the statute of limitations did not commence until association paid the disputed taxes and all of the conditions for accrual of the right to file a refund claim were finally met.
county asserts that holding that the statute of limitations does not commence until association pays the disputed taxes will lead to absurd results in the future because taxpayers would be able to wait a virtually unlimited amount of time to pay their disputed taxes and then will have another year after the date of payment to file a refund claim.the court disagrees.ignoring the multitude of penalties attendant to the tardy payment of taxes,the rule is well settled that when the plaintiff right of action depends upon some act which he has to perform preliminarily to commencing suit,and he is under no disability or restraint in the performance of such act,he can not suspend indefinitely the running of the statute of limitations by a delay in performing such preliminary act,and that if the time within which such act is to be performed is indefinite or not specified,a reasonable time will be allowed therefor,and the statute will begin to run after the lapse of such reasonable time.and it has been uniformly held that unless there are peculiar circumstances affecting the question,a reasonable time is a period coincident with that provided in the statute of limitations for barring the action.bass hueter cal.
therefore,in a case such as this one,it makes most sense that,once all of the conditions listed in section,subdivision a a i were met,but the disputed taxes had not yet been paid,the accrual of a right to file a refund claim depends on the applicant paying the outstanding taxes.since no statute specifies the time within which an applicant must pay the disputed taxes or lose the right to file a refund claim,the court finds that an applicant has a reasonable time of one year after the county assessment appeals board mails the applicant a written notice of its determination which does not advise the applicant to file a claim for refund because the statute of limitations established in section,subdivision a a i is one year.if the applicant pays the taxes within that year,then the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the tax is paid.if the applicant fails to pay the taxes within that year,the statute of limitations begins to run one year after all of the conditions listed in section,subdivision a a i are met.
in this case,all of the conditions listed in section,subdivision a a i were met no later than december,when board mailed association the written notice of its findings of fact and did not advise association to file a claim for refund.however,since association had not yet paid the disputed taxes,the statute of limitations did not begin to run.association paid the disputed taxes on may,less than a year after all of the conditions listed in section,subdivision a a i were met and within the one year of reasonable time.hence,the statute of limitations established in section,subdivision a a i began to run may.since association filed a claim for refund on february,less than a year later,the court finds that association timely filed its claim for refund with county and that this action is not barred by the statute of limitations set forth in section,subdivision a a i.
ii.association appeal.
on october,association moved for an award of in attorney fees pursuant to section county filed an opposition on november,and association filed a reply on november.in a tentative ruling issued on november,the superior court denied association motion.after hearing oral arguments on november,the court confirmed its tentative ruling.
discussion 
i.the procedural time limit in section,subdivision a a i,within which association claim for refund of property taxes must be filed,is not affected by the date the disputed taxes are paid.
it is clear that property taxes must be paid before litigation challenging them can occur.no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this state or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax.after payment of a tax claimed to be illegal,an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid,with interest,in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.cal,art.xiii,see water replenishment dist.of southern california city of cerritos th,flying dutchman park,city and county of san francisco th,cal,art.xiii,applies equally to state and local taxes as a matter of public policy.this constitutional provision,known as the pay first,litigate later doctrine see,water replenishment dist.of southern california city of cerritos,supra,at,establish es that the sole legal avenue for resolving tax disputes is a postpayment refund action state bd.of equalization superior court cal d,sbe.in other words,a taxpayer may not go into court and obtain adjudication of the validity of a tax which is due but not yet paid.sbe,supra,at.
the important public policy behind the pay first,litigate later doctrine is to allow revenue collection to continue during litigation so that essential public services dependent on the funds are not unnecessarily interrupted.citation.sbe,supra,cal d at.the california supreme court noted in an earlier decision 
the fear that persistent interference with the collection of public revenues,for whatever reason,will destroy the effectiveness of government has been expressed in many judicial opinions.citation.as was said by justice field in dows city of chicago,wall,any delay in the proceedings of the officer,upon whom the duty is devolved of collecting the taxes,may derange the operations of government,and thereby cause serious detriment to the public.citation.
the prompt payment of taxes is always important to the public welfare.it may be vital to the existence of a government.the idea that every taxpayer is entitled to the delays of litigation is unreason.citations.citation.sbe,supra,cal d at.
furthermore,the pay first,litigate later doctrine rests on the premise that strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought is necessary so that governmental entities may engage in fiscal planning based on expected tax revenues.woosley state of california cal th,see farrar franchise tax bd.th,the lesson of woosley we take is that statutes governing administrative tax refund procedures,backed as they are by a plenary constitutional authority,are to be strictly enforced.fn.omitted.

no injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit,action,or proceeding in any court against any county,municipality,or district,or any officer thereof,to prevent or enjoin the collection of property taxes sought to be collected.
this statutory bar to orders enjoining the collection of a county tax is comparable to the constitutional prohibition against enjoining the collection of a tax.connolly county of orange cal th,citing cal,art.xiii.the language used in section and california constitution,article xiii,section is nearly identical,and the policy behind both of them is the same to allow revenue collection to continue during litigation so that essential public services dependent on the funds are not unnecessarily interrupted.merced county taxpayers cardella d,accord,william jefferson,orange county assessment appeals bd.th.
association is incorrect,however,in its position that the claim filing deadline in this case did not begin to run until after payment of the taxes sought to be refunded.

examining the language of section,subdivision a a i,it is clear that a refund claim must be filed within one year after the county assessment appeals board makes a final determination on the assessment reduction application and mails a written notice of the determination to the applicant.association position,that the period does not begin to run until after payment of the disputed taxes,is inconsistent with the unequivocal statutory language.

ii.section,subdivision a is not subject to equitable tolling.
association argues that it at all times acted reasonably and in good faith in the pursuit of its dispute with assessor and so equitable tolling should preclude the forfeiture of its right to seek a property tax refund.
equitable tolling is a doctrine which operates independently of the literal wording of the code of civil procedure to suspend or extend a statute of limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.lantzy centex homes cal th,lantzy.association contends the claim filing deadline set forth in subdivision a a i of section can be equitably tolled.section,subdivision a,however,is not subject to the doctrine because it is not a statute of limitations.
