the plaintiffs,a group of former graduate students in the master of social work msw program at governor state university gsu,brought this action pursuant to against various gsu officers and members of the gsu board of trustees collectively,the defendants in their individual capacities.they alleged violations of substantive and procedural due process,as well as conspiracy to prevent the exercise of their first amendment rights.finally,they alleged retaliation for the exercise of their first amendment rights.the plaintiffs also asserted claims under illinois law for promissory estoppel and fraud.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs substantive and procedural due process claims with prejudice and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs first amendment conspiracy and retaliation claims.the district court also dismissed the plaintiffs state law claims,but without prejudice.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
gsu is a public university located in university park,illinois.the plaintiffs are former graduate students of the msw program at gsu.the defendants are various gsu officers and members of the gsu board of trustees.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants induced them to matriculate in the msw program at gsu by knowingly and falsely representing to them that the program was approved for accreditation by the national council of social work education ncswe according to the complaint,the msw program was never approved for accreditation by ncswe,and the defendants took no steps to ensure that the program would gain accreditation.the defendants hired unqualified faculty members and maintained an inadequate curriculum,knowing that such decisions would prevent the msw program from gaining accreditation.between,when the program was instituted,and,the msw program was denied accreditation on at least two occasions.in november of,gsu representatives informed the students enrolled in the msw program that ncswe had denied accreditation candidacy and that the students would be graduating from an unaccredited program.shortly thereafter,gsu suspended msw classes.
on december,msw students,including the plaintiffs,met with gsu president stuart fagan to discuss the msw accreditation issue.shortly thereafter,president fagan and gsu vice president timothy arr met and agreed to allow msw students to attend a board meeting scheduled for december,so that the plaintiffs could voice their complaints.several msw students attended the december meeting,and they were permitted to protest with picket signs.later that evening,several msw students attended a gsu holiday party,which also was attended by the defendants some students carried signs and others passed out leaflets protesting the defendants handling of the msw accreditation issue.
on january,the defendants held an executive board meeting to discuss the msw program.during this meeting,the defendants attorney summarized his research on the msw accreditation issue,including the possibility of litigation and settlement options.
on january,gsu hosted a series of alumni events,which entailed an alumni town meeting,followed by individual networking receptions for each of gsu academic departments,and an alumni dinner.the purpose of the alumni town meeting was to discuss gsu strategic planning process with alumni,while the purpose of the alumni networking receptions and dinner was to facilitate alumni networking.featured speakers at the dinner included president fagan and state senator debbie halvorson.
the gsu alumni association created the invitation list for the january events by identifying all gsu graduates as of august,and eliminating any whose addresses were not in zip codes within driving distance.invitations were mailed in december of,and invitees were asked to return a response card by january,indicating which of the events they planned to attend.although gsu officials initially expected around alumni and guests to attend the events,more than confirmed their attendance.
in preparation for the january events,gsu director of public safety albert chesser composed two memos addressed to president fagan regarding security.in the first memo,dated january,chesser stated that c ampus access will be open and we expect a positive impact in handling the potential protestors disturbances,ex.in a second memo,dated january,chesser noted a change in plans.in addition to closing two of the six university entrances and monitoring the remaining four,the memo states that security will only allow picket signs outside in the vestibule area,but not to stop any flow of guest attendance,ex.although both memos were addressed to president fagan,he denies receiving them,and chesser recalls sending them to his immediate supervisor,vice president arr,rather than to president fagan.
on the day of the events,the plaintiffs gathered outside of gsu main entrance in order to protest the defendants handling of the msw accreditation issue and to meet with state senator halvorson.some of the plaintiffs carried picket signs.security officers informed the plaintiffs that they could picket on the walkway outside of the building,but that they could not bring their picket signs into the building.the plaintiffs were allowed to enter the atrium without their picket signs and to converse with registered guests,but they were denied access to other areas of the building,including the library and restrooms.as a result of the restrictions,the plaintiffs claim that they were prevented from attending a previously scheduled meeting with senator halvorson.
with the exception of bruce friefeld,who arrived after the plaintiffs had disbanded,no member of the board of trustees attended the january alumni events.president fagan,however,was in attendance at some point during the events,chesser informed president fagan of the protest.president fagan testified that he told chesser that the students should be allowed to protest and in no situation whatsoever should there be any physical altercation at all,at.
discussiona.substantive due process 
the plaintiffs submit that the district court erred when it granted the defendants motion to dismiss their substantive due process claim.the plaintiffs submit that the defendants deprived them of a fundamental right to a continuing education.we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.see hickey,cir.in doing so,this court must accept all facts alleged in the complaint as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.see lachmund adm investor,cir.dismissal is proper if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs can not prove any set of facts entitling them to relief.see first ins.funding fed.ins,cir.
in washington glucksberg,d,the supreme court identified two controlling features of substantive due process 
first,we have regularly observed that the due process clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are,objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.second,we have required in cases a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.our nation history,legal traditions,and practices thus provide the crucial guideposts for responsible that direct and restrain our exposition of the due process clause.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted in keeping with the analytical pattern mandated by glucksberg,we first must identify carefully the interest that the plaintiffs claim to be constitutionally protected.then we must determine whether our nation history,legal traditions and practices permit our characterizing that interest as fundamental.in this process,we must adhere to existing precedent of the supreme court and of this court.
as the district court noted,the right asserted by the plaintiffs is best described as the right to an accredited graduate school education.neither the supreme court nor this court has recognized education as a fundamental right.the opportunity to receive a education from an accredited graduate school program certainly has not received such recognition.indeed,in san antonio independent school district rodriguez,d,the supreme court expressly declined the invitation to hold that education is a fundamental right under the due process clause.the court took the view that education is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under the constitution and that it could not find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected.id.at.relying on rodriguez,this court recently stated in dunn fairfield community high school district,cir,that,a lthough students may have some substantive due process rights while they are in school,education itself is not a fundamental right.internal citations omitted.
the supreme court has not overruled rodriguez.it is the governing precedent.nevertheless,the plaintiffs attempt to avoid the clear import of rodriguez by contending that the supreme court presumed the existence of a constitutionally protected right in a university student continued enrollment in a public institution in regents of the university of michigan ewing,d,and in board of curators of the university of missouri horowitz,d.the plaintiffs reliance on these cases is misplaced.the court in ewing and horowitz merely assumed,without deciding,that federal courts can review an academic decision of a public educational institution under a substantive due process standard.ewing,at.see also horowitz,at.in neither case did the court affirmatively recognize a substantive due process right in a student continued enrollment in a public institution.indeed,in both ewing and horowitz,the court expressly stated that it would not reach the issue of whether the plaintiff assumed property interest gave rise to a substantive right under the due process clause because the plaintiff claim failed even if the court were to assume such a right.see ewing,at.holding that,even if a student assumed property interest in a program of study culminating in an undergraduate degree and a medical degree gave rise to a substantive right under the due process clause to continued enrollment free from arbitrary state action,the facts of record disclose no such action horowitz,at.holding that,even if courts can review an academic decision of a public educational institution under substantive due process,the plaintiff claim would fail because the defendants conduct was not arbitrary and capricious see also akins bd.of governors of state colls,cir noting that neither the supreme court nor the seventh circuit has recognized that a student at a university has a substantive due process right to continued enrollment,vacated on other grounds by bd.of governors of state colls.univs.akins,d.
the plaintiffs submission fares no better when it is characterized as a display of arbitrary government action that deprived the plaintiffs of their asserted interest in obtaining a degree from an accredited institution.in their view,the alleged action of the defendants shocks the conscience and therefore constitutes the sort of egregious executive action that the substantive component of the due process clause is designed to prevent.
in county of sacramento lewis,d,the supreme court,in elaborating on the particular substantive due process concerns that ought to be addressed by a court in assessing executive action,noted that the cornerstone of due process is protection against government power arbitrarily and oppressively exercised.the court emphasized that only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court then defined such constitutionally cognizable conduct as that which shocks the conscience.id elaborating on this standard,the court stated that liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process and that conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.id.at.
we do not believe that the alleged executive action in this case can fairly be characterized as so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.lewis,at.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants induced them to enroll in a master of social work program by knowingly and falsely representing to them that the program was approved for accreditation.the plaintiffs further allege that the defendants failed to take the steps necessary to ensure that the program would gain accreditation.according to the plaintiffs,the defendants hired unqualified faculty members and maintained an inadequate curriculum,knowing that such decisions would prevent the msw program from gaining accreditation.assuming that these allegations are true,we certainly are sympathetic to the plaintiffs situation however,we do not believe that the defendants alleged conduct is sufficiently egregious to shock the conscience,as that term has been employed in substantive due process analysis.
finally,we note further that the plaintiffs due process claim can not succeed under the precedent of this circuit because adequate state law remedies are available to them.the plaintiffs asserted substantive due process interest exists if at all only as a matter of state contract law.in contreras city of chicago,cir,we stated that,when a plaintiff substantive due process claim is predicated on the deprivation of a state created property interest,the plaintiff must show that the state actor conduct was arbitrary and irrational,and that the state actor committed a separate constitutional violation or that state law remedies are inadequate.see also centres,town of brookfield,cir strasburger bd.of,hardin county cmty.unit sch.dist,cir doherty city of chicago,cir kauth hartford ins.of illinois,cir.we reasoned that such a disciplined jurisprudence was necessary in order to not undermine established supreme court precedent requiring plaintiffs complaining of arbitrary deprivations of their property to seek redress through state remedies.contreras,at internal quotation marks omitted.
assuming,arguendo,that the defendants acted arbitrarily and irrationally,the plaintiffs substantive due process claim still must fail because there is no independent constitutional violation and state law provides an adequate remedy.the plaintiffs are able to sue the defendants in state court under various state causes of action,including fraud and promissory estoppel.accordingly,the district court correctly granted the defendants motion to dismiss this claim.
procedural due process 
the plaintiffs next submit that the district court erred by dismissing their procedural due process claim.we review the district court dismissal of this claim de novo.see hickey,at.
a procedural due process claim requires two principal inquiries first,whether the plaintiff was deprived of a protected property or liberty interest,and second,whether the plaintiff was deprived of that interest without sufficient procedural protections.see doherty,at.in this case,the parties dispute whether the plaintiffs have a protected property interest in an accredited graduate degree whether the defendants,as opposed to ncswe,deprived the plaintiffs of that interest and whether the deprivation occurred without due process of law.
for purposes of procedural due process,property is a legitimate claim of entitlement.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.a claim of entitlement is not created by federal law instead it is created and defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.id.accordingly,property interests usually arise from rights created by state statutes,state or municipal regulations or ordinances,and contracts with public entities.ulichny merton cmty.sch,cir see also johnson city of fort wayne,cir noting that a property interest may arise from an express or implied contract,as well as a state statute or regulation.
the plaintiffs assert that defendants deprived them of a property interest in an expected degree from an accredited state institution.illinois courts have not identified clearly a property right in education however,illinois courts have found that the payment of tuition to an educational institution ordinarily gives rise to an implied contract that the school will award a degree upon the student satisfaction of the degree requirements established by the school.see johnson lincoln christian,d,holding that a student who allegedly completed all the requirements for a diploma but had not been given a diploma stated a cause of action for breach of an implied contract wilson illinois benedictine,d,stating that a university and its students have a contractual relationship and the terms of the contract are set forth in the university catalogs.because a property interest may be derived from an implied contract in some instances,see perry sindermann,d,and the plaintiffs allege that the defendants represented to them that they would graduate with an accredited degree upon completion of the program requirements,the plaintiffs arguably possessed a property interest in an accredited degree.
assuming that the plaintiffs had a protected property interest in an accredited degree,the next inquiry is whether the plaintiffs complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants deprived the plaintiffs of that protected interest.the district court held that the defendants did not work such a deprivation because ncswe was responsible for making the decision not to grant accreditation.on appeal,the defendants urge this court to affirm the district court finding,stating that ncswe autonomous accreditation decision,and its impact on the social work program and its graduates,can not support a claim for procedural due process against the gsu defendants.appellees br.at.the plaintiffs,on the other hand,argue that the district court and the defendants misconstrue their allegations although ncswe was responsible for approving the accreditation process,the defendants were responsible for ensuring that its programs and faculty were sufficient to qualify for accreditation.
we believe that the plaintiffs complaint states a sufficient deprivation caused by the defendants.taking the allegations in the complaint as true,as we must,the defendants induced the plaintiffs to enroll in the msw program by knowingly and falsely representing to the plaintiffs that the program was or would be approved for accreditation and then took no affirmative steps to ensure that the program would qualify for accreditation.
because the defendants alleged conduct was random and unauthorized,we must focus on whether meaningful remedies exist under state law.see hudson palmer,d a n unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment if a meaningful remedy for the loss is available.the answer to this question is yes.the plaintiffs are free to seek a wide variety of relief in state court under numerous legal theories,including common law fraud and promissory estoppel.there is no reason to believe that these potential causes of action do not afford the plaintiffs a meaningful remedy.although the plaintiffs complaint alleges that they had no available state remedies to address the defendants refusal to provide them with the expected degrees for which they matriculated,this court routinely has held that such a conclusory allegation is insufficient to state a procedural due process claim,especially as in this case,when the plaintiffs have failed to explain why they can not pursue their claim in the illinois state courts.doherty,at.
first amendment claims 
the plaintiffs next submit that the defendants conspired to prevent the plaintiffs from exercising their first amendment right to protest the defendants handling of the accreditation process during the january alumni events and that the defendants retaliated against the plaintiffs on that date for previously exercising their right to speak out in opposition to gsu and its administration.the plaintiffs contend that the defendants retaliated against them by preventing them from picketing inside the building and by denying them access to various parts of the building,including the library and restrooms.following discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to offer sufficient evidence that the defendants personally were involved in the decision to restrict the plaintiffs to the atrium without picket signs during the alumni events.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.see dersch energies,shell oil,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see wainscott henry,cir.
section creates a cause of action based upon personal liability and predicated upon fault.an individual can not be held liable in a action unless he caused or participated in the alleged constitutional deprivation.sonquist,cir see also starzenski city of elkhart,cir.section does not allow actions against individuals merely for their supervisory role of others.zimmerman tribble,cir.instead,a causal connection,or an affirmative link,between the misconduct complained of and the official sued is necessary,at.
in this case,the plaintiffs contend that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether president fagan and the individual members of the board of trustees conspired to prevent the plaintiffs from exercising their first amendment rights during the january alumni events.
the evidence relating to the trustees is particularly weak.with the exception of bruce friefeld,none of the trustees attended the alumni events,and friefeld did not arrive until after the plaintiffs had left and the alleged first amendment violation had taken place.essentially,the plaintiffs contend that the trustees participation in the alleged constitutional deprivation may be inferred from their discussion of the accreditation issue during the board of trustees executive meeting on january,and the temporal proximity between that meeting and the events that transpired on january.we can not accept this argument.
the minutes for the january meeting reflect that the defendants attorney was present and that he summarized the research he had done regarding the msw program accreditation issue and informed the trustees of possible litigation options the students might pursue,ex.the minutes further reflect that p ossible settlement options and the budget implications were discussed and t he draft of a press release regarding the msw situation was reviewed.id.the minutes do not reflect that the january alumni events,much less a potential demonstration by the plaintiffs during the events,were discussed.additionally,each of the trustees submitted to the district court an affidavit attesting that he or she had no involvement in anything that transpired in connection with the alumni events.based on the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs,a reasonable jury could not infer that the trustees participated in a plan to prevent the plaintiffs protest.accordingly,the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the trustees.
we now turn to the plaintiffs contention that president fagan conspired to impair their first amendment rights and to retaliate against them for having exercised previously their first amendment rights 
in addition to his presence at the january executive board meeting,the plaintiffs allege that president fagan was the one who actually articulated the order to prevent the plaintiffs from protesting during the january alumni events.in support of this contention,the plaintiffs offer three pieces of evidence plaintiff christy polaski testimony that two unidentified security guards told her on january that the building was closed pursuant to president fagan instruction timothy arr testimony that president fagan had the authority to make the decision that students would not be permitted
