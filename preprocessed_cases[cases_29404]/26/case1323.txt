los alamitos unified school district the district filed an action to validate its agreement with a contractor performing improvements on the track and athletic field of the district high school.another contractor,howard contracting,howard,filed an answer,claiming the agreement was unconstitutional,illegal,and invalid because the district did not obtain competitive bids for the project.the trial court did not err in granting the district motion for summary judgment,as the district was not required to obtain competitive bids under education code section.we affirm the judgment in favor of the district.

discussion 
for summary judgment 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.merrill navegar,cal th.a plaintiff moving for summary judgment must prove each element of each cause of action.code civ,subd.p.if the moving plaintiff satisfies this initial burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to set forth specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to a cause of action or a defense.ibid.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.merrill navegar,supra,at.
the agreement between the district and byrom davey was entered into pursuant to education code,subdivision a,which provides notwithstanding section,the governing board of a school district,without advertising for bids,may let,for a minimum rental of one dollar a year,to any person,firm,or corporation any real property that belongs to the district if the instrument by which such property is let requires the lessee therein to construct on the demised premises,or provide for the construction thereon of,a building or buildings for the use of the school district during the term thereof,and provides that title to that building shall vest in the school district at the expiration of that term.the instrument may provide for the means or methods by which that title shall vest in the school district prior to the expiration of that term,and shall contain such other terms and conditions as the governing board may deem to be in the best interest of the school district.thus,section,subdivision a expressly provides that notwithstanding the bidding process established by education code section,the district was permitted to engage in the type of transaction at issue here without advertising for bids.
in its motion for summary judgment,the district offered admissible evidence that it owns the land to be leased byrom davey,the contractor for the project,agreed to construct the project for a guaranteed maximum price and title to the site and all improvements made by the project will vest in the district at the end of the lease term.therefore,the district met its initial burden of establishing the necessary elements of its validation action.
howard did not challenge that the district had met its initial burden in the trial court,and does not do so on appeal.rather,howard argues that the use of the process was unconstitutional,unconscionable,illegal,and a theft of public funds.howard argues that despite the language of education code section,subdivision a,specifying arrangements may be entered into without advertising for bids,california public contract law requiring competitive bidding applied here,making the agreement between the district and byrom davey illegal 
the district contends the language of education code section exempts agreements from the competitive bidding that would otherwise apply to a public works contract.the great weight of authority supports this interpretation of section.
the attorney general interpreted an earlier version of education code section and concluded it exempted school district arrangements from the competitive bidding process.the predecessor of section provided the governing board of a school district may let,at a minimum rental of one dollar a year,to any person,firm,or corporation any real property which belongs to the district if the instrument by which such property is let requires the lessee therein to construct on the demised premises,or provide for the construction thereon of,a building or buildings for the use of the school district during the term thereof,and provides that title to such building shall vest in the school district at the expiration of such term.such instrument may provide for the means or methods by which such title shall vest in the school district prior to the expiration of such term,and shall contain such other terms and conditions as the governing board may deem to be in the best interest of the school district,former stats,ch.
in,the attorney general interpreted education code former section as follows there is no question but that the legislature has plainly,unambiguously,and explicitly imposed notice and bid requirements with respect only to construction authorized by education code former section and not to that authorized by section.considerations of wisdom,expediency,or policy suggest a contrary conclusion but such factors may be effectuated only by amendment through the legislative process rather than judicial construction.such judicial restraint prevents inadvertently invalidating such construction,without notice or bids,as may have occurred pursuant to the provisions of section.it is concluded that the legislature excluded an arrangement entered into under section from the notice and bid requirements.because a school district is not required to obtain bids for lease arrangements under section,it may lease its property for the purpose of permitting the construction thereon of school buildings which the district will lease at such rental rates as the governing board deems in the best interests of the district without reference to competitive bidding.
in,the california legislature sought to amend education code section to r
