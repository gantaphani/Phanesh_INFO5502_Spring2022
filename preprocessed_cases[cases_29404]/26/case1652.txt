background 
on december,ryan murray was a student at bryn mawr school,operated by defendant,the chicago board of education board.on that day,ryan was participating in an extracurricular lunch period tumbling class sponsored by the board and conducted by defendants,chicago youth center cyc and its employee,james collins.ryan apparently attempted to perform a forward flip off a and landed on his neck or shoulders.as a result of the accident,ryan is now a quadriplegic.
ryan and his mother,joyce mayer,brought suit against defendants.plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged that defendants,with an utter indifference and conscious disregard for the safety of ryan murray,were willful and wanton.plaintiffs further alleged,inter alia,that defendants knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard,failed to supply appropriate safety and protective equipment,failed to supply a spotter,failed to warn ryan of the risk of spinal cord injury,and failed to stop the class from using the trampoline unsafely.plaintiffs further alleged the board was willful and wanton in failing to supply a harness and safety belt,and supplying inadequate gymnastic floor mats rather than proper trampolining landing mats.plaintiffs complaint also included claims of negligence against defendants,and product liability claims against sports supply group,identified in earlier pleadings as bsn sports,and gsc sports.those claims are not subjects of this appeal.
in his discovery deposition,james collins testified that cyc offered the tumbling class at bryn mawr with the permission of the board.beginning in the spring semester,collins,a cyc employee,began instructing the tumbling class.collins had a degree in physical education and limited experience with tumbling,gymnastics,and the.collins had no license or certificate qualifying him as a trampoline instructor or teacher.collins had never taught the to anyone prior to instructing the tumbling class at bryn mawr,but had acted as a spotter under the supervision of an instructor.
according to collins,ryan began taking the extracurricular tumbling class offered by cyc at bryn mawr in the spring term,when he was in the seventh grade.the tumbling class was held two days each week and lasted about minutes.between and students participated in the tumbling class on a given day.no other teachers or instructors supervised the tumbling class.
typically,the students would come to the gym and sign in before class.students were permitted to wear clothes and socks while tumbling.class would always begin with stretching exercises.the students would then work on whatever gymnastic maneuver collins planned to practice that day.for the most part,tumbling class consisted of learning and practicing floor maneuvers,including forward rolls,dive rolls,and cartwheels.collins used the as part of his regular class on only a few occasions.however,at the end of each class,once the planned instruction was finished,collins would give the students the last to minutes of the class period to freelance and to show out or try to impress someone.generally,the would be made available to the students during this time.the students would bring the onto the gym floor and set it up.collins would then make sure the trampoline was locked in position and a double layer of floor mats was placed around the device.
once the was set up,the students would form a line and take turns using it.some of the students would simply jump off the,while other students who were more advanced might do a flip or somersault off the.on occasion,collins would spot the students.he also taught the students how to spot each other.however,collins did not require that spotters be used every time a student jumped off the but,rather,only if the student requested one.collins did not always provide spotters when students performed maneuvers outside of those he was teaching or beyond the student skill level.
on december,the tumbling class proceeded as usual.collins was the only instructor for to students.after regular class instruction was finished,the was set up and the students were allowed to freelance.ryan got in line and,when it was his turn,made a running approach to the,jumped off the into the air,and rotated in a forward flip.he then landed on the mats on his upper body,sustaining injuries and rendering him a quadriplegic.collins was in the gymnasium at the time of the accident,but was standing a few yards away,talking with a female student.he had not spotted the students using the,nor had he assigned other students to act as spotters on the day of ryan accident.collins saw ryan approach the before the accident and it appeared to him that ryan was going to attempt a double forward flip.however,collins was too far away from the to intervene.after ryan accident,collins immediately sent some students to the office to call for assistance.collins stayed with ryan until emergency services arrived and ryan was taken by ambulance to the hospital.
ryan murray testified during his discovery deposition that he never saw collins spot anyone off of the and that his injury occurred during the freelance part of the class.ryan had only done a forward flip two or three times,and he did not imagine that he could land on his head or neck while doing a forward flip.ryan imagined falling probably on his knees or incorrectly on his feet,but he did not know a forward flip could cause him to be seriously injured or paralyzed.the worst injury he imagined was probably a broken leg or arm.ryan testified that when he was injured,his body landed partially on the mat and partially on the floor.ryan stated that he felt a lot of pain in his neck and could not get up.
the only expert opinion offered by the parties in this case was plaintiffs retained expert,marc rabinoff,a doctor of education and a tenured professor of human performance sport and leisure studies at metropolitan state college of denver in colorado.he reviewed the statements of witnesses,depositions,photographs,and exhibits provided by plaintiffs attorneys and rendered a series of opinions on issues of liability in this case.the opinions were furnished to defendants in response to interrogatories,and he was deposed by defendant attorneys.rabinoff had more than years of experience in his field and has testified in several cases as a gymnastics expert.
rabinoff testified that it is well known that the is associated with the risk of spinal cord injury from improperly executed somersaults.according to rabinoff,the use of the requires competent instruction and supervision,and competent spotters for safety and prevention of catastrophic injury.in rabinoff opinion,the tumbling environment was not appropriate for executing somersaults off of a competitive professional because those maneuvers require considerable skill,spotting,and appropriate landing mats.the minimum mat requirement was not met,and there were absolutely no spotters.according to rabinoff,the tumbling program was one of the worst environments he had ever seen and violated every single safety standard.in his opinion,ryan murray injury would have been prevented had more than two inches of mat been used on the landing surface.
rabinoff testified it was collins job,as the tumbling instructor,to know the maneuver each gymnast intended to execute and that collins supervision and instruction were inadequate.in fact,rabinoff was shocked that collins inappropriately rolled ryan murray over after the accident,when ryan had a suspected head and neck injury.in rabinoff opinion,collins was not qualified to teach tumbling.rabinoff indicated that school districts all over the country had banned trampolines from tumbling classes to years before ryan murray accident,that the chicago schools should not have purchased the trampoline and should not have permitted collins to use the trampoline in tumbling classes.
rabinoff concluded that collins demonstrated reckless conduct or conscious disregard for the safety of ryan murray in that 
he elected,made a decision,not to spot,he made a decision to use the mini trampoline improperly he made a decision to use mats that are inadequate he made a decision to conduct that class the way it was conducted,that reckless to me,and complete disregard for what could potentially happen if a participant,a student in that class does make it all the way around off the.
rabinoff also concluded that the board of education demonstrated reckless conduct or a conscious disregard for the safety of ryan murray in the purchase and use of the.it was also clear to rabinoff that not enough mats were used on the landing area because ryan murray landed partially on the mat and partially on the bare gymnasium floor.
rabinoff report was also attached to his deposition and made a part of the record.the report indicates that in expressing his opinions on the issues of liability and probable cause,he relied on his education,training and experience,the other materials furnished to him,and guidelines and warnings on use of and trampolines issued by the united states gymnastics federation usgf,the american alliance for health,physical education,recreation and dance,the national collegiate athletic association ncaa,the american academy of pediatrics aap,the united states product safety commission,and the american society for testing and materials.rabinoff report quotes extensively from the usgf safety manuals in effect at the time of ryan injury 
the gymnastics safety manual,second edition requires that spotting should be required for activities.the decision as to when and how spotting should be employed rests with the teacher.skillful use of spotting and a safety rig are essential when teaching somersault activities.james collins failed to adhere to the gymnastics safety manual guidelines regarding spotting.
the safety manual,second edition,requires the following landing surface 
a suitable landing surface can be established by placing a landing mat x on top of a base mat x.this matting arrangement,positioned securely against the forward legs of the mini tramp,serves as a minimum recommendation for stand up jumping activities.for somersault activities,an additional landing mat x placed on top of the above described landing surface or an to safety cushion placed on top of the base mat is recommended.
the chicago board of education failed to supply the appropriate equipment for a landing surface.they further failed to supply a harness or safety belt to ryan murray while performing a somersault maneuver.
the wrestling mats used by and set up by collins for tumbling class were inappropriate and in clear violation of the gymnastics safety manual guidelines.
the gymnastics safety manual,second edition,requires that use of the occur under the supervision of a trained and qualified instructor.collins was not a trained and qualified instructor.
the gymnastics safety manual,second edition,requires that the instructor inform students about the potential risks associated with the use of the and that the instructor be sure that the risks and rules are appreciated and understood.collins did not inform students of the potential risks and ryan murray,a student in his class,did not appreciate and understand the risks of trampolining.
the gymnastics safety manual,second edition,clearly warns that improper execution of the somersault is one of the most common causes of serious,catastrophic spinal cord injury.this warning applies to both forward and backward somersaults as well as any of their related dive roll activities.collins as a trampoline instructor knew or should have known of this risk.
the failure of collins to adhere to the guidelines enunciated in the gymnastics safety manual,demonstrates reckless conduct or conscious disregard for the safety of ryan murray and the students in the tumbling class at bryn mawr school.
the chicago board of education did not adequately determine collins qualifications to teach tumbling and.
risk of serious injury,including quadriplegia,is known to occur from improper execution of a somersault when using a.
safety rules are a fundamental part of a safe trampoline program.the rules should be conspicuously and thoroughly understood by each participant in the class.each student must understand and respect the hazards of the trampoline and the disastrous consequence including paralysis of an improper head and neck landing.safety must be constantly reinforced.a student does not assume any risk of which he is not aware or does not appreciate.responsibility rests on the instructor to communicate the risk.knowledge of the risk is not enough.appreciation of the risk of serious catastrophic injury,including paralysis,must be supplied to every student by the instructor.the instructor must ascertain that the student understands this risk.
rabinoff opinions and deposition were submitted to the court in response to cyc and collins motion for summary judgment alleging that the pleaded facts did not constitute willful and wanton conduct as a matter of law,in addition to contending immunity applied.the board motion for summary judgment was limited to the issue of immunity and did not address the willful and wanton conduct issue.
the circuit court ultimately granted defendants motions for summary judgment.the circuit court held,pursuant to sections and a of the tort immunity act ilcs,a west,collins,cyc,and the board were entitled to immunity from all of plaintiffs claims.the circuit court,relying on a fourth district appellate court opinion,johnson decatur park district,d,ruled that section of the act did not serve to trump the blanket immunity provided by sections and a.the court did not revisit the earlier denial of cyc and collins motion on the willful and wanton conduct issue.
the appellate court affirmed the circuit court grant of summary judgment,but held,because trampolining is a hazardous recreational activity,section of the tort immunity act is the provision that determines the scope of defendants immunity.d at.accordingly,defendants were immune from all negligence claims,but pursuant to section c of the act,defendants would not be immune if plaintiff injury resulted from defendants willful and wanton conduct.d at.nevertheless,the appellate court held,based on the facts drawn from plaintiffs second amended complaint and the affidavits,depositions,and documents on file,defendants actions do not approach the degree of blameworthiness necessary to maintain an action for willful and wanton behavior.d at.
at the time of ryan accident in,sections and a of the tort immunity act provided 
except as otherwise provided by statute,a public employee serving in a position involving the determination of policy or the exercise of discretion is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission in determining policy when acting in the exercise of such discretion even though abused.ilcs west.
a except as otherwise provided by this act and subject to subdivision b neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by a failure to supervise an activity on or the use of any public property.ilcs a west.
plaintiffs do not dispute that,under ordinary circumstances,sections and a of the tort immunity act would provide defendants with absolute immunity for discretionary and supervisory conduct.plaintiffs maintain,however,the appellate court correctly determined that section of the tort immunity act,that sets forth the scope of immunity afforded local governmental entities and their employees in relation to hazardous recreational activities,applies in this case.
in,section of the tort immunity act provided 
a neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable to any person who participates in a hazardous recreational activity,including any person who assists the participant,or to any spectator who knew or reasonably should have known the hazardous recreational activity created a substantial risk of injury to himself or herself and was voluntarily in the place of risk,or having the ability to do so failed to leave,for any damage or injury to property or persons arising out of that hazardous recreational activity.
b as used in this section,hazardous recreational activity means a recreational activity conducted on property of a local public entity which creates a substantial as distinguished from a minor,trivial,or insignificant risk of injury to a participant or a spectator.
hazardous recreational activity also means 
animal racing,including equestrian competition,archery,bicycle racing or jumping,boat racing,and downhill skiing,hang gliding,kayaking,motorized vehicle racing,motorcycling or driving of any kind,orienteering,pistol and rifle shooting,rock climbing,rocketeering,rodeo,spelunking,sky diving,sport parachuting,body contact sports,sports in which it is reasonably foreseeable that there will be rough bodily contact with one or more participants,surfing,trampolining,tree climbing,tree rope swinging where the person or persons furnished their own rope,water skiing,white water rafting,and wind surfing.
c notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a,this section does not limit liability which would otherwise exist for any of the following 
failure of the local public entity or public employee to guard or warn of a dangerous condition of which it has actual or constructive notice and of which the participant does not have nor can be reasonably expected to have had notice.
an act of willful and wanton conduct by a public entity or a public employee which is a proximate cause of the injury.nothing in this subsection creates a duty of care or basis of liability for personal injury or for damage to personal property.emphasis added.ilcs west.
accordingly,plaintiffs maintain that the immunity afforded defendants is limited by the exceptions found in section.
plaintiffs also contend,however,that the appellate court erred when it determined there were no genuine issues of material fact on whether any of defendants acts or omissions amounted to willful and wanton conduct.plaintiffs seek reversal and a remand for trial on their claims that defendants acted willfully and wantonly.
as an additional basis for reversal,plaintiffs contend that their second amended complaint contains allegations that defendants failed to guard or warn ryan of the risks of using a,bringing their claims within the section c exception to the general grant of immunity.plaintiffs argue the appellate court erred because it failed to consider whether these allegations survived summary dismissal.
defendants,on the other hand,argue the appellate court erred when it ruled that the limited immunity afforded by section of the act supercedes the blanket immunity otherwise provided by sections and a of the act.defendants ask this court to affirm the grant of summary judgment in their favor,but on the grounds that sections and a of the act provide defendants with absolute immunity from all claims that challenge their discretionary and supervisory decisions,whether negligence or willful and wanton conduct is alleged.in the alternative,defendants argue that if section applies to limit their immunity to negligent acts,the appellate court ruling that defendants could not be shown to have acted willfully or wantonly should be affirmed.
this court review of a circuit court grant of summary judgment is de novo.morris margulis.summary judgment is appropriate whenever the pleadings,depositions,admissions,and affidavits on file,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,show there is no genuine issue of material fact between the parties and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.home insurance cincinnati insurance.
in granting summary judgment,the circuit court was required to interpret the tort immunity act.the proper construction of a statute is a question of law,subject to de novo review.barnett zion park district.the main goal in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.henrich libertyville high school.
the tort immunity act 
in,the general assembly enacted the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act to replace sovereign immunity,abolished by this court in molitor kaneland community unit district.both molitor and the act were validated by the illinois constitution see.const,art.xiii,except as the general assembly may provide by law,sovereign immunity in this state is abolished.the act protects local public entities and public employees from liability arising from the operation of government.van meter darien park district.the purpose of the act is to prevent dissipation of public funds on damage awards in tort cases.ilcs a west van meter,at.
the act imposes no duties,but merely codifies those duties existing at common law,to which the subsequently delineated immunities apply.barnett,at,see also moore green.unless an immunity provision applies,municipalities are liable in tort to the same extent as private parties.see barnett,at.
the overarching issue in this appeal is whether the general grant of immunity and the exceptions for hazardous recreational activity found in section of the act apply and,if so,whether section takes precedence over sections and a of the act.we find it does.
section of the act provides except as otherwise provided by statute,a public employee serving in a position involving the determination of policy or the exercise of discretion is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission in determining policy when acting in the exercise of such discretion even though abused.emphasis added.ilcs west.this section,together with section ilcs west a local public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of its employee where the employee is not liable,provides both public employees and the public employer with immunity against allegations that challenge discretionary policy determinations.arteman clinton community unit school district,mcgurk lincolnway community school district,d.allegations of a failure to supervise are immunized by section a except as otherwise provided by this act and subject to subdivision b neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by a failure to supervise an activity on or the use of any public property.emphasis added.ilcs a west.this court has held that these provisions,when applicable,provide immunity from both negligent,as well as willful and wanton conduct.see desmet county of rock island,arteman,at,henrich libertyville high school,epstein chicago board of education.we note that this court prior determinations on the scope of the immunities provided by sections and a were based on the fact that neither provision contained an explicit exception for willful and wanton conduct.section a was subsequently amended and now contains an exception for willful and wanton conduct.see pub.act,eff.december.
this court has never considered the interplay between the immunities provided by sections and a and the limited immunity provided by section.our appellate court,however,has considered this issue.in mcgurk,d,a student received head injuries while playing football.the student and his guardian brought suit against the school district,alleging the school district was negligent in its provision and modification of the football helmet used by the student.the appellate court held that the selection or modification of the school equipment was a discretionary determination immunized under section of the tort immunity act.however,the appellate court went on to hold 
section of the tort immunity act does not provide an absolute blanket of immunity to all public entities rather,it provides immunity for public employees involved in determination of public policy or the exercise of discretion,e xcept as otherwise provided by statute.citation.
one such exception is found in section of the tort immunity act.citation.section provides that public entities and employees are not liable to persons participating in hazardous recreational activities,including body contact sports however,immunity does not extend to willful and wanton acts that are the proximate causes of injury.citation.football is unquestionably a body contact sport,a sport in which it is reasonably foreseeable that there will be rough bodily contact with one or more participants.citation.thus,under the plain language of section,the legislature exempted willful and wanton conduct from the immunity extended to cases involving body contact sports such as football.emphasis omitted.mcgurk,d at.
in johnson decatur park district,d,the court came to an opposite conclusion.in johnson,similar to the case at bar,the plaintiff was seriously injured when he overrotated while performing a forward flip off a in a recreational tumbling class.the court held that the park district was immune from liability against allegations of improper or inadequate supervision pursuant to section a of the act and that section c was not an exception to this immunity because a condition of the was not at issue.johnson,d at.the court then noted 
plaintiffs argue that section c of the act is a limitation on the absolute immunity granted by section a.their argument is that use of a mini trampoline is a hazardous recreational activity and that wilful and wanton conduct is not immunized when it occurs in connection with such activities.they cite no case so holding.they argue that the plain language of section compels this conclusion.johnson,d at.
resolving this issue,the johnson court held 
p laintiffs have misconstrued the import of section c of the act.that subsection does not itself create an exception to the absolute immunity granted by section a of the act.it simply states that nothing in section a of the act limits liability which would otherwise exist for an act of wilful and wanton conduct by a public entity or employee that is a proximate cause of injury.thus,if section of the act does not itself contain an exception for wilful and wanton conduct in connection with supervisory activities,section c of the act does not apply to provide such an exception,simply because the activity involved may be a hazardous recreational activity.johnson,d at.
here,the appellate court rejected the reasoning in johnson,stating its belief that the johnson court did not give sufficient consideration to the e xcept as otherwise provided by this act language prefacing the section a immunity provision.d at.we agree with the appellate court conclusion.
it is clear from the prefatory language found in both section a and section of the act that the legislature did not intend for the immunities afforded public entities and their employees to be absolute and applicable in all circumstances.in section a the legislature included the conditional language e xcept as otherwise provided by this act,indicating that the immunity afforded by this provision would not apply if other exceptions or limitations of the act were applicable.in section of the act the legislature included the prefatory language except as otherwise provided by statute,indicating that section immunity is contingent upon whether other provisions,either within the act or some other statute,creates exceptions to or limitations on that immunity.
although we were not called upon to decide this exact issue in epstein,our comments in epstein lend support for our determination here.in epstein,this court examined the immunity afforded under section a for failure to supervise an activity on public property.we concluded 
section a grants immunity e xcept as otherwise provided by this act,ch,par.a.accordingly,section a by its own terms provides that the only exceptions to its grant of immunity are those set forth elsewhere in the tort immunity act.our review of the entire tort immunity act reveals that it provides exceptions for liability under the workers compensation act and the workers occupational diseases act,ch,pars.c,d,among other things.emphases added.epstein,at.
we did not examine the except as otherwise provided by statute provision of section in epstein.
even when an immunity provision does not contain conditional language as found in sections and a,this court has not hesitated to consider whether the immunity afforded by one provision might be negated or otherwise limited by some other applicable provision.see moore,desmet,at,exception to the application of section immunity may be found where a legislative enactment identifies a specially protected class of individuals to whom statutorily mandated duties are owed.it is a rule of statutory construction that w here there are two statutory provisions,one of which is general and designed to apply to cases generally,and the other is particular and relates to only one subject,the particular provision must prevail.henrich libertyville high school,at,quoting hernon corrigan construction,quoting bowes city of chicago.for example,in doe calumet city,we reconciled section of the act providing general immunity to municipalities and police officers regarding the provision of police services with section of the act and held that an officer acts or omission in executing or enforcing the law will not be immune if they constitute willful and wanton conduct.
we determine that,in the case at bar,although sections and a of the act would ordinarily provide immunity against the type of allegations advanced by plaintiffs,there is otherwise provided in the act a provision directly addressing the situation giving rise to ryan injury.ryan was injured when he was trampolining during an extracurricular tumbling class.
trampolining is specifically listed in section b of the act as a hazardous recreational activity and section a establishes that a public entity or public employee will not be liable to any person who participates in a hazardous recreational activity for any damage or injury to property or persons arising out of a person voluntary participation in a hazardous recreational activity taking place on public property.ilcs a west.this general grant of immunity is subject to two exceptions if the public entity fails to guard or warn of a dangerous condition of which the public entity has actual or constructive notice and of which the participant does not have nor can be reasonably expected to have had notice,and if an act of willful and wanton conduct by a public entity or a public employee proximately causes the injury.ilcs c west.we conclude that the legislature intended to hold local governmental entities and their employees to a higher standard of care for hazardous recreational activities,such as trampolining.thus,in the case at bar,defendants immunity from liability is subject to the exceptions found in section c of the act.
section c exceptions 
having decided that defendants immunity from liability is subject to the two exceptions found in section c of the act,we now address the applicability of those exceptions to this case.
the most fundamental rule in statutory construction is to give effect to the legislative intent.bank national ass clark.the language of the statute is the best indication of the legislature intent.bank national ass n,at.statutory language must be given its plain and ordinary meaning,and courts are not free to construe a statute in a manner that alters the plain meaning of the language adopted by the legislature.bank national ass n,at.if the language of a statute is clear,this court must give effect to its plain and ordinary meaning without resort to other aids of statutory construction.bank national ass n,at,citing king first capital financial services,quoting in re marriage of beyer,d.
section of the act was adopted in.that section provides w illful and wanton conduct as used in this act means a course of action which shows an actual or deliberate intention to cause harm or which,if not intentional,shows an utter indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of others or their property.emphasis added.ilcs west.the language of section is clear and unambiguous.applying fundamental rules of statutory construction,the statutory definition of willful and wanton conduct applies to every section of the act containing that term,including section c.the term willful and wanton includes a range of mental states from actual or deliberate intent to cause harm,to utter indifference for the safety or property of others,to conscious disregard for the safety of others or their property.in addition,the plain meaning of section is entirely consistent with this court common law precedents.
defendants argue that the amendments to the tort immunity act narrowed the definition of willful and wanton conduct to deliberate or conscious conduct disregarding the safety of others and that the pleadings and facts adduced in discovery do not meet that narrow definition.according to defendants,the common law definition of willful and wanton does not apply in tort immunity act cases.we disagree with defendants.a review of this court precedent defining willful and wanton conduct is instructive.
in schneiderman interstate transit lines,this court explained willful and wanton conduct as follows 
a wilful and wanton injury must have been intentional or the act must have been committed under circumstances exhibiting a reckless disregard for the safety of others,such as a failure,after knowledge of impending danger,to exercise ordinary care to prevent it or a failure to discover the danger through recklessness or carelessness when it could have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care.citations.the question whether a personal injury has been inflicted by wilful or wanton conduct is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.schneiderman,at.
in burke rothschild liquor mart,this court was presented with the question of whether the plaintiff alleged contributory negligence could be compared with the particularly egregious willful and wanton conduct of the police officers involved,thus entitling the municipality to a reduction in the damages award reflecting the plaintiff percentage of fault.in interpreting section of the tort immunity act,the court stated it was evident that the legislature did not intend to shield municipalities whose conduct shows a deliberate intention to cause harm or a complete indifference to the safety of others.emphasis added.burke,at.the burke court observed 
we can find no indication in the act that the legislature,balancing its dual interest in protecting municipalities and protecting the people,intended to reject the deterrent of placing willful and wanton conduct beyond the reach of comparison with mere negligence.however,as the legislature has not spoken definitively,we turn for guidance to common law precedents.emphasis added.burke,at.
in the confined context of the issue of comparative negligence,the court initially noted that the illinois pattern jury instructions,civil,ed,definition of willful and wanton conduct was virtually identical to the definition found in section of the act and to the pleading requirements for willful and wanton conduct.burke,at,citing adkins sarah bush lincoln health center.citing earlier authority,the court further noted that,in the context of punitive damages,willful and wanton misconduct approaches the degree of moral blame attached to intentional harm,since the defendant deliberately inflicts a highly unreasonable risk of harm upon others in conscious disregard of it.citation.burke,at.
the court acknowledged that illinois appellate court cases have found willful and wanton conduct where the circumstances involved a conscious and deliberate disregard for the rights or safety of others.burke,at,quoting bresland ideal roller graphics,d,quoting morrow goldschmidt associates,d.the court termed this type of willful and wanton conduct.burke,at.
the court then examined and adopted the restatement second of torts view that there is a qualitative difference between negligence and willful and wanton conduct.burke,at.the court noted that the restatement uses the term reckless conduct,rather than willful and wanton conduct.burke,at.
after carefully considering illinois precedent,federal decisions,and cases from our sister states,as well as learned treatises and relevant statutes,the court concluded that w illful and wanton conduct is found where an act was done with actual intention or with a conscious disregard or indifference for the consequences when the known safety of other persons was involved.emphasis added.burke,at,quoting lynch board of education of collinsville community unit district,quoting myers krajefska.the court indicated that a determination of willful and wanton conduct will be based on the facts of any given case.burke,at.the court ultimately held that b ecause of the qualitative difference between simple negligence and willful and wanton conduct,and because willful and wanton conduct carries a degree of opprobrium not found in merely negligent behavior,the contributory negligence of the plaintiff could not be compared with the willful and wanton conduct of the municipality.burke,at.
this court did not imply by its holding in burke that cases subject to tort immunity defenses require application of a more restrictive definition of willful and wanton conduct than applicable at common law.in burke,a jury had already found the municipality liable for willful and wanton conduct and that finding was not challenged on appeal.rather,burke simply held that a defendant liability for willful and wanton conduct could not be reduced by a plaintiff contributory negligence.
in ziarko soo line,this court considered the issue of whether a joint tortfeasor found guilty of willful and wanton conduct could seek contribution against another joint tortfeasor liable for only negligent conduct.in a plurality opinion,this court acknowledged legal commentary critical of burke,and determined that continued adherence to the full scope of the burke decision could lead to harsh and unjust results supported by neither the clear terms of,nor underlying purposes for,our laws regarding comparative fault and contribution.ziarko,at.
the ziarko plurality noted that the willful and wanton conduct in burke approached the degree of moral blame attached to intentional harm ziarko,at,but nevertheless held that conduct characterized as willful and wanton may be proven where the acts have been less than,when there has been a failure,after knowledge of impending danger,to exercise ordinary care to prevent the danger,or a failure to discover the danger through carelessness when it could have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care.ziarko,at,quoting schneiderman,at.accordingly,the court found that contribution principles could be applied in cases when one defendant is found guilty of negligence and another of willful and wanton acts not rising to the level of intentional misconduct.ziarko,at.
one year after the ziarko decision,a majority of this court expressly adhered to the ziarko analysis of willful and wanton conduct.poole city of rolling meadows.poole involved both a federal civil rights claim and a state claim against the city of rolling meadows,based on the allegedly willful and wanton misconduct of a police officer who shot the plaintiff by mistake while investigating a at the home of the plaintiff mother.a jury found for the officer on the fede
