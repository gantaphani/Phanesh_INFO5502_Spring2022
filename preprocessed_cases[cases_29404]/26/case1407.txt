the county of san diego county and other counties provided mental health services to special education students.when the legislature slashed the funding for such services to statewide,the county sought and obtained a superior court judgment holding that because this was an unfunded state mandate,the county did not have to provide such services.in response,the california department of education department required local school districts to absorb the costs of these services.
grossmont union high school district grossmont sued the department,primarily seeking a declaration that it should not have to pay these costs.the department demurred,asserting grossmont failed to exhaust available administrative remedies,specifically,that it first had to submit the dispute to the california commission on state mandates commission.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
grossmont asserts it would be futile to exhaust administrative remedies because the commission authority extends over only state programs or levels of service,but the costs grossmont complains of result from federal mandates.grossmont also asserts that its contractual and equal protection theories do not implicate the commission authority.
although a party may be excused from complying with an administrative remedy when it would be futile to do so,that exception is narrow and applies only when the outcome of the administrative proceeding is certain.in this case,grossmont complaint alleges facts suggesting the mandate may be a mixed mandate for which partial reimbursement would be available the commission is the body entrusted to make such determination in the first instance.
further,if,as grossmont states,there were no possibility the commission would rule in its favor,that would mean grossmont pleaded itself out of court entirely,because the judiciary lacks any general warrant to compel appropriations or to declare a mandate unenforceable,except after the commission has found an unfunded mandate.
we also reject grossmont subsidiary theories.we conclude grossmont is not an intended beneficiary of the special education funding laws.we also conclude the requirement that grossmont provide services to special education students does not deprive regular students of equal protection,although regular education programs will be cut.
accordingly,we agree with the trial court that grossmont complaint fails to state a cause of action.because grossmont does not suggest how the complaint might be amended,leave to amend was properly denied.see cantu resolution trust th,d.we shall affirm.
background 
we first describe a unfunded state mandates and the commission authority b special education c the standard of review over demurrers d grossmont complaint and e the demurrer and ruling leading to grossmont appeal to this court.
unfunded state mandates 
the property tax relief act of,or sb see stats,ch.stats,ch,created a mechanism to reimburse local governments for some costs of implementing new programs or increased levels of service.
then,the tax revolt changed the california constitution proposition limited the ability of the state of california state to collect property taxes proposition the spirit of in part limited spending and in part enshrined new reimbursement provisions in the california constitution.see department of finance commission on state mandates cal th,d,city of sacramento state of california cal d,hayes commission on state mandates th,d hayes.
section of article xiii b of the california constitution hereafter,section provides in part that,w henever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service.the purpose of section is to prevent the state from shifting costs of general government functions to local agencies in the wake of the tax revolt.see county of san diego state of california cal th,d,county of san diego.
a state requirement that an entity redirect resources is,however,not a reimbursable mandate,only a new cost is reimbursable.see county of los angeles commission on state mandates th,d county of sonoma commission on state mandates th,d sonoma.and shifting costs from one local entity to another is not a reimbursable mandate.city of el monte commission on state mandates th,d el monte city of san jose state of california th,d san jose.
but even some new costs are not reimbursable the commission shall not find costs mandated by the state if,after a hearing,the commission finds any one of the following c the statute or executive order imposes a requirement that is mandated by a federal law or regulation and results in costs mandated by the federal government,unless the statute or executive order mandates costs that exceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation,subd.c see also,federal mandate also includes a state mandate where lack of state mandate would result in substantial monetary penalties or loss of funds.
the legislature enacted procedures to determine if reimbursable costs have been imposed the local agency files a test claim.if the commission approves it,it determines the amount to be reimbursed if the commission denies it,the agency can seek review by means of a petition for writ of administrative mandate.county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.generally,test claims must be filed within a year of the effective date of the mandate or of the incursion of costs,subd.c see,tit,subd.c but see,tolled while procedure for referring the issue to the legislature is employed.the failure to exhaust these administrative remedies bars a party from seeking court relief.central delta water agency state water resources control bd.th,d central delta.
a commission determination that a cost results from an unfunded state mandate does not necessarily mean the legislature will pay for it.if the legislature does not pay,with a favorable commission determination in hand,an entity may seek a court order that it no longer has to obey the mandate if the legislature refuses to appropriate money to satisfy a mandate found to be reimbursable by the commission,a claimant may bring an action for declaratory relief to enjoin enforcement of the mandate,subd.b.lucia mar unified school dist.honig cal d,lucia mar see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.taxation,see also,entity may decline to obey such mandate when legislature identifies it in a budget bill as a mandate for which reimbursement will not be made.

special education 
the general contours of the special education laws are not disputed in this case and have been summarized as follows 
enacted by congress in as the education of the handicapped act,the individuals with disabilities education act idea,was renamed in.its primary objective is to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs citation.to accomplish this goal,the statute provides federal funds to assist state and local agencies in educating children with disabilities,but conditions such funding on compliance with certain goals and procedures.citation.
among the substantive procedures is the development of an individualized education program iep for each child with a disability 
california state law also has a regulatory scheme for special education with the express intent of assuring that all individuals with exceptional needs receive their rights to appropriate programs and services under the idea.cal.
the idea also contains numerous procedural safeguards.parents or guardians of a disabled child must be notified of any proposed change in the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child.citation.parents must also be provided an opportunity to present a complaint with respect to any matter relating to the proposed change 
any party aggrieved by the findings and a final decision has the right to bring a civil action in state or federal court.county of san diego cal.special educ.hearing cir,see generally county of los angeles smith th,d smith.
standard of review 
it is well settled that on demurrer the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,aubry.
as we will describe shortly,grossmont complaint pleads the effect of state and federal laws,an unnamed superior court decision,and an implementing directive by the department.however,as just stated,we do not assume the truth of pleaded conclusions of law.aubry,supra,cal th at,d,berry state of california th,d.
in determining whether a complaint states a cause of action an appellate court may consider matters judicially noticeable.county of lassen state of california th,d county of lassen.this may include a court decision in another case referred to in the complaint and an official act of government,subds.c d,and such facts will negate contrary facts alleged in the complaint.colvig rko general,d.court decision pratt coast trucking,d.official acts of government.we considered taking judicial notice of the superior court case and executive directive described in the complaint,but concluded it was not necessary to do so in this case.
d.the complaint 
on february,grossmont,a public school district in the county,filed its complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and specific performance.although the department is the only named defendant,the complaint refers to the claimed liability of the state itself.we do the same.
the complaint alleges that the state owed grossmont the costs of educating special education students.special education refers to an individualized education for each disabled student,but also includes related medical and other services.the state receives federal funds for such services.i n order to qualify for federal funds,states must mandate their leas local educational agencies provide disabled students with an individualized free and appropriate education fape and related services.if a state qualifies,and accepts federal funds,its leas become responsible to provide fape and related services to any disabled student within the lea boundary.
fape is also sometimes translated as free appropriate public education.see,smith,supra,th at,d.
special education results in high costs,such as the cost of preparing and administering ieps for each student,and the administration of dispute procedures,including the need to pay lawyers and pay the legal bills of parents who succeed in court challenges.special education teachers must have a higher level of training than other teachers,classes must be smaller and more teachers and aides are needed than in regular classes.in some cases grossmont must pay to place students in private schools,which are expensive.
grossmont pleads that although the state has a mechanism for seeking reimbursement or subvention for new programs or higher levels of service,there is no such requirement for old programs,and the state has reduced the already deficient funding provided for education,and reassigned to school districts,including plaintiff,responsibilities previously assigned to other agencies,without any corresponding increase in funding,compelling grossmont to use regular education money to fund special education thereby reducing the amount of regular education money and services.
grossmont alleges that required mental health services for special education students had been provided by san diego county mental health pursuant to what is commonly known as ab and ab services,and this reduced the burden upon the school district to provide those services.ab refers to the adoption of what is now chapter of division of title i of the government code,section et,entitled interagency responsibilities for providing services to children with disabilities,and ab made amendments to that chapter.stats,ch.stats,ch.
in the state reduced the funding for such mental health services to,statewide 
san diego county,with other counties,sued the state under the mandated costs provision of the california constitution.the superior court found that the mandated services were unfunded,within the meaning of the constitution,and entered an order permitting san diego county to cease providing those mental health services.
in response to the court ruling permitting the county to stop paying for mental health related services for disabled students,the department issued a statement that it expected the school districts to provide and pay for the mental health services previously provided by the county because the school districts are by statute required to provide these services.this resulted in a sharp increase in expenses with no additional funding from the state to pay the expense.
this transfer of responsibility without a corresponding increase in funding violated the constitution 
grossmont then pleaded that this violated an appropriations limit.we address that point in part,post.
the complaint alleges shortfalls of millions of dollars per year,and that the encroachments will be increasing because the costs of special education are on a systematic incline while the funding is being reduced.the gap is filled by cutting programs for regular students and other measures.
the complaint makes the following allegation.
proposition was passed by the voters,and amended by proposition,to provide a constitutional guarantee of a minimum of funding for public schools and community colleges.that constitutional guarantee of minimum funding for public schools has been violated by the state of california.
grossmont does not claim the state is diverting federal money to other uses,it pleads both governments are providing too little money.
the complaint purports to state three causes of action.the trial court concluded the complaint merely states three legal theories arising from the purported violation of a single primary right.see slater blackwood cal d,walton walton th,d witkin cal.procedure ed.pleading.we need not resolve that issue,although it leads to a procedural point we discuss in part,post.
in its first theory,grossmont seeks a declaration that the state has violated funding laws and therefore grossmont is no longer required to spend education funding to comply with the special education provisions of the education code because of insufficient funding from the state and federal government.the prayer phrases this as a declaration setting forth the rights and duties of the parties in this case,and specifically an order declaring that grossmont is no longer required to spend education funding to comply with the special education provisions of the education code because of insufficient funding from the state of california and the federal government.
in its second theory,grossmont alleges it is a beneficiary of the special education funding laws the federal government breached its duty to fund special education,and the state,by failing to sue the federal government,was liable for the difference.grossmont filed a government claim raising the contract issue.see,crow state of california d.government claim statute applies to contract actions.in its prayer grossmont asks for specific performance by the state,that the state pay the amounts to grossmont that are required by the agreement between the state and the federal government thereby permitting grossmont to provide for funded services to both its special and regular education students.
in its third theory,grossmont alleges an equal protection violation,claiming more money was spent on special education students,but there is no rational basis for reducing the educational services provided to regular students.the prayer seeks damages sufficient to permit grossmont to provide an appropriate education to each of its regular education students,
demurrer and appeal 
the department demurred to the first cause of action based on lack of exhaustion of remedies,and because the costs were a federal mandate,but demurred to the second and third purported causes of action on other grounds.
the trial court issued a tentative decision on august,which became the final ruling when neither party requested oral argument.in its final ruling the trial court concluded that grossmont failure to exhaust administrative remedies by submitting its claims to the commission defeated all of grossmont theories it also found grossmont was not a third party beneficiary of the agreement,lacked standing to assert the equal protection claim,and that the alleged funding inequality between special and regular students did not state a viable equal protection claim.
the judgment,filed nine months later on may,however recites only that grossmont failed to exhaust remedies.the record does not explain the reason for the delay in preparing the judgment,nor why it does not recite all of the reasons stated in the trial court final ruling.
grossmont timely filed its notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
in part,we conclude grossmont central claim must first be submitted to the commission,and that if we accepted grossmont claim that it would be futile to do so,grossmont complaint would still not state a valid claim.in part we reject grossmont claim that the trial court deprived it of due process.in part we explain why portions of the complaint that might not be barred by the failure to exhaust remedies fail to state a cause of action for other reasons.
grossmont can not sue for reimbursement 
failure to exhaust remedies 
the complaint does not allege that grossmont filed a claim with the commission,and impliedly asserts that grossmont did not do so.county of lassen,supra,th at,d.in its opposition to the demurrer grossmont conceded it had not done so.on appeal grossmont argues that its claim is outside the ambit of the commission because it is not seeking costs that stem from either a new program or a higher level mandated by the state,but rather from longstanding federal mandates.
where grossmont goes wrong,in part,is in the word new.grossmont claims special education was enacted in california in,and amended several times,but the current mandate is from.but grossmont alleges that after the funding reduction,a superior court judgment held these services were an unfunded mandate and relieved the county and other counties of the need to comply therewith,leading to the departmental directive requiring grossmont to pay those costs.
we read the complaint to mean that the department communication to grossmont amounted to a mandate.see long beach unified sch.dist.state of california d.term mandates read broadly to mean orders or commands,concepts broad enough to include executive orders as well as statutes.
by statute,county mental health departments must assess the needs of and provide mental health services to disabled students,subd.a.as pleaded in grossmont complaint,and as recited in a published case,the major funding for such services was by the state,to the amount of millions of dollars per year,but in the fiscal year,that funding was reduced to statewide.special educ.local plan area county of tuolumne th,d.
although not necessary to the decision,describes the judgment mentioned in grossmont complaint as a sacramento county superior court case that held san diego,sacramento,orange and contra costa counties need not provide the ab or ab services absent adequate,good faith funding from the state.respondents have advised this court that the sacramento county judgment has become final by virtue of the failure of any party to file a notice of appeal in a timely manner,supra,th at,fn,d.the parties do not contest this description and it conforms to grossmont complaint.
grossmont complaint states,the superior court found that the mandated services were unfunded,within the meaning of the constitution,and entered an order permitting san diego county to cease providing those mental health services.the only legal basis to justify such an order would be by finding the existence of an unfunded state mandate,subd.c.thus,by finding that san diego and the other counties did not have to pay for mental health services,the sacramento county superior court necessarily found those services were an unfunded state mandate.
those are the very services that grossmont complaint pleads amount to a federal mandate,and for that reason not within the commission authority.but as we have stated,in reviewing a demurrer,we need not accept as true legal conclusions stated in a complaint.here,the facts in the complaint,namely,the fact that the superior court relieved san diego of the need to provide mental health services,compels the legal conclusion that those services were found by the superior court to be a unfunded state mandate,not a federal mandate.
we do not say that we agree with such legal conclusion,because that issue is not properly before this court at this time we say that the complaint itself,properly understood,undermines grossmont claim that submission of the controversy to the commission is futile because it is certain that the commission will find the mandates to be federal mandates.
in hayes we explained that the federal special education laws left many details open,and to the extent the state chose to allocate a cost to a local school,such cost might be a reimbursable state mandate.hayes,supra,th at,d.we declined to assess the nature of such mandates in the first instance the commission is the entity with the responsibility for considering the issues in the first instance and which has the expertise to do so.id.at,d.we follow the same course in this case.submitting a claim to the commission is the exclusive method for resolving whether a cost is or is not a reimbursable state mandate.lucia mar,supra,cal d at,lake madrone water dist.state water resources control bd.d.until appellants have exhausted their administrative remedy before the commission,appellants can not know whether the statute imposes a cost,as they contend.central delta,supra,th at,d.
we are also aware that the duties of counties and school districts may differ with respect to federal law.a federal law provides in part that if a public agency other than an educational agency fails to provide or pay for the special education and related services the local educational agency shall provide or pay for such services.a b ii.but the trial court found that some of the burden shifted from the counties to local school districts could qualify as a higher level of service.it is for the commission to sort these matters out there is no precise formula or rule for determining whether the costs are the product of a federal mandate.county of los angeles commission on state mandates th,d the existence of a federal,as contrasted with a state,mandate is not easily ascertainable.
we take further guidance from county of contra costa,supra,d.there,as here,public entity claimants had filed an action in sacramento county superior court,seeking a declaration that a number of laws were unenforceable because they created unfunded mandates.id.at.in order to avoid the bar of failure to exhaust administrative remedies,the claimants argued they did not need to submit the dispute to the board of control,or its successor,the commission,because they were challenging the constitutionality of the laws.id.at.we rejected that claim t he fact that a constitutional provision is self executing does not relieve a party from complying with reasonable procedures for assertion of the right.id.at.the commission has the power to determine whether a statute or regulation mandates a new program,or higher level of service of an existing program and whether there are any costs mandated by the legislation.a proceeding before the commission will promote judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence and providing a record which the court may review.citation.it is still the rule that a party must exhaust administrative remedies even though,if unsuccessful,he intends to raise constitutional issues in a judicial proceeding.id.at,fn.
we also rejected the claim that submission of the matter to the commission would be futile,emphasizing that the futility exception applies only when it can be shown that an agency decision is certain to be adverse.county of contra costa,supra,d at.see white state of california d.here,we can not know that the commission will find that the costs complained of are unreimbursable mandates.county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d,commission had rejected identical claim.
accordingly,grossmont failure to exhaust an available administrative remedy bars this civil complaint.
we note that found the agency in that case had not complied with a separate exhaustion requirement,supra,th at,d.briefly,the federal law provides that where another public agency fails in its duty to provide special education and related services,although the local educational agency must perform that duty,it may seek relief against the other agency.a b ii.explains the california procedures to seek this relief,leading to action by the superintendent of public instruction,supra,at,d.we express no views about this procedure in this case,because grossmont has not named the county as a defendant.
suing the state in general 
putting aside the discussion in part,ante,grossmont assumes that if it can avoid going to the commission,it can sue,claiming the department does not say what should happen,where the school district like grossmont here is not claiming section reimbursement.so the lawsuit should be permitted to continue,we disagree.in such case,grossmont has pleaded itself out of court.
the allegation that the legislature is not providing enough funding for special education is not a basis for a lawsuit.how much money to collect and how to spend it are matters entrusted to the legislature,not the judiciary.schabarum california legislature th,d the enactment of a budget bill is a legislative function it is both a right and a duty that is expressly placed upon the legislature and the governor by our state constitution.
unlike the federal constitution,which is a grant of power to congress,the california constitution is a limitation or restriction on the powers of the legislature.citations.two important consequences flow from this fact.first,the entire authority of the state,except the people right of initiative and referendum,is vested in the legislature,and that body may exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the constitution.citations.in other words,we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the legislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited.citation.
secondly,all intendments favor the exercise of the legislature plenary authority if there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.such restrictions and limitations imposed by the constitution are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d,restated in state personnel bd.department of personnel admin.cal th,d.
as phrased in an unfunded mandate case,when considering the legislature considerable powers regarding budget and tax matters,the legislature,not this court,decides which of the innumerable public mouths tax revenues will feed.barring a statutory or constitutional violation,it is not for this court to stop the legislature if it transfers revenue from peter to compensate paul sonoma,supra,th at,d see san jose,supra,th at,d there is no basis for applying section as an equitable remedy to cure the perceived unfairness resulting from political decisions on funding priorities.
thus,because the legislature is generally free to fund or not fund programs,grossmont must identify some duty stemming from the california constitution or federal law that limits the legislature broad authority to decide how to spend money.
in its complaint,grossmont made reference to the failure of the state to make an appropriation,as follows 
this transfer of responsibility without a corresponding increase in funding violated the constitution.article xiiib,states in part,in the event that the financial responsibility of providing services is transferred from one entity of government to another,then for the year in which such transfer becomes effective the appropriations limit of the transferee entity shall be increased grossmont did not receive any additional funds to pay for the transfer of the services previously provided by the county of san diego.
grossmont mixes apples and oranges,and misquotes the relevant constitutional provision,which in full reads 
in the event that the financial responsibility of providing services is transferred,in whole or in part,whether by annexation,incorporation or otherwise,from one entity of government to another,then for the year in which such transfer becomes effective the appropriations limit of the transferee entity shall be increased by such reasonable amount as the said entities shall mutually agree and the appropriations limit of the transferor entity shall be decreased by the same amount.cal,art.xiii b,subd.a.
this provision allows a public entity to increase its appropriations limit when costs are shifted from another entity and the other entity limit is lowered so that the taxpayer does not pay anything extra.see huntington park redevelopment agency martin cal d.this prevents a government entity from spending more on programs funded with taxes than it spent in the prior year,adjusted for inflation and population changes.el monte,supra,th at,d see county of placer corin d.the thrust of article xiii b is toward placing certain limitations on the growth of appropriations at both the state and local government level.we fail to see how this provision pertains to reimbursements by the state.further,nowhere in its briefs does grossmont discuss this provision,therefore whatever claim it meant to make is forfeited.see marvin lieblein,shewry th,fn,d marvin lieblein diamond springs lime american river constructors d.the only relevance we perceive is that if the commission finds the expenses are federally mandated,grossmont appropriations limit would be lifted,pro tanto.cal,art.xiii b,see city of sacramento state of california,supra,cal d at.
similarly,nowhere in its briefs does grossmont explain the requirements of propositions or,mentioned in the complaint,nor how those requirements have been violated,nor how grossmont has a civil claim for their purported violation.grossmont mentions these propositions in its statement of the case,but merely summarizes the unanalyzed conclusion stated in the complaint,quoted earlier,that these provisions have been violated.we are not required to interpret the possible application of these provisions absent briefing by grossmont.therefore this claim,too,is forfeited.marvin lieblein,supra,th at,fn,d.further,we have previously considered proposition and concluded it does not deprive the legislature of its plenary authority over education and does not grant school districts political autonomy or a proprietary interest in the minimum funding to be applied by the state for support of school districts and community colleges.california teachers hayes th,d cta.another court has observed that after proposition adoption and modification by proposition,the power to appropriate funds was left in the hands of the legislature we perceive no intent in proposition concern for an appropriate level of funding for education that would tie the hands of the legislature in meeting that goal,particularly in years of low revenues.sonoma,supra,th at,d.given these holdings,and grossmont failure to discuss proposition in its briefs,we see no reason to address propositions and further.
the only state constitutional mechanism for forcing reimbursements discussed in the briefs is via the commission.if we agreed grossmont had no valid claim there,as grossmont maintains,then it pleaded itself out of court,because grossmont does not identify any other constitutional provision or federal law compelling the reimbursements or declaratory relief it seeks,and under the california constitution,the judiciary has no general authority to compel appropriations or legislative spending decisions.
due
