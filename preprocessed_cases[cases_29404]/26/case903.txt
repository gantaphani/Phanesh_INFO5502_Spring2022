the full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc.a judge requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.the matter failed to receive a majority of votes of the nonrecused active judges in favor of en banc consideration.fed.
the petition for panel rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc are denied.no further petitions for en banc or panel rehearing shall be permitted.
judge o scannlain dissent from denial of rehearing en banc is filed concurrently with this order.
the motion for en banc consideration of the motion of the alliance defending freedom for leave to file an amicus brief is moot.
the freedom of speech guaranteed by our constitution is in greatest peril when the government may suppress speech simply because it is unpopular.for that reason,it is a foundational tenet of first amendment law that the government can not silence a speaker because of how an audience might react to the speech.it is this bedrock principle known as the heckler veto doctrine that the panel overlooks,condoning the suppression of free speech by some students because other students might have reacted violently.
in doing so,the panel creates a split with the seventh and eleventh circuits and permits the will of the mob to rule our schools.for these reasons,i must respectfully dissent from our refusal to hear this case en banc.
on may,cinco de mayo,a group of caucasian students at live oak high school live oak wore shirts depicting the american flag to school dariano morgan hill unified sch,amended slip op.at cir.in the six preceding years,there had been at least thirty fights on campus,some between gangs and others between caucasians and hispanics,id.at,although the district court made no findings as to whether these fights were related to ethnic tensions,dariano morgan hill unified sch,d.a year earlier,during cinco de mayo,a group of caucasian students and a group of mexican students exchanged profanities and threats.dariano,amended slip op.at.when the caucasian students hung a makeshift american flag and began chanting u s a,assistant principal miguel rodriguez intervened and asked the mexican students to stop using profane language,to which one mexican student responded,but rodriguez,they are racist.they are being racist.f them white boys.let f them up.id.

rodriguez met with the students wearing the shirts,who did not dispute that they were at risk of violence due to their apparel.id.the school officials allowed two students to return to class with their american flag shirts on because their shirts had less prominent imagery and were less likely to cause an incident.id.at.two other students were given the choice to turn their shirts inside out or to go home.id.they chose to go home.id.all plaintiffs in this appeal received threatening messages in the days after the incident.id.

in tinker des moines independent community school district,a group of high school students was suspended for wearing black armbands as a way of protesting the vietnam war.u.in what has become a classic statement of first amendment law,the supreme court declared,it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.id.at.of course,as the court has subsequently made clear,the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.bethel sch.dist.fraser.nonetheless,tinker established that,where students in the exercise of first amendment rights collide with the rules of the school authorities,tinker,at,students free speech rights may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.morse frederick,quoting tinker,at.
invoking tinker,the panel holds that the school acted properly to prevent a substantial and material disruption of school activities.dariano,amended slip op.at.in the panel view,school officials acted reasonably given the history of ethnic violence at the school,the cinco de mayo incident,and the indications of possible violence on the day in question.id.at.because the officials tailored their actions to address the threat,the panel held that there was no violation of the students free speech rights.id.at.the panel also granted summary judgment with regard to the students equal protection and due process claims.id.at.
with respect,i suggest that the panel opinion misinterprets tinker own language,our precedent,and the law of our sister circuits.the panel claims that the source of the threatened violence at live oak is irrelevant apparently requiring school officials to stop the source of a threat is too burdensome when a more solution is at hand,id.at,namely,silencing the target of the threat.thus the panel finds it of no consequence that the students exercising their free speech rights did so peacefully,that their expression took the passive form of wearing shirts,or that there is no allegation that they threatened other students with violence the panel condones the suppression of the students speech for one reason other students might have reacted violently against them.such a rationale contravenes fundamental first amendment principles.
the panel claims to be guided by the language of tinker,dariano,amended slip op.at,but in fact the panel ignores such language.indeed tinker counseled directly against the outcome here relying on the earlier heckler veto case of terminiello chicago,the court explained that students speech,whether made in class,in the lunchroom,or on the campus,can not be silenced merely because those who disagree with it may start an argument or cause a disturbance.at citing terminiello.tinker made clear that the constitution says we must take th e risk that speech may engender a violent response.id.yet,rather than heed tinker guidance,the panel undermines its holding,and,in the process,erodes the hazardous freedom and openness that is the basis of our national strength and of the independence and vigor of americans who grow up and live in this relatively permissive,often disputatious,society.tinker,at.
what the panel fails to recognize,and what we have previously held,is that tinker went out of its way to reaffirm the heckler veto doctrine the principle that the government can not silence messages simply because they cause discomfort,fear,or even anger.ctr.for bio ethical reform,los angeles,cir citing tinker,at.quoting tinker,we have explained 
i n our system,undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.any departure from absolute regimentation may cause trouble.any variation from the majority opinion may inspire fear.any word spoken,in class,in the lunchroom,or on the campus,that deviates from the views of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance.but our constitution says we must take this risk 
bio ethical reform,at quoting tinker,u.at our precedents take the position,then,that far from abandoning the heckler veto doctrine in public schools,tinker stands as a dramatic reaffirmation of it given the central importance of the doctrine to first amendment jurisprudence,that should come as no surprise 
the heckler veto doctrine is one of the oldest and most venerable in first amendment jurisprudence.see terminiello city of chicago.indeed,the court has gone far to protect speech where it might incur a hostile and even violent reaction from an audience.in street new york,for example,a man was convicted for publicly defy ing or cast ing contempt upon any american flag by words.the court invalidated the conviction,rejecting the state justification that the man speech had a tendency to provoke violent retaliation.id.at.the heckler veto doctrine also protected a civil rights leader peaceful speech during a lunch counter protest,despite the state alleged fear that violence was about to erupt because of the demonstration.cox louisiana.as the court said in cox,t he compelling answer is that constitutional rights may not be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
of course,this doctrine does not apply to all categories of speech.the court has recognized that there are certain and narrowly limited classes of speech,the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.chaplinsky new hampshire,see also united states alvarez,listing types of speech that are not part of the freedom of speech.where,for instance,speech constitutes fighting which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,chaplinsky,at is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action,brandenburg ohio,or is a true threat,virginia black,such speech may be prohibited,subject to certain limitations,see city of paul.but apart from these categories,the government may not give weight to the audience negative reaction as a basis for suppressing speech.ctr.for bio ethical reform,at see also texas johnson,a principal function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute.internal quotation marks omitted quoting terminiello citing tinker.
despite tinker emphasis on the actions of the speaker and its reaffirmation of the heckler veto doctrine,the panel ignores these foundational precepts of first amendment jurisprudence and condones using the heckler veto as a basis for suppressing student speech.
the established first amendment principles that the panel disregards exist for good reason.rather than acting to protect the students who were peacefully expressing their views,live oak decided to suppress the speech of those students because other students might do them harm.live oak reaction to the possible violence against the student speakers,and the panel blessing of that reaction,sends a clear message to public school students by threatening violence against those with whom you disagree,you can enlist the power of the state to silence them.this perverse incentive created by the panel opinion is precisely what the heckler veto doctrine seeks to avoid.
in this case,the disfavored speech was the display of an american flag.but let no one be fooled by interpreting tinker to permit the heckler veto,the panel opens the door to the suppression of any viewpoint opposed by a vocal and violent band of students.the next case might be a student wearing a shirt bearing the image of che guevara,or martin luther king,or pope francis.it might be a student wearing a president obama hope shirt,or a shirt exclaiming stand with rand it might be a shirt proclaiming the shahada,or a shirt announcing christ is risen it might be any viewpoint imaginable,but whatever it is,it will be vulnerable to the rule of the mob.the demands of bullies will become school policy.
that is not the law.
the seventh and eleventh circuits agree that a student speech can not be suppressed based on the violent reaction of its audience.thus the panel is simply wrong that our sister circuits cases do not distinguish between substantial disruption caused by the speaker and substantial disruption caused by the reaction of onlookers.dariano,amended slip op.at.in zamecnik indian prairie school district,a student wore a to school on the day of silence bearing the slogan,be happy,not gay,cir.the school sought to prohibit the student from wearing the shirt based,in part,on incidents of harassment of plaintiff zamecnik.id.at.the seventh circuit squarely rejected that rationale as barred by the doctrine of the heckler veto.id.zamecnik made clear that tinker endorse s the doctrine of the heckler veto and described the rationale behind that doctrine 
statements that while not fighting words are met by violence or threats or other unprivileged retaliatory conduct by persons offended by them can not lawfully be suppressed because of that conduct.otherwise free speech could be stifled by the speaker opponents mounting a riot,even though,because the speech had contained no fighting words,no reasonable person would have been moved to a riotous response.so the fact that homosexual students and their sympathizers harassed zamecnik because of their disapproval of her message is not a permissible ground for banning it.
id.the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to zamecnik.id.at.
the eleventh circuit is of the same opinion.in holloman ex rel.holloman harland,a school punished a student for silently holding up a fist rather than reciting the pledge of allegiance,cir.school officials justified their actions,in part,by citing concern that the student behavior would lead to further disruptions by other students.id.at.the eleventh circuit acknowledged that tinker governed its analysis,and in an impassioned paragraph,the court invoked the heckler veto doctrine 
allowing a school to curtail a student freedom of expression based on such factors turns reason on its head.if certain bullies are likely to act violently when a student wears long hair,it is unquestionably easy for a principal to preclude the outburst by preventing the student from wearing long hair.to do so,however,is to sacrifice freedom upon the alter sic of order,and allow the scope of our liberty to be dictated by the inclinations of the unlawful mob.
id.at.particularly relevant here,the eleventh circuit squarely rejected the claim that the heckler veto doctrine does not apply in public schools 
while the same constitutional standards do not always apply in public schools as on public streets,we can not afford students less constitutional protection simply because their peers might illegally express disagreement through violence instead of reason.if the people,acting through a legislative assembly,may not proscribe certain speech,neither may they do so acting individually as criminals.principals have the duty to maintain order in public schools,but they may not do so while turning a blind eye to basic notions of right and wrong.
id.at.the court reversed the district court grant of summary judgment to the school and reinstated holloman claims.id.at.
the panel holding,then,represents a dramatic departure from the views of our sister circuits yet,one would never know it from reading the panel opinion,since the contrary decisions of those circuits are barely mentioned and completely.
finally,the panel attempts to analogize this case to those involving school restrictions on confederate flags.see dariano,amended slip op.at.but these cases,dealing solely with a symbol that is widely regarded as racist and incendiary,zamecnik,at,can not override tinker here 
the panel takes the confederate flag cases to be a single illustrat ion of the much broader principle that the heckler veto doctrine does not apply to schools.dariano,amended slip op.at.but as that broad principle is incorrect,the confederate flag cases can not illustrate it.indeed,what the cases actually illustrate is a permissive attitude towards regulation of the confederate flag that is based on the flag unique and racially divisive history whether or not this history provides a principled basis for the regulation of confederate icons,it certainly provides no support for banning displays of the american flag.
the panel opinion contravenes foundational first amendment principles,creates a split with the seventh and eleventh circuits,and imperils minority viewpoints of all kinds.like our sister circuits,i would hold that the reaction of other students to the student speaker is not a legitimate basis for suppressing student speech absent a showing that the speech in question constitutes fighting words,a true threat,incitement to imminent lawless action,or other speech outside the first amendment protection.see zamecnik,at rejecting the heckler veto because the speech had contained no fighting words holloman,at citing street for the proposition that the possible tendency of appellant words to provoke violent retaliation is not a basis for banning those words unless they are fighting words internal quotation marks omitted.
i respectfully dissent from our regrettable decision not to rehear this case en banc.
we are asked again to consider the delicate relationship between students first amendment rights and the operational and safety needs of schools.as we noted in wynar douglas county school district,cir,school administrators face the daunting task of evaluating potential threats of violence and keeping their students safe without impinging on their constitutional rights.in this case,after school officials learned of threats of violence during a celebration of cinco de mayo,the school asked a group of students to remove clothing bearing images of the american flag 
the students brought a civil rights suit against the school district and two school officials,alleging violations of their federal and state constitutional rights to freedom of expression,equal protection,and due process.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to the only defendant party to this appeal,assistant principal miguel rodriguez,and its denial of the students motion for summary judgment,on all claims.school officials anticipated violence or substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities,and their response was tailored to the circumstances.as a consequence,we conclude that school officials did not violate the students rights to freedom of expression,due process,or equal protection.
background 
this case arose out of the events of may,cinco de mayo,at live oak high school live oak or the school,part of the morgan hill unified school district in northern california.the cinco de mayo celebration was presented in the spirit of cultural appreciation.it was described as honoring the pride and community strength of the mexican people who settled this valley and who continue to work here.the school likened it to patrick day or oktoberfest.the material facts are not in dispute.
live oak had a history of violence among students,some and some drawn along racial lines.in the six years that nick boden served as principal,he observed at least thirty fights on campus,both between gangs and between caucasian and hispanic students.a police officer is stationed on campus every day to ensure safety on school grounds.
on cinco de mayo in,a year before the events relevant to this appeal,there was an altercation on campus between a group of predominantly caucasian students and a group of mexican students the groups exchanged profanities and threats.some students hung a makeshift american flag on one of the trees on campus,and as they did,the group of caucasian students began clapping and chanting usa.a group of mexican students had been walking around with the mexican flag,and in response to the white students,one mexican student shouted f them white boys,f them white boys.when assistant principal miguel rodriguez told the student to stop using profane language,the student said,but rodriguez,they are racist.they are being racist.f them white boys.let f them up.rodriguez removed the student from the area.
at least one party to this appeal,student,wore american flag clothing to school on cinco de mayo.was approached by a male student who,in the words of the district court,shoved a mexican flag at him and said something in spanish expressing anger at clothing.
a year later,on cinco de mayo,a group of caucasian students,including the students bringing this appeal,wore american flag shirts to school.a female student approached that morning,motioned to his shirt,and asked,why are you wearing that do you not like mexicans and were also confronted about their clothing before brunch break.
as rodriguez was leaving his office before brunch break,a caucasian student approached him,and said,you may want to go out to the quad area.there might be might be some issues.during the break,another student called rodriguez over to a group of mexican students,said that she was concerned about a group of students wearing the american flag,and said that there might be problems.rodriguez understood her to mean that there might be a physical altercation.a group of mexican students asked rodriguez why the caucasian students get to wear their flag out when we sic do get to wear our sic flag 
boden directed rodriguez to have the students either turn their shirts inside out or take them off.the students refused to do so.
rodriguez met with the students and explained that he was concerned for their safety.the students did not dispute that their attire put them at risk of violence.plaintiff said that he was willing to take on that responsibility in order to continue wearing his shirt.two of the students,and,said they would have worn the flag clothing even if they had known violence would be directed toward them.
school officials permitted and another student not a party to this action to return to class,because boden considered their shirts,whose imagery was less prominent,to be less likely to get them singled out,targeted for any possible recrimination,and significant ly differen t in terms of what he saw as being potential for targeting.
the officials offered the remaining students the choice either to turn their shirts inside out or to go home for the day with excused absences that would not count against their attendance records.students and chose to go home.neither was disciplined.
in the aftermath of the students departure from school,they received numerous threats from other students.was threatened by text message on may,and the same afternoon,received a threatening phone call from a caller saying he was outside of home.and were likewise threatened with violence,and a student at live oak overheard a group of classmates saying that some gang members would come down from san jose to take care of the students.because of these threats,the students did not go to school on may.
the students and their parents,acting as guardians,brought suit under and the california constitution against morgan hill unified school district the district and boden and rodriguez,in their official and individual capacities,alleging violations of their federal and california constitutional rights to freedom of expression and their federal constitutional rights to equal protection and due process.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted rodriguez motion on all claims and denied the students motion on all claims,holding that school officials did not violate the students federal or state constitutional rights.the district court did not address claims against boden,because he was granted an automatic stay in bankruptcy.the district court dismissed all claims against the district on grounds of sovereign immunity,a ruling not challenged on appeal.the question on appeal is thus whether rodriguez,in his official or individual capacity,violated the students constitutional rights.
first amendment claims 
we analyze the students under the framework of tinker des moines independent community school district,under tinker,students may express their opinions,even on controversial subjects if they do so without materially and substantially interfer ing with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school and without colliding with the rights of others.id.at final alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion,school officials must be able to show that their action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.id.at.
that said,conduct by the student,in class or out of it,which for any reason whether it stems from time,place,or type of behavior materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is,of course,not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.id.at.under tinker,schools may prohibit speech that might reasonably lead school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities,or that constitutes an actual or nascent interference with the schools work or collision with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.id.at,see also wynar,at quoting tinker,at.as we have explained,the first amendment does not require school officials to wait until disruption actually occurs before they may act.in fact,they have a duty to prevent the occurrence of disturbances.karp becken,cir footnote omitted.indeed,in the school context,the level of disturbance required to justify official intervention is relatively lower in a public school than it might be on a street corner.id.as the seventh circuit explained,s chool authorities are entitled to exercise discretion in determining when student speech crosses the line between hurt feelings and substantial disruption of the educational mission.zamecnik indian prairie sch.dist,cir.
although tinker guides our analysis,the facts of this case distinguish it sharply from tinker,in which students pure speech was held to be constitutionally protected.at.in contrast to tinker,in which there was no evidence whatever of petitioners interference,actual or nascent,with the schools work or of collision with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone,there was evidence of nascent and escalating violence at live oak.on the morning of may,each of the three students was confronted about their clothing by other students,one of whom approached student and asked,why are you wearing that do you not like mexicans before the brunch break,rodriguez learned of the threat of a physical altercation.during the break,rodriguez was warned about impending violence by a second student.the warnings of violence came,as the district court noted,in the context of ongoing racial tension and gang violence within the school,and after a altercation had erupted during the prior cinco de mayo over the display of an american flag.threats issued in the aftermath of the incident were so real that the parents of the students involved in this suit kept them home from school two days later.
the minimal restrictions on the students were not conceived of as an urgent wish to avoid the controversy,as in tinker,id.at,or as a excuse to tamp down student expression.the controversy and tension remained,but the school actions presciently avoided an altercation.unlike in tinker,where e ven an official memorandum prepared after the students suspension that listed the reasons for the ban on wearing the armbands made no reference to the anticipation of such disruption,id.at,school officials here explicitly referenced anticipated disruption,violence,and concerns about student safety in conversations with students at the time of the events,in conversations the same day with the students and their parents,and in a memorandum and press release circulated the next day.
in keeping with our precedent,school officials actions were tailored to avert violence and focused on student safety,in at least two ways.for one,officials restricted the wearing of certain clothing,but did not punish the students.school officials have greater constitutional latitude to suppress student speech than to punish it.in karp,we held that school officials could curtail the exercise of first amendment rights when they c ould reasonably forecast material interference or substantial disruption,but could not discipline the student without show ing justification for their action.at wynar,at upholding expulsion,despite its more punitive character,as a justified response to threats la vine blaine sch,cir.
for another,officials did not enforce a blanket ban on american flag apparel,but instead allowed two students to return to class when it became clear that their shirts were unlikely to make them targets of violence.the school distinguished among the students based on the perceived threat level,and did not embargo all clothing.see background,supra.
finally,whereas the conduct in tinker expressly did not concern aggressive,disruptive action or even group demonstrations,at,school officials at live oak reasonably could have understood the students actions as falling into any of those three categories,particularly in the context of the altercation.the events of took place in the shadow of similar disruptions a year earlier,and pitted racial or ethnic groups against each other.moreover,students warned officials that there might be physical fighting at the break 
we recognize that,in certain contexts,limiting speech because of reactions to the speech may give rise to concerns about a heckler veto.but the language of tinker and the school setting guides us here.where speech for any reason materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others,school officials may limit the speech.tinker,at.to require school officials to precisely identify the source of a violent threat before taking steps to quell the threat would burden officials ability to protect the students in their particularly salient concern in an era of rampant school violence,much of it involving guns,other weapons,or threats on the internet and run counter to the longstanding directive that there is a distinction between threats or acts of violence on school premises and speech that engenders no substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.id.at,see also id.at.
in the school context,the crucial distinction is the nature of the speech,not the source of it.the cases do not distinguish between substantial disruption caused by the speaker and substantial disruption caused by the reactions of onlookers or a combination of circumstances.see,taylor roswell indep.sch,cir observing that plaintiffs note that most disruptions occurred only because of wrongful behavior of third parties and that no plaintiffs participated in these activities this argument might be effective outside the school context,but it ignores the special characteristics of the school environment,and that the court ha d not found case law holding that school officials ability to limit disruptive expression depends on the blameworthiness of the speaker.to the contrary,the tinker rule is guided by a school need to protect its learning environment and its students,and courts generally inquire only whether the potential for substantial disruption is genuine.quoting tinker,at zamecnik,at looking to the reactions of onlookers to determine whether the speech could be regulated holloman ex rel.holloman harland,cir looking to the reactions of onlookers to determine whether a student expression cause d or was likely to cause a material and substantial disruption alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
perhaps no cases illustrate this principle more clearly than those involving displays of the confederate flag in the school context.we respect the american flag,and know that its meaning and its history differ greatly from that of the confederate flag.nevertheless,the legal principle that emerges from the confederate flag cases is that what matters is substantial disruption or a reasonable forecast of substantial disruption,taking into account either the behavior of a speaker,causing substantial disruption alongside the silent or passive wearing of an emblem or the reactions of onlookers.not s
