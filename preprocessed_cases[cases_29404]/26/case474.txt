daniel perez perez filed suit against region education service center region for alleged violations of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,the americans with disabilities act ada,and the texas whistleblower act.gov t code ann.vernon supp.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of region and perez appeals.we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
on october,perez began working for region as a data processing specialist.region is one of several education service centers centers charged with administering statewide educational programs and supporting local school districts.in,perez was promoted to the position of senior analyst specialist ii in the regional service center computer cooperative rsccc systems group.
perez wished to become a database administrator for the rsccc group.unlike other computer groups at region,the rsccc group did not have a database administrator position.perez began taking on some database administration duties.these duties were not part of perez job description,but employees at region often took on duties outside of their job descriptions.perez submitted a request to region asking to be promoted to,or reclassified as,a database administrator because it was a position than senior analyst specialist ii.perez request was not granted because there was no database administrator position available in the rsccc group,but perez was told that if the position was ever approved and funded for his group,he would get the position.
in june,perez filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,claiming that region discriminated against him on the basis of national origin in failing to promote or reclassify him.
in late,perez began experiencing stress and depression by january,though,perez received a clean bill of health.in june,perez was treated for stomach problems and stress.perez then told region that he was having medical problems and submitted certification of anxiety,depressive disorder,dysthemia,and stress.perez therapist noted that his condition was not chronic or incapacitating but nonetheless recommended that perez work schedule be limited to hours per week.region limited perez work schedule until april,when perez doctor released him to work overtime under certain conditions.
though perez had previously received positive performance reviews,perez annual performance review in august contained several negative comments.in march,perez received a memo from a supervisor stating that his performance was substandard and warning of possible consequences.in june,perez received two further memos documenting problems with his work performance and hours.perez was discharged on july.
perez responded to his discharge by filing several complaints against region.region does not have a formal procedure for an employee to appeal his termination,but it allowed perez to file a grievance.the grievance committee ruled against perez.perez also filed a grievance with the commissioner of education that grievance was ultimately dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction.in july,perez filed a second eeoc complaint,alleging that region discharged him due to his hispanic national origin region discriminated against him because of his mental illness disability in violation of the ada and region discharged him in retaliation for filing a previous eeoc complaint.the eeoc denied perez charges of discrimination and retaliation and informed perez of his right to sue region.
perez filed suit in texas state court,alleging that region violated title vii,the ada,and texas state law.specifically,perez alleged region discriminated against him on account of his hispanic national origin,in violation of title vii,when it failed to grant his request to reclassify his position or promote him region discharged him in retaliation for filing his charge of discrimination with the eeoc in violation of title vii region discharged him because of his hispanic national origin in violation of title vii region discriminated against him due to his mental illness disability in violation of the ada and region discharged him in retaliation for reporting the sexual harassment of another region employee in violation of the texas whistleblower act.region removed the lawsuit to federal district court.
the district court granted summary judgment for region on all claims.perez appealed.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.daniels city of arlington,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine issue of material fact for trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in determining if there is a genuine issue of material fact,the court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.daniels,at.
a genuine issue of material fact exists when there is evidence sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.when the party bears the burden of proof on a claim,the moving party may obtain summary judgment without providing evidence that negates the party claim.see celotex catrett,d.rather,the moving party need only highlight the absence of evidence in support of the party claim.see id.
iii.discussion 
perez raises five issues on appeal.he argues that region failed to promote or reclassify him on the basis of his hispanic national origin in violation of title vii region discharged him in retaliation for making an eeoc complaint in violation of title vii region discharged him on account of his hispanic national origin in violation of title vii region discriminated against him due to his mental illness disability in violation of the ada and region discharged him in retaliation for reporting sexual harassment in violation of the texas whistleblower act.we consider each claim in turn.
title vii failure to promote claim 
perez first contends that region failure to promote him to the position of database administrator violates title vii prohibition of discrimination in employment on the basis of national origin.see a.to make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on failure to promote,perez must show that he belongs to a protected class he was qualified for the job he sought despite his qualifications,perez was rejected and after his rejection,the position remained open and region continued to seek applicants from persons of perez qualifications.mcdonnell douglas green,d bennett total minatome,cir.if perez establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to region to articulate a legitimate,reason for perez rejection.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d mcdonnell douglas,at.if region articulates a reason,perez must then show that region did intentionally discriminate,which he may do by demonstrating that region proffered reason is simply a pretext for discrimination.see reeves,at.
the district court found that perez had made out his prima facie case,but that region had articulated a legitimate,reason for its failure to promote perez.we bypass the serious question whether perez even met his prima facie burden and address region articulated reasons for its failure to promote or reclassify perez.
region argues,and presented summary judgment evidence to the effect that,it did not promote perez or reclassify his position because the position of database administrator within the rsccc group was never approved for funding and,therefore,the position did not exist.the district court found this to be a legitimate,reason for the failure to promote perez and found that perez had failed to present sufficient evidence to suggest that region stated reason was false.perez notes only that another software group at region did contain a database administrator position and that other employees two anglo males,one hispanic woman,one male,and one woman were reclassified.neither fact,nor the argument that underlies them,addresses the inescapable fact that,as perez admits in his brief,a t the time he began requesting the,his funded software area rsccc group did not have the position of database administrator.the nonexistence of an available position is a legitimate reason not to promote.see int l of teamsters united states,d finding that the absence of a vacancy in the job sought is a legitimate reason for not hiring a person for a position.as perez produced no evidence to disprove this legitimate justification for region failure to promote or reclassify him,the district court correctly granted summary judgment on perez title vii failure to promote claim.
title vii discharge claims 
perez next makes two title vii claims related to his discharge.first,he argues that he was discharged in retaliation for filing his complaint of discrimination with the eeoc.second,he contends that he was discharged on account of his hispanic national origin.
title vii prohibits retaliation against employees who engage in protected conduct,such as filing a complaint of discrimination.see a.to make out a prima facie case of retaliation,perez must show he engaged in a protected activity he suffered an adverse employment action and a causal nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.gee principi,cir.once this prima facie burden is met,retaliation claims utilize the same approach as do failure to promote claims.id.
both parties agree that perez satisfied the first two elements of a prima facie case by providing evidence that perez filed a complaint with the eeoc a protected activity and that he was terminated on july,an adverse employment action.region disputes that perez provided sufficient evidence of the third element,causation.the district court found that perez provided sufficient evidence of a causal connection.it recognized that timing can constitute evidence of a causal connection between a protected activity and termination and looked to see whether region had articulated a legitimate,reason for the termination.the court then found that the reason proffered by region,poor work performance,was adequate to shift the burden back to perez to disprove the proffered reason.
we again assume that perez made out his prima facie case.perez claim nonetheless fails because he has not provided evidence to refute region proffered explanation for his discharge.perez points to the failure by region to meet with him to set performance goals as evidence of pretext.such a failure may be a management lapse,but it does not amount to evidence of retaliation.see mayberry vought aircraft,cir the question is not whether an employer made an erroneous decision it is whether the decision was made with discriminatory motive.perez also suggests that the fact that he received a low performance review within months of his complaint shows pretext.the negative august performance review,however,is substantiated by other evidence in the summary judgment record perez provides no evidence that challenges the accuracy of his performance review.merely disagreeing with an employer negative performance assessment is insufficient to show pretext.see shackelford deloitte touche,llp,cir.perez has thus failed to produce sufficient evidence of pretext.the district court properly granted summary judgment on perez retaliation claim.
perez also claims that region discharged him due to his hispanic national origin.again,even assuming that perez could make out a prima facie case of discrimination,he simply provided insufficient evidence that his termination was due to anything other than his poor work performance.poor work performance is a legitimate,reason for discharge.see,shackelford,at.the district court properly granted summary judgment for region on this claim.
americans with disabilities act claim 
perez next contends that he was discriminated against in violation of the ada.before addressing the merits of this claim,we must address the jurisdictional issue of whether perez ada claim is barred by sovereign immunity we review eleventh amendment immunity determinations de novo.see cozzo tangipahoa parish council,cir.
the eleventh amendment bars an individual from suing a state in federal court unless the state consents to suit or congress has clearly and validly abrogated the state sovereign immunity.see const.amend.xi see also,coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d finding an individual may sue a state if the state consents to suit or congress validly abrogates sovereign immunity.the state need not be the named party in a federal lawsuit,for a state eleventh amendment immunity extends to any state agency or entity deemed an alter ego or arm of the state.see vogt bd.of comm rs,cir.
region and the amicus curie state of texas argue that region is an arm of the state that has not consented to suit and perez claim under title i of the ada is thus barred as the supreme court recently held in board of trustees garrett,congress did not abrogate the states sovereign immunity in enacting title i of the ada.see,d.thus,the eleventh amendment bars perez ada claim if region is considered an arm of the state.
the inquiry then becomes whether the lawsuit is one which,despite the presence of a state agency as the nominal defendant,is effectively against the sovereign state.earles state bd.of certified pub.accountants,cir.this circuit uses a test to guide this inquiry.cozzo,at clark tarrant county,cir.the six factors are whether state statutes and case law view the entity as an arm of the state the source of the entity funding the entity degree of local autonomy whether the entity is concerned primarily with local,as opposed to statewide,problems whether the entity has the authority to sue and be sued in its own name and whether the entity has the right to hold and use property.see clark,at.no one factor is dispositive,though we have deemed the source of an entity funding a particularly important factor because a principal goal of the eleventh amendment is to protect state treasuries.see hudson city of new orleans,cir.an entity need not show that all of the factors are satisfied the factors simply provide guidelines for courts to balance the equities and determine if the suit is really one against the state itself.see id.
the district court concluded that region is an arm of the state entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.the district court noted that the texas attorney general considers the centers state agencies,that the centers receive significant funding from the state,that the commissioner of education determines the number of centers and their boundaries,and that the commissioner directs the centers in implementing legislative initiatives assigned to the commissioner of education.
region and the amicus curie state of texas provide sufficient evidence that region is,in effect,an arm of the state.the education service centers are at the intermediate level of texas educational system,between the state education agency and the local school districts.san antonio indep.sch.dist.mckinney,at the state level,we have the texas education agency,headed by the commissioner of education and the state board of education.regionally,the legislature created regional education service centers.at the local level are independent school districts.citations omitted.the mission of the centers is to ensure that all texas children have access to a quality education because a general diffusion of knowledge is essential for the welfare of this state and for the preservation of the liberties and rights of citizens.ann.a vernon supp.the centers provide several core services,such as teacher training and assistance to underperforming school districts,to improve educational efficiency and performance.see id.the centers also administer statewide programs,such as technology initiatives,see id.a,and programs for students with disabilities,see id.
state statutes and case law 
first,we consider whether state statutes and case law view the centers as arms of the state.the texas education code code reveals that the centers are more closely aligned with state,rather than with local,government.chapter of the code establishes and defines the roles of the texas education agency tea,see.ann.vernon supp,commissioner of education commissioner,see id,and state board of education,see id.chapter then explains that the commissioner is responsible for establishing centers for statewide access to educational resources and programs.see id.the commissioner supervises the centers and has broad authority to decide any matter concerning the operation or administration of the regional education service centers.id.c.a key purpose of the centers is to implement initiatives assigned by the legislature or the commissioner of education.id.the code distinguishes the centers from local school districts,which are governed by chapter of the code and are not under the guidance of the commissioner and the tea.see,id.b explaining that school district trustees have the exclusive power and duty to govern public schools.the centers,then,are administrative subdivisions within the tea according to state statutes.
texas case law also suggests that the centers are arms of the state.in davis education service center,the texarkana court of appeals considered whether a center should be considered an arm of the state for purposes of state sovereign immunity.see,no pet.after a brief discussion,the court concluded when davis sued region viii and ferguson,in his official capacity,she sued the state of texas.id.at.while the analysis in davis is not controlling on the issue of eleventh amendment immunity,it reflects the state view that suing a center is equivalent to suing the state of texas itself.
state statutes and case law,then,indicate that the state of texas views the education service centers as arms of the state perez has not provided adequate summary judgment evidence to rebut these authorities 
source of funding 
second,we address the extent to which the centers receive funding from the state of texas.this inquiry considers both the state liability for a judgment rendered against the centers and the state liability for general debts and obligations.see hudson,at.while the code does not contain a specific provision requiring the state to indemnify the centers in the case of a judgment,the significant financial support the state affords to the centers suggests that a judgment against a center would be borne in large part by the state.
we examine the amount of funding the state provides to an entity and whether that funding is earmarked for any particular purposes to determine whether a judgment likely would be paid with state funds.see hudson,at.the state of texas provides several types of funding to the centers.initially,centers receive state funding to provide core services to school districts and campuses to improve student and school district performance and for basic operational expenses.see.ann,vernon supp.for,the state appropriated million per year to the centers for core services,technical assistance,and program support.for,the state allocated million per year to the centers.further,the centers may receive additional funding from the state,including funds for efficiency initiatives,see.ann.vernon supp,funding for specific state initiatives,see id,competitive grants for innovation,see id.a,and emergency grants,see id.a.the state commissioner of education has broad authority to distribute state funds and allocate federal funds to the centers.see id.c,a,c,b,b.the centers also receive local funding through payment by school districts for certain services and grant contracts with public and private entities.see id.this local funding,however,fluctuates based on the centers ability to generate revenues state funding is the only assured source of funding for the centers.though the state is not the sole source of funding for the centers,we are persuaded that state funding comprises the lion share of the centers budgets.see vogt,at see also clark,at finding that a county probation department was an arm of the state even though it generated revenue through probation fees.
notably,unlike local school districts,the centers do not possess any tax levying or bonding authority that could be used to raise funds.see.ann.vernon supp.this fact counsels in favor of granting region immunity.see anderson red river waterway comm n,cir finding no sovereign immunity because waterway commission could raise funds through its statutory taxing and bonding authority hander san jacinto junior,cir finding no immunity because state junior college could issue revenue bonds and levy annual ad valorem taxes.in light of the centers dependence on the state of texas for funding and their inability to raise their own revenues,it seems likely that a judgment rendered against the centers would be paid in large portion by the state.indeed,the state provides the base funding for the centers operational expenses.see.ann.c vernon supp each regional education service center shall use money distributed to it under this section for the provision of core services or for payment of necessary administrative and operational expenses of the center related to the provision of those services.
local autonomy 
third,we ask whether the centers exercise local autonomy or whether they are primarily controlled by the state.frequent and broad oversight by the state suggests that the entity is an arm of the state.see hudson,at.in the case of the centers,members of the board of directors of each center are selected locally.see.ann.b vernon supp.the board of directors governs each center,develops management and operation policies,approves programs and activities,and establishes the budget.see id.e.though the directors are selected locally,their election is largely controlled by the state commissioner of education,as the commissioner sets rules for selection,appointment,and continuity of board membership.see id.b.once a center board is elected,the commissioner has the power to appoint a master or replace the board of directors if the center is not performing well.see id.management of the centers can be distinguished from management of local school districts,as local school districts determine their own procedures for electing their boards of trustees and trustees have exclusive power over the school districts.see id.
more generally,the centers are subject to significant supervision by the state commissioner of education.the commissioner has broad authority to decide any matter concerning the operation or administration of the centers.see.ann.c vernon supp.the commissioner sets operation and performance standards for each center,see id,and centers are required by law to report their performance to the commissioner annually,see id,b.underperforming centers may be sanctioned or even closed by the commissioner.see id.further,the commissioner must approve the appointment of each center executive director and can remove an executive director if a center is underperforming.see id.
the state oversight and control of the centers contrasts markedly with the significant autonomy of local school districts.under texas law,independent school districts enjoy a large amount of political autonomy from the state,the tea,and the state board of education.mckinney,at.each school district is governed by a board of trustees elected by the voters of the district.see.ann.vernon supp.trustees have the exclusive power and duty to govern public schools of the district.id.b.importantly,neither the tea nor the board may substitute its judgment for the lawful exercise by district trustees of their powers and duties.mckinney,at.the centers relative lack of autonomy counsels in favor of eleventh amendment protection.
local or statewide issues 
fourth,we consider whether the centers focus primarily on local or statewide issues.this factor asks whether the entity acts for the benefit and welfare of the state as a whole or for the special advantage of local inhabitants.pendergrass greater new orleans expressway comm n,cir.a primary mission of the centers is to ensure statewide uniformity and quality in education.see.ann.a vernon supp.the texas legislature gave the commissioner power to establish up to twenty centers and delineate their boundaries to serve schools around the state.see id.the centers are accountable to the state commissioner of education,see,id,not to local voters.the centers collect and deliver educational resources throughout the state,not just in one area the centers are simply divided into regions for convenience.s
