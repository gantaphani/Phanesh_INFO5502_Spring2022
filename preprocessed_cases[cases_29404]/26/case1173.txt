this is an appeal by john watts from the dismissal under.b of his amended complaint claiming,among other things,that because of his religious beliefs he was terminated from a practicum position,which led to his dismissal from a seminar and prevented him from earning his master degree at a state university.
given the procedural posture of the case,we view the allegations in the amended complaint in the light most favorable to watts.while the true facts may be other than those alleged,for present purposes it does not matter.the allegations,construed favorably to watts,are what count.
in watts enrolled in the master of social work program at florida international university,a state university.he was scheduled to graduate in may of.to complete the program and earn his degree,watts had to take a course called field practicum ii.according to fiu graduate catalog,field practicum ii was a hour supervised educational experience in an agency setting designed to provide the student with an opportunity to develop and practice social work skills in the student area of concentration.watts registered for the course,paid his tuition,and was assigned to fair oaks hospital,a private psychiatric institution affiliated with fiu for purposes of the practicum.while in the practicum watts worked under the supervision of phyllis singerman,an fiu graduate field instructor and advisor,and joseph salluzzi.salluzzi was also a field instructor,but it is unclear whether he worked for fiu or fair oaks.in the spring of,watts was counseling a patient at fair oaks who lacked a diagnosis.after questioning the patient,watts,consistent with his training,recommended that the patient join a bereavement support group.the patient asked where she could find such a group.watts,who had noticed on the patient assessment form that she was catholic,included church in the options he told her about.nothing he said violated any guidelines or requirements of the msw program.
shortly thereafter,watts received a letter on fair oaks letterhead which was signed by salluzzi and singerman,terminating him from the practicum.this is what it said 
this letter has been drafted in order to make john watts aware of his practicum termination at fair oaks hospital on.
the decision has been based on inappropriate behavior related to patients,regarding religion.this is the second such incident where personal boundaries have intruded into professional conduct.
the first counseling was verbal,and included phyllis singerman graduate field instructor and joseph salluzzi field instructor.
salluzzi and singerman also orally informed watts that his termination was due to his religious speech.as a result of his termination from the practicum,watts later received another letter dismissing him from field practicum ii,the related course in which he was enrolled at fiu.because he was kicked out of the practicum and the course,watts could not earn his master degree at fiu.
according to watts,fair oaks and salluzzi acted in such close concert with the state,and the state approved their actions,that their actions are fairly attributable to the state and they are deemed to be state actors for the purposes of.
watts filed a lawsuit against fiu,the board of regents,the board of trustees for fiu,the corporate entity that owns fair oaks,singerman,salluzzi,and some others.the complaint asserted under three claims that the defendants actions had violated watts constitutional rights to free speech,free exercise of religion,and procedural due process.it also put forward twelve state law claims.
in granting the defendants motion to dismiss,the district court did not address their assertion that fair oaks and salluzzi were not state actors for purposes of the federal claims.instead,the court ruled that the allegations failed to state a claim for violation of federal law regardless of state action.as for the state law claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them and dismissed them without prejudice.well,more or less.more about that at the end of this opinion,but for now we turn to the federal claims.
the district court reached its conclusion that watts free speech claim should be dismissed by applying the employee speech case of pickering board of education,d,and its progeny.the pickering decision recognized that government has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.id.at.at.still,the supreme court unequivocally rejected the notion that government employees relinquish their right to comment on matters of public concern.id.because pickering had spoken on an issue of public importance and there was no evidence that he had knowingly or recklessly made false statements,the court held that the school board had infringed on his first amendment rights by dismissing him from public employment.id.at.at.
by contrast,when public employees speak on matters of private concern,the first amendment protection is not as extensive.see generally connick myers,d.in the connick case the court explained that while the state generally is prohibited from punishing the expression of private sentiments 
when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern,but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest,absent the most unusual circumstances,a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee behavior.
id.at.at.the district court rightly found that watts spoke on a matter of private concern.his speech provided private counsel to a single patient within the confines of a counseling session.if pickering is the appropriate yardstick,watts loses.
watts argues,however,that the standard to apply is not the pickering test but the one governing student speech that is set out in tinker des moines independent community school district,d,and its progeny.in that case the supreme court famously proclaimed that neither students nor teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.id.at.at.less famously,the court said that the first amendment rights of students and teachers must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.id.in that special light,school officials may be justified in prohibiting particular expressions where there is a showing that engaging in the forbidden conduct would materially and substantially interfere with appropriate discipline in the operation of a school.id.at.at quotation marks omitted.watts argues that because he was a student,the state can only regulate his conduct under the tinker test,which limits the government power more than the pickering test does.
the assumption underlying watts contention is that because the state has some power to regulate his speech as a student of fiu,it can not also exercise its power to regulate his speech as an employee of fair oaks.tinker gives the state a limited power to restrict speech that materially and substantially interferes with the operation of a school.id.pickering,as modified by connick,provides the state a broader power to regulate the private speech of its employees.connick,at.at.had watts not been a student as well as a government employee,the state plainly would have been entitled to the greater leeway the pickering test affords it.the fact that the state could have attempted to assert its authority over watts as a student,subject to the tinker restrictions,does not prevent it from asserting authority over him as an employee,subject to the pickering test instead.in any event,once watts the employee was terminated from his employment in the practicum,watts the student could not complete the course which included the practicum.without that course he could not earn his degree.the action that led to the results about which watts complains is his termination from employment in the practicum,and to that pivotal action the pickering test applies.
as we have already indicated,judged under pickering,the termination of watts from the practicum because of what he said during the private counseling session does not violate the free speech clause of the first amendment.the district court correctly dismissed that claim.
the district court was also correct in dismissing the due process claim.assuming that watts held a property right in his graduate school education,he has not been denied constitutionally adequate due process.because a violation of procedural due process is not complete unless and until a state fails to provide due process the state may cure a procedural deprivation by providing a later procedural remedy.mckinney pate,cir en banc citation and quotation marks omitted.only when the state refuses to provide a process sufficient to remedy the procedural deprivation does a constitutional violation become actionable.id.the district court identified several florida administrative code sections and state court decisions indicating that watts could seek relief for his procedural deprivations in state court.watts sole argument on appeal appears to be that an administrative appeal of his dismissal would have been futile.even if that is true,watts has not presented any reason to believe that he could not receive a procedural remedy through a state court proceeding.for that reason,the dismissal of the due process claim was proper.
watts has,however,pleaded a valid first amendment free exercise of religion claim.the district court dismissed this claim because it concluded that watts had not alleged that the termination of his practicum employment for his statement to the counseling patient had substantially burdened his observation of a central religious belief.that is the wrong standard.to plead a valid free exercise claim,watts must allege that the government has impermissibly burdened one of his sincerely held religious beliefs.frazee.dep t of employment,d.in numerous decisions,beginning as far back as,the supreme court has used the phrase sincerely held to describe the type of religious belief or practice eligible for protection under the free exercise clause.see,witmer united states.frazee,at.at.we have used that sincerely held language as well.see,benning georgia,cir.
sincerely held is different from central,and courts have rightly shied away from attempting to gauge how central a sincerely held belief is to the believer religion.it is true that in hernandez commissioner,d,the supreme court described the type of religious belief or practice that the first amendment shields from substantial government burden as a central religious belief or practice.id.at.at.after using that phrase,however,the court pulled back from it in the very next sentence,stating it is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith,or the validity of particular litigants interpretations of those creeds.id.
if those two sentences in hernandez left any doubt about whether the judiciary should determine the centrality of a specific belief,the court removed that doubt the next year in employment division,department of human resources smith,d.there,the court wrote it is no more appropriate for judges to determine the centrality of religious beliefs before applying a compelling interest test in the free exercise field,than it would be for them to determine the importance of ideas before applying the compelling interest test in the free speech field.id.at.at.the court asked in smith what principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer assertion that a particular act is central to his personal faith judging the centrality of different religious practices is akin to the unacceptable business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims.id.at.at some quotation marks omitted.it concluded repeatedly and in many different contexts,we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.id.while the free exercise clause may be aimed primarily at protecting central religious practices,it is beyond the competence of the courts to determine the centrality of a particular religious belief or practice.the test is sincerity,not centrality.and it is sincerity that watts was required to plead.
with what specificity must sincerity be pleaded we have held many times when discussing a rule b motion to dismiss,that the pleadings are construed broadly,levine world fin.network bank,cir,and that the allegations in the complaint are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,hawthorne mac adjustment,cir.of course,a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.bell atlantic twombly,d.while rule b does not permit dismissal of a complaint simply because it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,the f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.
the supreme court most recent formulation of the pleading specificity standard is that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter taken as true to suggest the required element.id.the standard is one of plausible grounds to infer.id.the court has instructed us that the rule does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,but instead simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element.id.it is sufficient if the complaint succeeds in identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render the element plausible.id.
applying the teachings of twombly and our decisions to the pleading issue in this case,the question is whether watts has alleged enough facts to suggest,raise a reasonable expectation of,and render plausible the fact that he sincerely held the religious belief that got him fired.
how do you plead sincerity of belief one way is to state that the belief is,in fact,your religious belief.watts did that in paragraph of the amended complaint 
watts is a christian.he is not catholic.watts religious beliefs include the belief that a patient who professes a religion is entitled to be informed if the counselor is aware of a religious avenue within the patient religion that will meet the appropriate therapy protocol for the patient.watts termination for his religious speech evidences defendants intent to compel watts to act contrary to his religious beliefs and constitutes a substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs.
the only fair reading of paragraph is that watts religion included the sincere belief that a patient who herself professes religious faith is entitled to be informed of religious avenues for therapy.that reading is reinforced by the additional allegation that when watts was fired for acting on that belief it was done with the intent to compel him to act contrary to his religious beliefs and imposed a substantial burden on them.if watts was not sincere about the religious belief that got him fired,firing him for acting according to it could not have imposed a substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs,as he has pleaded.
in twombly terms,watts has certainly alleged enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that his religious belief was sincerely held.at,putting forward plausible grounds to infer that it was sincerely held,and identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render the sincerity of his belief plausible,id.that is all that is required at this stage of the litigation.
our dissenting colleague acknowledges that watts has adequately pleaded the sincerity of his belief,but believes that he has failed to plead sufficiently that the belief is of a religious character.see infra at.we disagree with the dissent position that watts must plead facts sufficient for an objectively reasonable person to conclude that his belief is religious in nature.
initially,we question whether a plaintiff could ever plead or proffer objective facts that his particular sincerely held belief is religious in nature.religion is by its nature subjective.as kierkegaard wrote,it is precisely in objective analysis that one loses the infinite personal and passionate concern that is the requisite condition for faith,its ubiquitous ingredient,wherein faith comes into existence.if watts could explain or prove objectively why his religion commanded the belief in question,it might no longer be a religious belief,or at least not one rooted in faith.
we need not delve far into philosophy,however,because the supreme court has at least twice instructed us not to engage in any objective test of whether a particular belief is a religious one.see thomas review bd.of the.employment sec,d united states seeger,d.in the thomas case,the court wrote that the resolution of whether a particular belief is religious in nature is not to turn upon a judicial perception of the particular belief or practice in question religious beliefs need not be acceptable,logical,consistent,or comprehensible to others in order to merit first amendment protection.at.at.it is difficult to gauge the objective reasonableness of a belief that need not be acceptable,logical,consistent,or comprehensible to others.
the dissent characterizes thomas as being about the verity of a plaintiff purported religious beliefs rather than about whether those beliefs are religious in character.see infra at.that is not how we read the case.in its opinion the supreme court takes to task the lower court for concluding that thomas refusal to participate in the production of war materials was a personal philosophical choice rather than a religious choice.thomas,at.at quoting thomas review bd.of the.employment sec.in doing so,the court squarely addresses the question of whether thomas beliefs were beliefs rooted in religion and explains how to go about t he determination of what is a religious belief or practice.id.it instructs us that the resolution of that question does not turn on the judiciary perception of the particular belief or practice.id.instead,t he narrow function of a reviewing court in this context is to determine whether there was an appropriate finding that petitioner terminated his work because of an honest conviction that such work was forbidden by his religion.id.at.at.the honest sincere conviction that counts is that of the plaintiff,not that of the court.
applying the holding of thomas,watts must plead that he believes his religion compels him to take the actions that resulted in his termination.he need not plead now,or present later,objective evidence that his belief is of the type that a judge would generally consider to be religious in nature.watts is not on the hook for our inability to understand his religious system.
we also are unpersuaded by the attempt to distinguish seeger.see infra at.while acknowledging that the supreme court in seeger recognized that the first amendment protects beliefs that are,in the claimant own scheme of things,religious,at.at,the dissent argues that the focus of the seeger court,however,was not the preclusion of any objective weighing of whether a belief was religious,but rather,an attempt to harness any extrajudicial weighing of the qualitative worth of any given religion,see infra at.the seeger opinion does concern the latter point,but it also concerns the former.the following passage from the opinion addresses both points 
as justice douglas stated in united states ballard.men may believe what they can not prove.they may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs.religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others.local boards and courts in this sense are not free to reject beliefs because they consider them incomprehensible.their task is to decide whether the beliefs professed by a registrant are sincerely held and whether they are,in his own scheme of things,religious.
seeger,at.at.
simply put,judges and juries must not inquire into the validity of a religious doctrine,and the task of courts is to examine whether a plaintiff beliefs are,in his own scheme of things,religious.id.the question is not whether the plaintiff beliefs are religious in the objective,reasonable person view,but whether they are religious in the subjective,personal view of the plaintiff.
for all these reasons,we conclude that a plaintiff need not prove the objective reasonableness of his religious belief.but even if the dissent were correct that at some point in this litigation watts will need to tender objective evidence of the nature of his belief,that point is not now.the district court dismissed watts complaint under rule b.we are at the pleading stage,not the proof stage.
the dissent says that we must ask whether a reasonable person would accept,without more,that watts belief is a religious belief,rather than a philosophical or professional belief,and require watts to set forth specific facts supporting his position that it is a religious belief.see infra at.this formulation sounds remarkably like the standard governing the adjudication of motions for summary judgment,not motions to dismiss.see anderson liberty lobby,d i n ruling on a motion for summary judgment t he question is whether a jury could reasonably find either that the plaintiff proved his case or that he did not.lujan defenders of wildlife,d in response to a summary judgment motion the plaintiff can no longer rest on mere allegations,but must set forth specific facts.citations omitted.even assuming that the questions posed by the dissent would be critical at summary judgment or at trial,all that is required in a complaint is a short and plain statement of the claim.a.
even if we agreed with the dissent position,we would disagree with its position that watts specific allegation of his religious belief is not enough because it is merely a single statement assigning religious motivation to his belief.see infra at.how else does one plead a religious basis or motivation for a belief except by asserting it in a statement in a complaint surely,the alleged fact is not deficiently pleaded,as the dissent implies,merely because it is stated only a single statement.there is no basis in law or logic for requiring a plaintiff to make the same allegation two or more times in a complaint.once is enough.
the dissent hints at how a plaintiff should demonstrate the religious nature of a belief by citing wisconsin yoder,d.see infra at.yoder did not concern pleading requirements.instead,it involved an appeal by the state from a lower court decision overturning a criminal conviction for violating a compulsory law.id.at.at.the supreme court examined whether t he trial testimony showed that respondents believed that their children attendance at high school,public or private,was contrary to the amish religion and way of life.id.at.at.it concluded,after examining the evidence presented at trial,that the respondents held a subjective belief that their opposition to the compulsory attendance law was based on religion.id.at.at.the evidence presented at trial included expert witnesses who were scholars on religion and education who presented the history of the amish people in some detail,beginning with the swiss anabaptists of the century.id.at.at.the respondents case was sufficiently detailed,in fact,that the supreme court spent more than two thousand words summarizing the relevant testimony.id.at.at.
the third circuit decisions from which the dissent borrows its test likewise discuss evidence presented after the pleading stage.in africa pennsylvania,cir,the court affirmed the district court denial of an injunction after it had conducted an evidentiary hearing.id.at.in malnak yogi,cir,the court affirmed the entry of summary judgment against a school district for violating the establishment clause after the defendants had filed numerous depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions,and other affidavits.id.at.
we do not understand the dissent to suggest that future first amendment litigants should add two thousand words to their complaints,detailing the contours of their religious beliefs.we have constantly preached to attorneys that they should avoid repetitious allegations and averments in complaints,warning against the reviled shotgun pleadings style.one of us has been particularly outspoken on the subject,always ready with the verbal cudgel to pound on those who file prolix and repetitious complaints,instead of the short and plain statement of the claim contemplated by rule.see,strategic income fund,spear,leeds kellogg,cir explaining that this court has addressed unwieldy pleadings on numerous occasions and always with great dismay byrne nezhat,cir outlining in meticulous detail a district court obligation not to permit duplicitous pleadings anderson dist.bd.of trs.of cent.cmty,cir noting that repetition of allegations makes it virtually impossible to understand a complaint pelletier zweifel,cir warning attorneys against forcing the court to sift through the facts at the pleading stage.
watts has stated in his amended complaint that his religious beliefs include the belief at issue here.his representation is all that is necessary to raise the possibility that his belief is a religious one above the speculative level.twombly.at see seeger,at.at t he claim of the plaintiff that his belief is an essential part of a religious faith must be given great weight.we are at a loss to understand how much more he could say in his complaint and still adhere to the rule model of a short and plain statement of the claim.of course,watts could conceivably be prevaricating when he pleads that his belief is religious.or maybe the defendants would say that he is mistaken about his religious beliefs,taking the position that samuel taylor coleridge did when he said that you do not believe you only believe that you believe.but it is these possibilities,and not watts straightforward allegations,that are too speculative to be dispositive at this state in the litigation.
of course,in allowing this claim to proceed,we express or imply no view on the ultimate merits,or lack of merit,of the claim.all we hold is that,if there is state action,see supra note,this claim is entitled to proceed to the next step in the litigation process.
although we are convinced that,subject to the state action question,watts has stated a claim for a violation of his free exercise rights,we affirm the district court ruling that qualified immunity applies to the state defendants whom watts has sued in their individual capacities.the factual circumstances of this case are unusual.there were no decisions in addressing the free exercise rights of graduate students in a practicum.watts seems to have admitted as much because he urged us to craft a new constitutional standard for precisely this situation,explaining that applying either employee speech or student speech cases to student internships is like trying to put the proverbial square peg in a round hole.to decide unusual cases courts sometimes have to cut down pegs and bore out holes,but when such carpentry is necessary qualified immunity is appropriate.because the individual defendants were not on notice that they were violating watts clearly established constitutional rights,the district court correctly granted them summary judgment in their individual capacities.
there is one more matter we need to address.we said earlier in our opinion that the district court more or less our term had declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims.supra at.what the court did in its order is state that in light of the dismissal of the federal claims,i decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims under c,and t hus,those claims are dismissed without prejudice capitalization in original.but then the court said 
because there may be an appeal,however,and in case i have erred in dismissing any of the federal claims,i will alternatively address some of the arguments made by the defendants as to the state law claims.should the eleventh circuit affirm the dismissal of the federal claims,the following discussion will,of course,be nothing more than dicta and not be binding in subsequent state proceedings.
the district court proceeded to explain why some of the pleaded state law claims were not valid.others it did not address on the merits.in the conclusion of the order,however,the district court stated that while the federal claims were dismissed with prejudice,under c it was declining to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims,which were therefore dismissed without prejudice capitalization in original.it did not dismiss without prejudice only some of the state law claims,but all of them.
this is a pretty unusual approach,and we have no precedent exactly on point about how to handle it.we are sympathetic with the district court desire to move things along should any part of its order addressing the federal claims be reversed on appeal,but at the same time the court did begin and end its discussion of the state law claims with clear statements indicating that all of them were being dismissed without prejudice.the decisive point for us is that the most efficient way to handle this situation is to let the state law claims travel as a group and avoid any piecemeal appellate consideration of them.a lot can happen to a case on remand,and it may be that some or all of the state law claims are mooted or fall by the wayside for one reason or another.we will vacate the judgment as to all of them and remand them to the district court for further proceedings in light of our reversal of its judgment as to the federal free exercise claim.obviously,we are not implying any view as to the merits of any of the state law claims.
the district court judgment is affirmed insofar as it dismissed with prejudice the federal free speech and procedural due process claims,but the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings insofar as the federal free exercise and all of the state law claims are concerned.
my colleagues debate well.concluding that the complaint does not affirmatively show that the appellant may not have a case,i concur in the opinion prepared for us by judge carnes.
now,perhaps,the fact contentions will be developed and,if they should not be in dispute,the court can rule on existing,and not merely alleged,facts.then,that ruling will determine something of value to the resolution of the disagreement.
that is,after all,what the judicial branch is said to be about.
although the majority is correct in holding that watts must allege the impermissible burden of a sincerely held religious belief,frazee illinois dep t of employment,d,in determining that watts pleaded a valid free exercise claim,the majority conflates what are two distinct analyses under the first amendment.as i set forth below,free exercise jurisprudence requires that a plaintiff plead both sincerity and the religious character of the plaintiff belief.because i conclude that watts failed to plead sufficient facts supporting the religious character of the belief for which he seeks first amendment protection,i respectfully dissent.
while a plaintiff seeking free exercise protection under the first amendment must allege a sincerely held belief,sincerity alone is not belief must also be religious.see,church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d benning georgia,cir.federal case law is replete with examples of courts articulating the threshold free exercise requirements as a analysis.see,lukumi,at.at noting that the court must consider the plaintiffs free exercise claim because no question existed as to the plaintiffs sincerity and the practice of animal sacrifice was a religious belief united states seeger,d describing a court responsibility as deciding whether a plaintiff beliefs are sincerely held and religious citing united states ballard.benning georgia,cir t he first amendment requires a court to determine whether the asserted belief is religious and sincerely held.martinelli dugger,cir a claimant meets this initial burden,therefore,if he or she proves that the beliefs are truly held and religious in nature.sutton rasheed,cir only beliefs which are both sincerely held and religious in nature are protected under the first amendment.internal quotation marks omitted wiggins sargent,cir o nly sincerely held beliefs which are rooted in religion are protected by the free exercise clause.quoting thomas review bd.of th
