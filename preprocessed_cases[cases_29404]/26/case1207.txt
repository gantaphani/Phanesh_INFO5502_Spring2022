the court hereby vacates its prior opinion,filed november,and substitutes this corrected opinion.
defendant judy weaver appeals her conviction and sentence for knowingly and willfully aiding and abetting the failure of flagler career institute to make refunds of student loans and pell grant funds,in violation of a and.after review and oral argument,we affirm.
background 
this appeal primarily concerns the district court denial of weaver motion to withdraw her guilty plea.we first review a weaver plea agreement,b her plea colloquy,and c the evidentiary hearing before the district court.
plea agreement 
for about years,judy weaver was the director of finance of flagler career institute flagler,a proprietary school when students dropped out or withdrew,flagler was required to refund the proceeds of pell grants and student loans guaranteed by the department of education.weaver duties included writing those refund checks.on july,the government filed a information charging that,beginning in early and continuing through february,weaver did knowingly and willfully aid and abet flagler failure to make refunds on behalf of approximately students in the amount of more than but less than,in violation of a and.
weaver entered into a plea agreement agreement wherein she acknowledged understanding the nature and elements of her offense.the agreement listed these elements as t hat the defendant failed to refund student loans insured by the department of education and pell grant funds provided by the department of education,and t hat the defendant did so knowingly and willfully.in her agreement,weaver also admitted that she was in fact guilty and these facts 
flagler,a proprietary school in jacksonville,florida,which closed in february,offered associate degrees to its students in various medical related programs.flagler was eligible for and participated in the title iv federal student financial assistant programs which provide various types of grants and loans to eligible schools.the loans are insured or guaranteed by the department of education and the grants are provided by the department of education.participating schools are required to make a refund within days after the student withdraws the ending of a quarter or semester or trimester or the date the institution determines that the student withdraws,whichever is earliest.the school is responsible for making student refunds in accordance with the distribution formula set forth under.schools participating in the federal student financial assistance programs must document student attendance,properly calculate refunds for students who drop out of or withdraw from school,and promptly refund the amount to the department of education or the appropriate lender.
the defendant was employed as flagler director of finance from fall until the school closed in february.as director of finance,the defendant helped develop corporate strategies,policies,and budgets.beginning in about,she was responsible for writing the checks for flagler,including refund checks.the defendant worked at various offices including lighthouse point,florida,but her duties included handling refund issues for the flagler.
when a student dropped out of or withdrew from flagler,a drop computation form was prepared at the school and sent to the defendant with the amount of the refund due.refund request packets were sent from flagler in jacksonville to the defendant weekly.the defendant reviewed the paperwork and changed the refund amount if she came up with a different calculation than the school calculation.the defendant then sent the packet back to jacksonville so the school could make the calculation changes and return the packet back to the defendant.
the defendant sent monthly accounts payable reports to wangberg,which included the aggregate amount of the student refunds due.the defendant also spoke with wangberg via telephone a number of times per month and discussed with him,among other things,the refund issue and flagler need to make refund payments.wangberg was aware of the refund problem but he did not consider making refunds a priority.
in or about february,wangberg himself took over as the school director of flagler.as noted above,wangberg was well aware that flagler owed a substantial amount of refund monies.when wangberg ran the school,he took complete control of the funds and the defendant could not write any checks without his approval.during wangberg tenure as school director,the amount of refund payments due continued to grow.
wangberg and the defendant both knew that flagler owed refunds and that they had a requirement to make the refunds.from in or about early,flagler,including wangberg and the defendant,failed to refund student loans guaranteed by the department of education and pell grants provided by the department of education in the amount of more than but less than,on behalf of approximately students.to date,these refunds have not been made.
rule colloquy 
on august,the magistrate judge reviewed the elements of her offense with weaver as part of both her waiver of indictment and plea colloquy.weaver had no questions about them,had read and understood every page and every word of her agreement,and knew every word and every provision was binding on her.the judge questioned weaver whether she was pleading guilty because she was in fact guilty whether she committed the act charged in the information whether she understood that her guilty plea admitted the truth of the charge and whether she understood what she was doing by pleading guilty.weaver responded affirmatively each time.
during the rule colloquy,the prosecutor read the above facts from the agreement and weaver agreed with them.weaver also responded affirmatively to these questions 
the court did you from in or about early to in or about february at jacksonville in the middle district of florida and elsewhere aid and abet louis weinberg sic in flagler failure to make refunds of student loans and pell grant funds 
defendant yes,sir.
the court were the pell grant sic funds provided by the department of education 
defendant yes,sir.
the court did you knowingly and willfully aid and abet louis weinberg sic in flagler failure to make these refunds 
defendant yes,sir.
the magistrate judge found that a factual basis existed for weaver plea,that those facts stated the elements of the offense,and that weaver guilty plea was freely,voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently made.weaver agreed with these findings and indicated her satisfaction with her attorney.the magistrate judge then issued a report and recommendation outlining these findings.weaver did not object.
thereafter,on september,the district court accepted weaver guilty plea,adjudged weaver guilty,and set sentencing for december.the court later rescheduled it to february.during the interim,weaver replaced her attorney,mark perry,with her current attorney,curtis fallgatter.the court continued sentencing to june.
evidentiary hearing on motion to withdraw 
on may,weaver moved to withdraw her guilty plea.weaver motion asserted that she was under the mistaken impression that the crime to which she pled guilty was a strict liability crime,she was misinformed as to the elements of the crime charged,the facts outlined in the agreement did not constitute the crime charged,she was misinformed as to the testimony of key witnesses,the agreement had an internal inconsistency,and she was innocent.during an evidentiary hearing on weaver motion,the district court heard testimony from both weaver and perry.
weaver testified that she understood the government witnesses were going to criminally implicate me and basically say it was my fault that the refunds were not paid,but later learned they were supporting her position that a crime had never been committed.at the time of her plea,weaver had understood that i simply had to have knowledge that the refunds were due and not that that made me guilty of a crime.
regarding the factual statement in her agreement identifying weaver as help ing to develop corporate strategies,policies,and budgets,weaver did not understand this statement to mean that she was involved in developing a strategy for refunds.according to weaver,wangberg established the priorities for refund payments before she came to work for flagler.weaver understanding of the mens rea required to violate a was as follows 
at that time i fully understood that the willful issue was the fact,simply the fact that i had to have knowledge that the refunds were due and not paid and that made me guilty.that was it,that the government did not have to prove intent.
weaver indicated that her attorney did some research with case law and said there was no real case law and that the bates case was the case law on this matter.this reference was to the supreme court decision in bates united states,d,which held that a specific intent to defraud the government is not an essential element of criminal misapplication under a.
in response to the court questions,weaver elaborated that she believed the intent of never paying the refunds back was a necessary element of a a violation,and that she never had this intent.weaver explained that nobody ever even conceived that not paying refunds was a crime.weaver further indicated that m y whole reason for withdrawing the plea is that had i known and understood the facts and the law in august of,i would have never said i was guilty.
weaver had not seen the pattern jury instructions defining knowingly and willfully until fallgatter reviewed them with her.when she entered her plea,weaver did not know that the definition of willfulness meant that the act was committed voluntarily and purposefully,with the specific intent to do something the law forbids,that is with bad purpose,either to disobey or disregard the law.
weaver testified that the loan funds were not used for any personal use by either her or louis wangberg,as follows 
q.did any of them get diverted by you for some personal use of yours or some company or bought a house or a car or some personal use 
to your knowledge did that get diverted to wangberg for his personal use,cars or houses or entertainment or anything other than school business 
q.did you exercise any control or dominion over those funds so they could be used for someone benefit other than paying school bills 
no.i had no authority.wangberg was responsible for setting the priorities,and in the last year of the school establishing all approvals for all disbursements.
during,weaver admitted that she understood a regulation existed which required flagler to refund student loans on a timely basis,she understood that rules existed which indicated how to make the refunds,and she discussed these rules with wangberg.weaver further acknowledged that around june she,along with roth and wangberg,made a collective decision to bring the refunds current.weaver sent refund checks to the school to have them held there and not mailed out until the cash was received in the bank.weaver testified that we did that with other bills too.she acknowledged that the checks were cut and entered into the books as having been paid,and that to the auditors,it would have appeared that the refunds had been made.weaver further testified that w e had signed a letter to our auditor stating that our refunds were current when they were not,that when she wrote the checks we considered them paid,and that the checks were going to sit in a drawer f or a very short time until we got the money in the bank.
weaver acknowledged her signatory authority over flagler operating account,that the operating account was the account from which refunds were paid,and that when refunds were made she would process them.weaver denied,however,that she was the one who signed the checks,stating that she only processed them and sent them to the school.
weaver met with perry more than five times and was provided a draft of a plea agreement in and another one in march of.she reviewed the plea agreement exhaustively with perry and her husband.perry explained to her that the government position was that i simply had to have knowledge that the refunds were due and not paid,period,and that the government had no burden to prove intent to defraud.perry did not discuss what knowingly and willfully meant,but advised her that the government position was that they did not have to prove intent and that weaver simply had to know that refunds were due and not paid.
perry testimony 
on direct examination,perry testified as to the truth and accuracy of his affidavit.perry affidavit stated that bates and a was sic the only case or law addressing the issue of intent that he discussed with weaver.perry affidavit also indicated that the terms willfully and aid and abet were not defined in the agreement or during the rule hearing and that weaver could easily have been confused regarding whether or not her conduct was such as to satisfy the element of willfulness under the statute.
on,however,when asked about his affidavit statement that weaver could easily have been confused,perry testified that he did not prepare the affidavit,that he did not put any of the words in it,that s he did understand,and that she did indicate to me in anyway sic that she was confused.perry testimony on also contradicted weaver assertion that perry believed that a was a strict liability crime.specifically,perry stated that after reading bates he understood that you still had to establish that the failure to refund was willful and voluntary and a knowing violation of the law b ut you did not have to establish,upon reading that case,that weaver had a fraudulent intent.
perry also testified that in his representation of weaver he was convinced that she knowingly failed to make refunds,that weaver told him that she participated with wangberg in decisions involving the refunds,and that weaver told him that she wrote checks for refunds,kept them in a drawer,and the books showed that the checks had been written 
perry further testified that weaver told him that she paid herself a bonus and that he and weaver discussed the implications of this in deciding whether to plead guilty perry understanding was that weaver paid herself and she may have paid wangberg a bonus based upon funds that were in the account and the refunds had not been paid.perry gave the bates decision to weaver,discussed it with her,and thought she had a full understanding of criminal intent.weaver made no indication that she did not understand the elements of the offense.perry admitted,however,that he could say that he pulled out the pattern jury instructions and went through willfully and knowingly with weaver.
order denying motion to withdraw 
on september,the district court denied weaver motion to withdraw.the district court found that weaver was not misinformed as to what the words knowingly and willfully meant,that there was no evidence of misrepresentation by the government as to any witnesses,that any inconsistency in the agreement was adequately addressed during the rule colloquy,and that weaver assertion of innocence alone did not entitle weaver to withdraw her plea.although during closing arguments weaver counsel had argued that conversion of the loan proceeds for weaver own use or benefit of another was also a required element of a a violation,the district court did not expressly address that issue.
the district court ultimately sentenced weaver to four months imprisonment and four months home detention.weaver timely appealed both the denial of her motion to withdraw and her sentence 
ii.discussion 
rule e motion to withdraw 
weaver filed her motion to withdraw her plea pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure e,which provides that i f a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty is made before sentence is imposed,the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.e the factors to be considered in evaluating whether a guilty plea may be withdrawn include the following whether close assistance of counsel was available whether the plea was knowing and voluntary whether judicial resources would be conserved and whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.united states buckles,cir internal citation omitted.
weaver contends,inter alia,that her plea was not knowing or voluntary because conversion is an essential element of her a violation,and she was not advised about the conversion element before entering her plea section a provides that a ny person who knowingly and willfully embezzles,misapplies,steals,obtains by fraud,false statement,or forgery,or fails to refund financial aid funds provided or insured by the federal government is subject to criminal liability.a emphasis added.a amendment added or fails to refund to a this court previously concluded that conversion is an element of criminal misapplication under a.see united states kammer,cir.in this case,however,weaver was charged with only fails to refund and not criminal misapplication.thus,her appeal presents the issue of whether fails to refund is an independent ground upon which criminal liability attaches under a,and,if so,whether conversion is an element for that separate crime.to answer these issues,we review relevant precedent and then the amendment to a 
misapplication under a 
our circuit principal decision discussing a is united states kammer,cir.the indictment charged kammer with embezzling,misapplying,and stealing federal financial aid funds in violation of a and kammer,at.reversing kammer misapplication convictions,this court concluded that t o establish a criminal misapplication under a the government must prove a conversion of the property to the use of the defendant or a third party,and fraudulent intent.id.at.we defined conversion as an act of dominion or control over the property that seriously interferes with the owner rights.id.quoting united states jakeway.
this court determined that the government evidence did not show either a conversion or an intent to defraud.id.at.kammer owned a school whose financial condition deteriorated kammer failed to refund loan payments and the withdrawn students files contained copies of refund checks.id.at.kammer explained that she was aging debts,including refunds,so that the most necessary and immediate debts could be paid first.id.at.these included kammer salary,campus renovations,consulting fees,loan repayment to her husband,and her private housekeeper.id.at.
because federal regulations allowed the school to commingle its own money with federal financial aid funds,this court concluded that t he fact that the school may have paid operating expenses before a student withdrew,and thus did not have money to refund the department of education is not a conversion.id.at.the fact that kammer may have paid other operating expenses before making the refunds also did not establish a conversion because w hat happened in this case is exactly what the program anticipated a commingling of funds with grant funds being used for operating expenses.id.this court concluded that u nder these circumstances,we can not find that the government intended to maintain supervision and control over the funds after the point of the commingling of the funds.id.in addition,this court held that the government has not demonstrated that kammer had the requisite intent to defraud the government.id.we stressed,however,that we do not hold that a failure to refund federal monies will never constitute a crime we reverse in this case strictly on the facts of this case.id.
after our kammer decision,the supreme court decided bates united states,d.as we now explain,kammer conclusions about conversion survive bates but its holding regarding intent to defraud does not 
similar to kammer,the indictment in bates charged a school officer with knowingly and willfully misapply ing federally insured student loan funds in violation of a and id.at.the defendant had initiated a pattern and practice of not making refunds,permitted management fee and salary payments to take priority over refunds,instructed others to not make refunds,and failed to make the required refunds id.at.the district court dismissed the indictment for failure to allege intent to injure or defraud.id.at.reversing the dismissal,the seventh circuit concluded that intent to defraud or injure the government is not an element of criminal misapplication,which requires only that the defendant,iv funds and that he did so knowingly and willfully.united states bates,cir.affirming the seventh circuit,the supreme court held expressly that the specific intent to injure or defraud the government or another is not an element of the misapplication of funds proscribed by a.bates,at.
although bates did not address directly whether conversion is an element of criminal misapplication under a,such a conclusion is implicit in its holding that a specific intent to defraud is not a required element of criminal misapplication.specifically,the supreme court quoted and relied on the seventh circuit working definition of willful misapplication under a,which,in essence,requires a conversion,as follows 
w illful misapplication under a requires the government to allege and prove that the defendant consciously,voluntarily,and intentionally exercised unauthorized control or dominion over federally provided or guaranteed title iv funds that interfered with the rights of the funds true owner s,for the use and benefit of the defendant or a third person,while knowing that such an exercise or dominion over the funds was a violation of the law.
id.at.quoting united states bates,at.the supreme court relied on this working definition to refute the defendant argument that if intent to defraud is not an element,innocent maladministration of a business enterprise or unwise use of funds,as the defendant put it,would fall within criminal misapplication under a.bates,at.the supreme court noted that the seventh circuit construction of criminal misapplication under a reaches only the transgressor who intentionally exercises unauthorized dominion over federally insured student loan funds for his own benefit or for the benefit of a third party.id.thus,kammer determination that conversion is an element of a a misapplication survives bates even though its holding does not.
fails to refund under a 
although conversion remains an element of misapplication under a,the more difficult issue is whether fails to refund is an independent ground upon which criminal liability attaches under a,and,if so,whether conversion is an element of that offense as well.
in,congress specifically added or fails to refund to a.see higher education amendments of,stat.significantly,the act of failing to refund is listed separately from the criminal act of misapplication and is connected by or.there is no indication on the face of a that congress intended misapplies and fails to refund to be the same thing or interchangeable.for example,congress did not amend a to provide criminal penalties for a ny person who knowingly and willfully misapplies by failing to refund.furthermore,if this language does not create a ground upon which criminal liability attaches,separate from misapplication,then or fails to refund would be mere surplusage.we decline to read a in this way instead,the text of a is clear and,therefore,we conclude that fails to refund is an independent activity which is criminalized under a.
despite the plain language of or fails to refund in a,weaver argues that the legislative history of the amendment supports the conclusion that fails to refund is not a separate ground upon which criminal liability attaches but is merely interchangeable with misapplication.weaver relies on a house conference report which states that the failure to pay refunds does constitute criminal misapplication under current law.language is added in this bill merely as a clarification.conf,at,reprinted in.weaver contends that or fails to refund was added only to clarify that a misapplication may encompass the failure to refund and that it is not an independent ground for criminal liability.
we decline,however,to look beyond the plain language of a.in our circuit,w hen the import of the words congress has used is clear,as it is here,we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.harris garner,cir en banc.see cbs primetime joint venture,cir.in our circuit,there is only one recognized ex
