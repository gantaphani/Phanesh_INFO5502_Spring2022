in this case we are asked to determine whether school officials may detain a minor student on school grounds in the absence of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or violation of a school rule.the minor,randy,contends that when school security officers called him out of class into the hallway,he was detained without cause in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.the court of appeal,relying on in re frederick d,applied the standard to this encounter,which occurred on school grounds and during school hours,and found that it had been satisfied.we do not decide whether the record supports that finding of reasonable suspicion because we conclude instead that the broad authority of school administrators over student behavior,school safety,and the learning environment requires that school officials have the power to stop a minor student in order to ask questions or conduct an investigation even in the absence of reasonable suspicion,so long as such authority is not exercised in an arbitrary,capricious,or harassing manner.on this ground,we affirm the court of appeal.
background 
a petition filed pursuant to welfare and institutions code section alleged that the minor had violated penal code section,subdivision a by possessing a knife with a locking blade on school grounds.prior to the jurisdictional hearing,the minor moved to suppress evidence of the knife,asserting that its discovery during a consent search had been tainted by the preceding illegal detention in violation of the fourth amendment.moving him from the classroom into the hallway for questioning was,he claimed,an unreasonable detention because there was no articulable basis for a reasonable suspicion that he had engaged or was engaging in the proscribed activity,violation of a criminal statute or school rule.the motion was denied,after which the petition was sustained.the minor was declared a ward of the court and placed on probation.
the evidence offered at the hearing on the motion to suppress reflects the following 
cathy worthy,a campus security officer at the public high school attended by the minor,testified that during passing time,approximately on march,she was between c building and a auditorium.as she came around one of two large pillars in that area,she observed the minor and a friend in an area of the campus in which students are not permitted to congregate.when the minor saw worthy,he fixed his pocket very nervously.some of the lining of the left pocket was still sticking out.worthy asked the two if they needed anything and instructed them to go to class.the minor finished fixing his pocket and went back to class.worthy followed them to see where they were going because the minor acted very paranoid and nervous.she then notified her supervisor and at his direction summoned another security officer.
when the two officers went to the classroom,worthy asked the minor if she could see him outside.once in the hallway,worthy asked the minor if he had anything on him.he replied no and repeated that denial when asked again.the second officer asked the minor for consent to search his bag.the minor consented,and replied no again to worthy repeated question whether he had anything on him.the second officer then asked the minor for permission to do a patdown search.worthy asked if it was okay,and the minor replied yes.a patdown search by the other officer revealed a knife,later found to have a locking blade,in the minor left pocket.
during the minutes the minor was in the hallway being questioned by worthy before the consent to search was given,he was not free to leave.
commenting that the officer had engaged in good security work based on the minor looking nervous or paranoid and adjusting his pocket upon seeing her,the judge denied the motion to suppress.
on appeal from the order declaring him a ward of the court,the minor repeated the arguments made in support of his motion to exclude the,that because the campus security officer had lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or violation of a school rule,the detention violated his right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by the fourth amendment,and that his consent to search was a product of that unlawful detention.the court of appeal agreed with the minor that the standard to be applied was whether the detaining officer has reasonable suspicion that the person to be detained has been,is,or is about to be engaged in criminal activity in re frederick,supra,d at.or is about to engage in a violation of those school rules that exist for the protection of other students attending school or for the preservation of order at the school.the frederick court had adapted its standard for judging the lawfulness of a detention of a student from in re william cal d,william and new jersey,d,both of which involved the search of a student.applying that standard as expanded to include school rules and regulations designed for the protection of students or the preservation of order,the court of appeal held that the detention of the minor was reasonable.the minor violation of a school rule,together with his nervous fixing of the protruding lining of his pocket,gave rise to reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a detention for the purpose of asking questions about the conduct the security officer had observed.
in this court,the minor contends that no articulable facts supported a reasonable suspicion of misconduct.the people argue that the standard does not apply to a detention of a student by a school official on school grounds.
discussion 
according to the minor,the question presented here is whether the circumstances outlined above made the security officer aware of sufficient articulable facts to warrant reasonable suspicion that the minor was committing a crime,or violating a rule designed to protect other students or to maintain order in the school,thereby justifying his detention for investigation of the offense.he contends that the absence of facts supporting reasonable suspicion rendered his detention invalid under the fourth amendment,requiring suppression of the knife found in his pocket.
to decide whether relevant evidence obtained by assertedly unlawful means must be excluded,we look exclusively to whether its suppression is required by the united states constitution.in re lance cal d.
the first question,then,is whether the minor was detained.a detention occurs o nly when the officer,by means of physical force or show of authority,has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen terry ohio,fn,d people souza cal th,d.in the general run of cases,where the police have succeeded in apprehending the suspect,there is no dispute that the suspect liberty has been thereby restrained,terry,supra,at.officer grabbed defendant while he was walking down the street and spun him around souza,supra,cal th at,d,defendant was stopped while running down the street.after all,in those cases,the defendant,in the absence of the stop,would have been free to continue on his way.
a minor at school,however,can hardly be said to be free to continue on his or her way.traditionally at common law,and still today,unemancipated minors lack some of the most fundamental rights of even the right of liberty in its narrow sense,the right to come and go at will.they are subject,even as to their physical freedom,to the control of their parents or guardians.vernonia school dist.acton,d vernonia.although the high court has rejected the notion that public schools,like private schools,exercise only parental power over their students,the power that public schools do exercise is nonetheless custodial and tutelary,permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults.id.at.
to begin,minor students are required to be in school.while they are there,the primary duty of school officials and teachers is the education and training of young people.a state has a compelling interest in assuring that the schools meet this responsibility.without first establishing discipline and maintaining order,teachers can not begin to educate their students.and apart from education,the school has the obligation to protect pupils from mistreatment by other children,and also to protect teachers themselves from violence by the few students whose conduct in recent years has prompted national concern,supra,d conc.opn.of powell,cal,art.i,subd.c all students and staff of public primary,elementary,junior high and senior high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe,secure and peaceful.california fulfills its obligations by requiring each school board to establish rules and regulations to govern student conduct and discipline,and by permitting the local district to establish a police or security department to enforce those rules.
at school,events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate,effective action.goss lopez,d.to respond in an appropriate manner,teachers and school administrators must have broad supervisory and disciplinary powers.william,supra,cal d at,quoting horton goose creek.sch.dist.cir.california law,for example,permits principals,teachers,and any other certificated employees to exercise the same degree of physical control over a pupil that a parent would be legally privileged to exercise which in no event shall exceed the amount of physical control reasonably necessary to maintain order,protect property,or protect the health and safety of pupils,or to maintain proper and appropriate conditions conducive to learning.
encounters on school grounds between students and school personnel are constant and much more varied than those on the street between citizens and law enforcement officers.while at school,a student may be stopped,told to remain in or leave a classroom,directed to go to a particular classroom,given an errand,sent to study hall,called to the office,or held after school.unlike a citizen on the street,a minor student is subject to the ordering and direction of teachers and administrators a student is not free to roam the halls or to remain in the classroom as long as she please s,even if she behave s herself.she is deprived of liberty to some degree from the moment she enter s school,and no one could suggest a constitutional infringement based on that basic deprivation.wallace by wallace batavia school dist.cir,wallace see also milligan city of slidell cir,milligan any such right of unhindered attendance in class is logically inconsistent with the mandate of compulsory attendance and a structured curriculum,and it hardly squares with the schools obligation to inculcate the habits and manners of civility.
thus,when a school official stops a student to ask a question,it would appear that the student liberty has not been restrained over and above the limitations he or she already experiences by attending school.accordingly,the conduct of school officials in moving students about the classroom or from one classroom to another,sending students to the office,or taking them into the hallway to ask a question would not seem to qualify as a detention as defined by the fourth amendment.in the absence of a fourth amendment claim,relief,if at all,would come by showing that school officials acted in such an arbitrary manner as to deprive the student of substantive due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment.see county of sacramento lewis,d.
a number of factors,however,counsel caution before holding that the fourth amendment does not apply to the exercise of physical control by school officials over their students.first,we must acknowledge the united states supreme court reluctance to expand the concept of substantive due process.the court has instructed that w here a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior,that amendment,not the more generalized notion of substantive due process,must be the guide for analyzing these claims.county of sacramento lewis,supra,at,italics added.here,of course,the particular sort of government behavior engaged in by school officials would unquestionably constitute a detention outside the school setting.
second,we have employed the fourth amendment framework in the analogous circumstances of parole and probation searches,even though it might appear that parolees and probationers have no fourth amendment protection against suspicionless searches and seizures.see people reyes cal th,d,in re tyrell cal th,d.in tyrell,for example,we held that a juvenile probationer subject to a valid search condition does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy over his or her person or property,which is the touchstone of fourth amendment analysis.tyrell,at,d.nonetheless,we rejected the notion that the probationer has no legally cognizable privacy rights at all and permitted the probationer to challenge a search as arbitrary,capricious,or undertaken for harassment.id.at fn,d.similarly,in reyes,we held that a parolee subject to a valid search condition does not have any expectation of privacy society is prepared to recognize as legitimate yet may still challenge the search as arbitrary,capricious,or undertaken for harassment.reyes,supra,cal th at,d.by analogy,we might permit a minor student,even though he appears to retain no appreciable liberty on school grounds,to challenge the conduct of school officials as arbitrary,capricious,or harassing under the fourth amendment,which,after all,was crafted to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.id.at,d,citations omitted.
finally,we note that a number of federal cases have without much analysis held or assumed that,notwithstanding the considerable restraints on a student movement by virtue of being at school,conduct by a school official to control that movement is a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment,milligan,supra,at wallace,supra,at hassan lubbock independent school dist.cir,edwards for and in behalf of edwards rees cir.
neither this court nor the supreme court has deemed stopping a student on school grounds during school hours,calling a student into the corridor to discuss a matter,or summoning a student to the principal office for such purposes to be a detention within the meaning of the fourth amendment.for the reasons stated above,we would be hesitant to term such conduct a detention here.however,we find it unnecessary to decide whether school officials infringement on the residuum of liberty retained by the student is properly analyzed as a detention under the fourth amendment or as a deprivation of substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment,for as we explain below we discover that the test under either clause is substantially the,whether the school officials conduct was arbitrary,capricious,or undertaken for purposes of harassment.
although individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure,such suspicion is not an irreducible component of reasonableness.indianapolis edmond,d.under the constitution,the usual prerequisites can be modified when special needs render those rules impracticable.see,griffin wisconsin,d.special needs exist in the public school context.vernonia,supra,at.in,for example,the court permitted the search of a minor student person,the type of intrusion that ordinarily must be supported by probable cause to believe a violation of the law has occurred,so long as there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the search would uncover evidence of a violation of law or school rules,supra,at.in vernonia,the court approved drug testing of,even in the absence of any individualized suspicion of drug use,based once again on the special needs of the public school context.vernonia,supra,at.
vernonia and both involved searches.the issue here is a seizure.still,the test for assessing the reasonableness of official conduct under the fourth amendment is essentially the same it is necessary first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,for there is no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search or seize a
