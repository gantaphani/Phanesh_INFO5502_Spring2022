jose duarte duarte appeals from the trial court denial of his petition for writ of administrative mandamus,through which he asserts that his application to the california state teachers retirement system calstrs for disability retirement benefits has been improperly denied.after hearing,an administrative law judge alj upheld calstrs denial of duarte application for benefits,concluding that calstrs had no choice but to deny duarte application once he refused to complete the independent medical evaluation ime ordered by calstrs pursuant to section,subdivision b,of the education code the trial court subsequently affirmed the decision of alj.duarte asserts on appeal that the trial court erred in concluding that he was ineligible for disability benefits under section,subdivisions a and c.he additionally argues that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars calstrs from relitigating the issue of his disability because several other state agencies have already found him to be disabled.because we conclude that duarte can not overcome his refusal to attend the ime ordered by calstrs in this case,we affirm.
background 
duarte employment and disability history 
duarte became a contributing member of the calstrs defined benefit program on september,when he began teaching in the stockton unified school district susd.duarte taught in stockton through june,earning years of creditable service for purposes of calstrs benefit calculations.thereafter,the susd authorized unpaid personal leave for duarte for the school year and unpaid educational leave for each of the and school years.during his time away from teaching,duarte spent one season working for the california department of forestry as a firefighter.in addition,he reportedly attended law school but,after failing to pass the bar,was working as a paralegal.on december,duarte returned to teaching in the oakland unified school district ousd.on his second day of employment december,he was assaulted by two students after he denied them entry into his classroom due to their disruptive behavior.specifically,duarte sustained an injury to his shoulder when one of the students knocked him backwards in order to get past him through the classroom door.according to duarte,the other student threatened him several times,making statements such as i gon na put a cap in your ass.as duarte tried to complete the day lesson,a number of students continued to mock him.duarte has not returned to teaching since this incident 
in january,duarte treating psychologist,sloman,opined that he was suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and was totally disabled with respect to working as a teacher.ct,specifically,sloman stated his anxiety,due to reminders of the original trauma,would be so high he could not function.sloman indicated in april that her original diagnosis had not changed.in march,although she had last seen duarte in november,sloman continued to diagnose him as suffering from ptsd and also reported that duarte had difficulty focusing,impaired concentration when trying to complete what appear to be simple tasks,and an inability to understand and remember simple directions.she did not expect his condition to improve.duarte treating psychiatrist,goldstein,stated in december that duarte was suffering from significant intermittent depression and indicated that he had previously been diagnosed with this condition by a psychiatrist at kaiser hospital.in october,after seeing duarte for almost a year,goldstein stated diagnosis was ptsd with significant depression.he further indicated that,due to this condition,duarte has a definite lack of concentration,impaired energy,memory loss,and anxiety.moreover,d ue to the daily stress and anxiety associated with this condition,duarte was reported to be unable to complete average daily tasks and is unable to make deadlines,appointments and other routine tasks required of him.
in march,duarte filed a worker compensation claim with the worker compensation appeals board in oakland against the ousd and the california department of education,which at the time managed and supervised the ousd.during the processing of this claim,duarte was evaluated by four different doctors.for instance,matan an orthopedic surgeon and qualified medical evaluator qme concluded that duarte has disability precluding heavy or repetitive use of his left shoulder and is specifically precluded from doing significant work at or above shoulder height.according to matan,duarte is physically able to work as a teacher,but probably not as a firefighter.another orthopedist and qme,barber,confirmed a level of permanent disability which precludes constant work at or above shoulder level on the left.
in addition,duarte attended a psychiatric evaluation with psychiatrist donald stanford in december.during that evaluation,duarte indicated that he had been treated psychiatrically for stress for a short time in when he was working for the susd.records indicate that he was also treated for stress in.duarte additionally reported multiple learning problems involving reading that he has had throughout his life,along with issues related to memory.stanford concluded that duarte cognitive complaints appeared to be exaggerated and that reported problems with concentration and clear thinking were not clinically evident.further,he saw no new cognitive problems as a result of duarte ousd injury.stanford additionally opined that duarte ptsd symptoms had resolved for the most part,although he would likely become anxious again if he were to resume his work as a teacher.in summary,stanford concluded that duarte had a period of temporary psychiatric disability as a result of the december incident,but that it had resolved by august,other than a preclusion from returning to teaching.other longstanding psychiatric and cognitive problems were unrelated to the ousd injury.
finally,duarte received a psychiatric evaluation from richard lieberman in november.duarte reported longstanding issues with dyslexia and memory trouble with details and words to leiberman.lieberman diagnosed duarte with ptsd,resolving.he concluded that duarte was psychiatrically totally and temporarily disabled from the date of the assault until the date of his evaluation.he recommended that duarte not return to work as a spanish teacher for the unified school district,but indicated that vocational rehabilitation would be appropriate.ultimately,duarte entered into a stipulated settlement of his worker compensation claims on january.the executed settlement documents indicate a serious dispute regarding the scope of duarte disability.
in october,duarte applied for social security disability benefits.the california department of social services caldss is charged with making disability determinations in california on behalf of the social security administration ssa,based on federal law.see.as part of this process,caldss sent duarte to be examined by an orthopedist,pon,and a psychologist,felix.pon concluded in march that duarte should avoid reaching over the left shoulder level and should be limited to only occasionally climbing ladders,crawling,lifting pounds,and reaching using his left shoulder.felix completed a psychological evaluation of duarte that same month.based on this evaluation,felix concluded that duarte appears to be impaired in his ability to return to teaching.specifically,felix opined as follows duarte would have difficulty in any situation involving the execution of even simple tasks in a consistent manner.he would be able to interact appropriately with,supervisors,and the public.it is possible that over time duarte may overcome some of his slowness,terror,and emotional numbness.
ultimately,caldss determined on april,that duarte was disabled from the date of the december incident.he became eligible for monthly disability benefits as of december.according to duarte,no hearing was ever held during this process,although he submitted a declaration to caldss and the ssa and was asked is that the truth and the whole truth during one phone call from one of the people from the social security administration.further,caldss did not issue a determination letter stating its reasons for approving his claim.
duarte also had two student loans through the university of california uc totaling approximately which he requested be forgiven due to his total and permanent disability.one loan was an institutional loan issued and funded by the uc,itself,while the other was a loan issued under the federal perkins loan program.a representative of the uc testified at the administrative hearing in this matter regarding the process for loan forgiveness with respect to both student loans,stating that first the borrower submits whatever medical documentation they would like for consideration.thereafter,the documentation is evaluated by medical staff at the relevant uc campus.so,in the case of this irvine loan that was evaluated by the medical staff at the irvine campus,i not going to say that it a comprehensive evaluation,but we do want to make at least a determination that the documentation appears,to our eyes,to be reasonable.for the institutional loan,the recommendation of medical staff after this informal review is conclusive.indeed,there is no formal hearing,and no formulated approach or written standard to aid in a finding of disability.with respect to the federal loan,once the uc makes a preliminary finding of disability,it releases its interest in the loan and forwards it to the department of education for a final determination based on federal standards.after application of this stated process in the present case,duarte institutional loan was cancelled on the basis of total and permanent disability.his federal loan was released by the uc and forwarded to the department of education on the basis of total and permanent disability.the alj found that this federal loan was ultimately forgiven at the federal level based on a standard that was not established at hearing.
duarte application for calstrs benefits 
on february,duarte applied for disability retirement benefits through calstrs,claiming permanent and total disability as a result of the december incident.over the course of the next six months,calstrs repeatedly asked duarte to submit various medical records and other documents necessary for consideration of his claim.for instance,on june,calstrs indicated that despite previous requests it had not received all of the documentation necessary for its evaluation of duarte application.it therefore requested,among other things,duarte worker compensation materials,including all reports of qmes the police report and principal report documenting the december attack the remainder of an incomplete document previously submitted by duarte information regarding his caldss claim and tax returns from to the present.in response,duarte supplied some of the materials requested.on june,calstrs again requested documents,including the police report and principal report regarding the december incident,as the document previously submitted by duarte as a police report appeared to be a citizen crime report completed by duarte,himself.again,duarte partially complied.
on july,calstrs requested medical documents from through current employment information tax returns for and information to clear up an inconsistency in duarte employment history with ousd after the attack.finally,on august,indicating that it was trying to rule out a disability based on certain statements made in the medical documentation duarte had already submitted calstrs again asked for his medical records from through.each of these calstrs letters indicated that duarte application was in danger of being rejected for failure to supply all of the requested materials within days.see,subd.c.
on august,duarte sent a letter to calstrs objecting to its process for handling his claim,arguing that he had complied with all of its previous requests,and indicating that he would submit his still outstanding kaiser medical records only upon calstrs commitment that it will pay my benefits if those records do not show a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder prior to december.duarte further stated that i f calstrs does not commit to that position,i will conclude that calstrs does not need those records for any legitimate purpose,and that i am in complete compliance with calstrs and eligible for benefits.
by letter dated september,calstrs indicated to duarte that it was still waiting for additional records from him and that it could not commit to approve his application in advance of having all of the necessary information and documentation to support a final decision.under such circumstances,calstrs informed duarte that it was exercising its right,under section,subdivision b,to order him to attend imes prior to a final determination of his disability claim.the scheduling of the imes was handled by benchmark medical consultants benchmark,and duarte initially indicated enthusiasm for completing the evaluations as soon as possible.eventually,imes were scheduled with a neuropsychiatrist for october,an orthopedic surgeon for november,and a neuropsychologist for december.duarte did attend his first ime as scheduled.thereafter,however,he declined to participate in his two remaining imes.
in fact,on september,two days after calstrs sent duarte its request for imes in this matter duarte had filed a lawsuit in superior court,seeking various forms of mandamus,injunctive,and declaratory relief and alleging an assortment of constitutional violations.in essence,duarte sought an order compelling the state of california to pay him disability benefits.duarte state of california super.alameda county,no.calstrs filed a demurrer on october,arguing,among other things,that calstrs had not yet rendered a decision with respect to duarte disability claim and that duarte had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.on november,the trial court granted the demurrer with leave to amend,noting that duarte had failed to exhaust his administrative claims and that the viability of any constitutional claims appears to be contingent upon completion of the administrative process rather than amend his pleadings,duarte reports that he voluntarily dismissed the litigation based on calstrs representations that he had the right to appeal any calstrs decision at any level.
the next day,november,duarte sent a letter to calstrs requesting a hearing on a laundry list of decisions that calstrs had made in the course of processing his application for benefits,including calstrs incorrect decisions that his ptsd was due to a condition,that prior disability determinations of other california agencies are not binding on calstrs,and that he should attend imes.on november,duarte also sent a letter to benchmark stating that he had appealed his application for calstrs disability benefits,that all matters were stayed,and that there would be no imes until the issues were resolved by an administrative law judge.finally,on november,duarte reiterated his request for a hearing to calstrs,stating basically,i want some authority figure or officer to decide whether a determination of disability by the california employment development department,caldss,and ssa should not bind calstrs because if it does,there will be no need for any more imes.however,if a hearing officer determines otherwise,i will certainly cooperate with any reasonable calstrs request,including imes.
by letter dated november,calstrs informed duarte that the disability decisions of other agencies are not binding on calstrs because the california education code has its own definition of disability along with eligibility and timeliness of application requirements.after noting that it had the statutory authority to order imes pursuant to subdivision b of section,calstrs stressed the need for duarte to reschedule his two remaining imes and noted that failure to do so would cause calstrs to take further action.in response to this letter,duarte sent a note dated december,to benchmark indicating that he had been told by a calstrs attorney that an alj decision might happen by july.the note further stated perhaps imes in august if ordered by an alj.on december,duarte threatened calstrs with further litigation unless he received a hearing as requested.thereafter,on december,calstrs denied duarte application for disability retirement benefits due to his failure to reschedule his ime appointments.in response,duarte requested an immediate alj hearing.
since duarte disagreed with calstrs rejection of his application,the agency forwarded his case to the executive review committee erc in accordance with its usual procedures.on january,the erc upheld the denial of duarte application for benefits.according to the erc,calstrs requested imes pursuant to section,subdivision b,in order to ascertain whether duarte had been continuously incapacitated from performance of service since december and whether he met the calstrs definition of disability.the erc concluded that calstrs was statutorily precluded from approving duarte application for disability benefits because he refused to attend the necessary imes.it further indicated that there was no legal basis for approving duarte application for disability retirement benefits based on the disability determinations of other agencies.because duarte had already formally requested an alj hearing,calstrs indicated that it would be proceeding directly to hearing in the matter.
c.the administrative hearing 
after a number of continuances and voluminous motions and other filings,duarte appeal was finally heard by the alj on january and.representatives of calstrs de fonte and benchmark cotten testified at the hearing regarding the application process for calstrs disability retirement benefits and the ime process,both generally and in this case.with respect to calstrs decision to request that duarte attend imes,de fonte testified we were never certain we had all the records because what would happen would be,new records would come up at different times for duarte.even in the course of one independent medical evaluation that he went to,he brought a set of records that he never provided to us.that we had requested any and all records,new records came up all the time.de fonte further testified w e got records that supported one picture.we did get all of the records.we might get,first,a deposition where we only receive certain pages of the deposition,not the full deposition.we did ever get the full picture of things.thus,the decision was made to have our own evaluation done to determine to,kind of,get to the bottom of the line to get to the bottom answer.de fonte also noted that duarte case review was complicated by the fact that it involved a very specific law which required not just that duarte be disabled,but also that his disability be a direct result of an unlawful act.finally,since calstrs law required that a member be continuously incapacitated and duarte had applied for benefits five years after his injury,i t was important to have a clear picture of what his condition is today,as well as the years in between.with respect to the actual scheduling of the imes,cotten testified for benchmark that her impression from her communications with duarte was that he was unwilling to proceed with the remaining imes until after an alj decision in the matter.
duarte,for his part,argued that the prior disability determinations by other state agencies should be controlling,that calstrs interpretation of section,subdivision b,constituted an impermissible underground regulation in violation of the administrative procedures act,and that he never indicated that he would not attend the imes.in addition,as stated above,a representative from the uc testified regarding the process for forgiving duarte two student loans based on his claim of disability.duarte,himself,testified regarding the medical evaluations and treatment that he had participated in since the december incident.
on april,the alj issued a proposed decision upholding calstrs denial of duarte application for disability benefits.specifically,the alj found that calstrs does not accept disability findings by other agencies as controlling and that neither caldss nor the uc has a special relationship with calstrs,other than each being a governmental agency.with respect to the imes ordered in this case pursuant to section,subdivision b,the alj found no ambiguity in the language of that statute which empowers calstrs to conduct its own ime examinations,and compels calstrs to deny an application for disability benefits when the applicant has refused to submit to such an examination.indeed,according to the alj,the legislature has made compliance with a request to submit to an ime by calstrs part of the applicant obligation to provide medical documentation to support a claim of disability.under the present circumstances,the alj concluded that duarte refused to submit to an ime for various reasons,none of which excuse his failure to submit.thus,calstrs had no choice but to deny duarte application.
with respect to the question of the collateral estoppel effect to be given to the disability determinations of other administrative agencies,the alj determined that such an inquiry is relevant only to the factual question of duarte disability.since the issue of duarte disability was never determined by calstrs due to duarte refusal to complete his imes,the alj did not reach the collateral estoppel issue.however,the alj did conclude that using the disability findings of other administrative agencies to somehow exempt duarte from the obligation of submitting to an ime ordered pursuant to section,subdivision b,would directly contravene the plain language of that statute.
subsequently,on june,the appeals committee of the teacher retirement board calstrs board adopted the alj proposed decision as its own,with minor nonsubstantive amendments.the minutes of the appeals committee meeting indicate that the committee requested staff encourage duarte to reapply and submit the necessary documentation.
d.the petition for writ of mandate 
on december,less than a month before the scheduled administrative hearing in this matter duarte had filed a second petition for writ of mandate in alameda county superior court,seeking to compel calstrs to award him disability benefits and advancing many of the same arguments presented to the alj,as well as numerous other constitutional,contractual,and equitable claims.on december,duarte requested that the trial court stay the administrative proceedings,but no action was taken by the court and thus,as described above,the alj hearing went forward as scheduled on january and.duarte filed a supplement to his writ petition on january,which detailed his many claims of error with respect to the alj decision ultimately adopted by calstrs.thereafter,in september,the parties stipulated to the contents of the administrative record.and,on september,duarte,through new counsel,filed his amended petition for peremptory writ of administrative mandamus writ petition,the operative pleading in these proceedings.ct 
after briefing and argument,the trial court issued its judgment and statement of decision on february,denying duarte writ petition.specifically,the trial judge held that the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that calstrs properly rejected duarte application for disability retirement because he failed to appear for the imes ordered pursuant to subdivision b of section.the trial court also determined that duarte did not qualify for disability benefits under section,subdivision a which requires at least five years of service credit because his three years of leave from susd did not count as creditable service.with respect to the issue of collateral estoppel,the court found that cdss and the uc are not in privity with calstrs regarding their respective disability determinations and that the standards for disability among the three agencies differ.on this basis,the trial court concluded that the prior disability determinations of cdss and the uc do not act through collateral estoppel to preclude calstrs from making an independent disability determination under the facts of this case.the trial court finally held that the weight of the evidence supported the conclusion that duarte received a fair hearing and that calstrs followed appropriate procedures in reaching its final determination on duarte application.
duarte filed a motion for a new trial on march,challenging the court conclusion that his three years of susd leave did not count as years of creditable service for purposes of eligibility under section,subdivision a.in addition,duarte claimed that his failure to attend imes was a separate issue from his eligibility under section,subdivision c,and that the court should have found him eligible under that statute.on april,the trial court denied duarte motion.duarte filed his notice of appeal the next day.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
judicial review of the denial of calstrs disability benefits is governed by the administrative mandate process set forth in section of the code of civil procedure see welch state teachers retirement system th,welch.when a mandamus proceeding challenges an administrative decision affecting a fundamental vested right such as the right to disability retirement benefits at issue here,the trial court must independently review the agency findings to determine if they are supported by the weight of the evidence.welch,supra,th at see also code civ,section,subd.c in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.in doing so,however,the court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings,and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.lagrone city of oakland th,lagrone.
on appeal from a decision of a trial court applying its independent judgment,we review the trial court findings rather than those of the administrative agency.calderon anderson th,calderon.specifically,we review the trial court factual findings for substantial evidence.in doing so,we must resolve all conflicts in favor of calstrs,the party prevailing below.further,we can not reweigh the evidence.thus,we do not determine whether substantial evidence would have supported a contrary judgment,but only whether substantial evidence supports the judgment actually made by the trial court.natalie state of health care services th,see also lagrone,supra,th at.in sum,t he question on appeal is whether the evidence reveals substantial support contradicted or uncontradicted for the trial court conclusion that the weight of the evidence supports the agency findings of fact.citation.we uphold the trial court findings unless they so lack evidentiary support that they are unreasonable.breslin city and county of san francisco th,breslin.
with respect to issues of law,in contrast,our review is de novo.breslin,supra,th at.in this regard,we acknowledge that calstrs interpretation of its governing statutes is entitled to great weight and deference.see calderon,supra,th at.nevertheless,s tatutory interpretation is a clear question of law for our determination anew on appeal.breslin,supra,th at.
statutory scheme governing calstrs disability retirement benefits 
calstrs was created by the legislature in as a retirement system for credentialed california teachers and administrators in kindergarten through community college.see et.teachers retirement law ct the calstrs board is responsible for the administration of calstrs,including implementation of the state teachers retirement plan plan,and shall set policy and shall have the sole power and authority to hear and determine all facts pertaining to application for benefits under the plan or any matters pertaining to administration of the plan or calstrs,subd.a see,subd.a see also calstrs board may delegate powers to a committee.the calstrs board has fiduciary obligations both statutory and constitutional to soundly administer the plan and maintain its fiscal integrity.see providing that calstrs board must discharge its duties under the teachers retirement law solely in the interest of the members and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and defraying administrative expenses see also cal,art.xvi,and subd.b n otwithstanding any other provisions of law,a retirement board for a public pension or retirement system must discharge its duties solely in the interest of,and for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to,participants and their beneficiaries,minimizing employer contributions thereto,and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.
the constitutional obligations of a public retirement board such as the calstrs board have been interpreted to include a duty to ensure the rights of members and retirees to their full,earned benefits.city of pleasanton board of administration th,italics added.such obligations therefore do not permit the payment of benefits not otherwise authorized.ibid.rather,the statutory scheme governs the scope of the benefits earned.chaidez board of administration th.thus,while p ension provisions should be broadly construed in favor of those who were intended to be benefited thereby,they can not be construed so as to confer benefits on persons not entitled thereto.id.at.with this in mind,we consider the statutes governing duarte claim for disability benefits in this case.
for purposes of the calstrs disability retirement program,disability is defined as any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is permanent or that can be expected to last continuously for at least months,measured from the onset of the disability,but no earlier than the day following the last day of actual performance of service that prevents a member from performing the member usual duties for the member employer,the member usual duties for the member employer with reasonable modifications,or the duties of a comparable level position for which the member is qualified or can become qualified within a reasonable period of time by education,training,or experience.essentially,a person is disabled under this statutory definition if the person is unable to perform his or her regular duties or comparable duties with reasonable accommodation and that inability is permanent or expected to last at least a year from the date of onset.welch,supra,th at.
the teachers retirement law,however,contains additional eligibility requirements for obtaining disability retirement benefits.generally speaking,for example,a member may only apply for disability retirement if that member has five or more years of credited service and meets a number of listed criteria,subd.a.most relevant to the present case are the requirements that at least four years of service were credited for actual service performed including certain periods where the member was receiving workers compensation that the last five years of credited service were performed in california and that the application is not based on a condition,subd.a.
the requirement that an eligible member must have performed at least four years of actual service is relaxed if such lack of actual service is due to an injury or disease while engaged in employment,subd.b.under such circumstances,a member may take advantage of additional credit purchased under the teachers retirement law for certain specified activities,including military service,teaching in the peace corps,and as is relevant here t ime spent on a sabbatical leave,approved by an employer in this state after meeting the requirements of section,subd.a.currently,in order for sabbatical leave to be creditable,a member must have previously rendered seven years of consecutive service and have agreed in writing to provide a period of service equal to twice the period of the leave upon return from the leave.
further,a member that meets the special eligibility requirements of subdivision c of section,is required to have only one year of credited service,a requirement clearly met by duarte in this case,subd.c.specifically,subdivision c provides nothing in subdivision a shall affect the right of a member under this part who has less than five years of credited service to a disability retirement allowance if the following conditions are met the member has at least one year of credited service performed in this state.the disability is a direct result of an unlawful act of bodily injury that was perpetrated on his or her person by another human being while the member was performing his or her official duties in a position subject to coverage under the defined benefit program.the member provides documentation of the unlawful act in the form of an official police report or official employer incident report,subd.c.
even if otherwise eligible for disability benefits,however,a member must also meet the application timing requirements set forth in section.as is relevant here,that section provides as follows a the board may authorize payment of a disability retirement allowance under this part to any member who is qualified upon application by the member,the member guardian or conservator,or the member employer,if the application is submitted on a properly executed form prescribed by the system during any one of the following periods while the member is employed and has performed creditable service within the four months previous to application,or while the member is on a compensated leave of absence.while the member is physically or mentally incapacitated for performance of service and the incapacity has been continuous from the last day of actual performance of service for which compensation is payable to the member.within four months after the termination of the member employment subject to coverage under the defined benefit program,if the application was not made under paragraph and was not made more than four months after the last day of actual performance of service for which compensation is payable to the member,italics added.in addition,subdivision b of section reiterates that a member is not qualified to receive a disability retirement allowance if the member is applying because of a physical or mental condition that existed at the time the most recent membership in the defined benefit program commenced and which remains substantially unchanged at the time of application.thus,in order to meet the requirements of section,duarte would need to establish both that his disability was not attributable to a condition and that he was continuously disabled from the december incident until the february filing of his application for benefits.
finally,in order to establish eligibility to the satisfaction of calstrs,an applicant for disability benefits must comply with the documentation requirements set forth in sections and.pursuant to section subdivision a,e ach member and beneficiary shall furnish to the board any information affecting his or her status as a member or beneficiary of the defined benefit program as the board requires,which may include,but shall not be limited to,the following financial statements,certified copies of state and federal income tax records,or evidence of financial status.employment,legal,or medical documentation.additionally,section provides in relevant part as follows a the member shall provide medical documentation substantiating the impairment qualifying the member for the disability retirement under this part.b on receipt of an application for disability retirement under this part,the system may order a medical examination or review of medical documentation of a member to determine whether the member is incapacitated for performance of service.the medical examination or review of medical documentation shall be conducted by a practicing physician,selected by the board,with expertise in the member impairment,and the board shall pay all costs associated with the examination or review of medical documentation.if the member refuses to submit to the required medical examination or review of medical documentation,the application for disability retirement shall be rejected c the system may reject the disability retirement application under this part if the member fails to provide requested medical documentation to substantiate a disability,as defined in section,within days from the date of the request or within days from the time that a legally designated representative is empowered to act on behalf of a member who is mentally or physically incapacitated,subd.a,b c,italics added.thus,based on the plain language of section,calstrs has broad discretion to order an ime in a particular case,but no choice other than to reject an application if a member refuses to submit to an ime request from calstrs.
failure to complete section b medical examination s 
in this case,as detailed above,calstrs requested that duarte submit to imes pursuant to section,subdivision b,on september.specifically,duarte was ordered to attend three imes,one with an orthopedic surgeon,one with a neuropsychiatrist,and one with a neuropsychologist.the trial court concluded that t he weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that calstrs acted within its discretion by ordering duarte to take medical examinations.we agree.
first,the record supports the conclusion that,despite repeated requests,calstrs had not received all of the documentation that it had requested from duarte and that some of the documents submitted were incomplete.further,the documentation that was provided raised issues regarding the scope of duarte disability and the possibility of cognitive psychological deficits which the december incident.finally,because duarte filed his application for disability benefits many years after the termination of his employment,his application was only timely under section,subdivision a,if he could prove that he was continuously incapacitated from his last day of service december,until his application filing date february.thus,it was important to have a clear picture of duarte condition in february,almost a year after his last evaluation.given the broad discretion afforded to calstrs when evaluating applications for disability benefits,these facts were certainly sufficient to support calstrs decision to seek its own medical evaluations to as the calstrs representative put it get to the bottom answer in this case.
the trial court further concluded that t he weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that calstrs properly rejected duarte application for disability retirement because he failed to appear for the medical examinations.again,we agree.although,admittedly,duarte did not state that he would never attend further imes,he failed to attend the last two imes scheduled and indicated a willingness to reschedule only if ordered to do so at some point in the future by the alj.since duarte was entitled to administrative review of his case only after calstrs had actually acted upon his application,duarte position was tantamount to a refusal to supply the information necessary for calstrs to make a reasoned disability determination.under such circumstances,the plain language of section,subdivision b,mandated that calstrs reject his claim 
duarte repeated reliance on the doctrine of collateral estoppel to justify his actions does not change this analysis or our conclusions.specifically,duarte asserts that the issue of his disability had already been conclusively determined in prior administrative proceedings before caldss and the uc.thus,he argues,calstrs should have deemed duarte disability a settled issue under the doctrine of collateral estoppel and approved his application for disability retirement.however,as the alj properly found in this case,calstrs never even reached the issue of duarte disability.rather,his application was rejected on procedural grounds.thus,there was simply no need to consider any possible preclusive effect of these prior disability determinations in the context of this case.
moreover,to the extent duarte is contending that notions of collateral estoppel provide him with some kind of exemption from the process for the award of calstrs disability benefits,we believe his argument misapprehends the nature and scope of the doctrine.at its most fundamental,i ssue preclusion,or collateral estoppel,precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.city of oakland oakland police fire retirement system th,italics added.thus,until there has actually been a determination made that is adverse to an issue previo
