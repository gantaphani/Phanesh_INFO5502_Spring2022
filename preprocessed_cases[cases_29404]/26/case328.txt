opinion of the court 
in this interlocutory appeal,the defendant appeals the district court denial of a motion for summary judgment in a section action where the defendant asserted the defense of qualified immunity.what is unusual here is the setting a public university.in an amended complaint,a tenured professor alleged that he was suspended from teaching a class after he refused the university president instruction to change a student grade and that he was discharged after submitting a written criticism of the president to be presented to the university board of trustees.according to the complaint,these were acts of retaliation which violated the professor rights to academic freedom and free speech protected by the first amendment.we conclude that the amended complaint did not allege deprivations of constitutional rights and that summary judgment should have been granted.we therefore will reverse the portion of the district court judgment that dealt with these issues and remand for the district court to enter summary judgment for the defendant university president.
when an appellate court reviews the denial of a defendant claim to qualified immunity,the appealable issue is a purely legal one whether the facts alleged support a claim of violation of clearly established law.mitchell forsyth,d resolving the legal issues,however,requires consideration of the factual allegations that make up the plaintiff claim for relief.id.at.for this reason,we present the facts as they have been alleged by the plaintiff and do not concern ourselves with weighing the correctness of the plaintiff version.id.our review is plenary.abbott latshaw,cir.
for years,plaintiff robert brown was employed as a professor at california university of pennsylvania he has been tenured since.at the conclusion of the spring semester,the plaintiff assigned an f,or failing,grade to one of his students in a practicum course because the student had attended only three of fifteen class sessions.defendant angelo armenti,the university president,ordered that the grade be changed to incomplete,but the plaintiff refused.
the plaintiff alleged that,as a result of his refusal,the university suspended him from teaching the course.he further contended that a s a result of this and other matters,the plaintiff wrote a critical review of defendant armenti for presentation to the university board of trustees.two years later,the university terminated the plaintiff employment.
the plaintiff then filed a complaint in a pennsylvania state court,naming armenti and other individuals or entities as defendants.the complaint alleged violations of state law as well as of federal and state constitutional law.pursuant to d,the case was removed to the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania by the time the district court considered the motion for summary judgment now before us,the only claims remaining for disposition were federal civil rights violations alleged against several defendants including armenti,and a civil rights retaliation claim against armenti alone.count v in the complaint stated the retaliation claim against armenti 
defendant armenti retaliated against plaintiff because plaintiff refused to change a student grade at the order of defendant armenti,in violation of plaintiff right to academic free expression,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
defendant armenti retaliated against plaintiff for plaintiff critical review of defendant armenti for the board of trustees in violation of plaintiff right to free speech under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
the district court granted summary judgment as to all the claims except for those in count v.the district court denied defendant armenti motion for summary judgment as to the count v claims,concluding that both the plaintiff criticism of armenti and the plaintiff assignment of student grades were protected speech under the first amendment.the district court did not address the defendant claim to qualified immunity.the defendant filed a timely appeal,asserting again that qualified immunity provides him a defense to the count v claims.
the doctrine of qualified immunity establishes that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.this doctrine is founded upon the recognized need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.id.at.internal quotations and citation omitted.
we have held that the defendant is entitled to the defense of qualified immunity if none of the following questions can be answered in the affirmative have the plaintiffs alleged a violation of their statutory or constitutional rights was the right alleged to have been violated clearly established in the existing law at the time of the violation and should a reasonable official have known that the alleged action violated the plaintiffs rights.rouse plantier,cir.the of the inquiry serves to filter unfounded claims and promotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct,to the benefit of both the officers and the general public.wilson layne,d citing county of sacramento lewis,d siegert gilley,d decision of the purely legal immunity question s permits courts expeditiously to weed out suits which fail the test without requiring a defendant who rightly claims qualified immunity to engage in expensive and time consuming preparation to defend the suit on its merits.we turn,therefore,to the question of whether first amendment rights were violated 
the supreme court has held that the first amendment prohibits the government from regulating speech based upon its substantive content or the message it conveys.rosenberger rector and visitors of university of virginia,d.here,we must consider whether the alleged actions of the defendant,the president of a public university,had the effect of discouraging speech with a disfavored message and,therefore,amounted to an improper conditioning of public employment.the plaintiff has alleged two acts of retaliation and two theories supporting first amendment protection of his speech.first,he asserts that retaliation following the plaintiff refusal to change the grade violated a right to academic free expression under the first amendment.second,the plaintiff contends that the defendant firing him for submitting a written criticism violated the generalized free speech rights under the first amendment.we will consider these arguments in turn.
employees of federal and state government do not relinquish their first amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest as a condition of their government employment.pickering board of education,d.nor do students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines school district,d.furthermore,the supreme court has held that the university setting is one in which first amendment free speech protections in that context are of particular importance 
the essentiality of freedom in the community of american universities is almost.no one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth.to impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our nation.

these statements notwithstanding,there are recognized limitations upon free speech in the university setting.for example,we held in edwards california university of pennsylvania,cir,that a public university professor does not have a first amendment right to decide what will be taught in the classroom.
in edwards,a university professor alleged a violation of his first amendment rights when the school disciplined him after a series of disputes with the administration over course curriculum.id.at.we concluded that no violation occurred because in the classroom,the university was the speaker and the professor was the agent of the university for first amendment purposes.id.at.in support of this conclusion,the edwards opinion quoted from the supreme court opinion in rosenberger 
w hen the state is the speaker,it may make choices.when the university determines the content of the education it provides,it is the university speaking,and we have permitted the government to regulate the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message it does not follow,however,that restrictions are proper when the university does not speak itself or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.a holding that the university may not discriminate based on viewpoint of private persons whose speech it facilitates does not restrict the university own speech,which is controlled by different principles.
id.at quoting rosenberger,d.
edwards distinguished the rights of a professor in the classroom from those out of the classroom.id.at.in the classroom refers to those settings where the professor is acting as the university proxy,fulfilling one of the functions involved in the university four essential freedoms choosing who may teach,what may be taught,how it shall be taught,and who may be admitted to study.id.at citing regents of of california bakke,d.because grading is pedagogic,the assignment of the grade is subsumed under the university freedom to determine how a course is to be taught.we therefore conclude that a public university professor does not have a first amendment right to expression via the school grade assignment procedures.
the plaintiff argument to the contrary relies upon the analysis adopted by the court of appeals for the sixth circuit in parate isibor,cir.in parate,a professor was forced to sign a memorandum changing a student grade.id.at.he was not permitted to note on the document that the change was per instructions from the dean id.the court held that a professor first amendment right was violated because the assignment of a letter grade is a symbolic communication intended to send a specific message to the student and is entitled to some measure of first amendment protection.id.at citing tinker,at.the court concluded that the university was the speaker only as far as the grade on the student transcript.id.at.
the edwards framework,however,applies to the present case and offers a more realistic view of the relationship.whether the school registrar is told that a student performance rates an f or an incomplete is not a matter that warrants the intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment.connick myers,d wozniak conry,cir some universities offer their faculty more control over grading than in this case and maybe discretion is good.but competition among systems of evaluation at different universities,not federal judges,must settle the question which approach is best.we note that our holding today is consistent with at least one other court of appeals.see lovelace southeastern massachusetts university,cir per curiam.
in his second argument,the plaintiff asserts that retaliation following his submission of a critical evaluation violated his free speech rights under the first amendment.when resolving such disputes,courts must strike a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon the matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees when determining whether a public employer acted properly in discharging an employee for engaging in speech.pickering,at.the threshold question in this analysis is whether the employee speech may fairly be characterized as a matter of public concern.rankin mcpherson,d.
in connick myers,a district attorney fired an assistant district attorney for distributing a questionnaire to fellow staff members.at.the survey sought staff views on the office transfer policy,office morale,the need for a grievance committee,the level of confidence in supervisors,and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.id.
the court reiterated the balancing described in pickering,this time addressing a single question in the analysis whether the subject of the employee expression was a matter of legitimate public concern upon which free and open debate is vital to informed by the electorate.id.at.quoting pickering,at.the court reasoned that if the employee speech 
can not be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern,it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge.when employee expression can not be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices,without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment.
id.at.internal footnote omitted.the court pointed to the standard applied in the common law tort for invasion of privacy as the correct standard to apply when determining whether an expression is of a kind that is of legitimate concern to the public.id.at.citing cox broadcasting cohn,d.the cox standard for determining whether a topic is a legitimate matter of public concern is functional,asking whether there is a public benefit in reporting the matter.at.
in connick,the court concluded that w hether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.id.at.the court concluded that all but one of the questions on the survey dealt with the individual employee dispute with the district attorney and were not of public import in evaluating the performance of the district attorney as an elected official.id.at.because the questionnaire concerned matters of public interest in only a most limited sense t he limited first amendment interest involved here does not require that the employer tolerate action which he reasonably believed would disrupt the office,undermine his authority,and destroy close working relationships.id.at.
four years later,in rankin mcpherson the supreme court considered the question again whether a statement by an employee that led to her firing was a matter of public concern.at.the employee in rankin worked in a constable office and had remarked after hearing of an attempt on the life of the president,if they go for him again,i hope they get him.id.at.in determining the public concern threshold test,the court reasoned that because the statement was made in the context of a discussion about the policies of the president administration,and because it was said following a news bulletin of national interest,it plainly dealt with a matter of public concern.id.at.
whether the subject matter of the speech was a legitimate matter of public concern is a question of law.connick,at.the fact that the matter now on appeal is a legal issue distinguishes the present interlocutory appeal from that in johnson jones,d.in deciding johnson,the court resolved a circuit split in the courts of appeals about the immediate appealability of pretrial evidence insufficiency claims made by public official defendants who assert qualified immunity defenses.johnson,at.although there is some broad language in johnson that might suggest the court foreclosed any consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence when courts of appeals review summary judgment motions,the court limited the holding in at least two ways.first,it noted that the decision did not change the law for many courts of appeals johnson,at.observing that our holding here has been the law in several circuits for some time and referring to a listing of cases that included giuffre bissell,cir.second,the court acknowledged that where a district court does not clearly state facts relevant to a question of law,it might be appropriate for a court of appeals to
