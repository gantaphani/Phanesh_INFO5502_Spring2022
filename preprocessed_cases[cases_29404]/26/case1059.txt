in this appeal we consider,inter alia,whether the district court properly granted summary judgment on john hensala claims that the united states air force educational recoupment policy violated his constitutional rights.we conclude that genuine issues of fact preclude summary judgment as to some of the claims,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
since,the uniform code of military justice has criminalized sex between service members of the same gender and provided that such conduct is an offense punishable by court martial.in,congress enacted the do ask,do tell policy,codified at b,which limits the basis under which a service member will be ordered separated from the armed services for violations of.in particular,the do ask,do tell policy enumerated five exceptions under which evidence of a violation will not lead to discharge,see b and provided that if a service member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual,or words to that effect,a presumption arises that the member violated,but the presumption can be rebutted by evidence of celibacy.see b.
this general policy has been incorporated into the administration of the armed forces health professional scholarship program the scholarship program,a national program that provides an individual with financial assistance for expenses arising from his medical education in exchange for an enforceable commitment to serve on active duty as a physician for a specified period of time.pursuant to,the secretaries of each branch of the military may require a scholarship contract to provide that if such person,voluntarily or because of misconduct,fails to complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement such person will reimburse the united states proportionately to the unserved duty.
on may,deputy secretary of defense john deutch issued a memorandum the deutch memo interpreting in light of the do ask,do tell policy.as relevant here,the deutch memo provided that although a service member statement of sexual orientation,sometimes referred to as a coming out statement,when not offset by evidence of celibacy,is sufficient for grounds of separation from the armed forces,such a statement is insufficient to constitute a basis for recoupment.the deutch memo indicated that recoupment would be appropriate where,based on the circumstances,it is determined that the member made the statement for the purpose of seeking separation.the parties concede that,for the purposes of the instant case,the deutch memo reflects the operative recoupment policy of the united states air force.
hensala is a physician and former air force reserve captain.prior to his entry into medical school,hensala applied for and became a recipient of the scholarship program.after executing a contract implementing the terms of the scholarship program,hensala began pursuing his medical education at northwestern university medical school.
the contract at issue contained a provision that hensala would reimburse any money expended on his behalf in the event that he fails to complete the period of active duty due to voluntary separation for any reason or involuntary separation for specified reasons.in particular,the contract provided that 
if i fail to complete the period of the active duty required by this agreement because of voluntary separation for any reason,conscientious objector,pregnancy,or involuntary separation because of substandard duty performance,misconduct homosexuality,moral or professional dereliction,or because retention is not clearly consistent with the interest of national security,i will reimburse the united states in one lump sum for the total cost of advanced education.
in,hensala graduated from northwestern university medical school,and pursuant to the terms of the contract,was appointed captain of the air force reserve,medical corps.hensala requested and received two deferments of active duty for the purpose of completing a psychiatric residency and a fellowship in child psychiatry.
in,the air force notified hensala that his active duty would commence in and requested the completion of a physical examination,a prerequisite to his appointment to active duty.on december,hensala sent a letter to colonel daniel degracias of the air force directorate of medical service officer management informing the colonel that i am gay and that i do not believe this will affect my ability to serve in the air force as a child psychiatrist the air force did not send a direct response to hensala at this time.
hensala completed his physical examination in january.in april,he was ordered to commence active duty at scott air force base,located in kansas,on june.
in approximately april or may,hensala called his supervisor and commanding officer,lieutenant colonel jay weiss,and informed him that he was gay and intended to live with his partner when stationed at scott air force base.according to hensala,colonel weiss responded that such an arrangement was acceptable as long as hensala neither brought his partner to the housing office nor publicized their relationship.
also in the spring of,major albert klein contacted hensala and informed him that he had been appointed to serve as hensala counsel in the investigation of hensala statements regarding his sexual orientation.major klein allegedly advised hensala to provide a list of references who could confirm his sexual orientation.hensala complied by providing a list of organizations and individuals.major klein forwarded this list to colonel rockne buraglio,a reserve judge advocate.in june,the air force suspended hensala orders to report to active duty.
in august,the air force appointed colonel buraglio as the investigating officer over the matter.colonel buraglio conducted a recorded interview with hensala who was represented by counsel.at this interview,hensala explained that in,he realized he was gay,and at that time,he informed only a small number of close friends of his sexual orientation.over time,he became more comfortable with his sexual orientation,and in,he realized he could no longer conceal his sexual orientation from and supervisors.hensala contended he was motivated to inform the air force of his sexual orientation because of his growing comfort with it and his increased discomfort with keeping his orientation a secret.
hensala also asserted that at the time he contacted colonel degracias,he was not aware of the recoupment policy,and that his attorney and media were the sources of his understanding of the armed forces do ask,do tell policy.at the close of the interview,hensala reaffirmed his desire to serve on active duty.
in january,colonel buraglio sent a letter to the air reserve personnel center reporting his findings from the investigation,which included a conclusion that hensala informed the air force of his sexual orientation for the purpose of avoiding active duty.colonel buraglio thus recommended that the air force discharge hensala and seek recoupment pursuant to the operative regulations.
in february,the air force informed hensala of its intention to discharge him and seek recoupment because he had made a personal statement regarding a propensity for homosexual conduct for the purpose of obtaining separation.on may,hensala informed the air force of his decision not to tender his resignation and waived an opportunity to contest the air force recommendation for discharge at an administrative proceeding on the basis that such a hearing would be futile.
on june,the air force reserve personnel center forwarded the hensala case to the air force personnel council with a recommendation of discharge and recoupment.on october,the personnel council voted unanimously to follow such recommendation.on november,the secretary of the air force discharged hensala pursuant to and ordered recoupment in the amount of pursuant to.
on august,hensala petitioned the air force board for correction of military records corrections board to rescind the recoupment order,but did not challenge the underlying discharge.on april,the corrections board issued a written opinion denying the petition.
hensala filed an action with the district court,alleging that the recoupment order violated the administrative procedure act,apa procedural due process under the fifth amendment equal protection under the fourteenth amendment and his first amendment right to freedom of speech.in response to discovery,the air force provided a list of all of the medical doctors and students separated from the air force between the time that the deutch memo was written and the time this action was commenced.the list provides the reason for each service member discharge,whether recoupment was sought,and whether the secretary of the air force found the separation voluntary.as relevant here,of the situations in which a service member made a statement of sexual orientation,the air force ordered recoupment in out of the cases.in the separation cases that did not involve a coming out statement,recoupment was ordered times.
on may,the district court reviewed the record in its entirety and granted the air force motion for summary judgment with respect to all four claims and denied hensala request for further discovery on the apa and due process claims.hensala timely appealed.we ordered the submission of this case deferred pending the united states supreme court decision in lawrence texas,d.
we review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo.see oliver keller,cir.we must determine whether,when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable toward the nonmoving party,there are any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.at.we may not weigh evidence or determine the truth of the matter,but rather,we limit our inquiry into whether genuine issues exist for trial.see balint carson city,cir en banc.we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal pursuant to.
hensala alleges that the district court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to his apa claim in light of the fact that hensala made a clear statement of intent to serve on active duty.
under the apa,a federal court may set aside an agency decision only if it is demonstrated to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see.cattle growers ass united states fish wildlife,cir.if the evidence contained in the administrative record is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency.see edlund massanari,cir reddick chater,cir.
here,the district court did not err in concluding that substantial evidence supports both the secretary initial decision to seek recoupment and the corrections board affirmance.colonel buraglio undertook an extensive investigation,conducted an interview,made a credibility determination,and prepared a report with his written findings.both colonel buraglio and the corrections board relied upon these findings in concluding that hensala informed the air force of his sexual orientation for the purpose of separating.despite the existence of other reasonable interpretations of the evidence,colonel buraglio conclusion is supported by inferences drawn from the timing of hensala disclosure and colonel buraglio credibility determination.further,colonel buraglio and the corrections board conclusions appear to fit squarely in the language of the deutch memo.because a federal court may not substitute its judgment under these circumstances,the district court properly rejected hensala contention that the decision lacked an adequate factual foundation.see edlund,at affirming an alj resolution of competing testimony in light of its provision of specific and legitimate reasons for its decision.
hensala also advances two legal claims against the air force decision.first,hensala argues that because the deutch memo provides that the member made the statement for the purpose of seeking separation,recoupment is proper only if a statement of sexual orientation is made with knowledge that the statement will result in separation.hensala argues that because colonel buraglio did not make findings involving hensala knowledge on this matter,his recommendation is incomplete,contrary to hensala clear statement of intent to serve,and thus insufficient to meet the deutch memo standard.however,as the district court correctly noted,there is nothing in or the deutch memo that limits a finding of purpose to a finding of specific awareness regarding the consequences as coming out as advanced by hensala.thus,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this matter.
second,after lawrence was decided,hensala alleges that the recoupment policy violates the apa because is contrary to a constitutional right pursuant to b.hensala first raised this argument after lawrence texas,d,was decided.because the claim has not been presented to the district court,we decline to address it on appeal.balser dep t of justice,cir.we do not,of course,preclude the parties from pursuing this claim on remand.
hensala contends that the air force violated due process by presuming that any statement declaring his sexual orientation constitutes an irrebuttable finding of a service member intent to separate.hensala alleges that despite a written policy providing for individualized findings,the air force applies its recoupment policy to all service members who make coming out statements.hensala contends that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on this claim and abused its discretion in denying his related discovery request because material issues of fact exist and,when viewed most favorably toward hensala,a reasonable could resolve them in his favor.
the recoupment policy on its face provides for an individualized investigation and hearing,and does not deny a service member an opportunity to present evidence as to the question of intent to separate.vlandis kline,d striking down policy that denied applicants an opportunity to prove whether they were residents of connecticut.further,as applied to hensala,the record demonstrates that the air force provided an investigation and hearing in which hensala presented evidence that he did not come out for the purpose of separating from the air force.
as applied to other service members,the record demonstrates that in an approximate six year window,the air force ordered recoupment in of the cases that involved a service member who announced his or her sexual orientation.the district court analyzed the findings of these cases,as characterized by each of the parties,and concluded that the air force made individualized determinations with respect to each service member intent to separate.
even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable toward hensala,the record demonstrates that the air force orders recoupment after individualized determinations of intent and does not,in policy or in practice,circumvent the investigation by applying an irrebuttable presumption.any further evidence relating to situations in which recoupment was ordered does not undercut the demonstrated individualized practices employed by the air force.accordingly,the district court neither erred in granting summary judgment on this claim nor abused its discretion in denying further discovery or denying hensala rule f motion relating to the air forces practices towards other service members who make coming out statements.see carlson reed,cir holding that a university presumption that certain immigrants are nonresidents did not violate due process because individuals subject to the policy had an opportunity to present proof of residency chance teletrac,cir holding that a district court abuses its discretion in denying a rule f motion if movant can demonstrate that additional discovery would have precluded summary judgment.
hensala alleges that the air force violated his rights to equal protection and free speech because his status as a gay man,rather than any misconduct,triggered the recoupment policy.the district court rejected this argument,holding that holmes california army national guard,cir foreclosed consideration of these claims.
holmes involved two service members constitutional challenges to b,the do ask,do tell policy.at.holmes held that the statute did not v
