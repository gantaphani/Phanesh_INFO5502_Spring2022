cary cliff appeals the district court denial of his motion for class certification.cliff brought this class action against osi collection services,osi,formerly payco general american credits,alleging violations of the federal fair debt collection practices act the fdcpa,et,and the florida consumer collection practices act the florida act.stat.et.the district court concluded that cliff could not satisfy the numerosity requirement for a class action.cliff raises four issues on appeal that could affect the size of the class.because we disagree with the district court resolution of one issue that could affect the size of the class,we vacate the court denial of class certification and remand for further proceedings.
background 
cliff,a florida resident,graduated from law school in and has been a practicing attorney since he financed his college and law school education in part through student loans,and after he completed his education,he consolidated his federal student loans through a consolidation program administered by sallie mae servicing corporation sallie mae.his consolidation loan was guaranteed by great lakes higher education guaranty corporation great lakes.
in,cliff failed to make the required payments on his consolidation loan,and his loan formally entered default in november of.sallie mae assigned his loan to great lakes,the guarantor,and the loan was serviced on great lakes behalf by osi collection services.cliff contacted osi and agreed to enter a repayment rehabilitation program,but he failed to make any payments on his loan from to because he believed that sallie mae had granted him a forbearance during a prior telephone conversation and because he objected to the assessment of collection fees.cliff does not dispute the unpaid principal amount of the debt,which was approximately at the time of default.
on october,osi issued a notice prior to wage withholding to cliff.the notice showed that cliff owed and stated that if cliff did not enter into a new written repayment arrangement with osi by november,osi would issue a garnishment order requiring cliff employer to begin withholding and paying over his wages pursuant to the provisions of the higher education act hea,et.
under the wage garnishment provision of the hea,a guaranty agency may garnish the disposable pay of a debtor to collect the amount owed if the debtor has failed to make payments required under a repayment agreement.a.debtors who are subject to garnishment are statutorily entitled to a hearing concerning the existence or the amount of the debt and,in certain cases,concerning the terms of the repayment schedule.id.a.if the debtor requests a hearing on or before the day following the mailing of the notice,a hearing must be provided before a garnishment order is issued to the debtor employer.id.b.if the debtor requests a hearing more than days after the notice is mailed,however,the debtor is still entitled to a hearing but the hearing need not be conducted before garnishment begins.id.
cliff requested a hearing,but there is a dispute as to whether he requested a hearing within days of receiving the notice on december,osi sent a letter to cliff stating that his request for a hearing was denied,though the hea does not expressly authorize the denial of a hearing request.the letter stated that cliff wages would be garnished if he did not make other arrangements to make payments on the debt.he did not make any payments,and in january of,osi served a garnishment order on his employer.cliff employer began withholding per week in february of,and his employer continues to withhold and pay over his wages pursuant to the order of garnishment.
ii.procedural history 
on december,cliff filed suit against osi cliff alleges that osi garnished his wages in a manner that violates the wage garnishment provision of the hea,a,b.based on the alleged hea violations,cliff sought damages and injunctive relief from osi under both the federal fair debt collection practices act and the florida consumer collection practices act 
from the genesis of this lawsuit,cliff sought to proceed as a class action plaintiff under.but the definition of the class which cliff sought to represent changed three times during the litigation.in his original complaint of december,cliff limited his class to florida residents but almost seven months later,on july,cliff filed an amended complaint which defined two distinct classes a class of florida consumers alleging violations of the florida act and a separate class of nationwide consumers alleging violations of the fdcpa and the constitution.these class definitions also reflected the difference between the statute of limitations under the fdcpa and the more generous statute of limitations under florida law on march,cliff filed a motion for class certification asking the court to certify a florida class and a nationwide class.
while cliff motion for class certification was pending,osi filed a motion for summary judgment on the fdcpa claims and the florida act claim.the court granted summary judgment in osi favor on cliff florida act claim.the court concluded that congress enactment of the hea expressly preempted state law,and thus precluded cliff and any class members from seeking relief under the florida act.based on this grant of partial summary judgment,the court denied cliff motion to certify a nationwide class and a separate florida class and invited cliff to file an amended motion for class certification.
shortly thereafter,cliff filed another motion for class certification which defined only a nationwide class.he amended the class definition to include 
all student loan debtors 
to whom osi sent a garnishment order or otherwise caused wage garnishment to begin 
and who are shown by osi records to have timely requested a hearing before garnishment 
but who neither received nor waived a hearing,
from december,to the date of certification.
cliff estimated that at least debtors fell within the defined class.in his motion,cliff requested an evidentiary hearing to resolve any factual disputes.
a dispute ensued between cliff and osi regarding the number of individuals who satisfied the criteria for class membership.this dispute revolved around two issues.the first issue was relation back.cliff does not allege that osi violated the wage garnishment provision of the hea after june,but cliff did not purport to represent consumers outside florida until he filed his amended complaint on july.if cliff representation of consumers outside florida does not relate back to the original complaint,all of the fdcpa claims of consumers outside florida are barred by the statute of limitations.
the second issue focused on the term timely in cliff class definition.osi argued that a timely request referred to only those requests made within days of the mailing of the notice.cliff,by contrast,argued that timely requests would include those requests made within days which entitled the debtor to a hearing as well as those requests made after the period but before garnishment began which entitled the debtor to a hearing,but not before garnishment.
after osi filed its response to cliff class certification motion,cliff requested an evidentiary hearing or,in the alternative,leave of the court to file a reply brief.the court granted cliff request to file a reply brief in which he again requested an evidentiary hearing.upon reading cliff reply,the court instructed osi to answer an interrogatory about the number of debtors who satisfied the criteria for class membership to enable the court to determine if class certification was appropriate.based on osi interrogatory answer,cliff contended that debtors fell within the class,while osi contended that only five or,at most,nine debtors fell within the class.cliff also requested either an evidentiary hearing or additional discovery and briefing time.
the court denied cliff request and denied his motion for class certification.the court concluded that the amended complaint did not relate back because the original complaint did not give adequate notice to osi that cliff would be representing a nationwide class and because the relation back would unfairly prejudice osi.as a result,the statute of limitations barred cliff from pursuing any claims on behalf of consumers outside florida.the court also held,based on the complaint and his motion for class certification,that cliff use of timely in the class definition limited the class to persons who requested a hearing within the period.because cliff could not pursue any claims on behalf of consumers outside florida,and because the class was limited to individuals who requested a hearing within the period,the court agreed with osi that the proposed class consisted of no more than nine florida consumers.the court concluded that cliff failed to satisfy the numerosity requirement of.a and denied his motion for class certification.
cliff filed a motion for reconsideration,in which he made yet another request for an evidentiary hearing.he also asked the court to modify the class definition by omitting the word timely.osi,in response,argued that the class definition should not be revised for two reasons cliff can not represent debtors who made requests within days and debtors who made requests after days because he could not satisfy the typicality requirement as to one of the groups,and another change in the class definition would cause further delay and could require the reopening of discovery.the court denied cliff motion for reconsideration upon review,the court concludes that plaintiff does not raise new issues which would convince the court to reverse its prior decision.at.cliff petitioned this court for discretionary interlocutory review under.f,and we agreed to hear his interlocutory appeal.
iii.issues on appeal 
before the district court could certify cliff proposed class,cliff had to demonstrate that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a see franze equitable assurance,cir.the district court concluded that cliff failed to satisfy this numerosity requirement.cliff disagrees,and asks us to consider four issues that potentially affect the size of the class whether the hea preempts the florida consumer collection practices act whether the court abused its discretion when it concluded that cliff amended complaint did not relate back whether the district court erred when it construed timely and whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied cliff requests for an evidentiary hearing and additional discovery.

preemption 
the supremacy clause of article vi of the constitution provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.when we consider issues that arise under the supremacy clause,preemption issues,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not superseded by federal law unless preemption is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.rice santa fe elevator.therefore,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of preemption analysis.retail clerks int l ass n,local schermerhorn,d.
congress intent to preempt state law may be explicitly stated in the language of a federal statute or implicitly contained in the structure and purpose of the statute.jones rath packing,d.bearing in mind this distinction between express and implied preemption,the supreme court has identified three types of preemption express preemption field preemption and conflict preemption.wisconsin public intervenor mortier,d this that the other gift tobacco,cobb county,cir.express preemption occurs when congress has manifested its intent to preempt state law explicitly in the language of the statute.if congress does not explicitly preempt state law,however,preemption still occurs when federal regulation in a legislative field is so pervasive that we can reasonably infer that congress left no room for the states to supplement is known as field preemption or occupying the field.english general,d.and even if congress has neither expressly preempted state law nor occupied the field,state law is preempted when it actually conflicts with federal law.conflict preemption,as it is commonly known,arises in two circumstances when it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law and when state law stands as an obstacle to achieving the objectives of the federal law.crosby foreign trade council,d.
overview of the applicable statutes 
congress enacted the higher education act of to address the pressing need to provide financial assistance to students in higher education.title iv of the hea authorizes the secretary of education to administer several federal student loan and grant programs,including the federal family education loan program the stafford loan program,federal plus loans,federal consolidation loans,and federal perkins loans.under these programs,lenders make guaranteed loans under favorable terms to students and their parents,and these loans are guaranteed by guaranty agencies and ultimately by the federal government.
because the united states guarantees these loans,the secretary of education has an interest in protecting the united states against the risk of unreasonable loss by ensuring that lenders employ due diligence in the collection of these loans.c a.the hea authorizes the secretary of education to promulgate regulations to carry out the purposes of these programs,and these regulations apply to debt collectors such as osi that attempt to collect loans on behalf of lenders and guaranty agencies.see,d a.it comes as no surprise that the secretary has issued several regulations that articulate the standards for diligent collection of student loans.see.for example,after a borrower misses a payment,the lender must send at least one written notice or collection letter to the borrower within days that notifies the borrower of the delinquency.c.if the debtor is still delinquent after days,the lender must send four collection letters to the borrower and make four diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone one telephone contact must occur on or before the day of delinquency,one must occur after the day of delinquency,and at least two of the collection letters must warn the borrower that if the loan is not paid,the default will be reported to all national credit bureaus.d.these are just a few of the due diligence standards promulgated by the secretary of education,and they serve as a guide for lenders,guaranty agencies,and debt collectors engaged in collection efforts.
if these diligent collection activities are unsuccessful,guaranty agencies may seek recourse through a valuable tool that congress has placed at their disposal wage garnishment.according to 
notwithstanding any provision of state law,a guaranty agency may garnish the disposable pay of an individual to collect the amount owed by the individual,if he or she is not currently making required repayment 
a.under the wage garnishment provision of the hea,a guaranty agency may order an employer to withhold up to ten percent of the debtor disposable pay.id.a.the debtor is entitled to notice that the guaranty agency intends to initiate garnishment as well as an opportunity to enter into a new repayment agreement.id.a,a.as previously noted,the debtor is also entitled to a hearing concerning the existence or the amount of the debt and,in some cases,the terms of the repayment schedule,but the timing of this hearing depends upon the timing of the debtor request.id.a,b.
while the hea endows debtors with certain rights during the wage garnishment process,the hea expressly empowers only the secretary of the authority to enforce the hea and rectify hea violations.b.it is that the hea does not expressly provide debtors with a private right of action.mcculloch pnc bank,cir listing cases that found no express private right of action under the hea parks sch.of business,symington,cir there is no express right of action under the hea except for suits brought by or against the secretary of education.and this court recently joined several other circuits when it concluded that the enactment of the hea did not create an implied private right of action.mcculloch,at.
but debtors may be able to seek a remedy through another federal statute,the fair debt collection practices act.the fdcpa applies to debt collectors in general and provides debtors with a remedy for abusive,fraudulent,and deceptive collection practices.the fdcpa sets forth a laundry list of prohibited collection practices,each giving rise to a private right of action under.see.while the hea,standing alone,does not expressly or impliedly authorize a private right of action,the secretary of education has expressed the belief that debt collectors acting on behalf of guaranty agencies to collect federal student loans must comply with the fdcpa.notice of interpretation,stafford loan,supplemental loans for students,plus,and consolidation loan programs,observing that the secretary of education took particular note of the existence of federal law that regulated the conduct of third party collectors of defaulted student loans and concluded that these debt collectors remain subject to the fdcpa.and both parties here agree that a debtor may pursue an action under the fdcpa when a debt collector,by violating a provision of the hea,also violates the fdcpa.cliff,on behalf of himself and the class,has alleged just such a claim under the fdcpa he asserts that osi violated the fdcpa when it denied his hearing request on december,and again when it issued a garnishment order on january,because osi did not have the legal right under the hea to take such action.see supra note.
but cliff also contends that the alleged hea violation constitutes an actionable violation of the florida consumer collection practices act,the florida statute that provides debtors with protection from abusive,fraudulent,and deceptive collection practices.like the fdcpa,the florida act includes a list of prohibited collection practices that give rise to a private cause of action.stat.cliff contends that osi conduct violated.stat,which prohibits a debt collector from asserting the existence of a legal right in this case,the right to deny cliff hearing request and garnish his wages when the collector knows that the right does not exist.we must decide whether cliff claim under.stat.is preempted by the hea.
contentions of the parties 
cliff observes that consumer protection is an area traditionally regulated by the states and he contends that the phrase notwithstanding any provision of state law in the wage garnishment section of the hea expressly preempts only those state laws that regulate garnishment.he argues that we are precluded from finding field preemption because congress has expressly identified the extent to which the hea preempts state law.finally,he asserts that the purposes and objectives of the hea will not be frustrated by permitting him to maintain his cause of action under the florida act.
in response,osi relies on the notwithstanding any provision of state law clause,as the district court did,to conclude that congress has expressly preempted the florida act.but osi presents its second the florida act actually conflicts with the substantially greater force.osi contends that the enforcement scheme of the hea,which relies on the authority vested in the secretary of education,would be undermined if debtors were entitled to bring claims under state law.osi also directs our attention to a notice of interpretation issued by the secretary of education and points to a recent ninth circuit decision that relied upon this interpretation to find preemption of state law.lastly,while osi concedes that some hea violations can be pursued under the fdcpa,osi argues that the florida act may impose greater burdens on collection activity than the hea or the fdcpa and,as a consequence,the florida act is preempted.
express preemption 
we must first consider whether the notwithstanding any provision of state law clause in the wage garnishment section of the hea expressly preempts the florida act claim asserted in this case.we conclude that it does not.the hea is riddled with isolated preemptive provisions that expressly preempt certain provisions of state law see,preempting state disclosure requirements id.a state statutes of limitations id.d state usury laws id.b state law infancy defense.the preemptive clause in the wage garnishment section is just such a provision,and when congress includes a provision that directly addresses the preemption of state law,we have been instructed to identify the domain expressly by that provision.cipollone liggett group,d.congress embedded this preemptive clause in the wage garnishment section of the hea.but that section,read as a whole,is absolutely silent regarding civil liability under consumer protection laws for violations of the hea,and thus we decline to conclude that the preemptive clause in was intended to preempt the state law claim cliff asserts in this case.
garnishment prior to judgment is an exceptional remedy,and many states permit garnishment in limited circumstances subject to strict procedural safeguards.the limitations on garnishment under state law would often foreclose the garnishment remedy contemplated by the hea,and we believe that congress had these state laws in mind when it included the preemptive clause in.see,nelson diversified collection,concluding that the phrase notwithstanding any provision of state law in expressly preempts the writ and service requirements of the maryland wage garnishment statutes.accordingly,we conclude that the notwithstanding any provision of state law clause preempts only those provisions of state law that would otherwise prohibit or hinder the ability of a guaranty agency to garnish a debtor wages.mccomas financial collection agencies,no.civ,wl at,unpublished the hea does not expressly preempt west virginia law relating to debt collection.the preemptive clause of does not expressly preempt cliff claim under the florida consumer collection practices act.
field preemption 
having concluded that the hea does not expressly preempt cliff claim,we turn our attention to field preemption.notably,osi does not contend that the hea so pervasively regulates in the field of debt collection that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.moreover,consumer protection is a field traditionally regulated by the states,florida lime avocado growers,paul,d,and the supreme court has recently reaffirmed that there is a presumption against finding implied preemption of state law in these fields.medtronic,lohr,d cipollone,at.at referring to the presumption against the of state police power regulations see also.east coast ry.city of west palm beach,cir.that presumption is reinforced by those provisions of the hea,noted earlier,that expressly preempt isolated provisions of state law.based on the supreme court decision in cipollone,these express preemptive provisions preclude our finding that the hea occupies the field.
when congress has considered the issue of and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly addressing that issue,and when that provision provides a reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state authority there is no need to infer congressional intent to state laws from the substantive provisions of the legislation such reasoning is a variant of the familiar principle of expression unius est exclusio alterius congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.
cipollone,at.at internal citations omitted.in light of this presumption and the hea preemptive provisions,as well as osi apparent concession that there is no field preemption in this case,we have no trouble concluding that the enactment of the hea does not occupy the field of debt collection practices and thus does not impliedly preempt the florida act.see,mccomas,wl at the court also has little difficulty concluding the hea lacks the comprehensive scope necessary for field preemption congress simply did not intend to occupy the entire field of debt collection activities.
conflict preemption 
conflict preemption,the final step in our preemption analysis,presents a more challenging task in this case.we first consider whether it is possible to comply with the hea and.stat.at the same time.to comply with the hea,osi was required to honor cliff request for a hearing and,depending on the timing of cliff request,may also have been required to postpone the issuance of a garnishment order pending the outcome of a hearing.see a,b.to comply with.stat,osi must not have asserted the existence of a legal right which it knew did not exist.
we conclude that a debt collector like osi can comply with the hea and.stat.simultaneously.a claim under requires the misrepresentation of a legal right or an attempt to collect a debt that is not legitimate.stat.to determine whether a debt is legitimate or whether a legal right exists,courts must refer to other statutes that establish the legitimacy of a debt and define legal rights.see kaplan assetcare,d.the hea is just such a statute the hea and its regulations define the rights of lenders,guaranty agencies,debt collectors,and debtors when federal student loans are collected.because the claimed violation of.stat.is based upon the alleged misrepresentation of a legal right established by the hea,we conclude that osi could have complied with both the hea and.
we do not suggest that it is always possible to comply with the hea and its regulations and the florida act.for instance,a regulation promulgated under the hea requires lenders to complete a specific series of contacts including telephone calls and letters with a debtor in an attempt to collect a student loan.d.but state laws,including provisions of the florida act,might be construed to prohibit one or more of these required contacts in such cases,other courts have concluded that a claim brought under state law would be preempted by the hea.see,fischer unipac serv,iowa concluding that a state law claim brought under the iowa consumer credit code,which requires a debt collector to communicate with a debtor through the debtor attorney,was preempted by,which requires a particular sequence of written and oral contacts directly with the debtor.but such a case is not before us,and the mere possibility that a claim based on one of the seventeen prohibited practices set forth in the florida act might be preempted by the hea is not enough for us to conclude that cliff claim brought under is preempted,especially when it is clear that debt collectors can comply with both the hea and.stat.
because compliance with federal and state law is possible,osi seeks refuge in the last possible ground for preemption,vigorously contending that the florida act stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congress objectives in enacting the hea.the purposes underlying the hea loan programs are fourfold to enable the secretary of education to encourage lenders to make student loans,to provide student loans to those students who might not otherwise have access to funds,to pay a portion of the interest on student loans,and to guarantee lenders against losses.a mcculloch pnc bank,cir.osi makes three arguments to support its contention that the florida act hinders the accomplishment of these goals permitting a debtor to maintain a state law cause of action undermines the hea enforcement scheme and permits an around those decisions that hold that the hea does not authorize a private right of action a notice of interpretation issued by the secretary of education compels the conclusion that any state law that would hinder any collection activity taken by a debt collector is preempted and the florida act in particular,its statute of limitations imposes greater liability than the hea and the fdcpa,disrupting the balance congress struck between the interests of debtors and the interests of those students who rely on a stable federal student loan program.we address each argument in turn.
osi concedes,as it should,that a violation of the hea can give rise to a cause of action under the fdcpa.see osi br.at student loan debt collectors are clearly subject to private liability for abusive practices under the fdcpa,including practices that may constitute violations of the hea.the secretary of education agrees that the fdcpa and the hea are intended to work in tandem.with this in mind,we reject osi argument that permitting a private cause of action under state law equates to an around our prior decision that the hea does not authorize a private right of action,because a cause of action under the the secretary of education,both parties,and this court agree is constitute just as much of an around our decision as a cause of action under state law.
we likewise reject osi contention that permitting a private cause of action would undermine congress enforcement scheme.the enforcement scheme relies on the authority vested in the secretary of education,and the secretary has expressed the belief that a private cause of action is not only consistent with congress enforcement scheme,but a necessary part of it.there is no indication that the secretary contemplated that the fdcpa would work in tandem with the hea to the exclusion of state law remedies,and osi does not direct us to any authority to support the proposition that the secretary believed that the hea and state consumer protection statutes should not similarly work in tandem 
osi urges us to find preemption based on a notice of interpretation issued by the secretary of education that prompted the ninth circuit,in brannan united student aid funds,cir,to conclude that a cause of action under the oregon unfair debt collection practices act was preempted.in and,the secretary established a mandatory sequence of contacts and other collection actions for diligent collection of delinquent student loans.when borrowers began to invoke state law to prevent lenders and guaranty agencies from completing the sequence of actions required under the regulations,the secretary issued a notice of interpretation addressing the preemptive effect of these regulations.the notice states,in pertinent part 
t he preemptive effect of these regulations extended no farther than is reasonably necessary to achieve an effective minimum standard of collection action the secretary promulgated these regulations to establish minimum required collection actions,and intended these provisions to preempt contrary or inconsistent state law to the extent necessary to permit compliance with the federal regulations these provisions therefore preempt state law that would prohibit,restrict,or impose burdens on the completion of that sequence of contacts moreover,because holders of these student loans commonly engage servicers and collection agencies to perform these dunning activities,this preemption includes any state law that would hinder or prohibit any activity taken by these third parties to complete these required steps this interpretation applies only to preemption by b and.the secretary does not attempt here to describe which other provisions of the regulations,or the hea itself,preempt state law.
notice of interpretation.at.based on this notice,the brannan majority concluded that oregon consumer protection statute was preempted because it consists of nothing but prohibitions,restrictions and burdens on collection activity.at.osi relies upon the notice of interpretation and the reasoning of the brannan majority to contend that florida consumer protection statute is similarly preempted.
we are not persuaded.on its own terms,the secretary interpretation limits the preemptive reach of the regulations to only those state laws that would prohibit,restrict,or impose burdens on the completion of the mandatory contacts prescribed by the regulations.id.at noting that the official interpretation indicates that only inconsistent state law governing collection activities by debt collectors has been preempted mccomas,wl at read in its entirety,the notice of interpretation indicates that the secretary regulations preempt only those state laws contrary to or inconsistent with the collection procedures mandated by the regulations and those laws that would frustrate the purpose of the hea.but osi does not contend that the state law provision at issue.stat,would prohibit,restrict,or impose burdens on the completion of these contacts.under this provision,osi can not c laim,attempt,or threaten to enforce a debt when such person knows that the debt is not legitimate or assert the existence of some other legal right when such person knows that the right does not exist.stat.for us to conclude that this provision of the florida act hinders the completion of the sequence of collection activities,we would have to first conclude that the regulations require a debt collector to attempt to collect a debt that it knows is not legitimate or to assert the existence of a legal right that it knows does not exist.we are certain that the hea and its regulations do not contemplate debt collectors attempting to collect debts that are not legitimate or asserting rights that do not exist.therefore,the secretary of education notice of interpretation does not suggest that a cause of action under.stat.is preempted 
although.stat.does not impose burdens on the completion of the sequence of collection activities,osi contends that other provisions of impose burdens on collection activity and,as a result,the entire florida act should be preempted.osi finds some support for this argument in brannan.the brannan court did not engage in a preemption analysis instead,it viewed the oregon statute broadly,concluded that the statute consists entirely of restrictions and prohibitions on collection activity,and held that the entire statute is preempted.at.we acknowledge that other subsections of.stat.may hinder or restrict the completion of the required collection activities.see supra note.but an entire state statute is not preempted because some of its provisions may actually conflict with federal law.see brannan,at fletcher,concurring and dissenting absent a conclusion that congress intended to occupy the entire field of debt collection activities,a position the majority appears properly to disclaim,we must look to the particular state law provision by provision in order to determine whether any provision is inconsistent with the hea.in fact,many provisions of state consumer protection statutes do not conflict with the hea or its regulations,and many state law provisions,including.stat,actually complement and reinforce the hea.see,brannan,at fletcher,concurring and dissenting mccomas,wl at concluding that the west virginia consumer collection practices act as a whole does not conflict with the hea or its regulations,and finding that several provisions of the west virginia act actually complement the hea.
we also reject osi argument that the statute of limitations under the florida act places the statute in conflict with the goals of the hea encouraging lenders to participate in federal student loans programs is an objective of the hea,and there is no question that increasing the prospect of civil liability might discourage some lenders from participating.but lenders are already subject to civil liability under the fdcpa and its statute of limitations,d,and there is nothing to suggest that by merely permitting claims to be brought within four years instead of one,the florida act discourages lender participation to such an extent that it stands as an obstacle to the hea.under the fdcpa,a prevailing class action plaintiff is entitled to any actual damages and such additional damages up to that the court may allow,and the rest of the class members collectively may receive an amount that the court may allow up to the lesser of or one percent of the debt collector net worth.id.a b.by contrast,under the florida act,plaintiffs are entitled to the greater of actual damages or.stat.while in some circumstances the potential award under the florida act might exceed the damages available under the fdcpa,all lenders,by virtue of their participation in the federal student loan program and in light of the possibility of a fdcpa claim,are already potentially liable for up to or one percent of their net worth.on this basis,we conclude that the florida act statute of limitations does not present such a threat to the continued participation of lenders in federal student loan programs that the florida act can be deemed to obstruct the accomplishment of the objectives of the hea.
in summary,we hold that the hea does not preempt cliff claim under the florida consumer collection practices act.the preemptive clause in expressly preempts only those state laws that would hinder or otherwise obstruct a guaranty agency from employing the wage garnishment remedy made available by the hea.because the wage garnishment section and several other sections of the hea include clauses that expressly preempt certain provisions of state law,we conclude that the hea does not occupy the field of student loan debt collection,thus there is no field preemption.we also conclude that.stat.does not actually conflict with the hea because debt collectors can comply with both the hea and.stat.and because a cause of action under does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congress objectives for the hea.accordingly,we hold that the district court erred when it concluded that cliff claim under.stat.was preempted by the hea.
relation back 
next,we must decide if cliff amended complaint relates back,because if it does,cliff class could include consumers outside florida.citing.c,cliff argues that the claims asserted on behalf of the nationwide class involve precisely the same conduct that he alleged in the original complaint.because the original complaint placed osi on notice of the nature of the class action claims,he argues,the complaint failure to provide osi with complete notice of the size of the putative class is merely a procedural matter that does not affect the application of rule c.moreover,cliff argues that the district court did not have any evidentiary support for its conclusion that relation back would unfairly prejudice osi.
osi directs our attention to.c and notes that while rule c by its terms applies only to amendments involving defendants,other circuits have applied rule c to amendments involving plaintiffs.osi also points us to courts that have created tests based on considerations of notice and prejudice to determine whether an amendment regarding plaintiffs relates back.under either rule c or the test,osi contends,cliff amendment does not relate back because cliff failed to provide notice of these potential class members and because relation back would unfairly prejudice osi.
our analysis of relation back begins with.c,which governs the relation back of amendments.as a general proposition under that rule,an amendment of a pleading relates back to the original pleading if the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original p
