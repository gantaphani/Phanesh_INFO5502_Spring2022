plaintiff justin van schoick appeals an adverse summary judgment on his claim under the federal equal access act feaa or the act.he contends mission viejo high school violated his rights under the act by refusing to grant a student club of which he was president,the fellowship of christian athletes fca,rights enjoyed by all other clubs permitted to meet on campus.
in particular,plaintiff challenges the trial court conclusion that two other student key club and the girls curriculum related primarily because participation in them satisfied a graduation requirement that all students perform eight hours of community service.because it found those clubs were curriculum related,the court reasoned the provisions of the feaa were not triggered and the school could,therefore,lawfully exclude his club from campus.we reverse because the court went beyond its role on summary judgment of searching for triable issues of fact when it resolved the factual disputes concerning the key club and girls league.
mission viejo high school is a secondary educational facility within the saddleback valley unified school district the district,both of which receive federal monies.during the spring semester of the academic year,van schoick received word from his football coach,william smith,of an organizational meeting for the creation of a local chapter of the fca,to be held at the home of another teacher,douglas burt.in addition to plaintiff,smith,and burt,an adult fca organizer and nine other students attended the meeting,as did burt wife.
the attendees met for about minutes,during which they discussed the fca purpose and aims.subsequently,these and other students met at a nearby thrift store on monday were usually joined by burt and smith.an fca organizer also attended sometimes.group officers were chosen,and plaintiff was elected president.at the meetings participants discussed the significance of various biblical passages.this bible study was planned by the elected officers,together with smith and burt.in time,the students also began meeting informally at school during noninstructional times these meetings were student initiated and were attended solely by students.
eventually,the group resolved to seek formal club status at the high school toward that end,and with the assistance of smith and burt,the students drafted a constitution,and in may,applied for recognition as an officially sanctioned club,one with the avowed aim of having a christian presence on campus,and influencing others into the christian faith.the club constitution declared,among other things,that succeeding officers would be appointed by the present year four officers,in conference with the faculty advisors,smith and burt.the fca application was denied.in rejecting the application,the principal,duffy clark,declared,in part,that t he district has been advised that sponsorship of a student religious club would be contrary to both the united states and california constitutions.
at that time the school district had in place a policy concerning student clubs it had adopted in the early in the wake of the united states supreme court opinion in board of education of westside community schools mergens,d,the seminal interpretation of the feaa.pursuant to that policy,each campus was to be a closed forum,which meant,among other things,the only student clubs that could be allowed on campus would be curriculum related.that requirement could be met easily by existing clubs that,for instance,related directly to the subject matter of a course,such as a french or spanish club,or to the body of courses as a whole,such as clubs promoting academic excellence and so on how to categorize existing clubs that had a more attenuated connection with the curriculum,the key club and the girls league,service clubs,was more problematic.
this was the solution adopted by the saddleback valley unified school district board of trustees the board approved at the board may,meeting,board policy declared that the subject of community service was to be a component of the social studies curriculum at each high school grade level in addition,it established a new requirement that all students either perform eight hours of community service or write a relatively lengthy research essay on community service in order to graduate then,perhaps intentionally to salvage certain service clubs whose curriculum relatedness might previously have been questionable,the board decreed that the community service graduation requirement could be satisfied by eight hours of participation in a qualified community service organization,which included service clubs such as the key club and the girls league.
thus,with all of the favored clubs arguably in the category,defendants were able to maintain that mission viejo high school was a closed forum to which the provisions of the feaa therefore did not apply.accordingly,the fca had no right of access and was denied recognition as an official campus club.
dissatisfied with the denial of the club application,plaintiff instituted this action,alleging,among other things,that defendants violated his rights under the feaa by denying his application.that is,plaintiff alleged that the high school permitted other student clubs,the key club and the girls league,to meet on campus and use certain campus facilities,thereby making the high school a limited open forum and triggering the protections of the act.plaintiff also averred his proposed club was composed of students who meet and fellowship sic,share their experiences as youths,sing songs,study the bible,and who perform various charitable acts within the community to help persons in need of financial assistance,and other needs.the fca sought official club status in order to hold meetings on campus,meetings which were to be student initiated,voluntary,held during time,not sponsored by the school,government or its agents or employees and would not in any way interfere with the orderly conduct of educational activities within the school.further,such meetings were not to be directed,controlled,conducted,or regularly attended by nonschool persons.
defendants subsequently sought summary judgment,arguing that,among other things,the provisions of the feaa were inapplicable because mission viejo high school was a closed forum.the school had closed forum status,defendants argued,because all student clubs on campus,including key club and girls league,were curriculum related,the condition precedent to status under the act.defendants noted that the district had made the subject of community service a component of the social studies curriculum at each high school grade level.and the key club and girls league were curriculum related because each satisfied the district graduation requirement ignoring plaintiff claim that the fca perform s various charitable acts within the community to help persons in need of financial assistance,and other needs.in any event,defendants argument continued,even if mission viejo high were a limited open forum and the equal access act applied,the fca still could be denied access,both because the group was not student defendants asserted was required by the allowing it access to school facilities would violate the establishment clauses of the state and federal constitutions.
the court granted defendants motion.it concluded the fca was not entitled to access under the act because of the provision in the club constitution giving burt and smith some authority over the selection of each succeeding year officers.likewise,because of those two teachers involvement in the club,granting it access to campus would amount to impermissible state sponsorship of religion.moreover,the court concluded that,because participation in key club or girls league satisfied mission viejo high graduation requirement,those clubs were curriculum related and the high school maintained a closed forum to which plaintiff had no right of access under the act 
the feaa provides in pertinent part that i t shall be unlawful for any public secondary school which receives federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum to deny equal access or a fair opportunity to,or discriminate against,any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious,political,philosophical,or other content of the speech at such meetings.a.the act protections are and apply only with respect to a school whose campus is a limited open forum,which is created whenever such school grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises during time.b.here,in concluding that mission viejo high school had not created a limited open forum,the trial court rejected plaintiff assertion that key club and girls league were noncurriculum related and concluded instead the clubs were curriculum related because participation in them satisfied the graduation requirement.
although the act defines several key words and phrases,noncurriculum related is not among them.relying primarily upon rules of statutory construction,however,the united states supreme court fleshed out the phrase noncurriculum related in mergens,supra,d.there,a group whose application for club recognition had been denied by the students high school sought to invoke the protections of the feaa by establishing the school was a limited open forum because it recognized and granted campus access to numerous clubs,including the service clubs interact a junior version of the rotary club and zonta the female equivalent of interact.id.at.attempting to glean legislative intent from the language and logic of the act,the court noted that t he act definition of the sort of meeting s that must be accommodated under the statute,a,sheds some light on this question.the term meeting includes those activities of students groups which are not directly related to the school curriculum.congress use of the phrase directly related implies that student groups directly related to the subject matter of courses offered by the school do not fall within the noncurriculum related category and would therefore be considered curriculum related.id.at,italics omitted.
the court continued,the logic of the act also supports the view that a student group is one that has more than just a tangential or attenuated relationship to courses offered by the school.id.at.after noting the act was passed in response to several cases denying religious groups access to high school facilities on establishment clause grounds the court added the following w e think that the term noncurriculum related student group is best interpreted broadly to mean any student group that does not directly relate to the body of courses offered by the school.in our view,a student group directly relates to a school curriculum if the subject matter of the group is actually taught,or will soon be taught,in a regularly offered course if the subject matter of the group concerns the body of courses as a whole if participation in the group is required for a particular course or if participation in the group results in academic credit.we think this limited definition of groups that directly relate to the curriculum is a commonsense interpretation of the act that is consistent with congress intent to provide a low threshold for triggering the act requirements.id.at.
turning its attention to the specific clubs at issue in included clubs as disparate as the future business leaders of america and the subsurfers,the chess club,and the national honor court rejected the assertion that all of these student activities are curriculum related because they further the goals of particular aspects of the school curriculum.id.at.that is,simply because particular clubs might advance the overall goal of developing effective citizens enabl e students to develop lifelong recreational interests,enhance students ability to engage in critical thought processes,and the like,did not make them sufficiently curriculum related to avoid offending the act.id.at.thus,t o define curriculum related in a way that results in almost no schools having a limited open fora,or in a way that permits schools to evade the act by strategically describing existing student groups,would render the act merely hortatory.ibid.the court also declared that,in making a determination,courts should look to a school actual practice rather than its stated policy.id.at.
perhaps even more factually on point is pope east brunswick board of education cir,in which,on a motion for summary judgment,a student bible group sought access pursuant to the act by establishing that several student clubs,including the key club,were noncurriculum related.at the outset the court acknowledged that under mergens the act should be construed broadly in order to effectuate the congressional purpose of prohibiting discrimination against student religious groups.id.at.as in mergens,it went on to say,to that end,the existence of a limited open forum,and concomitantly the applicability of the act itself,is triggered by what a school does,not by what it says.ibid.with respect to the key club,defendant adduced evidence to the effect that the bulk of the key club activities involve a variety of activities,such as volleyball marathons,game nights,and book,food and toy drives.the proceeds from these activities are donated to local charities.id.at.
the defendant argued that the key club subject matter was directly related to the school history and humanities classes,which teach a unit on homelessness,hunger and poverty.pope,supra,at.indeed,the teacher testified his classes participate d in and coordinate d the key club food and toy drives.ibid.rejecting defendant assertion that this established curricular relatedness,the court declared that the mergens court did not indicate that participation in one or more of the group activities would be sufficient to make the group curriculum related,italics omitted.were that the case,schools could then evade the act by the simple expedient of requiring some or all students to participate in a single activity or meeting of each group with which the school administrators wish to create a curriculum relationship.such a result would not be consistent with the low threshold for triggering the act and would indeed render it merely hortatory.ibid.the court concluded defendant failed to establish the subject matter of the key club directly related to that of any course 
in the present case,defendants argue,and the trial court held,that the key club and the girls league were curriculum related because eight hours of participation in them satisfied mission viejo high graduation requirement.the court specifically found that satisfaction of this graduation requirement established curriculum relatedness,presumably under the fourth prong of the test set forth in mergens,curriculum relatedness established where participation in a club results in academic credit.we seriously doubt that the graduation requirement,without more,is sufficient to establish curriculum relatedness.as mergens suggests,and as pope squarely holds,community service clubs are,at best,only marginally related to the usual high school curriculum.that being the case,we fail to see how making participation in such clubs satisfy a graduation requirement somehow transforms those clubs into scholastic endeavors moreover,allowing mission viejo high to remain a closed forum merely by making participation in such marginal groups a graduation prerequisite would essentially be permitting the high school to evade the act by the simple expedient of requiring some or all students to participate in a single activity or meeting of each group with which the school administrators wish to create a curriculum relationship,an eventuality condemned by the pope court.pope,supra,at.
the facts differ here,however,in one arguably significant respect from those in pope.the present defendants introduced some evidence that,in the early,the curriculum at mission viejo high was changed to include at least some units on the subject of community service.for several reasons,however,we believe that evidence was insufficient to establish that no triable issue of material fact existed as to the curriculum relatedness of the two service clubs here at issue or that of fca itself under the sc
