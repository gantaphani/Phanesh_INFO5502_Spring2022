contending the amendment order amounted to a denial of his strike motion,defendant argues the trial court erred because plaintiff failed to allege actual malice in her original complaint and the trial court erroneously permitted amendment the communist epithet no longer constitutes slander per se given the absence of slander per se,plaintiff failed to demonstrate defendant comment damaged her or injured her reputation and defendant description of plaintiff as a communist was not a provably false assertion of fact but rather protected rhetorical hyperbole or loose language.lam ngo th,d lam.
defendant also raises for the first time on appeal arguments not presented to the trial court his statements fell within the doctrine applicable when petitioning one elected representatives,and his statements were shielded by the absolute privilege afforded petitioning activity under civil code section,subdivision b,for communications concerning legislative proceedings.finally,while defendant motion to strike did not challenge plaintiff causes of action for intentional interference with contractual relations,or intentional or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,defendant asserts the trial court erroneously denied his strike motion as to those claims because he later attacked them in a supplemental reply.

factual and procedural background 
after applying for the position of westminster superintendent of public schools,plaintiff advanced through three rounds of interviews.the board members conducted the first round on may,the members of the teacher union interviewed candidates the next week,and the board members conducted a final round a week later.plaintiff competed with other applicants.
wsd held focus group interviews to develop a profile of the ideal superintendent by interviewing the board,the district staff,the teacher union,the city council members in the district,the police departments,and the parents and community members.
board president blossie marquez opined that b ased on my review of experience,credentials,and cultural background,she was qualified for the wsd s uperintendent position.
on may,the board voted in favor of plaintiff as its next superintendent.board member purcell dissented.marquez called plaintiff to congratulate her that evening and gave her the official news.the interim superintendent,mel lopez,also called to congratulate her.
wsd issued a press release announcing plaintiff superintendent appointment.local television stations and major newspapers picked up the story because plaintiff would become the first vietnamese person hired in america as a superintendent of a public school system.she would begin her term on july,a little more than a month later.the next day,plaintiff resigned her administrative position at california state university,long beach.
on may,claiming she had been investigating plaintiff,board member judy ahrens called marquez at her home.the call was placed from defendant business.announcing,i know someone who knows all about,ahrens placed defendant on the line.according to marquez,defendant spoke to me and maliciously accused of being a communist,inexperienced,and unqualified for the position.ahrens then advised marquez,you have to listen to this guy.
in his initial declaration submitted for the hearing,defendant admitted that at the time he made these statements,he never had met plaintiff,and only knew about her through media reports as a garden grove school board member and community activist,as well as articles she might have published in the newspaper.defendant admitted he talked to ahrens and marquez about the decision to hire plaintiff however,defendant insisted he merely gave his opinion of plaintiff.
in his second declaration,filed with his reply in the proceeding,defendant denied stating plaintiff was a communist,inexperienced,or unqualified.on the contrary,he claimed,my only complaint about is that,according to my understanding,her political views are far less conservative than my own.defendant also insisted he was merely sharing his opinion and never encouraged anyone to change their vote.
plaintiff explained in her declaration that calling someone a communist in westminster little saigon vietnamese community was extremely harmful to her reputation.while the statements were not made to vietnamese individuals,they were made to board members necessarily attuned by demographics to the concerns of voters.
less than a week after plaintiff appointment,the board met and voted to terminate her as superintendent.board members ahrens and jim reed changed their votes while purcell again dissented.marquez and sergio contreras continued to support plaintiff.
plaintiff subsequently filed a lawsuit against the school district and others,including defendant.plaintiff named defendant in the following causes of action defamation seventh cause of action,intentional interference with contractual relations ninth cause of action,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage tenth cause of action,and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage eleventh cause of action.
defendant filed an answer to the complaint,listing numerous affirmative defenses however,he did not assert any privileges.a few days later,defendant filed his motion,contending any statements he made were pursuant to his right to free speech and to petition the government.he asserted plaintiff was a public official and her appointment as superintendent was a matter of public interest.defendant explained he formed an opinion about plaintiff,which he shared with others because of his interest in vietnamese community affairs and local politics.he argued plaintiff suit punished him for expressing his political opinion.
other than listing the causes of action in his notice of motion,defendant did not further address why the trial court should strike the ninth,tenth,or eleventh causes of action.plaintiff opposition argued the statute did not apply because defendant did not make his comments in a public forum on a pending matter.plaintiff explained she was past the hiring phase and the matter was no longer under review.moreover,defendant made his statements privately either by telephone or at his office,in a manner she had no opportunity to dispute before the board acted on them.plaintiff denied she was ever a communist.
in his reply,defendant claimed any statements he may have made simply illustrated his political differences with plaintiff and amounted to an expression of his opinion,not an assertion of fact.in his second declaration,which he attached to his reply,defendant denied stating plaintiff was a communist,but opined her political beliefs were more liberal than his.
seven days later,defendant filed a short supplemental reply,in which he attempted to address the ninth,tenth,and eleventh causes of action.on august,the trial court heard the motion,noting defendant failed to address the ninth,tenth,and eleventh causes of action in his moving papers,and found defendant attempt to do so in his reply improper.
addressing the existence of actual malice,the trial court stated but is the proof in your client own declaration where he says he does even know this lady and nowhere does he say,i learned she is a communist from this source or that source or from her own words.if you put both of those together,what do you have you have no place to go for his belief that she a communist.
the next day,the trial court asked for briefs from both parties as to whether plaintiff could amend her complaint to allege actual malice.following further briefing,the court granted leave for plaintiff to amend her complaint and effectively denied defendant motion.the trial court found the matter was one of public interest under the statute however,plaintiff had established a probability of prevailing on her defamation claim.the trial court denied defendant motion as to the ninth,tenth,and eleventh causes of action because defendant failed to address them in his moving papers.the court found the complaint was deficient on its face in alleging actual malice,but determined plaintiff had provided proof of actual malice and authorized plaintiff to amend the complaint accordingly.the court concluded plaintiff had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on her claim that defendant falsely and maliciously branded her a communist,uttered as a statement of fact without a belief in its truth.

the trial court concluded defendant satisfied the first prong because plaintiff appointment as superintendent remained an issue of public interest that moving party was free to comment on.defendant challenges the trial court analysis on the second prong.we review the trial court order de novo.christian research institute alnor th,d christian research.
defendant contends the trial court erred in concluding plaintiff demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits of her slander claim.to establish a probability of prevailing,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.in doing so,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant.citation.although the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.citation.moreover,the plaintiff can not rely on the allegations of the complaint,but must produce evidence that would be admissible at trial.citation.integrated healthcare,supra,th at,d.

defendant asserts plaintiff,a public figure,inadequately alleged slander in her complaint.plaintiff concedes that as westminster new superintendent,albeit briefly,she was a public figure.we agree.see ghafur bernstein th,d strong public interest in ensuring open discussion of superintendent fitness for the position commands universal agreement that such persons are public figures also conroy spitzer th,d candidates for public office are public figures.as such,plaintiff shouldered the burden of proving not only the falsity of the challenged statement,but also that defendant acted with actual malice.new york times sullivan,d new york times.

plaintiff original complaint unequivocally asserted defendant statement that she was a communist was false.but whether she alleged defendant knew the statement was false or uttered it with reckless disregard for the truth is a closer call.according to defendant,plaintiff failed to allege he uttered his statements with the actual malice necessary to constitute slander of a public figure.
actual malice 
plaintiff complaint alleged defendant repeatedly called her a communist for malicious purposes,to get her fired and justify her wrongful termination quoting civil code section,the complaint further alleged defendant made the statements intending to subject her to contempt,ridicule,hatred,and obloquy,or to cause her to be shunned and avoided.defendant points out that plaintiff quotation derives from the libel statute,not the slander code section.but this is a distinction without a difference if plaintiff conveyed that defendant acted with anger and hostility toward her,which may support an inference of actual malice.see christian research,supra,th at,d anger and hostility toward the plaintiff may,in an appropriate case,indicate that the publisher himself had serious doubts regarding the truth of his publication.
