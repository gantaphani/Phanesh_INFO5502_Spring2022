plaintiffs are california high school and college students who allege that section of article i of the california constitution violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and causes the unfair exclusion of african american,latino,and native american students from higher education.they seek to enjoin governor edmund brown and mark yudof,president of the university of california,from enforcing section.yudof asserts that he is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment and that he is an improper defendant pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.although we hold that plaintiffs suit against yudof is not barred by eleventh amendment immunity,we also hold that plaintiffs equal protection challenge to section is precluded by coalition for economic equity wilson wilson ii,cir,where we previously upheld the constitutionality of section.the district court correctly dismissed the complaint against the governor and yudof for failure to state a claim.
factual and procedural background 
the university of california is a public university system governed by the regents of the university of california,a board with full powers of organization and government,including the authority to set the university admission policy.cal.const.art.ix.plaintiffs allege that,as a result of the civil rights movement,the regents adopted affirmative action programs to increase the number of african american,latino,and native american students.the programs were effective in rapidly and significantly increasing the number of underrepresented minorities.
in november,californian voters adopted proposition,which amended the california constitution to provide 
a the state shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.
f for the purposes of this section,state shall include,but not necessarily be limited to,the state itself,any city,county,city and county,public university system,including the university of california,community college district,school district,special district,or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the state.
cal.const.art.i.
several individuals and groups immediately brought suit under against state officials and political subdivisions of the state,alleging,inter alia,that section violated the equal protection clause.see coal.for econ.equity wilson wilson i.the district court in wilson i granted the requested relief by the plaintiffs,holding that section was likely unconstitutional and granting a preliminary injunction enjoining its enforcement.id.at.
on appeal,we vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the matter because the plaintiffs had shown no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.wilson ii,at.in so doing,we rejected the plaintiffs equal protection claim under both a conventional equal protection analysis and a equal protection analysis.id.at.under a conventional analysis,the court focuses on whether the government has classified individuals on the basis of impermissible criteria.valeria davis,cir.we held in wilson ii that section is constitutional under a conventional equal protection analysis because it prohibits the state from classifying individuals by race or gender and,therefore,it a fortiori does not classify individuals impermissibly.at.under a analysis,the question is whether a state action creates a political structure that treats all individuals as equals but place s special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.washington seattle sch.dist,citation and quotation marks omitted.applying this analysis,we determined that section was constitutional because the law addresse d in and matters.at.section prohibited preferential treatment,we held,not equal protection rights against political obstructions to equal treatment.id.at.
after section became law,the university ceased considering race or sex in student admissions.the year after section passed,the number of african american,latino,and native american freshmen at ucla and berkeley dropped by over.the regents have attempted to mitigate the drop in underrepresented minorities by adopting a comprehensive review of applicants,utilizing different standardized tests,admitting the top of graduates from any high school,and decreasing the weight of standardized tests.it is alleged that these measures have had only a minor impact on the number of underrepresented minority students.
plaintiffs initiated the instant putative class action to once again challenge the constitutionality of section under conventional and equal protection analyses.defendants regents,arnold schwarzenegger,and yudof moved to dismiss the complaint,asserting along with other defenses that they were immune from suit under the eleventh amendment and that they were not proper defendants.former regent ward connerly,the american civil rights foundation,and the california association of scholars then moved to intervene as defendants and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under rule b.
the district court allowed connerly and the american civil rights foundation to intervene.the court dismissed the regents on sovereign immunity grounds,which plaintiffs have not appealed.the district court then denied the motions to dismiss by former governor schwarzenegger and yudof.the court ruled that the governor and yudof were not immune from suit and were proper defendants because they were sufficiently connected to the enforcement of section through their respective roles as president of the regents and president of the university.in a separate order,the district court dismissed with prejudice both of plaintiffs claims,holding that it was bound by wilson ii to uphold the constitutionality of section.
plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims,and yudof the district court decision to deny him state immunity and to keep him in the suit.governor brown was then substituted as a defendant.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review de novo a district court order granting a motion to dismiss under rule b,cook brewer,cir.a denial of eleventh amendment immunity is also reviewed de novo.eason clark cnty.sch,cir.we review a district court decision to dismiss with prejudice for abuse of discretion.stearns ticketmaster,cir.
iii.discussion 
because our precedent dictates that we resolve an eleventh amendment immunity claim before reaching the merits,we first address yudof.see in re jackson,cir.yudof argues that the district court erred in denying him eleventh amendment immunity.we disagree.
the eleventh amendment erects a general bar against federal lawsuits brought against a state.porter jones,cir.it does not,however,bar actions for prospective declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers in their official capacities for their alleged violations of federal law.see ex parte young,alden.maine.the individual state official sued must have some connection with the enforcement of the act.ex parte young,at.in addition,that connection must be fairly direct a generalized duty to enforce state law or general supervisory power over the persons responsible for enforcing the challenged provision will not subject an official to suit.cnty.bar ass eu,cir.
relying primarily on snoeck brussa,cir,yudof contends that the district court improperly denied him eleventh amendment immunity.snoeck held that members of a judicial discipline commission were immune from suit under the eleventh amendment because they had no enforcement power over the challenged rule.id.at.the plaintiffs in snoeck alleged that the commissioners violated their first amendment rights by prohibiting them from disclosing the facts contained in their complaints against two nevada judges.id.at.pursuant to the nevada constitution,the nevada supreme court adopted judicial rules that required confidentiality,and that allowed it to hold in contempt those who breached confidentiality.id.we held that the commissioners were immune from suit because the commission h
