this case arises from the claimed physical abuse of a old disabled child in a public school setting.the child,preschooler ii,and his mother,jane roe,filed suit against the state,school district,school board and various school personnel school officials under the americans with disabilities act ada,the rehabilitation act,the individuals with disabilities education act idea,and preschooler ii claims abuse ranging from being beaten,slapped,and body slammed to unexplained bruises and shoeless walks from the school bus to the classroom.the district court denied the school officials motion to dismiss based in part on qualified immunity.in this interlocutory appeal,the school officials properly raise only the issue of qualified immunity for the claims 
not long ago,our court acknowledged that the right of a student to be free from excessive force at the hands of teachers employed by the state was clearly established as early as.doe state of hawaii dep t of,cir.at this stage of the proceedings,we construe the allegations in the light most favorable to preschooler ii.see,beier city of lewiston,cir.because certain of the allegations,such as the unexplained bruising and shoeless walks,do not rise to the level of constitutional claims,we reverse the district court denial of qualified immunity on those claims.we affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity on the remaining claims.
in the school year,preschooler ii was four years old.he had been diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis,a neurological disease that causes tumors to form in various organs,primarily in the brain,eyes,heart,kidneys,skin,and lungs.symptoms include seizures,rashes,and skin lesions.in addition,preschooler ii suffers from autism.based on these diagnoses,preschooler ii is eligible for special education services under the idea.see.
in compliance with the idea and state regulations,preschooler ii began his schooling at a special education program known as kids intensive delivery of services kids at the betsy rhodes school in clark county,nevada.the program was staffed by one teacher,kathleen lisanti,and various teacher assistants.
lisanti allegedly physically abused preschooler ii on repeated occasions.the claimed abuses started in september,and continued until early april.preschooler ii transferred to another elementary school soon after.the alleged incidents of abuse are as follows 
preschooler ii was assaulted at circle time by defendant lisanti,when defendant lisanti grabbed plaintiff preschooler ii hands and slapped him repeatedly lisanti beat preschooler ii,hitting his head and face.this event was especially traumatic for preschooler ii because of his tuberous sclerosis diagnosis,which causes tumors in the eyes and brain.preschooler ii alleges that lisanti admitted wrongdoing when she later apologized for this assault and battery 
lisanti maliciously body slammed preschooler ii into a chair,an event witnessed by a detective who testified at preschooler ii administrative hearing.
on four occasions,lisanti forced preschooler ii to walk without shoes across the asphalt from the school bus to the classroom.
on one occasion,lisanti documented in writing noticeable bruising to preschooler ii arms.beyond the bruises documented by lisanti,preschooler ii sustained unspecified bruising to the inner thigh regions in addition to a thick fingernail scratch to his neck region.
preschooler ii alleges that the school officials were on notice of the violent and unlawful conduct ongoing in the classroom before and during the time preschooler ii was abused,and that they failed to act to prevent further harm to him.preschooler ii amended complaint relates several events to support the notice allegation.these incidents allegedly provided notice of the ongoing abuses to the school principal,darryl wyatt,and district personnel who,according to preschooler ii,failed to report the incidents as required by statute,or to correct the situation.in addition to wyatt,compliance director michael harley,associate superintendent charlene green,superintendent carlos garcia,and special education specialist kay davis allegedly knew of and failed to report or remediate possible child abuse of preschooler ii.
preschooler ii mother was suspicious that something was negatively affecting the child at school because he had begun to develop violent behavior not previously exhibited.nonetheless,she was not informed of any of the specific alleged abuses until early april,when principal wyatt first told her that her son had been battered by lisanti.lisanti apparently was trying to teach preschooler ii not to swat himself,a behavior incident to his disability.months after the first abuse report,lisanti was placed on administrative leave.
after unsuccessful administrative proceedings,preschooler ii mother filed suit in federal court.preschooler ii eight causes of action are as follows petition for judicial review,declaratory and equitable relief,and claim for attorney fees and costs violation of the americans with disabilities act violation of the rehabilitation act violation of based on the fourth and fourteenth amendments claims assault,battery and use of aversive interventions negligence claims and negligent failure to report.
the school officials moved to dismiss preschooler ii second,third,fourth,fifth and eighth causes of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.they also asserted qualified immunity with respect to the fourth cause of action.in addition,the motion requested a declaratory judgment that the enforcement provisions of the nevada reporting statute,are not state educational requirements under the idea.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss as to all claims,denied qualified immunity,and declined to reach whether nevada reporting requirements were incorporated into the idea.the court determined that qualified immunity was not warranted because preschooler ii had alleged conduct sufficient to support a claim for constitutional deprivation under the fourth and fourteenth amendments and violations of clearly established law.see roe nevada,d at.school officials lisanti,wyatt,garcia,green,harley,and davis filed this interlocutory appeal on the qualified immunity issue.
we review de novo the district court denial of qualified immunity.see sorrels mckee,cir citing elder holloway,d.government officials do not enjoy qualified immunity from civil damages if their conduct violates clearly established constitutional or statutory rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.
in analyzing whether the school officials are entitled to qualified immunity,we address two sequential questions.first,we inquire whether,taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,that party has established a violation of a federal right.see saucier katz,d.assuming this threshold inquiry is satisfied,we consider whether the school officials conduct violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.hope pelzer,d quoting harlow,at.the clearly established test is satisfied if in light of law the unlawfulness is apparent.id.qualified immunity will not protect the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.hunter bryant,d quotations omitted.
physical abuse of public school lisanti 
our initial task is to determine whether the physical abuse allegations rise to the level of constitutional violations.we begin with the principle that excess force by a school official against a student violate s the student constitutional rights.koch,cir.the consequences of a teacher force against a student at school are generally analyzed under the reasonableness rubric of the fourth amendment,although historically courts applied substantive due process analysis under the fourteenth amendment shocks the conscience test.see doe,at cir quoting new jersey,d applying the fourth amendment in the school context,requiring reasonableness to be assessed in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction,and explaining the movement from substantive due process to fourth amendment review.
