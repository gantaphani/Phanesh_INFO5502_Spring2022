opinion of the court 
is a student at the learning center for exceptional children lcec.lcec is a private school for children with intellectual disabilities.individualized education program her education plan created by her parents,teachers,and local system says that she should attend lcec and integrated classes with students from today learning center tlc.tlc is a private school for students that shares classroom space with lcec.the new jersey department of education the department asserts that it has not approved lcec or tlc to teach integrated classes of students and students with disabilities.therefore,the department directed lcec to confirm that it would not place its students with disabilities in classrooms with students.lcec agreed under protest.
parents and on behalf of and lcec sued the department and two of its officials,challenging the department regulation of lcec as arbitrary and capricious,and sought preliminary injunctive relief.the district court granted a preliminary injunction under the rule of the individuals with disabilities education act idea.the injunction allowed her to attend classes with tlc students during the pendency of the case.we will remand the case with the injunction intact for additional fact finding.
the individuals with disabilities education act imposes conditions on any state that accepts certain federal educational funding assistance.new jersey accepts this assistance and is bound by those conditions.
under idea,a state must provide a free appropriate public education to all students with intellectual disabilities.a a a free appropriate public education is,among other things,an education that is provided in conformity with an individualized education program for that child.id.d.a state can provide a free appropriate public education to a child with disabilities by paying for that child to attend a private school if the state ensures that the private school meets the same standards that the state requires of public schools and if the private school accords with the child individualized education program.id.a b.the new jersey department of education approves programs to serve these students with disabilities,but the approval process is for specific programs only and is not a general certification of the school.admin.code a.
an individualized education program frequently abbreviated as iep must be created and in effect for each child with disabilities by the beginning of each school year.a,d a.each year,a child iep is developed by a team that includes the child parents,at least one teacher,at least one teacher,a representative of the local educational agency,and the child himself or herself,if appropriate.id.d b.if needed to interpret evaluation results or to provide other expertise,additional individuals may participate in creating the iep.id.the iep should state the child present levels of achievement and performance,provide annual goals,and explain how progress will be measured.id.d a i.the iep should also state the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child and the anticipated frequency,location,and duration of those services and modifications.id.d a i iv,vii.once an iep has been created,it may only be amended by the entire iep team or by agreement between the parents and the local educational agency.id.d f.
idea also requires that states provide a dispute resolution system should a parent or public agency dispute whether the child is receiving a free appropriate public education.either party may seek mediation or present a complaint to an administrative law judge,who will then adjudicate the parties disagreement.id.b,c,d,e,f.when parties go before an administrative law judge,the process is called a due process hearing.id.f.any party aggrieved by the alj findings can administratively appeal.id.g.any party still aggrieved after the administrative appeal may file a civil action in a state court of competent jurisdiction or in a federal district court.id.i.
importantly,idea requires that during the pendency of any proceedings the child shall remain in the educational placement unless the parents and the state or local educational agency agree otherwise.id.j.this is commonly referred to as idea rule.
the learning center for exceptional children is a private school for students with disabilities.it opened in.during the times relevant to this lawsuit,lcec leased classroom space in a building in clifton,new jersey.also sharing this space was a private school for students,today learning center.the principal of lcec is also the principal of tlc.
lcec has received authorization from the new jersey department of education to educate students with disabilities referred to lcec by the students local systems into certain programs.lcec received its most recent approval in.in its application for this approval,lcec listed one of the programs as integration of disabled and peers.app.at alteration omitted.the application,however,did not mention that lcec students would attend integrated classes with tlc students.the department has never approved tlc to educate any students with disabilities.
is a girl who most recently was in the fourth grade.her local system,hoboken,classified her as multiply disabled and eligible to receive special education services.beginning in january,she has attended lcec,as stated in her ieps for each year.lcec was specifically selected as the educational placement for due to her unique academic and needs.app.at.for the school year,iep calls for her to be integrated with regular education students in a small classroom at tlc with a low ratio.id.she is also to receive a,assistant and other curricular modifications.
in december,after an inspection,the department requested a statement of assurance that nonpublic school students from tlc are not in class with public school students from lcec.app.at.the department subsequently denied lcec request to locate to a different building,stating that it did so because lcec educated its students with disabilities with tlc regular education students.the department also changed lcec approval status to conditional approval,which meant that lcec could not enroll any new public school students.see b i.lcec filed petitions for review of both decisions with the new jersey office of administrative law,which are still pending although a decision is expected shortly.in july,lcec assured the department that it would not place its students with disabilities in classrooms with tlc students,despite the fact that some of its students ieps such as called for it.lcec remains on conditional approval status.
on july,lcec and,through her parents and,sued the department,as well as linda chavez and peggy mcdonald two senior employees in the department.lcec sought injunctive and declaratory relief allowing lcec to accept new students and to educate its students with tlc students.sought injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the department from acting in a manner that precludes lcec from implementing the mainstreaming component of iep.app.at also sought her attorneys fees in bringing the suit,as permitted by i b.
after the district court denied the plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order,the parties filed and briefed a motion for a preliminary injunction on an accelerated basis.when the briefing was complete,the district court held a hearing.the district court,finding that the plaintiffs arguments had evolved,ordered supplemental briefing on the applicability of the rule to 
after the supplemental briefing,the district court granted a preliminary injunction to only.it held that did not need to first seek a order from the administrative process,that the department was altering educational placement by preventing lcec from educating its students with disabilities with tlc students,and that,therefore,was entitled to an injunction while she challenged the department actions.the district court injunction orders that the department be enjoined from interfering with plaintiff lcec implementation of individualized education plan and applies only to and no other student at lcec.app.at.the department timely appealed 
the district court had jurisdiction over this suit under.we have jurisdiction over this appeal from the district court order entering a preliminary injunction under a.
typically,we review the district court preliminary injunction under a tripartite standard we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.legal conclusions are assessed de novo.the ultimate decision to grant or deny the injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.ex rel.ayers pocono mountain sch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,our review of a preliminary injunction entered pursuant to idea rule is more specific.
the rule functions,in essence,as an automatic preliminary injunction.drinker ex rel.drinker colonial sch,cir.this is because,under the rule,the child shall remain in the educational placement while proceedings conducted pursuant to are ongoing.j.thus,if the rule applies,children are to remain in their current educational placement until the dispute with regard to their placement is ultimately resolved regardless of whether their case is meritorious or not.drinker,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.the usual prerequisites to injunctive relief are not required.id.internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,the court reviews the application of the rule to a given set of facts de novo.id.at.
under j,during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to,unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree,the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child.in other words,if there are proceedings conducted pursuant to ongoing and the child will otherwise be moved from her educational placement,the child is entitled to an injunction against the change.we must,therefore,ask two questions.first,is suit against the department a proceeding conducted pursuant to second,is educational placement being altered 
whether suit against the department claiming that its directive to lcec breaches its obligations under idea and denies her a free appropriate public education constitutes a proceeding conducted pursuant to requires us to consider two subordinate issues.first,the federal courts must have jurisdiction over the suit.second,claim must be one that can be enforced through an action under.we begin with the jurisdiction issue.
idea authorizes an aggrieved party to file suit in a federal district court should there be a dispute as to whether a child is receiving a free appropriate public education.i.however,a federal court may not exercise jurisdiction over the dispute unless state administrative remedies have been exhausted.batchelor rose tree media sch,cir in the normal case,exhausting the idea administrative process is required in order for the statute to grant subject matter jurisdiction to the district court.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.exhaustion is not required in very limited circumstances,such as where exhaustion is futile or inadequate,where the question presented is purely legal,where the administrative process can not grant relief,or where exhaustion would work a severe or irreparable harm upon a litigant.komninos upper saddle river bd.of,cir.
here,we find that the administrative process would be unable to grant relief,and so exhaustion of that process is unnecessary neither idea nor the new jersey administrative code provides administrative means for a parent to challenge an action of a state agency,only to challenge action of a local system.see,f a whenever a complaint has been received the parents or the local educational agency involved in such complaint shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing.emphasis added admin.code h when a parent requests a due process hearing the district board of education shall have an opportunity to resolve the matter emphasis added.does not challenge the action of her local system.rather,she agrees with what her local system has decided that she attend lcec while attending classes with tlc students.it is the department that would prevent her from doing so,and it is the department action she wishes to challenge.given that the administrative process can not grant relief because the hearing officer lacks authority to provide a remedy,komninos,at,her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.
we therefore turn to the second issue does contemplate and allow suit against the department the answer is yes.e.believes that the department interpretation of the scope of lcec approvals is incorrect,arbitrary,and capricious.by imposing its interpretation of the scope of lcec approvals on,the department would prevent from having her iep implemented as worded that she attend lcec and integrated classes with students at tlc.because receiving an education in compliance with her iep is a part of receiving a free appropriate public education under idea,see d,the department is thus arguably interfering with her ability to receive a free appropriate public education.the entire purpose of is to provide parents procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education.id.a.
moreover,under idea,a parent who prevails in a lawsuit may receive reasonable attorneys fees and costs.id.i b i i.importantly,a district court can award attorneys fees to a state educational agency if it is the prevailing party and the underlying action was frivolous or was presented for an improper purpose.id.i b i ii iii.therefore,because claim is one that concerns the provision of a free appropriate public education to her and because the department is a permissible party in an idea lawsuit in a federal district court,we conclude that lawsuit against the department is a proceeding conducted pursuant to.
the department arguments to the contrary rely on cases we find inapplicable.first,the department relies on judge becker opinion in deleon susquehanna community school district,cir,and the sixth circuit opinion in tilton ex rel.richards jefferson county board of education,cir.in deleon,we considered whether a change in the way a child was transported to school was subject to the rule.at.previously,the school district paid the child parent to drive him to school the school district began arranging group transportation instead.id.at.we concluded that the change was not subject to the rule because the child educational placements were not changed.id.at.the department,however,emphasizes certain dicta from the opinion.judge becker opined that possibly requiring school districts to raise substantial funds by taxation or transfer of appropriations in order to keep a school open that a school district intended to close for financial reasons raises substantial and sensitive separation of powers problems.id.at.
in tilton,a local school district planned to close a education program for students with disabilities for budget reasons and to transfer the students to day programs.at.the sixth circuit held that the rule did not apply to the district plan to close the programs for budgetary reasons because nothing in the legislative history or the language of the act implies a legislative intent to permit interested parties to utilize the automatic injunctive procedure of the rule to frustrate the fiscal policy of participating states.id.at.the court noted that education is committed to the control of state and local authorities and that applying to a budgetary decision would effect a transfer of power.id.quoting epperson arkansas.therefore,the sixth circuit held,challenging the financial decision to close schools was not something that triggered the rule.id.at.
from these cases,the department would have us craft a rule that exempts state regulation of public and private schools from the reach of a action.both deleon and tilton suggest that certain types of state or school district action namely funding decisions are not the proper subjects of a suit under idea.however,claim does not raise the same concerns as the hypothetical challenge in deleon and the actual challenge in tilton.those cases were concerned with preventing the rule from intruding on areas of state authority with which idea has only a tangential relationship such as a budgetary decision.
this is key,we think.claim focuses on a responsibility of the state educational agency under idea proper regulation of private schools to which local districts will send students with disabilities.see a b.if the department fails to do this properly,it has directly breached one of its obligations under idea.in contrast,fiscal and administrative decisions may impact the education that a student receives under idea,but only indirectly reallocating funds,for example,does not itself violate idea.the fact that challenges the way in which the department performs one of its obligations as a state educational agency under idea demonstrates that claim falls within the ambit of.
the department next relies on town court nursing center.in,federal and state regulators decided to end medicare and medicaid relationship with a nursing home because it no longer met the statutory and regulatory standards for skilled nursing facilities.id.at.residents residing at the facility by virtue of medicaid would have been forced to move to a different nursing home or else pay their own way.id.at.the residents wanted a due process hearing before the relationship was discontinued and for medicaid to continue to pay for their continued residence at the nursing home in the meantime.id.at.the supreme court determined that the residents lacked an interest in receiving benefits for care in a particular facility that entitles them,as a matter of constitutional law,to a hearing before the government can decertify that facility.id.at.this was because medicaid did not confer a right to continued residence in the home of one choice it only conferred the right to choose among a range of qualified providers.id.at.because the end of the relationship does not reduce or terminate a patient financial assistance,but merely requires him to use it for care at a different facility,no due process interest was triggered.id.at.
the fact that is a constitutional due process case is what distinguishes it from this one.the residents in were seeking to find an interest sufficient to trigger the protections of the due process clause,and the court concluded that no such interest existed.does not need the due process clause of the constitution to get an injunction here.if she can show that she has begun a proceeding conducted pursuant to and that she faces a change in her educational placement,idea grants her an injunction.does not help us determine whether the first of these requirements is met,which is what we consider here.
finally,the department relies on dima macchiarola,and corbett ex rel.corbett regional center of the east bay.in dima,the district court denied a injunction against the local school board decision not to renew a contract with a private school,which would result in the transfer of students with disabilities to a different school.at.in corbett,the district court modified a injunction to allow the state department of social services proceedings to revoke the operating license of a facility to operate to move forward.at.we do not think these cases are helpful to the issue of whether lawsuit is a proceeding conducted pursuant to.dima concluded that the transfer of these handicapped students did not constitute a change in placement.at.corbett,in turn,relied on dima.at.therefore,these cases do not persuade us that can not sue the department under 
we are satisfied that suit against the department is a proceeding conducted pursuant to.however,this implies nothing about the merits of her claims against the department.the merits of the underlying suit have no impact on whether applies in a given case,and we express no opinion on them here.see drinker,at stating that applies regardless of whether the case is meritorious or not.although there are circumstances when federal courts should not and can not intervene in the licensing decisions of the state,we also envision circumstances in which federal law requires that we intervene,such as if the licensing decision is based on an impermissible motive under idea.whether the particular action challenged is something that the federal courts can remedy must be determined in each case.because a injunction applies regardless of the merits,we take this brief opportunity to emphasize that speed of a final resolution in these cases is in the best interest of all parties.
because suit is a proceeding conducted pursuant to,she is entitled to remain in her educational placement under j.therefore,she is entitled to an injunction should the department attempt to alter her educational placement.says that by instructing lcec not to allow its students in classrooms with students from tlc,which is required by her iep,the department is attempting to alter her educational placement.the department responds that can receive the same services provided by lcec at a different school,so her educational placement is unchanged.to resolve this dispute,we have to address what educational placement means in this context.
the term educational placement is not defined by idea or its implementing regulations.nevertheless,this court has previously interpreted the term to mean whether a change is likely to affect in some significant way the child learning experience.deleon,at.this is because a change in the child educational placement should be given an expansive reading,at least where changes affecting only an individual child program are at issue.id.we also consider the iep of the child that is actually functioning when the is invoked.drinker,at internal quotation marks omitted.
argues,and the district court held,that her current educational placement is to implement her iep at lcec and tlc.e.finds support for this position in drinker we held there that because the child iep team had determined the appropriate placement and location of services for the child to be a particular school,that school was the child educational placement.id.it also accords with the notion that an iep for a child should identify the specific locations at which the child is to receive special education services.d a i vii.
the department,however,argues that educational placement does not mean a specific school when a state or local agency acts in a way that affects a group of children,rather than in a way directed towards any individual child specifically.instead,when the agency acts in a way that affects a group,educational placement means the overall educational requirements contained in the iep.the department contends that its actions are not targeted towards specifically,so if another school can provide with the programs included in her iep,she is not entitled to remain at lcec.
in support of its position,the department cites a statement by the department of education in the federal register and a group of cases from other circuits.the department of education,in creating implementing regulations for idea,drafted and implemented a regulation corresponding to the rule of j.a.the regulatory rule uses the same term,educational placement,that the statute uses.the term is not defined in the regulations even though it is a commonly used term throughout the implementing regulations.the lack of a definition was the subject of comments when the regulations were first publicized.the department of education noted that a few commenters suggested that the term educational placement be defined to include location,supports,and services provided.assistance to states for the education of children with disabilities and preschool grants for children with disabilities,emphasis added.the department decided not to define the terms,although t he department longstanding position is that placement refers to the provision of special education and related services rather than a specific place,such as a specific classroom or specific school.id.emphasis added.
the courts of appeals have also generally come to the same conclusion.in concerned parents citizens for the continuing education at malcom x ps new york city board of education,the local board of education planned to close a school for budgetary reasons and transfer the students with disabilities to other schools the parents of those children sought a order barring the closure while they challenged it,cir.the second circuit held that was not triggered because the board of education was not changing the students educational placements even though they were being transferred.id.at.the court reasoned that educational placement referred to the general type of educational program in which the child is placed or the existence and classification of a handicap,and the most appropriate type of educational program for assisting a child with such a handicap.id.at.
in aw ex rel.wilson fairfax county school board,a student was transferred from his preferred school for disciplinary reasons and challenged the transfer as being in violation of the rule,cir.the fourth circuit found that did not apply because the student educational placement was not the specific school he attended but the environment in which educational services are provided.id.at.as long as the new school replicate d the educational program contemplated by the student original assignment,there was no change in educational placement.id.
in knight ex rel.knight district of columbia,a child objected to a new iep that would transfer him from a private school to a public school for the following school year and sought an injunction under the rule while he challenged the transfer.the circuit found that did not apply because the only sense in which the two schools are dissimilar is that one is a private school and the other is a public school.id.at.the court concluded that as long as the public school was able to implement the child iep there was no change in the child educational placement.id 
these decisions indicate that,at least in some situations,a child educational placement does not include the specific school the child attends.but in each of these decisions,an alternative location provided sufficient services to satisfy the requirements of the student iep.see concerned parents,at noting that the record reflected a good faith effort to preserve intact as far as possible the basic educational programs that the transferred children had formerly enjoyed aw,f d at finding nothing in the record to indicate that the new location can not fairly be described as an identical setting knight,at finding no evidence in the record that the student would be unable to obtain similar educational benefits at the new school.
these decisions are consistent with our opinion in deleon.judge becker in deleon noted that t he question of what constitutes a change in educational placement is,necessarily,fact specific.at.the record in deleon did not indicate that changes to the student transportation plan would have a substantial,detrimental impact on the student education.id.at.judge becker also noted that decisions concerning the interests of a large number of children involve entirely different problem s than decisions that affect or are targeted towards one child.id.at.this is because decisions affecting a group as a whole are broad policy decisions rather than individual choices concerning particular children.id.
the eighth circuit summarized this dichotomy well 
a transfer to a different school building for fiscal or other reasons unrelated to the disabled child has generally not been deemed a change in placement,whereas an expulsion from school or some other change in location made on account of the disabled child or his behavior has usually been deemed a change in educational placement that violates the provision if made unilaterally.
hale ex rel.hale poplar bluffs r i sch,cir per curiam agreeing with the district court factual determination that changing the location of instruction for a student from his home to a school effected a change to his educational placement see also bd.of educ.of cmty.high sch.dist.state bd.of,cir w e adopt our sister circuits approach.we accept as the outer parameters of educational placement that it means something more than the actual school attended by the child and something less than the child ultimate educational goals.this dichotomy is appropriate because one of the primary concerns of idea was to prevent schools or educational agencies from excluding disabled students from classrooms.honig doe.
we are operating in this case in a gray area.the facts of this case are distinguishable from the decisions involving school closures for general budgetary or administrative reasons.see,ex rel.parents acting as guardians ad litem haw.dep t of,cir concluding that a reduction in school days affect s all public schools and all students,disabled and alike tilton,at i f a state or local agency must discontinue a program or close a facility for purely budgetary reasons,the requirements of the provision do not apply.the department no mainstreaming directive does not affect disabled and students equally it impacts substantially more than her peers.this case occupies a middle ground between the broad policy decisions and the individually targeted actions described in deleon.
the language of idea is broad enough to cover circumstances other than those that purely address a single student.the state legitimate interest in regulating private schools like lcec and tlc is such that it can rightly communicate its licensing concerns to the administrators of those schools,but it can not wield its regulatory authority in a fashion that immediately and without notice or any proposed alternative requires a child iep to be dispensed with while administrators are in discussions about licensing requirements.a main point of the provision in idea is to protect individual students while educational regulators and those interested in a child education are working out disputes.we are not suggesting that educational placement requires that she stay at lcec.we are saying rather that her placement is at least the program identified in her iep and that the department actions in this particular case are,if there is no viable educational alternative,recognizable as effecting a change in that placement and hence subjecting the department to a injunction of the limited variety imposed by the district court.
to reiterate,we have no occasion to decide whether moving to another school would constitute a change in placement.one aspect of this case that must be particularly frustrating to parents and perhaps to herself is that nothing in the course of the disputations between school and the department seems to have taken account of whether another school is available to satisfy the requirements of iep.she has been caught in a bureaucratic crossfire in which scant attention,if any,has been directed at alternatives to satisfy her educational needs.the district court appears to have understood that problem and sought to prevent becoming a casualty of evolving discussions on the future of her present school.we do not understand the district court to have taken any position on whether the injunction will survive a decision by the department to close lcec or by the local system to transfer students like to another school capable of implementing their ieps.nor do we.instead,given the unsettled state of the record which does not even contain a copy of iep,just a summary from provisions of the verified complaint,we think it best to remand the case,with the injunction in place,for further development of the record,including whether other educational alternatives are available to and her family as a new school year approaches.
for these reasons,we remand this case to the district court for additional fact finding consistent with this opinion.
at its core,this case is a licensing dispute between the new jersey department of education njdoe and the learning center for exceptional children lcec.thwarted at the state administrative level,lcec filed this lawsuit,joined by and her parents,in an effort to forestall njdoe actions.plaintiffs have attempted to stop njdoe by relying on a provision of the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,that is meant to prevent local agencies from changing a child education while the school and the parents address their disputes about the child educational placement.as more fully explained herein,does not provide a basis for relief here because plaintiffs do not satisfy the unambiguous statutory prerequisites and this provision does not cover challenges to a state licensing decision that equally applies to all students at a particular school.for these reasons,i dissent.
as the majority has explained,is a disabled student receiving special education services at lcec pursuant to an individualized education plan iep devised by her parents and the hoboken school district.her iep requires that a portion of her education be conducted with typically developing peers.this is known as mainstreaming.app.because lcec only enrolls public school special education students,it arranged for students at its sister school,today learning center,which enrolls private school general education students,to participate in activities with lcec students.
the njdoe has asserted that lcec is not authorized to educate private school general education students alongside public school special education students.when lcec failed to assure the njdoe that such education was not occurring,njdoe placed lcec on conditional approval status,which meant it could not accept new students.lcec,which consequently lost students and revenue,construed this directive as barring mainstreaming,thereby limiting its ability to educate according to her iep and contravening the idea goal of ensuring that students are educated in the least restrictive environment possible.
is caught in the of this regulatory dispute her iep requires mainstreaming,but the school she attends can not provide it.has invoked j,idea stay put provision,to enjoin the njdoe from interfering with the mainstreaming component of her iep while the dispute between the njdoe and lcec remains unresolved.the able district judge,confronted with the plaintiffs frequently shifting positions on the relief sought and the basis for it,relied upon j and granted relief.
the narrow issue before us is whether the idea stay put provision is an appropriate mechanism to provide the relief seeks,namely the ability to obtain uninterrupted mainstreaming opportunities at lcec.because plaintiffs have not satisfied the conditions for obtaining stay put relief under,is not entitled to an injunction under this provision.in addition,because plaintiffs are,in effect,challenging a state regulator policy that applies to all children at the school,rather than a local educational agency decision specifically concerning iep,the stay put provision does not apply and can not provide a basis to enjoin the njdoe regulatory actions.
as the majority thoroughly explains,under the idea,parents and guardians play a central role in the education of their special needs children.schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,honig doe.to this end,they participate in the creation of an iep and must be provided with w ritten prior notice whenever the local educational agency proposes to initiate or change or refuses to initiate or change the educational placement of the child.b.if the parent is dissatisfied,then he or she may present a complaint,to which the local educational agency must respond.id.b,c b.the parents are then entitled to an impartial hearing,an appeal to the state educational agency,and judicial review of the state educational agency decision.id.f a,g.
recognizing that these due process safeguards may result in lengthy proceedings,congress enacted a stay put provision that protects the status quo of a child educational placement,ex rel.hayes cape henlopen sch,cir,by preventing school districts from effecting unilateral change in a child educational program during the proceedings.susquenita sch.dist.raelee ex rel.heidi,cir.the stay put provision provides 
d uring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree,the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child,or,if applying for initial admission to a public school,shall,with the consent of the parents,be placed in the public program until all such proceedings have been completed.
j when read together with the idea due process safeguards,the stay put provision is only triggered during the pendency of proceedings conducted under when initiated by a parent who files a due process complaint in response to a proposed change in the student educational placement.none of these prerequisites are met.
plaintiffs filed this action in district court without first initiating a proceeding under.proceedings under focus on the individual student education,includ ing the conduct and development of evaluations,eligibility determinations,ieps,and educational placement.michael ex rel stephen.radnor twp.sch,cir.no such proceeding concerning education has been initiated.although the majority devotes pages to discussing whether this case is a proceeding under,the proper inquiry is whether there exists a separate pending proceeding,such as a due process complaint or an appeal of a ruling on such a complaint.because stay put operates only d uring the pendency of such a proceeding,and no such proceeding has been initiated,stay put provision simply does not apply.see moss by mutakabbir smith,holding that a federal action to enforce the stay put provision is not itself a pending proceeding under that triggers stay put.
moreover,as the majority acknowledges,there is no evidence that a change in educational placement has been proposed or has occurred as the plain wording of requires.the present record does not show that the hoboken school district has taken steps to change iep,that it intends to move to a different school with a different educational program,or that she presently lacks the mainstreaming opportunity that has been described as being part of her iep indeed,even the majority can not dispute that the record is silent as to whether there has been any actual or proposed change in educational placement the majority also discusses exhaustion and concludes that it is not required here because the idea does not allow a parent to challenge a state agency licensing decision but rather provides a means to challenge changes to an individual educational placement.for reasons that i will explain,i agree.indeed,that reasoning underscores why this is not a proceeding about educational placement covered by.
for these reasons,plaintiffs have not satisfied the prerequisites to obtain a stay put order under and,therefore,on this record,relief on that basis should not have been granted.
plaintiffs reliance on the stay put provision fails for an additional reason.even if plaintiffs would otherwise satisfy the requirements for a change in educational placement under,they can not overcome the general rule that the stay put provision does not apply when such a change results from a broad policy decision grounded in matters of licensing,administration,or fiscal policy,as opposed to a decision about an individual student.see,ex rel.parents acting as guardians ad litem haw.dep t of,cir state implementation of furloughs that closed schools on fridays was a administrative decision that did not constitute a change in placement triggering the stay put provision,although it could give rise to a failure to implement claim weil bd.of elementary secondary,cir noting that if the change in educational placement is necessitated by the closure of a facility for reasons beyond the control of the public agency,the provisions do not apply deleon susquehanna cmty.sch,cir distinguishing cases that involved broad policy decisions that could interfere with resource allocation and applying an expansive reading to change in educational placement where the decision involved is one that affects the educational program of an individual child internal quotation marks and citations omitted.while the majority correctly points out that many cases that have refused to apply the stay put provision to counteract policy decisions have involved school closures due to budget allocation decisions,the same logic applies to similar state regulatory interests.setting state educational policy,accrediting particular schools,and making difficult prioritization decisi
