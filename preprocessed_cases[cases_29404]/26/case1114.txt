lisa simpson and anne gilmore plaintiffs claim that they were sexually assaulted on the night of december,by football players and recruits of the university of colorado at boulder cu.they brought this action against cu under title ix of the education amendments of.see.the district court granted summary judgment for cu,see simpson of,d,and later denied motions to alter or amend the judgment and to reopen discovery.plaintiffs appealed these rulings in our case number.later the district court denied a second motion for relief from judgment.plaintiffs appealed that ruling in our case number.we grant plaintiffs motion to consolidate the two appeals.two amicus curiae briefs have been submitted by organizations in support of plaintiffs position we have jurisdiction under.in our view,the evidence presented to the district court on cu motion for summary judgment is sufficient to support findings that cu had an official policy of showing football recruits a good time on their visits to the cu campus,that the alleged sexual assaults were caused by cu failure to provide adequate supervision and guidance to chosen to show the football recruits a good time,and that the likelihood of such misconduct was so obvious that cu failure was the result of deliberate indifference.we therefore hold that cu was not entitled to summary judgment.because we reverse and remand for further proceedings,we need not address the merits of the postjudgment motions.
background 
we will briefly state the gist of plaintiffs claims before addressing the procedural posture of the case and the governing law.then we will discuss the evidence in significantly greater detail.we view the evidence presented to the district court in the light most favorable to the parties opposing summary,plaintiffs.see escue,cir 
plaintiffs allegations 
plaintiffs were sexually assaulted in simpson apartment by cu football players and students on a recruiting visit.the cu football team recruited talented players each fall by bringing them to campus.part of the sales effort was to show recruits a good time.to this end,recruits were paired with female ambassadors,who showed them around campus,and,who were responsible for the recruits entertainment.at least some of the recruits who came to simpson apartment had been promised an opportunity to have sex.
by the time of the alleged assaults of plaintiffs,there were a variety of sources of information suggesting the risks that sexual assault would occur if recruiting was inadequately supervised.these included reports not specific to cu regarding the serious risk of sexual assaults by.there was also information specific to cu.in a girl was assaulted by cu recruits at a party hosted by a cu football player.the local district attorney initiated a meeting with top cu officials,telling them that cu needed to develop policies for supervising recruits and implement training for football players.yet cu did little to change its policies or training following that meeting.in particular,were not instructed on the limits of appropriate entertainment.
moreover,events within the football program did not suggest that training relating to recruiting visits was unnecessary.not only was the coaching staff informed of sexual harassment and assault by players,but it responded in ways that were more likely to encourage than eliminate such misconduct.
court proceedings 
on december,simpson filed a complaint in colorado state court on december cu removed the action to the united states district court for the district of colorado.gilmore filed her complaint in federal district court on december.the two cases were consolidated on january.in their complaints plaintiffs sought relief under title ix,a,claiming that cu knew of the risk of sexual harassment of female cu students in connection with the cu football recruiting program and that it failed to take any action to prevent further harassment before their assaults.
on may,cu filed a motion contending that plaintiffs could not establish the elements of a title ix claim.in granting cu motion on march,the district court ruled that no rational person could find that cu had actual notice of sexual harassment of cu students by football players and recruits before plaintiffs assaults or that cu was deliberately indifferent to such harassment.simpson,d at.the court also observed that a could not find causation because of the lack of evidence of notice and deliberate indifference.see id.at.on may,the court denied motions to alter or amend the judgment and to reopen discovery.on april,after plaintiffs had already appealed these rulings,it denied an additional motion by plaintiffs for relief from judgment.
ii.discussion 
governing law 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.escue,at citation and ellipsis omitted quoting.c.
title ix provides in pertinent part no person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.the united states supreme court has held that title ix authorizes private suits for damages in certain circumstances.see franklin gwinnett county pub,d see also cannon of,d.two supreme court cases have addressed the contours of title ix damages suits for sexual harassment.in gebser lago vista independent school district,d,the complaint alleged sexual harassment of a student by a teacher.in davis ex rel.lashonda monroe county board of education,d,the complaint alleged harassment.
both parties in the case before us have treated plaintiffs claims as claims of harassment subject to the specific requirements of davis.in our view,however,plaintiffs claims have critical elements that make the framework an imperfect one for analysis of their claims.the alleged sexual assaults were not simply misconduct that happened to occur at cu among its students.plaintiffs allege that the assaults arose out of an official school program,the recruitment of athletes.indeed,they allege that the assaults were the natural,perhaps inevitable,consequence of an officially sanctioned but unsupervised effort to show recruits a good time.although we find this situation distinguishable from those addressed in gebser and davis,we can determine the requirements for a title ix claim in this context only after seeking guidance in these two decisions.
in gebser the supreme court held that a student claim for money damages based on sexual harassment by a teacher could arise under title ix,but only if an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the funding recipient behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient programs and fails adequately to respond,and the inadequate response amount s to deliberate indifference to discrimination.at.the court rejected two alternative bases of liability advanced by the plaintiffs.first,it rejected a claim predicated on the notion that the authority conveyed to the teacher by the school district facilitated the harassment.see id.at.second,it rejected the notion that the district could be liable based on constructive is,that the district should have known about harassment but failed to uncover and eliminate it.id.
gebser requirements for a title ix claim were premised on two propositions.first,title ix was enacted under congress spending power,which allows it to provide for the general welfare of the united states,const.art.i,cl,and to attach conditions on the funds it provides,see gebser,at.consistent with this power,title ix condition s an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate,in what amounts essentially to a contract between the government and the recipient of funds.id.at.because of title ix contractual nature,the court decided that a funding recipient could be liable in monetary damages for noncompliance with the condition,id.at,only if it has notice that it will be liable for a monetary award,id.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,a funding recipient must have notice of its noncompliance with title ix before it can be held liable for money damages.
second,the provisions of title ix indicate that a funding recipient should be liable only for its own actions,and not for the independent actions of an employee or a student.the court observed that the scheme for title ix permitted the imposition of financial penalties only after funding recipients received actual notice of discrimination within their programs and were given an opportunity to institute corrective measures they would be subject to sanctions only for their failure to respond rather than for an employee independent acts.id.at.where a statute express enforcement scheme hinges its most severe sanction on notice and unsuccessful efforts to obtain compliance,said the court,we can not attribute to congress the intention to have implied an enforcement scheme that allows imposition of greater liability without comparable conditions.id.at.the claim in gebser thus did not survive because the plaintiffs had conceded that the school district did not have actual knowledge of harassment.id.at.
gebser also rejected the plaintiffs contention that liability could be based on the school district failure to promulgate and publicize an effective policy and grievance procedure for sexual harassment claims.id.it explained that the school district alleged violation of federal regulations requiring such procedures did not establish the requisite actual notice or deliberate indifference,and the failure to promulgate a grievance procedure does not itself constitute discrimination under title ix.id.at.
relevant to the claims before us are two remarks by the court that suggest that the gebser standards do not apply to some title ix harassment claims and indicate what the standards should be for those claims.first,the court noted a limitation when setting forth the requirements of actual knowledge and an inadequate response.it restricted these requirements to cases like this one that do not involve official policy of the school district.id.at.second,it suggested that courts can find guidance in cases alleging municipal liability under.explaining why liability would arise only when the school inadequate response amounted to deliberate indifference to discrimination,the court wrote 
the administrative enforcement scheme presupposes that an official who is advised of a title ix violation refuses to take action to bring the recipient into compliance.the premise,in other words,is an official decision by the recipient not to remedy the violation.that framework finds a rough parallel in the standard of deliberate indifference.under a lower standard,there would be a risk that the recipient would be liable in damages not for its own official decision but instead for its employees independent actions.comparable considerations led to our adoption of a deliberate indifference standard for claims under alleging that a municipality actions in failing to prevent a deprivation of federal rights was the cause of the violation.see board of comm rs of bryan cty.brown,d canton harris,d.
gebser,at.we will return to these two remarks after a brief discussion of davis.
davis held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for damages under title ix when they alleged that a student had been subjected to five months of physical and verbal harassment by a classmate and that school officials informed of the harassment had failed to take any action to investigate or stop it.see at.the court addressed two distinct components of the claim.one was the nature and extent of the injury to the student.the court held that a student harassment by a peer constitutes discrimination under title ix if it is so severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive,and so undermines and detracts from the victim educational experience,that the is effectively denied equal access to an institution resources and opportunities.id.at.the district court did not rule that plaintiffs had failed to establish this component of their cause of action,and it is not at issue on appeal.
the second component addressed in davis is the role and responsibility of the funding recipient.although acknowledging that a school receiving federal funds can not be liable unless it has notice that its conduct could subject it to a damages claim,the court said that this limitation on private damages actions is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient intentionally violates the statute.id.at.it noted that in gebser it had rejected a negligence standard for,a standard that would have imposed liability on a school district for failure to react to harassment of which it should have known but instead had concluded that the district could be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally acted in clear violation of title ix by remaining deliberately indifferent to acts of harassment of which it had actual knowledge.id.in further expounding the standard for liability the court said 
the statute plain language confines the scope of prohibited conduct based on the recipient degree of control over the harasser and the environment in which the harassment occurs.if a funding recipient does not engage in harassment directly,it may not be liable for damages unless its deliberate indifference subjects its students to harassment.that is,the deliberate indifference must,at a minimum,cause students to undergo harassment or make them liable or vulnerable to it.
id.at.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.these factors,it continued,
combine to limit a recipient damages liability to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the context in which the known harassment occurs.only then can the recipient be said to expose its students to harassment or cause them to undergo it under the recipient programs.
the second component of plaintiffs role and responsibility of the focus of this appeal.we do not believe,however,that the formulation of this component in gebser and davis translates perfectly to the context of this case.we find it significant that in those cases there was no element of encouragement of the misconduct by the school district.to be sure,in those cases the school district could anticipate that the very operation of a school would be accompanied by sexual harassment,but that is simply because,unfortunately,some flawed humans will engage in such misconduct when they are in the company of others.here,however,the gist of the complaint is that cu sanctioned,supported,even funded,a program showing recruits a good time that,without proper control,would encourage young men to engage in opprobrious acts.we do not think that the notice standards established for claims in gebser and davis necessarily apply in this circumstance.
gebser suggested as much in the remarks we referenced above.the court said that the requirements it imposed applied to cases like this one that do not involve official policy of the school district.at.the court did not elaborate on what it meant by involve official policy,but the essence of the point is suggested by its reliance in the following paragraph on the doctrine regarding the imposition of liability on municipalities under for violations.the court supported the requirement for title ix liability by observing that c omparable considerations led to our adoption of a deliberate indifference standard for claims under alleging that a municipality actions in failing to prevent a deprivation of federal rights was the cause of the violation.id.at.what is comparable is the requirement for both municipal liability and title ix liability that the institution itself,rather than its employees or students,be the wrongdoer.under title ix the school district could be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally acted in clear violation of title ix.davis,at.the funding recipient should be liable only for its own official decision,not its employees independent actions.gebser,at.likewise,under a municipality is not liable under respondeat superior doctrine but only for its own violations.i t is when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.monell dep t of soc.servs.of,d.
in the context of gebser or davis,the school district could not be said to have intentionally subjected students to harassment unless it knew of the harassment and deliberately decided not to take remedial action.but the cases reveal how the standard changes when the claim involve s official policy,gebser,at,although the underlying only for intentional acts by the institution the same.
one of the cases cited by gebser as support for the requirement,see id.at,is city of canton harris,d.in that case the court held that a municipality may be liable under for an officer constitutional violation if the violation was the result of inadequate police training and the municipality failure to train the officer amounted to deliberate indifference to the rights of those with whom police come into contact.id.at.although recognizing that a municipality is liable under for a constitutional violation by one of its officers only if the officer action is caused by a municipal policy or custom,see id.at,the court declared that the policy itself need not be unconstitutional,id.at.rather,failure to conduct an adequate training program for implementation of an otherwise valid policy may represent a municipal policy on which liability can rest.see id.at.to be sure,typically a municipality would not intentionally have a training program that was clearly inadequate,but the court explained 
i t may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious,and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.
id.at.we conclude that a funding recipient can be said to have intentionally acted in clear violation of title ix,davis,at,when the violation is caused by official policy,which may be a policy of deliberate indifference to providing adequate training or guidance that is obviously necessary for implementation of a specific program or policy of the recipient.implementation of an official policy can certainly be a circumstance in which the recipient exercises significant control over the harasser and the environment in which the harassment occurs.id.at.
in applying this standard we take note of canton discussion of what is meant by an obvious need for training.it recognized that a need could be obvious for reasons other than knowledge of previous incidents within the municipality 
for example,city policymakers know to a moral certainty that their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.the city has armed its officers with firearms,in part to allow them to accomplish this task.thus,the need to train officers in the constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force can be said to be so obvious,that failure to do so could properly be characterized as deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.
canton,at.citation omitted.the court elaborated on this point in board of county commissioners of bryan county,oklahoma brown,d,which held that a sheriff isolated failure to perform adequate screening of a potential deputy did not establish deliberate indifference to a risk that the deputy would use excessive force,id.at.but it reaffirmed canton holding that claims could be established by a failure to train for certain obvious risks in canton,we did not foreclose the possibility that evidence of a single violation of federal rights,accompanied by a showing that a municipality has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an obvious potential for such a violation,could trigger municipal liability.id.at.see allen muskogee,cir when city trained officers to leave cover and approach armed,suicidal,emotionally disturbed persons and try to disarm them,plaintiff claim fell within the narrow range of circumstances under which a single violation of federal rights may be a highly predictable consequence of failure to train officers to handle recurring situations with an obvious potential for such a violation internal quotation marks omitted see also brown gray,cir.
evidence at summary judgment 
we now review the evidence presented in the filings in the light most favorable to plaintiffs to determine whether it can satisfy the above standard.see escue,at.at summary judgment,
the relevant inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law s ummary judgment will not lie if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.

the cu football program is one of the premier programs in the country.from the team had the record among all teams in division of the national collegiate athletic association ncaa.it won the national championship in,finished first in the big conference three times between and,and was the big conference champion in.
as the report of a cu independent investigative commission iic report observed cu success on the field has been partly the result of an effective recruiting program that attracts the attention of the country elite football prospects.the ncaa,which closely regulates many aspects of the recruiting process,allows schools like cu to bring up to prospects to campus each fall during football season.in the cu paired each visiting recruit with an ambassador,usually female,who escorted the recruit around campus throughout the visit.cu also matched recruits with players selected by the coaching staff,including the head coach.robert chichester,an attorney in the cu counsel office and later associate athletic director,said that the,who were usually underclassmen,were chosen because they knew how to party and how to show recruits a good time,and would do a good job of entertaining them.vol.vi at dep.of robert chichester.one host put it 
t he whole goal is to have the top recruits come from all over the nation to come to your school,because that future of the team t he position that we placed in is that we supposed to take these recruits out,show them a good time,go out to dinner with them,just have them interact with other athletes and just students in general.
vol.vii at.
plaintiffs were assaulted during a recruiting visit in december.cu won the big conference championship on december.recruits visited campus a few days later.according to one recruit who was present at the assaults,on the night of thursday,december,some of his fellow recruits had sex with female students in a room at a local hotel.he had stayed in his own room,but the next day he was assured by players that he could expect similar treatment that night and every weekend if he came to cu.
cu football players talked to a female cu student,who was a tutor for the athletic department,about getting together with her and other female students on friday,december.at least one of the players understood that the purpose was to provide recruits another chance to have sex.the tutor,along with gilmore,simpson and others,had planned to spend the evening at simpson apartment.the tutor asked simpson if four football players could come over later,and simpson agreed.between and about football players and recruits arrived.although some apparently left shortly after arriving,others remained.one player who was leaving was told by the tutor that he should stay because it was about to go down,which he understood to mean that the women would begin showing recruits a good time.vol.vi at internal quotation marks omitted.
within an hour or so simpson,who was intoxicated,went to her bedroom to sleep.she awoke later to find two naked men removing her clothes.the door was locked.she was then sexually assaulted,both orally and vaginally,by recruits and players surrounding her bed.in the same room at the same time,two players and a third man,who was either a player or a recruit,were sexually engaged with gilmore,who was too intoxicated to consent.simpson and gilmore were not the only females allegedly assaulted that night three other women were sexually harassed by players in the apartment and a fourth had nonconsensual sex with two players after leaving the apartment.simpson later withdrew from cu,and gilmore eventually left colorado for a year.
the central question in this case is whether the risk of such an assault during recruiting visits was obvious.in our view,the evidence could support such a finding.
the association of sexual misconduct with college football programs had been a matter of widespread reporting and concern for many years.the women sports foundation,amicus curiae in this appeal,has pointed to at least articles addressing the topic in various mainstream news publications between and plaintiffs assaults.there were also a number of articles in the chronicle of higher education,including at least one expressly noting the risk of sexual misconduct in connection with recruiting.academic research in the early concluded that male student athletes were more prone to commit sexual assault than other male students.cu handbook for football players contains the following paragraph 
a recent study conducted by the national institute of mental health found that athletes participated in of the sexual attacks on college campuses.another study conducted at towson state university center for the study and prevention of campus violence found that athletes are times more likely to commit date rape.
cu itself was a specific focus of concern.a sports illustrated article on unlawful conduct by cu football players reported a number of cases of sexual assault by the players.one passage stated that the head football coach at the time,bill mccartney,
sometimes does seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation either h e told a television reporter,rape by definition is a violent act an act whereby there real physical violence involved,and so i do think that what we talking about here.said boulder district attorney alex hunter,it obvious to me that one more spot in that seminar should be reserved for the football coach.
rick reilly,what price glory sports illustrated,at.in two cu football players were charged with rape and sexual assault arising from separate incidents.
the cu recruiting program was implicated in such misconduct in,when rick neuheisel was head coach.as the iic report detailed,on december a group of girls attended a party at an hotel hosted by a cu football player for two visiting recruits.one of the girls alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by recruits at the party.although the victim was not a cu student protected by title ix,that circumstance is irrelevant to evaluation of the risk to cu women.
in january cu chancellor richard byyny learned that boulder police were investigating the incident.he emailed athletic director richard tharp 
i worry about the oversight we have of the recruits while they are in our charge.allegedly the recruits were all drinking beer in their rooms.i realize we do have control over immature potential students.however,we should clearly spell out our rules,responsibilities,and expectations.
vol.ii at iic report internal quotation marks omitted.
after the incident came to the attention of boulder county district attorney alex hunter,he requested a meeting with cu officials.on february,hunter and assistant district attorneys peter hofstrom and mary keenan met with byyny,tharp,and chichester,who was working in cu counsel office.byyny understood that the purpose of the meeting was to provide the da office with an opportunity to ask cu to continue to try and help educate its students,make sure that the students and the coaches were well informed about university policies and expectations in order to work to prevent these kinds of events from occurring.vol.vi at dep.of richard byyny.
at the meeting keenan,who later became da,said that she was concerned about women being made available to recruits for sex.she explained that a girl in the position of the victim,who was drunk at the time,would have sex with football recruits,whether consensual or nonconsensual.id.at notes of mary jo white.she asserted that the assault was isolated and indicated a real problem from which people at cu were turn ing their heads.id.at notes of robert chichester.according to keenan,she recommended that cu adopt a policy of zero tolerance for alcohol and sex in the recruiting program,develop written policies and procedures for supervising recruits,and offer football players annual training by the da on sexual assault.she told tharp that he need ed to take measures to prevent this because if it happens again,the da office is going to deal with it very seriously.id.at dep.of mary keenan.cu was now,as she put it at the time,on notice.id.
hunter also emphasized the changes that he thought needed to be made in the cu football recruiting program.the most important was that the needed to be instructed on what was and was not appropriate conduct.furthermore,the head coach needed to be tougher with athletes,and the coaching staff needed to explain clearly what conduct was appropriate for and others.
the parties dispute the vigor of cu response after the meeting.cu claims that it made significant policy revisions,but plaintiffs have questioned whether these revisions were actually aimed at remedying or correcting the problem.cu primary response was not admitting the two recruits involved in the assault and suspending the player for a semester.in addition,in april chancellor byyny instructed athletic director tharp to develop new policies on behavior,including a rule on activities threatening the health or safety of and others.tharp responded that new policies would be drafted,but he expressed concern that new including the impose a higher standard upon than other students.as tharp acknowledged in his deposition,none of the eventual recruiting or policy most substantive of which was apparently a ban on alcohol or tobacco for either sexual contact between recruits and females or the responsibilities of other than a general statement that should comply with colorado law.furthermore,although cu adopted a revised policy in,it applied equally to everyone on campus.it included nothing specific to recruiting or athletics,and although tharp had been involved in drafting the policy in and,he admitted that he played no role in its development after december,when the assault occurred.as for the recommendations by prosecutors hunter and keenan,no changes were apparent to chichester following the meeting.id.at.
new head coach gary barnett arrived at cu in.deposition testimony of three players suggests that still received little or no direction on appropriate behavior or responsibilities.one player testified that he had been told that his responsibilities as a were to s how the recruits around,and that t hey really do go into detail regarding your responsibilit ies.id.at.barnett,who had learned from chichester about the assault and subsequent meeting with the da,began distributing a football handbook that included one page of addressing date rape and social policy.vol.ii at.the page warned players not to put themselves in a position to lose everything they ha d worked hard for by committing a sexually aggressive act.id.it cautioned that no means no even if you think she means yes a girl never owes you sex and n ever initiate intercourse if the woman is intoxicated or passed out.id.there is evidence that coaches or senior players reviewed at least some of the information in the handbook with players during training camp.the handbook does not,however,address the risk of sexual assault or harassment in the recruiting program,and does not provide guidance to on appropriate behavior by themselves and recruits.the only pages to address recruiting provided basic instructions on the use of a stipend provided by cu to hosts for entertainment of recruits.
