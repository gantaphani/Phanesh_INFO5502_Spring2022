roxanne moffitt pignanelli ran for the pueblo school district board of education in but lost the election.a middle school drama teacher at the time,she blamed her employer,pueblo school district,for her loss,and sued under for alleged violations of her constitutional rights.pignanelli claimed the school district and its representatives,including the superintendent of schools,violated the first amendment,equal protection clause,and due process clause by causing her to lose the school board election and then failing to renew her teaching contract.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims,and pignanelli appealed.we agree with the district court that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.exercising jurisdiction under,we therefore affirm.
factual background 
viewed in the light most favorable to pignanelli,see clanton cooper,cir,the facts as alleged establish the following.
the school district hired pignanelli in august,to serve as a middle school drama teacher under a contract.district deputy superintendent john musso negotiated with pignanelli for her salary and benefits package,and ultimately placed pignanelli into a higher pay grade than her educational qualifications and teaching experience supported at the time.despite this discrepancy,the contract was approved by the school board and pignanelli began her tenure as a teacher in the district.in august,pignanelli was rehired,again under a contract,to continue in the same position.
a week after her rehiring,pignanelli announced her candidacy for the upcoming school board election.one of the issues that developed in the campaign was whether district superintendent joyce bales should be removed.pignanelli was perceived by some,including bales,as a someone who would vote for bales removal.because of this perception,bales sought to discredit pignanelli candidacy and cause her to lose the election.bales did this by combing through pignanelli personnel file,and then initiating a school board review of her salary and qualifications.on september,at a confidential executive session of the board,pignanelli salary was reduced to the level her experience and education supported.
soon after the executive session,the pueblo chieftain,a local newspaper,reported pignanelli salary reduction.one of the reporters for the chieftain made a request under colorado open records act for pignanelli personnel records,which were duly handed over by the board.these records were then made public through publication in the chieftain.at the same time,both pignanelli and superintendent bales were interviewed by the newspaper for additional,related stories.the controversy over pignanelli salary and her concomitant candidacy for the school board fed into several stories in the local media up through the election day in november.at the election,the voters chose not to elect pignanelli.
despite her election defeat,pignanelli maintained her position as a teacher through the end of the school year.at the end of the year,pignanelli drama spot was changed to a language arts,speech,and drama position.pignanelli was not qualified for this new position,and was not hired for it.as she had been working under a contract,the district had no contractual obligation to rehire her.
based on her failure to obtain office and the loss of her teaching position,pignanelli determined her constitutional rights had been violated.she therefore brought suit under against the school district,superintendent bales,and the president of the school board.the district court granted summary judgment to all three defendants.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.seegmiller laverkin city,cir.summary judgment should only be granted where,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.although the burden is on the moving party,the may not rest on its pleadings,but rather must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial as to those dispositive matters for which it carries the burden of proof.applied genetics int l,first affiliated,cir.
pignanelli appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on all the claims she raised in the district court.interpreting her briefing as best we can,pignanelli alleges she can overcome the summary judgment hurdle on her claims alleging violations of due process,first amendment employment retaliation,and violations of equal protection.we conclude pignanelli has waived review of her due process claim by failing to cite any legal authority for the claim in her appellate brief,waived review of her first amendment retaliation claim by failing to argue it in the district court,and can not obtain relief on her equal protection claim because it fails on the merits.
due process 
pignanelli has waived appellate review of any due process claim she may have alleged against the defendants in the district court.although pignanelli asks us to reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,she must do more than simply request reversal for us to consider the merits of her claim.see fed.a becker kroll,cir an issue or argument insufficiently raised in the opening brief is deemed waived.rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure requires the appellant to set forth appellant contentions and reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and part of the record on which the appellant relies.fed.a a.because pignanelli has not directed us to any legal authority or record evidence supporting a claim for relief under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,her appeal on this ground must fail.
first amendment employment retaliation 
as with her due process claim,we will not consider the merits of pignanelli first amendment employment retaliation claim.pignanelli argues for the first time on appeal that she meets the analysis,set forth in dill city of edmond,for public employees asserting a claim of retaliation for exercising their first amendment rights.see dill city of edmond,cir citing connick myers,d pickering bd.of,d.under dill,if the public employee speech involves a matter of public concern,we must balance his or her interest in commenting on such matters against the interest of the government employer in an effective,work environment.id.
by failing to argue dill in the district court,however,pignanelli has waived review of the issue in this court.we do not review claims on appeal that were not presented below.wolfe barnhart,cir rosewood,sunflower diversified,cir.pignanelli failed to allege the requirements for a first amendment employment retaliation claim in her district court complaint,summary judgment briefing in the district court,or at the hearing held by the district court.in fact,as pignanelli made clear in her summary judgment briefing,the basis of her first amendment challenge was her election employment retaliation.see.at pl.resp.br.at this is a first amendment case about the defendants hijacking a school board election.id.at pl.resp.br.at plaintiff first amendment claim revolves around her status as a candidate running for the board of education.her claim is that the defendants disclosed confidential information about her to the media,sabotaging and destroying her candidacy.

equal protection 
finally,repackaging a first amendment speech right two distinct harms were inflicted upon her in violation of the equal protection clause.she complains of her loss in the school board election in november,and her loss of salary and position as a teacher at pueblo school district after the school year.both harms,she asserts,result from the defendants intentional or purposeful discrimination design ed to favor one individual or class over another.aplt.br.to put it another way,pignanelli asserts the defendants violated the equal protection
