jessica garcia,on behalf of her daughter myisha,alleges that the albuquerque public school district failed to formulate an individualized education program for myisha in the fall semester of,in violation of the individuals with disabilities education act.by way of remedy,the garcias seek certain compensatory educational services.the district court,though acknowledging the school district procedural deficiency,held that no such services should be awarded as a matter of equity because,among other things,myisha has dropped out of school,demonstrated an unwillingness to return to school,and could essentially receive the very services she seeks simply by in school.on appeal,we do not excuse the school district for neglecting its statutory duties to myisha,but neither can we say that the district court abused its discretion in exercising its traditional equitable powers.
although this appeal concerns only the school district conduct in fall,the parties initial administrative dispute extended to myisha education in prior school years as well.because the district court remedial decision relied on the full record developed by the parties,an appreciation of that record is essential to our own analysis.
the genesis of this case takes us back to,when,while in fifth grade,myisha was diagnosed with a specific learning disability affecting her reading abilities.this diagnosis qualified myisha to begin receiving special education services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea or the act,see a,a federal statute aimed at helping states provide disabled children with a free and appropriate public education fape,see id.et.in order to provide myisha with a fape,the school district was obligated to develop and implement an individualized education program iep calculated to meet myisha specific educational needs,id.d,and then to review and revise the iep annually,id.d.the school district was also required to involve myisha mother in this process.see generally id.
after her diagnosis,myisha school district did exactly as it should,providing her with services and benefits through the creation and annual renewal of ieps.despite these efforts,however,myisha academic performance began to decline by the time she entered middle school,when she also began to display significant disciplinary that only escalated as she entered high school in the fall of.
for the school year,myisha enrolled in ninth grade at west mesa high school,and the school district formulated and approved in may an iep for her freshman year.the iep acknowledged myisha prior behavioral and academic struggles and set out various initiatives to help myisha overcome them.during the fall semester,however,myisha frequently skipped class,recording unexcused class absences in that semester alone,and did not do well when she did attend class.myisha also began to engage in significant drug and alcohol use.making matters worse,on december,myisha was arrested,apparently for attacking her mother and brother.as a result of the arrest,myisha spent the spring semester of at the bernalillo county juvenile detention center jdc and the mesilla valley residential treatment center.
while myisha was still at the jdc in august,that institution completed a short,form intended to serve as an interim iep.substantively,the interim iep went no further than evaluating myisha abilities as reading is help in math,and recommending place ment in with support.this interim iep did not meet the full requirements for annual ieps under idea,as set out in d,but it appears the jdc and the school district intended only that the iep be employed on a basis during myisha temporary assignment to the jdc.
after her release from the jdc,myisha again enrolled in ninth grade at west mesa high school for the school year.the school district,however,did not review and revise her iep prior to the start of school.indeed,for most of the fall semester,the staff at west mesa did not even notice that myisha lacked an updated iep.the school district explains this oversight as a result of data entry issues with myisha file in the school district computer system.specifically,because the august interim iep from the jdc was logged into myisha electronic file,the computer system showed that myisha had a new iep as of august,apparently leading west mesa to believe incorrectly,until at least november,that it did not need to revise her iep for the school year.yet,despite apparently lacking guidance from any iep,the school did enroll myisha in a curriculum consisting almost entirely of special education courses for the fall term.
myisha continued to exhibit serious disciplinary problems,and she recorded days of unexcused absences during the fall semester.that semester effectively ended for myisha on december,when she was suspended for the remainder of the term for fighting at school.though her suspension did not prevent her from doing so,myisha did not attend any of her final examinations,and,as a result,she failed all of her fall classes.
having finally realized that no iep existed for the school year,the school district convened an iep meeting on december,to create one for the second half of the year.the school district made many attempts to secure garcia attendance at the meeting,but ultimately decided to hold the meeting in her absence after garcia failed to return phone calls and letters and in light of her history of missing iep and other school meetings.
the gathering did produce a new iep,but myisha did not attend school at all during the remainder of that school year.in early january,the garcias apparently moved to another area within the school district,necessitating that garcia obtain for myisha a transfer to del norte high school.unfortunately,by the time garcia requested the transfer,it was too late in the semester for myisha to earn any credits towards graduation.as a result,it appears that myisha did not attend any school during spring semester.
in april,garcia filed a request for an idea due process hearing with the new mexico public education department,claiming,in essence,that the school district had failed to provide myisha with the fape promised her by idea during the and school years because the may iep effective for was inadequate and because there was no iep in place for until december.
after taking evidence from the parties,the hearing officer determined that there were at least three irregularities in the school district actions the school district failed to implement some of the reading instruction components of the may iep the school district failed to have a new iep in place for the fall semester and,relatedly,the school district failed to ensure that teachers implemented an iep during fall.despite these irregularities,the hearing officer ruled that the school district actions did not result in a denial of access to a fape because the record failed to show that the irregularities would have made any difference to,or imposed any harm on,myisha.in the hearing officer words,a school can not provide fape to a student who is not there,either physically or by virtue of her attitude.see hearing officer final decision at.
garcia appealed to an administrative appeal officer aao within the new mexico public education department.the aao agreed with the hearing officer that the school district procedural missteps did not constitute a violation of idea per se,and that myisha had to show educational harm or loss of educational opportunity to have been denied fape as a result of alleged procedural violations.admin.appeal decision at.but the aao disagreed with the hearing officer that the absence of a current iep in fall did not result in harm or that the lack of an iep was excusable due to myisha poor behavior.the aao stated in relevant part that the district failure to have a current iep in place in the fall semester of can not be blamed on student behavior or truancy whether having an iep in place would have altered the semester experience for student is pure conjecture as to what might have been.id.at.as such,the aao determined that the school district effectively denied myisha access to a fape in the fall of.by way of an equitable compensatory award,the aao ordered the school district to conduct a new and independent evaluation of myisha needs and to develop a reading program for her based upon the evaluation findings.
while the administrative appeal was pending,myisha enrolled again in the ninth time at del norte high the school year.before the school year began,the school district conducted a comprehensive evaluation of myisha and developed a revised iep.during this third attempt at ninth grade,myisha displayed a remarkable change of attitude and performance myisha consistently attended school,did well in every class,and achieved a grade point average for the year.
the school district also developed and implemented a revised iep for the school year,myisha sophomore year.unfortunately,however,myisha seemed to return to her prior habits,frequently skipping class and using drugs and alcohol.three days before the end of the fall semester,myisha mother kicked her out of the family home.since that incident,myisha has not regularly attended school for any material period of time,although,with the aid of her attorney,she was at least formally at another high school highland for the school year.see dist.op.at.
following the aao decision,garcia brought suit in federal court,claiming that the aao should have found further violations of idea and that the compensatory education awarded by the aao was insufficient.the school district,meanwhile,sought reversal of the aao order.
the district court ruled in favor of the school district on all scores.on the merits of whether the school district effectively denied myisha a fape,the district court,much like the original hearing officer,reasoned that it was myisha own behavior,rather than the school district procedural deficiencies,that caused any loss of educational opportunity in fall,and that the school district therefore had no liability under idea.dist.op.at.alternatively,the district court held that,even had the school district procedural failures harmed myisha and the school district was liable for that harm,no award of compensatory educational services was warranted as a matter of equity in light of the fact that myisha had demonstrated a pattern of failing to use the educational opportunities provided to her by the school district despite the district exceptional efforts to her in school.id.at.according to the district court,t here is no basis for granting what is essentially equitable relief to someone who neither deserves it nor wants it.id.at.
in reaching its result,the district court also stressed that the compensatory educational services the garcias sought through court award would effectively be available to her if and when she should simply decide to return to school.id.at.for example,the garcias asked the court to order an educational reevaluation of myisha and educational planning with an independent expert.see appellant app.at.yet,idea already provides for objective educational evaluations and for educational planning based on those evaluations.a d.similarly,the other remedial measure sought by the the state pay for myisha placement outside of the traditional public high school setting if such a placement is necessary to enable her to progress towards also already guaranteed to public education students by idea.see id.a b.
on appeal,the garcias challenge the district court disposition only with respect to whether the school district failed to provide myisha with a fape in fall and whether equitable compensatory relief is warranted for that failure.for its part,the school district defends the correctness of the district court reasoning,and it also raises the question of mootness,arguing that there is no active controversy that need be resolved because myisha has shown a lack of desire to return to school or take advantage of any compensatory education services that might be awarded as a result of this litigation.
we must address the question of mootness first because the existence of a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal court jurisdiction.mcclendon city of albuquerque,cir.to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii,and thus to justify a federal court jurisdiction,the parties dispute must not only be live at the time the suit is filed,but the parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit throughout the various stages of litigation.lewis continental bank,d internal quotation and citation omitted.in essence,t his means that,throughout the litigation,the plaintiff must have suffered,or be threatened with,an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.spencer kemna,d internal quotation and citation omitted.
the school district contends that this appeal is moot because myisha is now nineteen years old,is no longer compelled under state law to attend high school and has expressed little or no desire to return to school or to continue her education.in other words,because little evidence exists indicating that myisha intends to take advantage of any benefits she might be awarded from this suit,the school district believes there is no active case or controversy to be resolved.
we can not agree.if the garcias allegations are true,then myisha suffered an actual injury deprivation of a fape,at least for the fall semester.and this is a kind of injury that congress has authorized the federal courts to remedy,stating that a district court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.i c iii.indeed,pursuant to the statutory grant of remedial discretion,courts have commonly awarded exactly the kinds of compensatory educational services that the garcias seek in this suit.see generally allan osborne,remedies for a school district failure to provide services under idea,ed.law,see also g ex rel.rg fort bragg dependent,cir collecting cases approving compensatory education awards.
it seems to us that the school district rests less on an assertion that we are powerless to issue a compensatory remedy in this case and more on a prediction that myisha is unlikely to take full advantage of any such award.but while the school district predictive assertions about what myisha may or may not do in the event she prevails in this litigation may be relevant in assessing whether equitable relief is very different question we take up are beside the point for purposes of assessing mootness.for this case to be considered live,it is enough that the garcias have alleged an actual injury traceable to the school district for which we can issue a remedy.after all,when a plaintiff brings suit for damages,the fact that he or she is not likely to make good use of any ultimate compensatory award hardly means we are without jurisdiction to entertain the claim.
informative by way of contrast is a pair of our prior cases,indep.sch.dist,cir,and moseley bd.of educ.of albuquerque public,cir.in those matters we emphasized two factors that,together,suggested mootness in the idea context the claimant has graduated from high school and thus has become ineligible to receive continuing benefits under idea and the claimant seeks prospective relief.see,at moseley,at.when both factors are present,any court decision on the merits in those cases would,we held,have no effect on the present or future actions of either party because the only relief sought is relief that the student can no in most instances,need no.moseley,at see also honig doe,d.
in myisha case,however,not only is she statutorily eligible to receive idea benefits being nineteen years old and not graduated,but she seeks compensatory rather than prospective relief,complaining not about the entitlement to future benefits but instead seeking a remedy for past wrongs.in both and moseley,we implied that such a claim would likely not be moot and for good reason after all,if a student has not graduated and is still eligible to receive idea benefits in the future,seeking relief is hardly a moot point.likewise,even if a student is ineligible going forward under idea,seeking relief to make up for past deprivations also seems entirely appropriate far from indicating that such a case is moot,then,our precedent tends to confirm that this controversy is very much live.
turning to the district court disposition of myisha claim on the merits,we begin by reiterating what is not before us.although the garcias initially claimed deprivations of a fape in both the and school years,on appeal they limit their challenge to the fall semester.
on the question of liability for that term,the garcias contend that the school district violated idea by failing to formulate and implement an iep,and that this failure resulted in an effective denial of a fape to myisha.the school district responds by arguing that the tardiness in formulating an iep for fall was merely a procedural irregularity that did not cause any substantive harm or comprise an effective denial of a fape.in pressing its position,the school district emphasizes that it provided myisha with special education services even in the absence of an updated iep and that myisha behavioral problems prevented her from receiving any benefit from an updated iep even had there been one.
we approach this dispute mindful,as always,of our standard of review.by statute,congress has set out rather unique rules governing the review of liability in idea claims.unlike the deferential review typically afforded to administrative adjudication of statutory claims,congress requires district courts to apply a modified de novo standard when reviewing agency disposition in the idea context.see i c murray montrose county sch,cir.specifically,the district court must receive the record of the administrative proceedings,hear additional evidence at the request of a party,and base its decision on the preponderance of evidence.i c.at the same time,though the statute specifies that review is de novo,the supreme court has interpreted the requirement that the district court receive the administrative record to mean that due weight must be given to the administrative proceedings,bd.of educ.rowley,d,the fact findings of which are considered prima facie correct,ex rel.nebo sch,cir.on appeal of the district court judgment on the record,we are bound to apply these very same principles of review.nebo sch,at.
bearing this standard of review in mind,we turn to the inquiry set out by the supreme court as our test for assessing liability has the school district complied with the procedures set forth in idea are the special education services provided to the student reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational in other words,has the school district fulfilled its obligation to provide the student with a fape rowley,at.
while a failure to meet either one of these considerations may result in court ordered relief,erickson albuquerque pub,cir,the type of relief sought will often determine which of the two considerations is dispositive in a particular case.for example,where a school district has allegedly failed to comply with a procedural requirement of idea and the plaintiff seeks only an order mandating prospective compliance,then question whether the school district complied with idea procedural requirements may be the crucial inquiry,while question whether the school district provided a fape may often be irrelevant because the claim seeks only to vindicate the student procedural,rather than substantive,rights under idea.but where,as here,only compensatory relief is sought,the pivotal question is,because an award of compensatory education vindicates the student substantive right to receive a fape and compensates for a past deprivation of educational opportunity rather than a deprivation of purely procedural rights.see urban jefferson county sch.dist,cir erickson,at c ompensatory education is not an appropriate remedy for a procedural violation of the idea.of course,where a procedural violation is alleged to have caused the substantive deprivation of a fape the case here,question still bears obvious significance.
in this appeal,the school district does not dispute that it failed to comply with idea procedural requirements in fall.for that reason,and because the award of compensatory education that the garcias seek depends primarily on question of our rowley analysis,we proceed directly to consider that,whether such a failure resulted in an effective denial of fape for myisha.or,more precisely,whether the procedural defect of not having a current iep in place in fall amounted to a substantive failure to provid e personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from the school.rowley,at.
both the hearing officer and the district court held that,in light of myisha truancy and behavioral problems,as well as the school district provision of remedial classes to myisha,the school district failure to conduct an iep for the fall semester was immaterial.meanwhile,the aao believed that no such conclusion could be certain because,had the school district developed a new iep at the start of the term,it might have helped myisha improve her behavior and achieve the sort of success she found in.as the disunity of these opinions indicate,the answer to the liability question in this case is not altogether free from doubt.
adding to this doubt is the fact that the garcias challenge the district court decision on two grounds that do not appear to have been squarely addressed previously in this circuit or others.
first,the garcias argue that the lack of an iep during most of the fall term constitutes a per se denial of fape.this argument seems,at first blush,to run headlong into our precedent holding that procedural failures under idea amount to substantive failures only where the procedural inadequacy results in an effective denial of a fape but the garcias pose a slightly different and subtler question that we have never fully confronted.they assert that,because the iep is the central vehicle that congress created to deliver fape to disabled children and the focal point of court review under rowley,the total lack of an iep for a school term,as opposed to merely a defective iep,is more than a technical deficiency rather,its entire absence forecloses any possibility that the school district adequately provided a fape and also prevents effective court review of a school district compliance with idea.
in aid of this argument,the garcias cite to two cases in which the absence of an iep was found to be a substantive denial of a fape.see knable bexley city sch,cir dep t of educ.cari rae,d.but these cases dealt with yet another,slightly different factual scenario where no iep was ever developed or implemented for the.here,of course,the school district violated idea not by failing ever to prepare an iep for myisha,but by failing to update her iep in the annual,timely fashion the statute requires.also,apparently unlike the cases cited by the garcias,the school district in this case provided myisha with a full curriculum of special education classes even in the fall semester so that it remains unclear from our record whether any additional or different services would have been provided had myisha iep been revised before that term began.
second,the garcias argue that myisha behavior can not be used to defeat the school district liability under idea.and this,too,presents us with a thorny and uncertain path.on the one hand,we acknowledge potential pitfalls in deeming harmless procedural violations of idea for students who fail to exhibit enthusiasm for school.after all,a student lack of enthusiasm,at least in some cases,may be related to his or her disability.such students are perhaps most in need of vigilant attention from their schools,and there is at least the possibility that,had the school district reassessed myisha needs and implemented a new iep at the start of the fall semester,the school might have been successful in helping myisha to overcome her behavioral tendencies and to increase her commitment to possibility not entirely out of the question on this record in light of the potential myisha demonstrated in,the very next school year.
on the other hand,liability under idea is determined not by imagining the possibilities of what might have been,but rather b
