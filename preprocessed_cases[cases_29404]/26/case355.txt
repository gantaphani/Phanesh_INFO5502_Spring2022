the iota xi chapter of sigma chi fraternity the chapter and two of its officers,ryan duckwitz and justin pietro,sued george mason university the university and several of its administrators in the eastern district of virginia,alleging,inter alia,constitutional claims under.the chapter and certain of its members were sanctioned by the university following their involvement in a series of disciplinary incidents,and the plaintiffs allege that those sanctions deprived the chapter and its members of their procedural due process and free speech rights.the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants,see iota xi chapter of the sigma chi fraternity patterson,d,and this appeal followed.as explained below,we affirm.
the university is a public institution located in fairfax county,virginia,where,until may,the chapter was an officially recognized student group between february and august,the chapter and its members were involved in a string of incidents that culminated in the revocation of the chapter official university recognition and the individual discipline of several chapter members.
five separate disciplinary incidents led to the chapter being sanctioned.the first such incident occurred on february,when the chapter a party at an house.a female university student asserted that she was sexually assaulted at the party by a chapter member.the victim initiated administrative charges against the chapter member,and the university sexual assault hearing panel subsequently adjudicated the member as responsible.as a result,the chapter member was expelled from the university.
the second such incident occurred in,when several chapter members took part in a party where underage guests drank excessively.as a result of this second incident,defendant girard mulherin,dean of students,placed the chapter on interim suspension on august.mulherin lifted the interim suspension on september,after determining that the chapter had not authorized the party,and that the chapter had fully cooperated with the university investigation.
the third incident took place on september,when the chapter hosted another party where underage guests consumed alcohol,and where a second female university student claimed that she had been sexually assaulted by a chapter member.the victim filed an administrative complaint in connection with that event,and the offending chapter member was adjudicated to be responsible for the sexual assault.he was placed on disciplinary probation for the remainder of his undergraduate career.
finally,two incidents of alleged hazing occurred on december.the first hazing incident occurred at about,when several chapter members and pledges gathered near fenwick library and began to sing and march the library incident.defendant michele goubadia,associate director for student activities,greek life,witnessed the event from her office and concluded that the chapter was conducting hazing activity.the second hazing incident occurred later that day,when goubadia learned that a chapter pledge had informed his instructor that he could not go home to retrieve an assignment the classroom incident.the instructor inferred that the student could not go home because of hazing by the chapter,and she informed goubadia about the classroom incident.in response to these suspected hazing incidents,goubadia placed the chapter on interim suspension,prohibiting it from participating in all social events,community service,and recruitment efforts.on december,goubadia sent a memorandum to defendant pamela patterson,associate dean of students,characterizing the two december events as hazing.that same day,patterson sent an interim suspension notice to the chapter,restricting it from conducting any social event where more than three chapter members or pledges were present,pending a university investigation.
the university subsequently determined that a disciplinary hearing was warranted on the five incidents described above.on february,the university informed the chapter that a disciplinary hearing would be conducted on may.after the chapter requested a detailed description of the charges against it,the university,on february,provided the chapter with a complaint listing the following charges 
on december,in the area of fenwick library on the george mason campus.
providing alcohol to.
underage consumption of.
sponsoring a party under conditions that resulted in sexual on a female guest.february,and september.
on march,dean mulherin offered to settle the charges with the chapter with a suspension of the chapter university recognition,which the chapter declined.the university provided the chapter,in advance of the disciplinary hearing,with a list of the witnesses that the university intended to call.
on may,the university convened a panel of three students from the university student judicial board the panel to address the four charges against the chapter.during a hearing the hearing,the chapter was permitted to make opening and closing statements,object to certain testimony,witnesses,and present evidence.
at the hearing,dean mulherin represented the university and presented several witnesses in support of the charges against the chapter.associate director goubadia testified concerning the library incident,which she characterized as hazing.juliet,the instructor involved in the classroom incident,also testified.with regard to the classroom incident,stated that she was concerned for hazing.it seemed to me that the chapter pledge was part of a kidnap process,part of a process where he not able to go home.additionally,the two female victims of the sexual assaults at parties testified that they had consumed alcohol at those parties despite being underage,and that they were sexually assaulted by chapter members.when the chapter representative sought to these witnesses about whether they had actually been sexually assaulted,mulherin stated that the prior sexual assault ruling should not be reopened,because to do so could revictimize the victim by going through the details of this event again.id.at.the panel hearing officer agreed and precluded further inquiry on that subject.a male friend of one of the sexual assault victims,who was with the victim on the night she was assaulted,also testified.he stated that he had seen the victim consuming alcoholic beverages at the party,and that when he looked for her later in the evening in the backyard of the house,chapter members told him to go back inside the house.he said that he later learned the victim had been sexually assaulted in a shed in the backyard.
the chapter also presented witnesses at the hearing.two of its witnesses testified as to the chapter overall character.one female witness,who was dating a chapter member,described the fraternity as welcoming and trustworthy,and explained that she had not seen any aggressive behavior against women by chapter members.another witness testified that the chapter had raised funds to assist him with medical bills.the chapter also presented testimony seeking to rebut the university allegation that it had engaged in hazing.several had been chapter pledges at the time of the library that the incident had just been a fun thing,not a hazing ritual.furthermore,the student who was involved in the classroom hazing incident testified that had misinterpreted his statements.he explained that the reason he could not retrieve his assignment was because he did not have his car that week and not because of hazing.he further explained that the assignment had been for extra credit,and that he felt it was unnecessary to retrieve it.
at the conclusion of the hearing,dean mulherin recommended that the chapter be permanently dismissed from campus.mulherin later explained that his recommendation was based on the chapter refusal to acknowledge that it had engaged in any wrongful conduct.characterizing the chapter communications leading up to the hearing as hostile in tone,he concluded that they had not come to a realization that they were engaged in conduct that was not acceptable.in mulherin view,the chapter refused to recognize that they had a problem.id.at.similarly,associate dean patterson stated that nobody from the fraternity showed any concern about the charges,only what the university was doing.id.at to.
by letter dated may,the university notified the chapter that the panel had concluded,by clear and convincing evidence,that the chapter had engaged in h azing on december,p roviding alcohol to underage persons on september,and s ponsoring social events under conditions that resulted in sexual assaults on female guests on february and september.the panel found the proof on the charge of underage consumption of alcohol to be insufficient,and dismissed that charge.
as a result of the panel decision,the university imposed the following sanctions.first,it revoked the chapter university recognition until at least september,second,the dean of students and the director of student activities were instructed to monitor membership in george mason university recognized fraternal organizations to insure that the current membership of sigma chi fraternity does not reemerge under a different name.finally,the decision was to be published as deemed appropriate by the dean of students in order to inform and educate the george mason university community regarding our institutional values.id.on november,the university publicized the results of the hearing in the mason gazette,a university newspaper.
the chapter appealed the panel decision to defendant sandy hubler,vice president for student life,who rejected the appeal on june.hubler explained that,in reaching her decision,she had carefully considered both the appeal document and supporting exhibits submitted by the chapter,and concluded that the chapter had failed to provide new evidence,identify a defect in the proceedings,or specify a standard of fairness that was abridged.she also determined that the sanctions imposed are proportionate to the offense.id.
several weeks after the hearing,in august,two additional incidents led to the discipline of several chapter members,including plaintiffs pietro and duckwitz.pertinent to these proceedings,pietro and another chapter member attended a greek organizational recruitment fair the orientation fair wearing sigma chi.a university official saw the two chapter members at the orientation fair and notified associate director goubadia.goubadia confronted the members and told them that the event was for recognized organizations only,and that they could not be included because the chapter was not a recognized student group.the second incident involved an golf tournament and brotherhood day by chapter members,including duckwitz,aspects of which contravened the university sanctions against the chapter.
these two incidents were ultimately referred to david shaw,the university director of judicial affairs.pietro,duckwitz,and four other chapter members were then charged with f ailure to comply with a university official,u nauthorized use of the george mason university name or logo,and f ailure to comply with an official judicial sanction.shaw conducted a disciplinary hearing on these charges and found that all six chapter members were responsible.as a result of that hearing,pietro was given a formal warning,placed on probationary status for one year,required to write a research paper on student ethics,and restricted from participating in any university sponsored extracurricular activities for the academic year.id.at.duckwitz was similarly given a formal warning,placed on probationary status,and restricted from participating in extracurricular activities for the academic year.id.at.
on august,the chapter,pietro,and duckwitz filed their complaint against the university and the administrator defendants in the eastern district of virginia.the complaint asserted claims under,alleging,inter alia,that the university and the administrator defendants had violated the plaintiffs fourteenth amendment rights to procedural due process the procedural due process claim,as well as their right to freedom of speech under the first amendment the free speech claims 
on september,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,by which they had sought to prevent the university from imposing its sanctions.then,on november,the court dismissed the university as a defendant,concluding that the university,as an arm of the commonwealth of virginia,could not be sued under without its consent.in february,the parties filed for summary judgment.pertinent to this appeal,the defendants memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment exceeded by two pages the page limit prescribed by the court local rules.rejecting the plaintiffs request that the memorandum be stricken in its entirety,the court instead ordered that its final two pages be stricken.on march,the court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants,and denied the plaintiffs for summary judgment.see iota xi chapter of the sigma chi fraternity patterson,d.
on april,the plaintiffs timely filed their notice of appeal in this matter.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment.see tigrett rector visitors of the of,cir.in assessing a summary judgment ruling,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable factual inferences in its favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.we are entitled to sustain a district court judgment on any ground apparent from the record.cfa inst.inst.of chartered fin.analysts of india,cir.finally,we review for abuse of discretion a district court imposition of sanctions for a violation of the court local rules.see dove codesco,cir.
in their appeal,the plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred in three respects in awarding summary judgment to the defendants.first,the plaintiffs contend that the court erred by rejecting their procedural due process claim.second,the plaintiffs assert that the court erroneously rejected their free speech claims.finally,the plaintiffs maintain that the court erred in failing to strike the memorandum submitted in support of the defendants motion for summary judgment.we address these contentions in turn.
the plaintiffs first contend that the district court should have provided appropriate relief to the chapter for having successfully proved that its due process rights were violated.br.of appellants.in order for the plaintiffs to succeed on their procedural due process claim,they are obliged to show a cognizable liberty or property interest the deprivation of that interest by some form of state action and that the procedures employed were constitutionally inadequate.stone of.med,cir.
in assessing a procedural due process claim,u nless there has been a deprivation of a protected liberty or property interest by state action,the question of what process is required is irrelevant,for the constitutional right to due process is simply not implicated.stone,at.the plaintiffs assert that the defendants,in sanctioning the chapter,deprived it and its members of two constitutionally protected rights.first,the plaintiffs contend that the university deprived the chapter of its constitutional liberty interest in its members right to free association by instituting sanctions against the chapter.second,the plaintiffs maintain that the university deprived the chapter of its property interest in its good name,honor,reputation,and integrity when the university published the results of the hearing in a university newspaper.
we first assess the issue of whether the university deprived the chapter and its members of a liberty interest in the right to free association.the first amendment protects two types of association intimate association and expressive association.see roberts jaycees,d.as the supreme court has explained,intimate association consists of the choice to enter into and maintain an intimate human relationship.id.at.the court has defined expressive association as the right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the first,assembly,petition for the redress of grievances,and the exercise of religion.id.at.in these proceedings,the plaintiffs rely solely on the contention,accepted by the district court,that the chapter members engaged in expressive asso
