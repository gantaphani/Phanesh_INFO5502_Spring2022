we sua sponte grant rehearing in this case,vacating our prior opinion filed on march,published at cir,in its entirety and substitute the following opinion in its place while the court reaches the same result,we address certain claims more fully.
the primary question in this appeal is whether petitioner,a student at the university of georgia,alleged facts sufficient to withstand defendants motion to dismiss her title ix claim based on sexual harassment.
background 
here,as alleged in her complaint at approximately on january,tiffany williams williams,then a student at the university of georgia uga,received a telephone call from uga basketball player tony cole.cole invited williams to his room in mcwhorter hall,the main dormitory for on the university campus.shortly after williams arrived at cole room,the two engaged in consensual sex.unbeknownst to williams,brandon williams,a uga football player,whom williams did not know,was hiding in cole closet.cole and brandon had previously agreed that brandon would hide in the closet while cole had sex with williams.when cole went to the bathroom and slammed the door behind him,brandon emerged from the closet naked,sexually assaulted williams,and attempted to rape her.
as brandon was sexually assaulting williams,cole was on the telephone with steven thomas,cole teammate,and charles grant,brandon williams teammate.cole told thomas and grant that they were running a train on williams thomas came to cole room,and cole allowed thomas to enter the room.with cole encouragement,thomas sexually assaulted and raped williams.
williams returned to her dormitory at approximately,called jennifer shaughnessy,and asked shaughnessy to come to her room.when shaughnessy arrived,williams was visibly upset and crying.williams explained what had happened in cole room,and shaughnessy told williams that she had been raped and should call the police.williams told shaughnessy that she did not want to call the police because she was afraid.while shaughnessy was with williams,the telephone rang.the caller identified himself as steven thomas,and williams immediately hung up.thomas had never called williams before that night.minutes later,thomas called again.williams said that she was afraid to answer the telephone,therefore,shaughnessy answered.thomas immediately asked,why did you hang up on me when shaughnessy said hello,thomas asked,is tiffany there shaughnessy told thomas that he had the wrong number,and she hung up.
williams then called her mother,who notified uga police of the incident that occurred in cole room.uga police arrived at williams room shortly after on january and arranged for williams to have a sexual assault exam performed.later that same day,williams requested that uga police process the charges against cole,brandon williams,and thomas.after filing her complaint with uga police,williams permanently withdrew from uga.
uga police conducted an investigation,as part of which,the police obtained cole telephone records.the records show that cole called williams dorm room several times in the days immediately following the incident and williams withdrawal.within hours of the incident,uga chief of police notified uga director of judicial programs of the incident and provided her with a written explanation.on april,a lieutenant from uga police provided the director of judicial programs with additional information about the investigation.several of the individuals who spoke with uga police supported williams allegations.
the actions of cole,brandon williams,and thomas constitute sexual harassment under the sexual harassment policy of the university of georgia.the policy applicable in january,however,provided that s exual harassment between students,neither of whom is employed by the university should be treated as a disciplinary matter and should be reported to the office of student affairs and not dealt with under the sexual harassment policy.cole,brandon williams,and thomas were charged with disorderly conduct under uga code of conduct.additionally,their coaches suspended them from their sports teams after an county grand jury indicted them in early april a uga judiciary panel,consisting of one staff member and two university students,held hearings almost a year after the january incident and decided not to sanction cole,brandon williams,or thomas.by the time of the hearing,cole and brandon williams no longer attended uga.thomas left uga in september.the three also faced criminal charges,but a jury acquitted brandon williams,and the prosecutor dismissed the charges against cole and thomas.
williams complaint also alleges that defendants james harrick,former head coach of uga men basketball team,vincent dooley,athletic director of the university of georgia athletic association ugaa,and michael adams,president of uga and ugaa,were personally involved in recruiting and admitting cole even though they knew he previously had disciplinary and criminal problems,particularly those involving harassment of women,at other colleges.
while coaching the men basketball team at the university of rhode island uri,harrick recruited cole to attend uri.when cole could not gain admission to uri,harrick helped cole gain admission to the community college of rhode island ccri.cole was eventually dismissed from ccri after allegations that in december and february he sexually assaulted two employees of the college athletic department by groping the women,putting his hands down their pants,and threatening them when they rejected his advances.cole pleaded no contest to criminal charges of misdemeanor trespass in connection with the two sexual assaults 
furthermore,while attending wabash valley college wvc in mount carmel,illinois,cole was dismissed from the basketball team because of disciplinary problems,including an incident in which he whistled at and made lewd suggestions to a female store clerk.adams,harrick,and dooley knew of the incident when they recruited and admitted cole.by the time cole was dismissed from wvc,harrick was at uga and again recruited cole.because cole did not meet uga standards for admission,harrick requested that adams admit cole through uga special admissions policy.adams is the sole decision maker when admitting an applicant under the special admissions policy.cole was admitted to attend uga on a full scholarship.
finally,williams alleges that uga officials received suggestions from that coaches needed to inform the about uga sexual harassment policy.despite adams and dooley duties to ensure compliance with uga policy,uga and ugaa failed to ensure that the received adequate information concerning uga sexual harassment policy applicable to and failed to enforce the policy against football and basketball players.
williams brought suit against uga,the board of regents of the university system of georgia board of regents,and ugaa for violation of title ix adams,harrick,and dooley as individuals and in their official capacities as uga and ugaa president,former head basketball coach,and athletic director of ugaa for violation of uga and the board of regents for violation of and cole,brandon williams,and thomas for state law torts.she also sought injunctive relief ordering the defendants to implement policies,and procedures to protect students like plaintiff from sexual harassment prohibited by title ix.
uga,ugaa,the board of regents,adams,harrick,and dooley all filed motions to dismiss williams claims.williams then moved to amend her complaint,adding additional factual allegations to support her claims,providing a more specific request for injunctive relief,and requesting declaratory relief against uga,ugaa,and the board of regents.for various reasons we discuss later,the district court dismissed williams title ix and claims,denied her requests for declaratory and injunctive relief,and denied in part and granted in part williams motion to amend her complaint.the district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over williams state law claims.in sum,the district court dismissed all the claims.
williams now appeals.after a thorough review of the record and the benefit of oral argument,we reverse the district court decisions to dismiss williams title ix claims against uga and ugaa and to deny williams motion to amend her complaint.in all other respects,we affirm the district court.

discussion 
williams raises four issues on the district court erred in denying williams motion to amend her complaint dismissing her title ix claims dismissing her claims and dismissing her claim for injunctive relief.
whether the district court erred in denying williams motion to amend her complaint 
williams argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to amend her complaint to file claims for a declaratory judgment against uga,the board of regents,and ugaa.in her first amended complaint,williams sought declaratory judgments that defendants sic application of its sexual harassment policy to tiffany williams was unconstitutional as it denied her equal protection of the laws and that defendants sic application of its sexual harassment policy to other similarly situated female students who are sexually harassed by other students denies equal protection of the laws.williams first amended complaint also contained additional factual allegations.at the time williams filed her first amended complaint,the board of regents,uga,adams,and dooley had filed a motion to dismiss only thomas had filed an answer.
federal rule of civil procedure a states that a party may amend the party pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served.a.for purposes of this rule,a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading.chilivis sec,cir.if the case has more than one defendant,and not all have filed responsive pleadings,the plaintiff may amend the complaint as a matter of course with regard to those defendants that have yet to answer.producers video,cir.
here,the clerk of the district court refused to file williams first amended complaint until williams obtained the consent of the opposing parties or leave of court.williams then filed a motion seeking permission from the court to file her first amended complaint.apparently believing that williams could not amend her complaint as a matter of course,the district court analyzed her first amended complaint under another provision of rule a.the district court permitted williams to amend her complaint to include additional factual allegations but rejected as futile her claims for declaratory judgments.
the district court erred in failing to allow williams to file her first amended complaint as a matter of course.when williams attempted to file her first amended complaint,thomas was the only defendant who had filed a responsive pleading.williams first amended complaint included additional claims against uga,the board of regents,and ugaa,none of whom had filed a responsive pleading.therefore,williams had the right to amend her complaint as a matter of course 
ugaa argues that we should affirm the district court holding as it applies to ugaa because the sexual harassment policy was not its policy and it lacks the authority to change the policy should the plaintiff prevail.we also reject this argument because it mimics the argument we just rejected.ugaa argument is simply that williams amended complaint is futile,but as we stated,the district court lacked the discretion to make that determination at that time.
ii.whether the district court erred in dismissing williams title ix claims 
williams argues that the district court erred in dismissing her title ix claims against uga,the board of regents,and ugaa.the district court concluded that williams claims failed because she was unable to meet the deliberate indifference requirement of the title ix cause of action.
this case presents a factually distinct scenario from our and the supreme court precedents.in each of those cases,the defendant did not learn about the alleged harasser proclivities until the alleged harasser became a teacher or a student at the defendant school.davis monroe county bd.of,d student gebser lago vista indep.sch,d teacher hawkins sarasota county sch,cir student.here,however,williams has alleged that adams,dooley,and harrick knew about cole past sexual misconduct when they recruited him and gained his admission to uga.furthermore,uga and ugaa knew about suggestions that the athletic coaches should inform about the applicable sexual harassment policy.although,a title ix recipient can not be held liable for misconduct that occurred before the alleged harasser was affiliated with the recipient,as we explain later,adams,dooley,and harrick preexisting knowledge of cole past sexual misconduct and the suggestions are relevant when determining whether williams alleged facts sufficient to survive the defendants motion to dismiss her title ix complaint.
title ix states,in pertinent part no person shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.although title ix does not expressly permit private enforcement suits,the supreme court has found an implied private right of action for individuals to enforce the mandates of title ix.cannon of,d.the court also has held that private individuals can obtain monetary damages.franklin gwinnett county pub,d.
s exual harassment is discrimination in the school context under title ix and in certain narrow circumstances,a plaintiff may be able to recover for harassment.davis monroe county bd.of,d.a plaintiff seeking recovery for a violation of title ix based on harassment must prove four elements.first,the defendant must be a title ix funding recipient.floyd waiters,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,reinstated,cir.second,an appropriate person must have actual knowledge of the discrimination or harassment the plaintiff alleges occurred.gebser lago vista indep.sch,d.a n appropriate person is,at a minimum,an official of the recipient entity with authority to take corrective action to end the discrimination.id.third,a funding recipient is liable for harassment only if the funding recipient acts with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities.davis,at.in considering this element,we analyze the conduct of the funding recipient,not the alleged harasser we do this to ensure that we hold the funding recipient liable only if the funding recipient deliberate indifference subjected the plaintiff to discrimination.id.at.therefore,we will not hold a funding recipient liable solely because a person affiliated with the funding recipient discriminated against or harassed the plaintiff.hawkins sarasota county sch,cir.fourth,the discrimination must be so severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim access to an educational opportunity or benefit.davis,at.
title ix claims against the board of regents 
as an initial matter,we hold that the district court properly dismissed williams title ix claim against the board of regents.even if we construe williams initial complaint and first amended complaint broadly and construe all the allegations in her favor,we can not find any allegations that an appropriate person with the board of regents had actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient programs and fail ed adequately to respond.gebser,at.williams alleged that the board of regents appointed adams and ceded substantial control over uga to him.adams,however,is not a member of the board of regents,and williams failed to allege that adams has authority to take action to change the policies of the board of regents.in the absence of any allegations that an appropriate person with the board of regents had actual knowledge of the acts that williams alleges constitute discrimination,williams title ix claim against the board of regents can not survive a b motion to dismiss.united states in currency,cir holding that an appeals court can affirm for any reason supported by the record,even if not relied upon by the district court.
title ix claims against uga and ugaa 
turning to the title ix claims against uga and ugaa,for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court erred in dismissing those claims.
are uga and ugaa title ix funding recipients 
as to the first element,the parties agree that uga is a funding recipient properly subject to title ix liability.although ugaa disputes that it is a funding recipient,we believe that williams has presented sufficient facts at this stage to show that we should treat ugaa as a funding recipient.here,williams has alleged that uga,a funding recipient,has ceded control over one of its programs,the athletic department,to ugaa and provided extensive funding to ugaa.notably,the court has not resolved whether this is sufficient to make an entity a funding recipient subject to title ix liability.ncaa smith,d see also alston.high sch.league,d.we are persuaded,however,by the analysis of the western district of michigan,noting that if we allowed funding recipients to cede control over their programs to indirect funding recipients but did not hold indirect funding recipients liable for title ix violations,we would allow funding recipients to receive federal funds but avoid title ix liability.cmtys.for equity.high sch.athletic ass n,d.we hold that williams complaint sufficiently alleges this element,and we leave for the discovery process and the district court to determine whether to treat ugaa like a funding recipient.
did an appropriate person have actual knowledge of the alleged harassment or discrimination 
as to the second element,we agree with williams that an appropriate person at both uga and ugaa had actual knowledge of the harassment.according to williams,adams,the president of uga and ugaa,and dooley,the athletic director of ugaa,had actual knowledge of the three forms of discrimination or harassment that williams allegedly faced cole recruitment and admission despite his past misconduct at several other schools the january,incident involving cole,brandon williams,and thomas and the discrimination that williams faced as a result of uga failure to respond adequately to her allegations against cole,brandon williams,and thomas.additionally,williams has sufficiently adams and dooley do not adams and dooley had authority to take corrective measures for uga and ugaa to end the alleged discrimination.thus,we must turn to the final two elements of a title ix cause of action.
were uga and ugaa deliberately indifferent to the alleged discrimination 
the davis court held that funding recipients are deliberately indifferent only where the recipient response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.davis,at.as the defendants note,the court also stated that district courts can identify a funding recipient response as not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law and dispose of the claim on a motion to dismiss.id.at.nevertheless,we believe that williams has alleged sufficient facts in her complaint to demonstrate that uga and ugaa were deliberately indifferent to the alleged discrimination and that the district court erred in concluding that the response was not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law.
the factual distinctiveness of this case is most relevant when determining whether uga and ugaa were deliberately indifferent to the alleged discrimination.in gebser,the supreme court adopted the deliberate indifference standard for determining when a title ix recipient would be liable for harassment,gebser,at,and in davis,adopted the same standard for determining liability for harassment.davis,at.prior to gebser,the court adopted the deliberate indifference standard when determining a municipality liability for claims under alleging that a municipality actions in failing to prevent a deprivation of federal rights was the cause of the violation.gebser,at.citing board of comm rs of bryan county.brown,d canton harris,d.in adopting the deliberate indifference standard in title ix cases that do not involve allegations of discrimination resulting from the title ix recipient official policy,the gebser court noted that comparable considerations namely,to impose liability only for official decisions by the defendant not to remedy the violation and not for the independent actions of the use of the deliberate indifference standard in both title ix and municipality liability cases.id.at.
in the municipality liability context,this circuit has held that a plaintiff can show deliberate indifference by proving that the municipality knew of a need to supervise in a particular area and the municipality made a deliberate choice not to take any action.gold city of miami,cir.this precedent guides our decision here to the extent that we deal with a scenario that is factually distinct from gebser,davis,and hawkins,but we stress that title ix has important requirements for establishing deliberate indifference that can not be scuttled simply because the plaintiff can meet the standard applicable to municipality liability cases.
first,title ix requires that the plaintiff prove that the deliberate indifference occurred in response to discrimination she faced.davis,at.second,as davis requires,a title ix recipient may not be liable for damages unless its deliberate indifference subject s its students to harassment.that is,the deliberate indifference must,at a minimum,cause students to undergo harassment or make them liable or vulnerable to it.id.at.citing random house dictionary of the english language defining subject as to cause to undergo the action of something specified expose or to make liable or vulnerable lay open expose webster third new international dictionary defining subject as to cause to undergo or submit to make submit to a particular action or effect expose.based on the davis court language,we hold that a title ix plaintiff at the motion to dismiss stage must allege that the title ix recipient deliberate indifference to the initial discrimination subjected the plaintiff to further discrimination.
as stated earlier,adams,dooley,and harrick decision to recruit cole and admit him through uga special admission process was a form of discrimination that williams suffered.according to williams,adams,dooley,and harrick knew at that point of the need to supervise cole for two reasons.first,uga and ugaa officials had received suggestions from that uga and ugaa ensure that athletic coaches inform their athletes about the sexual harassment policy applicable to.second,and more importantly,williams alleges that adams,harrick,and dooley knew about cole past sexual misconduct.nevertheless,even with its knowledge of the need to inform its about the applicable sexual harassment policy and of cole past sexual misconduct,uga and ugaa failed to adequately supervise cole.williams allegations of uga and ugaa failures are sufficient at this stage to establish deliberate indifference under our municipality liability precedent.but to satisfy our title ix precedent,williams must go further and sufficiently allege that the deliberate indifference subjected her to further discrimination.
williams meets the title ix standard through her allegations regarding the january incident.uga and ugaa failure to inform its about the applicable sexual harassment policy and failure to supervise its subjected williams to this further harassment and caused williams to be the victim of a conspiracy between cole,brandon williams,and thomas to sexually assault and rape her.by placing cole in a student dormitory and failing to supervise him in any way or to inform him of their expectations of him under the applicable sexual harassment policy,uga and ugaa substantially increased the risk faced by female students at uga.
furthermore,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to williams,uga acted with deliberate indifference again when it responded to the january incident although uga police seem to have performed a thorough investigation,uga failed to provide an adequate response.within hours of the incident,uga had a preliminary report providing details about the incident,and by april,had a full report,including information about interviews with suspects and witnesses,from uga police.nevertheless,uga waited another eight months before conducting a disciplinary hearing to determine whether to sanction the alleged assailants.by that point,two of the alleged assailants no longer attended uga.the fact that the disciplinary panel ultimately decided not to sanction the alleged assailants is immaterial because it fails to explain why uga waited almost eleven months to take corrective action,especially considering the fact that uga police report provided substantial evidence corroborating williams version of the january incident.to the extent that uga argues that it waited so long because of the pending criminal trials against the assailants,this argument also fails because the pending criminal charges did not affect uga ability to institute its own procedures the criminal charges were an ineffectual means to prevent future attacks at uga while the charges were pending and the disciplinary proceedings were not instituted for another four months after brandon williams acquittal and the dismissal of charges against cole and thomas.
once again,uga deliberate indifference was followed by further discrimination,this time in the form of effectively denying williams an opportunity to continue to attend uga.although williams withdrew from uga the day after the january incident,we do not believe that at this stage her withdrawal should foreclose her argument that uga continued to subject her to discrimination.in light of the harrowing ordeal that williams faced on january,her decision to withdraw from uga was reasonable and expected.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to williams,uga failed to take any precautions that would prevent future attacks from cole,thomas,brandon williams,or hooligans should williams have decided to return to uga,either by,for example,removing from student housing or suspending the alleged assailants,or implementing a more protective sexual harassment policy to deal with future incidents considering what had already occurred,uga failure was inexplicable and discriminatory.
even though a university might not be expected to exercise the same degree of control over its students that a grade school would enjoy,davis,at,uga and ugaa exercised almost no control over cole,even though they knew about his past sexual misconduct.moreover,uga and ugaa failed to inform about the applicable sexual harassment policy.placed together,williams allegations that she faced several forms of harassment and that uga and ugaa repeatedly responded with deliberate indifference are sufficient to meet williams burden on a motion to dismiss.
was the discrimination severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive 
as for the first part of the final element,we conclude that the discrimination was severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive.id.at.whether conduct rises to the level of actionable harassment thus depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectation,and relationships,including,but not limited to,the ages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved.id.at.citations omitted.t o have a systemic effect of denying the victim equal access to an educational program or activity gender discrimination must be more widespread than a single instance of peer harassment hawkins,at citing davis,at.
according to williams allegations,a conspiracy between at least two of the alleged perpetrators began before she entered cole room because brandon williams was already in cole closet,with cole permission and without her knowledge,when she entered the room.viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to williams,cole and brandon agreed before williams arrived that brandon would emerge from the closet and attempt to have sex with williams once she and cole finished having sex.then,during brandon sexual assault of williams,cole called thomas and charles grant and invited them to continue running a train on williams.even though williams successfully fended off brandon attempted rape,the situation worsened further when thomas arrived and raped her.moreover,thomas later telephoned her twice.
the january events differ markedly from the rarely actionable,theoretical single incident mentioned in davis and hawkins.the incident involved a ringleader who lured the victim to his territory and then conspired with two friends to commit two separate acts of sexual assault and so constitutes a continuous series of events.although occurring in one room over two hours,the acts are sufficient to meet the requirements of severity and objective offensiveness.based upon these facts,together with the discrimination that occurred before and after the incident,we conclude that williams has alleged sufficient facts at this stage to show that the discrimination was pervasive.
did the alleged discrimination effectively bar williams access to an educational opportunity or benefit 
this leaves us to resolve whether the discrimination effectively bar red the victim access to an educational opportunity or benefit.davis,at.as we noted,this case involves a cycle of discrimination and deliberate indifference that lasted for more than one year,ultimately resulting in williams withdrawal from and decision not to return to uga.williams alleges that she may return to the university if uga implements more effective procedures to deal with harassment.although uga and ugaa neither formally forced williams to leave nor banned her from returning,the discrimination in which they engaged or they allowed to occur on campus caused williams to withdraw and not return.when williams was faced with decisions to leave or to return to uga,she knew the following uga and ugaa recruited and admitted a despite knowledge of his past sexual misconduct uga and ugaa failed to supervise dangerous students or properly instruct on the applicable sexual harassment policy she was sexually assaulted and raped by three,including one whose past sexual misconduct was known to uga and ugaa officials and the response to her complaints did nothing to assuage her concerns of a future attack should she return to uga.considering these circumstances,we conclude that williams has alleged sufficient facts at this stage to show that the alleged discrimination effectively bar red her access to an educational opportunity or benefit,namely pursuing an education at uga.
it is important to emphasize the extent and limits of our analysis.a court holding can reach no further than the facts of the case before it.see watts bellsouth,cir j udicial decisions can not make law beyond the facts of the cases in which those decisions are announced.united states aguillard,cir per curiam the holdings of a prior decision can reach only as far as the facts and circumstances presented to the court in the case which produced that decision.citation and internal marks omitted.
the facts alleged in this case are extreme.according to the amended complaint,which we take as true for present purposes,uga and ugaa officials actively recruited and admitted cole despite his past serious sexual misconduct.once cole was a at uga and placed in a dormitory,the defendants did not supervise or even counsel him against sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct.even after the rape and assault,which cole orchestrated,the defendants failed for months to remove cole and the other attackers from the university.it is likely that this failure prevented williams from returning to the university to continue her education.
we hold that these extreme facts are sufficient to state a claim under title ix.we do not decide,nor could we decide,whether a valid title ix claim would have been stated if the facts alleged had been less severe.
iii.whether the district court erred in dismissing williams claims 
next we consider williams claims against adams,harrick,and dooley,as individuals and in their official capacities,and against the board of regents and uga.the district court dismissed the claims against adams,harrick,and dooley as individuals based on williams failure to state a claim and the defendants qualified immunity.the district court dismissed all other claims based on eleventh amendment immunity.
title provides every person with the right to sue those acting under color of state law for violations of federal constitutional and statutory provisions.section is merely a vehicle by which to bring these suits it does not create any substantive federal rights.whiting traylor,cir.therefore,the plaintiff must point to a specific federal right that the defendant violated.id.
here,williams asserts that adams,harrick,and dooley,while acting under color of state finding that the defendants do not her of her federal rights under title ix by failing to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the statute and under the equal protection clause for discrimination based on sex.williams also asserts a claim against the three defendants because they exhibited deliberate indifference by recruiting and admitting cole despite his troubled past.williams fails to explain what statutory or constitutional right the defendants violated through their deliberate indifference,so we consider those allegations as relevant to both the title ix and equal protection claims.additionally,williams asserts that uga and the board of regents violated the equal protection clause by implementing a sexual harassment policy that treats harassment differently from harassment involving other members of the university community.
section claims against adams,harrick,and dooley for violating title ix 
the district court dismissed williams first claim against adams,harrick,and dooley as individuals because a plaintiff can not assert a action based on a violation of title ix.we agree.title ix does not allow claims against individual school officials only funding recipients can be held liable for title ix violations.hartley parnell,cir although this court has never considered whether a plaintiff can use to assert a title ix claim against an individual school official,we conclude that to allow plaintiffs to use in this manner would permit an end run around title ix explicit language limiting liability to funding recipients.
section claims against adams,harrick,and dooley for violating the equal protection clause 
the district court dismissed williams second claim against adams,harrick,and dooley as individuals,holding that the defendants have qualified immunity and that williams failed to state a claim.we need not address whether williams failed to state a claim because we affirm the district court holding on qualified immunity grounds.
qualified immunity shields governmental officials executing discretionary responsibilities from civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.courson mcmillian,cir citing harlow fitzgerald,d.if a defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense in a rule b motion to dismiss,the court should grant qualified immunity if the plaintiff complaint fails to allege a violation of a clearly established constitutional or statutory right.williams.state,cir per curiam.
to establish a defense of qualified immunity,the defendant must show that he acted within the scope of discretionary authority when performing the challenged conduct.rich dollar,cir.if the defendant meets this burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish that the defendant conduct violated clearly established law.id.at.the parties agree that the defendants met their burden therefore,we turn to the dispositive inquiry.
under the second step,the plaintiff must establish that the state of the law when the challenged events occurred was such that the defendant had fair warning that his alleged treatment of the plaintiff was unconstitutional.willingham loughnan,cir.the plaintiff does not have to show that the precise conduct in question has been held unlawful.id.nevertheless,for a federal right to be clearly established,its parameters must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.
the equal protection clause confers a federal constitutional right to be free from sex discrimination.pers.adm r of feeney,d.here,williams has alleged a harrowing incident,similar to other allegations that unfortunately have become increasingly common on today university campuses williams presents a compelling case that adams,harrick,and dooley knew about the criminal and disciplinary problems that plagued cole past,but that they considered his basketball skills a greater benefit than his questionable mores were a burden.furthermore,williams has presented evidence to show that the defendants action,coupled with others actions,may amount to discrimination actionable under title ix.at a minimum,adams,harrick,and dooley acted recklessly,and their apparent win at all costs attitude resulted in enormous costs and fewer wins than expected.nevertheless,williams has failed to present any cases that show the three defendants violated her clearly established equal protection rights by recruiting and admitting an individual like cole.therefore,williams can not meet her burden under the second step of the qualified immunity analysis,and we hold that adams,harrick,and dooley are entitled to qualified immunity.
williams also brings claims against adams,harrick,and dooley,in their official capacities.the district court dismissed these claims based on eleventh amendment immunity.without addressing the district court reasoning,we hold instead that the claims were properly dismissed for the same reasons we dismissed the claims against those defendants in their individual capacities.in currency,at holding that an appeals court can affirm for any reason supported by the record,even if not relied upon by the district court.
section claims against uga and the board of regents 
as for the claims against uga and the board of regents,we hold that the eleventh amendment bars suit against those defendants.under most circumstances,the eleventh amendment bars suits against states and state entities by their citizens.hans louisiana.williams does not dispute that uga and the board of regents are state entities for eleventh amendment purposes.but even in those situations in which the eleventh amendment bars suits,a party may sue the state if the state has waived its immunity or if congress has validly abrogated the state immunity.coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d abrogation atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d waiver.
williams correctly notes that congress validly abrogated the states immunity from title ix suits.gebser,at.this is why the eleventh amendment did not bar the direct title ix action against uga,ugaa,and the board of regents.here,however,williams is trying to use to bring a title ix claim.congress has not abrogated states immunity from suits.miller king,cir.nor has uga or the board of regents waived its eleventh amendment immunity.therefore,the eleventh amendment bars williams claims against uga and the board of regents 
iv.whether the district court erred in dismissing williams claim for injunctive relief 
finally,williams asserts that the district court erred in dismissing her claim for injunctive relief that she requested in her initial complaint and expanded upon in her first amended complaint.in her initial complaint,williams sought an injunction ordering the defendants to implement policies,and procedures to protect students like plaintiff from sexual harassment prohibited by title ix.although not entirely clear,this request for injunctive relief likely applies to uga,the board of regents,adams,dooley,and ugaa.in her first amended complaint,williams sought an injunction
