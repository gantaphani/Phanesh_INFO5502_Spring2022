the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction over related claims,codified as part of a federal court supplemental jurisdiction under,is generally well understood.yet,as the supreme court observed,the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction can hardly be criticized for being overly rigid or precise,because the more obscure doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction over collateral proceedings remains a matter of case law.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure ed.the present appeal involves the jurisdiction over proceedings related to,but technically separate from,a federal lawsuit.under this doctrine,a federal court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over collateral proceedings in two distinct contexts that are relevant here to enforce a settlement agreement,and to resolve an attorney fees dispute.
four juvenile plaintiffs,by and through their respective guardians,and the american diabetes association collectively,plaintiffs filed a putative class action against jack,in his official capacity as superintendent of public instruction for the state of california the state board of education and the california department of education collectively,defendants.the parties eventually settled,and the district court retained limited jurisdiction to enforce their settlement agreement.after the court jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement had expired under the terms of that agreement,plaintiffs filed a motion seeking attorneys fees for monitoring defendants compliance with the agreement.the district court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that its jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement had expired.
on appeal,plaintiffs argument is.first,they argue that their motion for attorneys fees does not seek to enforce the settlement agreement.consequently,the conclusion that the district court lacks ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement is irrelevant.second,they argue that the district court independently has ancillary jurisdiction over a post judgment attorneys fees dispute,irrespective of the fact that the court jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement has expired.we agree.therefore,we reverse and remand.

standards of review

discussion 
the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction recognizes federal courts jurisdiction over some matters otherwise beyond their competence that are incidental to other matters properly before them.kokkonen,at.broadly speaking,federal courts exercise ancillary jurisdiction for two separate,though sometimes related,purposes to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are,in varying respects and degrees,factually interdependent and to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.id.at emphases added.
the first and purpose ancillary jurisdiction over factually interdependent claims is codified as part of.see peacock thomas,congress codified much of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction as part of supplemental jurisdiction in.that purpose,however,is not relevant here.
this case instead involves the second,less common purpose ancillary jurisdiction over collateral proceedings.city mortgage stephen,cir ancillary jurisdiction is a common law doctrine that survived the codification of supplemental jurisdiction in.see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure ed.differentiating supplemental jurisdiction over claims asserted in federal court from jurisdiction over related proceedings that are technically separate from the initial case that invoked federal subject matter jurisdiction emphasis in original.
as the tenth circuit has explained,this less common exercise of ancillary jurisdiction rests on the premise that a federal court acquires jurisdiction of a case or controversy in its entirety.incident to the disposition of the principal issues before it,a court may decide collateral matters necessary to render complete justice.jenkins weinshienk,cir.
in particular,this appeal turns on the distinction between a court ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement and its ancillary jurisdiction over collateral matters such as an attorney fees dispute.
we first address a court authority to enforce settlement agreements.federal courts have no inherent power to enforce settlement agreements entered into by parties litigating before them.arata nu skin int l,cir citing kokkonen,at.rather,courts have ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement only if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement ha s been made part of the order of dismissal either by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.kokkonen,at.
in the event the settlement agreement is breached,the court would have ancillary jurisdiction that arises from breach of the court dismissal order.see also alvarado table mountain rancheria,cir stating that where the dismissal order incorporates the settlement terms,or the court has retained jurisdiction over the settlement contract the party seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement must allege a violation of the settlement agreement in order to establish ancillary jurisdiction citing kokkonen,at,and colvin,cir.
in this case,there is no dispute that the terms of the parties settlement agreement had been made part of the order of dismissal by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.ko
