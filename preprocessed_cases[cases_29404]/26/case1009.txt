public school districts across the country have increasingly turned to the adoption of mandatory dress policies,sometimes referred to as school uniform policies,in an effort to focus student attention and reduce conflict.these policies are not without controversy,and many students,as well as their parents,find them offensive to their understanding of core first amendment values.in a case of first impression in this circuit,we address just such a set of challenges and largely conclude that public school mandatory dress policies survive constitutional scrutiny.
factual procedural history 
in,the clark county school district the district promulgated regulation the regulation which created a standard dress code for all clark county students and established a means by which individual schools in the district could establish more stringent mandatory school uniform policies these uniform policies were to be established for the purpose s of increasing student achievement,promoting safety,and enhancing a positive school environment.
a number of schools in the district instituted such uniform policies.for example,liberty high school liberty instituted a policy requiring all students to wear solid khakicolored bottoms and polo,tee,or shirts blue,red or white with or without liberty logos.kimberly jacobs jacobs,then an at liberty,repeatedly violated liberty uniform policy at least once by wearing a shirt containing a printed message reflecting her religious beliefs.as a result of these violations,jacobs was repeatedly referred to the dean office and was ultimately suspended from school five times for a total of approximately days.although liberty provided jacobs with educational services during her suspensions and,in fact,jacobs grade point average improved during that time period jacobs claims that she missed out on classroom interactions,suffered reputational damage among her teachers and peers,had a tarnished disciplinary record,and was unconstitutionally deprived of her first amendment rights to free expression and free exercise of religion because of liberty enforcement of its mandatory school uniform policy 
jacobs and her parents thus brought suit against the district and various individual defendants collectively,defendants,asking the court to declare,the regulation,and liberty mandatory school uniform policy unconstitutional as violating the first amendment free speech and free exercise clauses,as well as the fourteenth amendment due process clause expunge all related discipline from jacobs record and award her appropriate damages without expressing any view on the constitutionality of liberty uniform policy or its authorizing regulation and statute,the district court granted jacobs motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined liberty from further disciplining or suspending jacobs for failing to adhere to the policy following this decision,the district slightly amended the regulation,with the only significant changes being a relaxation of the amount of parental support needed to enact a school uniform policy and elimination of one portion of the regulation about which the district court expressed strong reservations.additionally,liberty expunged all discipline from jacobs record.
encouraged by jacobs success in obtaining a preliminary concerned about the suit viability after jacobs had withdrawn from liberty and moved to a new school number of other district students and their parents collectively,plaintiffs joined the suit 
shane dresser dresser a student at jim bridger middle school bridger at the time this suit was filed alleged,inter alia,that his right to free exercise of religion was violated when,after being denied a religious exemption from bridger uniform policy,he was forced to wear the required uniform.dresser had applied for an exemption on the ground that his religion teaches its members to embrace their individuality and further teaches that,even though uniformity can be accepted by an individual if they choose to do so by their own free will,no one can force uniformity onto a person.dresser application was denied without explanation 
dwight terry,terry a student at chaparral high school chaparral alleged that,on at least five occasions,he was sent to the principal office for the remainder of the school day for failing to wear the required school uniform.neither the amended complaint nor any evidence in the record provides any additional information regarding terry violations.specifically,the record does not indicate whether terry was due to a religious objection,a desire to communicate a particular message either via his dress itself or via a printed message contained on his clothing,a desire to cause disruption in his school,or simple forgetfulness.chaparral is not presently enforcing a school uniform policy.
whitney rose and john does i at frank garside.high school garside and glen taylor elementary school glen taylor,that their due process rights were violated when their schools implemented school uniform policies without complying with the parental survey requirements included in the original regulation of these three students,only john doe i continues to attend a district school with a mandatory uniform policy.
defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint under rule b.after advising the parties that defendants motion might be construed as one for summary judgment,and after the parties supplemented the record accordingly,the district court struck two provisions of the regulation but otherwise granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,finding no other constitutional infirmity with,the regulation,or the individual schools uniform policies.see generally,jacobs,d at.plaintiffs appeal this judgment.
discussion 
justiciability 
before turning to the constitutional claims lodged against the district school uniform policies,we must ensure that at least one plaintiff presents a justiciable case or controversy with respect to each constitutional claim.const.art.iii city of lake tahoe cal.tahoe reg l planning agency,cir.for a plaintiff claim to be justiciable,he or she must have standing to bring the claim,and the claim must not be moot.am.civil liberties union of lomax,cir.
a plaintiff has standing to challenge allegedly unconstitutional conduct as long as he or she has suffered an injury in fact there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and it is likely the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.while standing is determined based on the facts as they exist ed at the time the complaint was filed,a case becomes,hence,the requisite personal interest captured by the standing doctrine ceases to exist at any point during the litigation.see parole comm geraghty,d bernhardt county of los angeles,cir.
although many of plaintiffs claims for declaratory and injunctive relief appear to be moot as only one plaintiff continues to attend a district school that is currently enforcing a mandatory school uniform policy,plaintiffs amended complaint seeks not only prospective relief,but also appropriate damages.as this court clarified in bernhardt,a live claim for even nominal damages will prevent dismissal for mootness.at.we thus examine each of plaintiffs constitutional claims to determine whether at least one plaintiff meets the three standing requirements and retains a live claim for at least nominal damages.see id.
freedom of speech 
plaintiffs allege that the district mandatory school uniform policies infringe upon students free speech rights by preventing them from engaging in both constitutionally protected pure speech and constitutionally protected expressive conduct,as well as by compelling them to speak in a particular manner 
when a plaintiff alleges violation of a constitutional right,the supreme court has held that,even if compensatory damages are unavailable because the plaintiff has sustained no actual injury such as an economic loss,damage to his reputation,or emotional damages are nonetheless available in order to mak e the deprivation of such right actionable and to thereby acknowledge the importance to organized society that the right be scrupulously observed.carey piphus,d see also memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d our discussion in carey makes clear that nominal damages are the appropriate means of vindicating constitutional rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,provable injury.
here,while it is questionable whether jacobs has presented sufficient evidence of actual damages to be entitled to compensatory relief and it is clear that dresser has not even attempted to do is not fatal to the justiciability of their claims.jacobs has standing to bring a claim for nominal damages because she alleges an injury in fact namely,deprivation of her first amendment right to communicate a particular written message on her was caused by liberty mandatory uniform policy and would be redressed if this court were to find the policy unconstitutional.see rk ventures,city of seattle,cir free speech case found justiciable based solely on plaintiffs allegations that city regulation prevent ed them from playing the music of their choice.similarly,dresser has standing to bring a claim for nominal damages because he alleges injuries in fact namely,deprivation of his first amendment rights to engage in expressive conduct via his choice of clothing and to be free from compelled was caused by bridger mandatory uniform policy and,again,would be redressed if this court found that policy unconstitutional.see id.
thus,although jacobs and dresser may be entitled to collect only nominal damages were they to succeed on their free speech claims,they nonetheless present justiciable challenges to all aspects of the district uniform policy.see lujan,at.bernhardt,at rk ventures,at.the merits of these free speech claims will be discussed in part ii.
free exercise of religion 
plaintiffs also allege that the district mandatory uniform policies prevented jacobs and dresser from freely exercising their respective religions.again,these two plaintiffs have standing to assert claims for at least nominal damages because they allegedly sustained injuries in fact that were caused by their schools uniform policies and would be redressed if the court found those policies unconstitutional.see lujan,at.bernhardt,at allah,cir allowing free exercise claim for only nominal damages to proceed.specifically,jacobs was allegedly prevented from practicing her religion which she wanted to do by wearing clothing expressing her beliefs,while dresser was allegedly prevented from expressing his individuality via his clothing,and required to engage in an act of conformity by wearing the school of which,he claims,violate the teachings of his religion.the merits of these free exercise claims will be discussed in part iii.
due process 
finally,plaintiffs allege that their due process rights were violated when several schools in the liberty,bridger,garside,and glen school uniform policies without complying with the parental survey requirements contained in the original regulation.because the students at these schools were allegedly deprived of a cognizable liberty interest in free speech as a result of the school uniform policies,they too have standing to bring a claim for nominal damages.see lujan,at.bernhardt,at carey,at.t he denial of procedural due process is actionable for nominal damages without proof of actual injury.the merits of these due process claims will be discussed in part iv.
because at least one plaintiff has alleged a viable claim for at least nominal damages with respect to each constitutional issue,our justiciability inquiry ends there and we proceed to the merits of their claims.
ii.free speech claims 
plaintiffs raise three claims.first,plaintiffs contend that the district school uniform policies which prohibit students from displaying any printed messages on their clothing save for,in some cases,the school logo unconstitutionally restrict students rights to engage in pure speech while in school.see tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d s tudents do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.this claim is best exemplified by liberty refusal to allow jacobs to wear containing written messages expressing her religious beliefs in school second,plaintiffs claim that the uniform policies unconstitutionally restrict students rights to engage in expressive conduct.see id.this claim is best exemplified by bridger refusal to allow dresser to express his individuality and his objection to forced uniformity by wearing clothing different from his classmates third,plaintiffs claim that requiring students to wear a uniform amounts to unconstitutional compelled speech.see.state bd.of educ.barnette.see also supra note.this claim is best exemplified by dresser contention that he is being forced to convey a message of uniformity with which he strongly disagrees by wearing the same clothing as his classmates.
we agree with the district court that none of plaintiffs free speech claims survive summary judgment.ballen city of redmond,cir reviewing grant of summary judgment in free speech case de novo.we reach this conclusion because,as explained in more detail below,the district encroachment upon its students rights to free speech and expression via its school uniform policies need only survive intermediate scrutiny to be level of scrutiny we find the uniform policies easily withstand.moreover,enforcement of the mandatory uniform policies does not amount to compelled speech because,under the circumstances,it is unlikely anyone viewing a student would understand the student to be communicating a particular message via his or her mandatory dress.
pure speech and expressive conduct 
the district school uniform policies need only withstand intermediate scrutiny to be constitutional 
the court below concluded that the district uniform policies did not infringe upon students rights to engage in pure speech or expressive conduct because the policies withstood intermediate scrutiny jacobs clark county sch,d.plaintiffs take issue with this analysis from the outset,arguing that applying intermediate scrutiny to student speech is foreclosed by chandler mcminnville school district,cir.specifically,they argue that,under chandler,speech that is neither vulgar,lewd,obscene,or plainly offensive nor like the speech plaintiffs wish to engage in be analyzed under the stricter standard the supreme court utilized in tinker des moines independent community school district,d and,most importantly,that chandler leaves room for no other alternative.
plaintiffs argument is superficially appealing.chandler laid out three categories of student speech vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly offensive speech,speech,and speech that falls into neither of these categories and explained that speech in the first category should be analyzed under bethel school district number fraser,d,speech in the second category should be analyzed under hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,d,and speech in the third category should be analyzed under tinker,at.see at.
as both parties concede,plaintiffs speech falls into neither of the first two categories.plaintiffs thus argue that,just as the policy in tinker was found unconstitutional because allowing students to wear black armbands in silent protest would not substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students,at,the policy here,forbidding students from wearing their choice of clothing to school should be found unconstitutional because it fails tinker substantial interference test,as well.
what plaintiffs the district court and one of our sister circuits have correctly a key flaw in this logic.see canady bossier parish sch,cir jacobs,d at.while chandler certainly says that all speech in the third category must be analyzed under tinker,it does not say that all speech in this category has to be evaluated at the same level of scrutiny as that ultimately used in tinker.in other words,while chandler dictates that tinker must guide our analysis of this case,it does not require us to blindly apply the standard employed therein.we thus start by carefully examining what the tinker decision,even more importantly,what it does.
tinker is silent about how regulations of pure speech and regulations affecting expressive conduct should be evaluated 
in tinker,a group of students had arranged to wear black armbands to school to protest the involvement of the united states in the vietnam war.at.upon learning of this plan,the des moines independent school district adopted a policy prohibiting students from wearing such armbands,apparently fearing the disturbance they might cause.id.at.when the students were suspended for violating the policy,they filed suit,arguing that the policy violated their rights to free speech under the first amendment.id.at.
the supreme court agreed,holding that,i n order for the state in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion,it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.id.at.the court further explained 
i n our system,undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.any departure from absolute regimentation may cause trouble.any variation from the majority opinion may inspire fear.any word spoken,in class,in the lunchroom,or on the campus,that deviates from the views of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance.but our constitution says we must take this risk and our history says that it is this sort of hazardous kind of is the basis of our national strength and of the independence and vigor of americans who grow up and live in this relatively permissive,often disputatious,society.
id.at.internal citation omitted.
in short,the court made clear that suppressing the expression of unpopular or controversial in the name of avoiding potential a violation of the first amendment unless the school could show that,absent such suppression,the school orderly operation would be materially and substantially compromised.id.at.
despite plaintiffs attempt to read tinker more broadly,this is all tinker expressly holds.two things are notable about this limited holding.first,as the court itself made clear,its substantial interference test applies only to restrictions on pure speech,and does not necessarily apply to school policies placing incidental restrictions on expressive conduct.see id.at.the problem posed by the present case does not relate to regulation of the length of skirts or the type of clothing,to hair style,or deportment.king saddleback.coll,cir declining to employ tinker analysis to student claim that policy disallowing long hair for male students violated the first amendment.thus,tinker leaves unresolved the question of how restrictions upon expressive conduct in schools should be evaluated but see generally texas johnson,d the government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has in restricting pure speech.
second,the holding itself extends only to speech restrictions,and not necessarily to speech restrictions.although these two terms of art had not yet been used by the supreme court when tinker was decided in,see young am.mini theatres,d,the tinker opinion makes clear that the court principal objection to the armband prohibition was that it was motivated by a desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that accompany an unpopular viewpoint.at.emphasis added.in essence,the court found the armband prohibition unconstitutional not simply because it worked to prohibit students from engaging in a form of pure speech,but because it did so based on the particular opinion the students were espousing.id.at.finding it significant that the school authorities did not purport to prohibit the wearing of all symbols of political or controversial significance,but only the wearing of armbands worn to exhibit opposition to this nation involvement in vietnam.
although a slightly more expansive reading of tinker suggests that its mode of analysis should also be used when a school regulation is not only when it is no reading of tinker suggests that viewpoint and restrictions on student speech should also be subjected to tinker scrutiny.indeed,neither this court nor the supreme court has ever analyzed a restriction on student speech under tinker rather,the tinker test has only been employed when a school restrictions have been based,at least in part,on the particular messages students were attempting to communicate 
it is thus our view that tinker says nothing about how viewpoint and restrictions on student speech should be analyzed,thereby leaving room for a different level of scrutiny than that employed in either bethel,hazelwood,or tinker when student speech is restricted on a viewpoint and basis.accord canady,at 
district school uniform policies are viewpoint and 
before turning to precisely what level of scrutiny that should be,we pause to explain why we find the school uniform policies at issue in this case to be both viewpoint and and,thus,deserving of a different level of scrutiny than that applied to the policy in tinker.
on its face,the portion of the regulation authorizing schools to implement mandatory uniform policies is aimed at increasing student achievement,promoting safety,and enhancing a positive school environment.nothing in the regulation language suggests it was directed at the type of messages or specific viewpoints previously conveyed by students wardrobe choices indeed,the record evidence unambiguously indicates that the district purpose in enacting the regulation was to further the regulation stated goals,not to suppress the expression of particular ideas for example,the referendum sent to parents listing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed uniform policy included as potential advantages promot ing safety by reducing the ability to hide weapons,drugs or alcohol allow ing students and staff to focus more attention to increasing student achievement eliminat ing dress differences that emphasize different income levels and simplif ying daily school preparation and maintenance for families.none of the proposed advantages related to the benefits of preventing students from expressing unpopular views or communicating about particular subjects via their clothing choices.
of course,while evidence of a viewpoint and purpose strongly suggests that a regulation is,in fact,mere assertion of a benign purpose is insufficient to conclusively establish a regulation.turner,at.here,plaintiffs argue that,despite the district stated purposes,the regulation is not because it allows student clothing to contain the school allowance that,in plaintiffs view,sanctions expression of messages touting the district schools,but not messages relating to any other topic or viewpoint.
at first blush,plaintiffs argument seems viable.indeed,if the regulation allowed for school uniforms that consisted only of clothing without any words,logos,or printed material whatsoever,plaintiffs argument against the regulation would almost certainly fall flat.as it stands,however,plaintiffs have at least a colorable claim that,by allowing student clothing to contain school logos,the regulation reflects an impermissible and,indeed,preference for expressions of school pride.
while the district could have steered far clear of the first amendment boundaries by foregoing the logo provision entirely,we nevertheless conclude that allowing students otherwise clothing to contain a school item expressing little,if any,genuine communicative not convert a school uniform policy into a one.
indeed,the district very narrow exception to its otherwise school uniform policy is a far cry from those regulations previously found by the supreme court to be.see,united states playboy entm t group,d statute restricting cable companies dissemination of sexual programming city of cincinnati discovery network,d ordinance banning commercial handbills on news racks but allowing newspapers boos barry,d statute prohibiting display of signs critical of a foreign government near a foreign embassy carey brown,d statute prohibiting all picketing in residential neighborhoods except labor picketing tied to a place of employment police dep t of city of chi.mosley,d similar see also aclu of city of las vegas,cir ordinance prohibiting speech soliciting donations,charity,business or patronage.
moreover,w hatever marginal expression wearing a school logo implicates,it does not rise to the level of expression to implicate concerns of viewpoint non neutrality.long bd.of educ.of jefferson county,d.the dichotomy is not grounded in the text of the first amendment itself,but was created by the supreme court as a tool for distinguishing those regulations that seek to advance legitimate regulatory goals from those that seek to suppress unpopular ideas or information or to manipulate the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion.turner,at.here,plaintiffs put forth no evidence that the regulation logo allowance was an attempt by the district to inundate the marketplace of ideas with messages or to starve that marketplace of contrary opinions rather,all evidence suggests that the district considered the logo to be an identifying mark,not a communicative device.
we thus decline plaintiffs invitation to take the term to its literal extreme,and we hold that the district school uniform policies are despite their allowances for clothing containing school logos 
intermediate scrutiny is the appropriate standard 
as discussed above,the school uniform policies at issue here implicate the first amendment only insofar as they place restrictions on students pure speech and place incidental restrictions on students expressive conduct because neither type of restriction is governed by tinker,see supra part,we must now decide how to evaluate the constitutionality of these policies.
outside the school speech context,the supreme court has repeatedly held that a law restricting speech on a viewpoint and basis is constitutional as long as it withstands intermediate,if it furthers an important or substantial government interest the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.turner,at.the same is true of a regulation that has an incidental effect on expressive conduct.united states,d 
we agree with the district court that this same level of scrutiny should extend to the school speech context.see jacobs,d at accord canady,at applying intermediate scrutiny to school policies that effect restrictions upon pure speech or place limitations upon expressive conduct or,as is the case here,do both not only strikes the correct balance between students expressive rights and schools interests in furthering their educational missions,but,as the fifth circuit explained,is entirely consistent with the supreme court other school speech precedents,not to mention the remainder of the court first amendment jurisprudence.see canady,at 
accordingly,if the district school uniform policies advance important government interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech,and do so in ways that effect as minimal a restriction on students free expression as possible then the uniform policies should be upheld.we now turn to whether those criteria are satisfied here.
applying intermediate scrutiny 
school uniform policies further important government interests 
the district claims its uniform policies further three important state interests increasing student achievement promoting safety and enhancing a positive school environment.the district supports its claim with affidavits from school personnel confirming that the school uniform policies were implemented with these purposes in mind and that the policies have,in fact,been effective in advancing these goals.
plaintiffs do not contend that the district stated interests are unimportant or insignificant.instead,they argue that,even though these interests may be laudable,the district real justification for its uniform policies was its goal of visible conformity an interest plaintiffs argue is not important or substantial.but this is not how the intermediate scrutiny test works.indeed,a court job in evaluating a policy under this test first step is to determine whether the government stated goals qualify as important or substantial.see turner,at.specifically,the court must determine whether the government evidence demonstrate s that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.whether those stated goals are mere pretexts for a more insidious government purpose is taken up in the second and third steps of the analysis.see,at.
here,the government stated goals unquestionably qualify as important.see canady,at finding comparable goals sufficiently important to withstand intermediate scrutiny blau fort thomas public sch,cir b ridging socioeconomic gaps between families within the school district,focusing attention on learning,increasing school unity and pride,enhancing school safety,promoting good behavior,reducing discipline problems,improving test scores,improving children and,helping to eliminate stereotypes and producing a cost savings for families are all important governmental interests served by a school uniform policy.indeed,it is hard to think of a government interest more important than the interest in fostering conducive learning environments for our nation children.
additionally,not only do affidavits from district administrators indicate that the school uniform policies have been effective in achieving the regulation three itself is evidence that the contemplated harms are real and that the policies do in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way,turner,at.department of education has also acknowledged the efficacy of school uniforms in advancing such state interests.see dep t of ed.manual on sch.uniforms,available at in the absence of any evidence from plaintiffs that the uniform policies fail to advance the important government interests of increasing student achievement,enhancing safety,and creating a positive school environment,we conclude that the first prong of the intermediate scrutiny test is satisfied.
b.the district interests are unrelated to the suppression of free expression 
because the district stated interests are unrelated to the suppression of free expression,we conclude that the second prong of the intermediate scrutiny test is satisfied,as well.see turner,at,at.
on their face,the district goals have nothing to do with quelling speech or limiting expression.accord castorina ex rel.rewt madison county sch,cir kennedy,concurring a stable,educational environment is a substantial government interest unrelated to the suppression of student expression.additionally,the record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that the district stated goals were mere pretexts for its true purpose of preventing students from expressing their views on particular subjects,such as support for a particular faith in jacobs case or opposition to conformity in dresser case.the district may have known that views like these would be incidentally suppressed because of its schools uniform policies however,its reasons for enacting the uniform policies far as the record divorced from preventing student speech.
again,the referendum sent home to parents is telling.although the district acknowledges in this referendum that its school uniform policies would limit student creativity and restrict students freedom to express themselves in nonviolent ways,it lists these effects in the column,thus implying that the district enacted the regulation authorizing school uniforms not because of,but in spite of,the impact school uniform policies would have on students expressive opportunities.we thus conclude that the district interests are not pretexts for an underlying desire to limit free speech but,rather,are directed only at creating an educational environment free from the distractions,dangers,and disagreements that result when student clothing choices are left unrestricted.city of renton playtime theatres,d expressing less first amendment concern regarding policies aimed not at the content of the forbidden speech,but rather at the secondary effects of that speech 
c.the district school uniform policies do not restrict more speech than necessary 
the third prong of the intermediate scrutiny test has been stated in several forms but,for purposes of this case,it focuses on whether the regulation leave s open ample alternative channels for student communication.colacurcio city of kent,cir.
as the district court appropriately noted,although the school uniform policies may limit students abilities to express themselves via their clothing choices,students may continue to express themselves through other and traditional methods of communication throughout the school day.for example,students are still permitted if not encouraged to have verbal conversations with other students,publish articles in school newspapers,and join student clubs.moreover,even a student ability to communicate through his or her choice of clothing is not completely curtailed,as students are still permitted to choose what clothing to wear after school,on weekends,and at functions.
because the district uniform policies limit only one form of student expression while leaving open many other channels for student communication and apply during the narrowest possible window consistent with the district goals of creating a productive,educational environment for its students the district uniform policies are a way of furthering the district pedagogical goals without infringing upon students first amendment rights any more than is necessary to achieve these goals.see turner,at,at.accordingly,the policies withstand intermediate scrutiny and do not unconstitutionally abridge a student rights under the first amendment to engage in free speech while at school.
compelled speech 
plaintiffs next argue that the district uniform policies infringe upon students first amendment rights because they compel students to express support for message with which students like dresser disagree although the district court did not address this argument in its order granting summary judgment,plaintiffs did raise the argument both to the district court and in their opening brief here thus,we will consider the contention on appeal.donovan crisostomo,cir.
dresser contends that uniforms usually convey symbolic messages,see,daniels city of arlington,cir wearing police uniform conveys message of authority,and thus that,by requiring him to wear a school uniform,bridger compelled him to convey a symbolic,support for conformity and community his will.we disagree.first,although there are times when wearing a uniform is expressive,identifying the wearer with other wearers of the same uniform,and with the ideology or purpose of the group,church of am.knights of the ku klux klan kerik,cir,wearing bridger school uniform which,here,consists of nothing more than tops and bottoms can hardly be compared to wearing the type of uniform contemplated in,a white hooded gown that clearly identifies its wearer as a member of the ku klux klan and,presumably,as a subscriber to its views 
second,given both the nature of dresser activity and the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken,the likelihood that a person viewing dresser wearing his mandated school uniform would have understood dresser to be conveying a message of conformity is extremely small.spence washington,d per curiam finding conduct to be expressive only when that likelihood was great.wearing a uniform does not involve written or verbal expression of any kind,barnette,at.requiring students to pledge allegiance to the american flag each morning,it is passive rather than active,and if it conveys a message at all,that message is imprecise,rather than particularized,spence,at.see troster.state dep t of,cir citing these reasons when concluding that requiring state corrections officers to wear american flag patch on their uniforms was not likely a form of compelled speech.indeed,dresser puts forth no evidence to suggest that,even though every student at bridger was required to wear the uniform,a person observing these similarly clad students would understand any of them to be expressing a personal affinity for conformity.see id.at.
dresser argument that bridger uniform policy amounts to a form of compelled speech thus fails.indeed,bridger does not force dresser to communicate any message less one expressing support for conformity or community by requiring him to wear the tops and bottoms mandated by its uniform policy.accord littlefield forney indep.sch,cir.
in sum,we conclude that none of plaintiffs rights were violated by the district mandatory school uniform policies and,thus,summary judgment in the defendants favor on these claims was appropriate.
iii.free exercise claims 
plaintiffs next contend that the district uniform policies violated their first amendment rights to free exercise of religion.see const.amend.specifically,they claim that liberty uniform policy unconstitutionally forbade jacobs from wearing shirts expressing her religious beliefs and that bridger refusal to grant dresser an exemption from its uniform policy unconstitutionally forced dresser to violate the teachings of his religion.
jacobs free exercise claim 
jacobs free exercise claim fails for the simple reason that both the regulation and the school uniform policy liberty implemented thereunder were valid and neutral law s of general applicability and,as such,did not implicate the free exercise clause at all.see employment,or.dep t of human res.smith,d church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.there is no evidence in the record suggesting that liberty was motivated to enact its uniform policy because its administrators disapprove d of a particular religion or of religion in general.city of hialeah,at.moreover,liberty policy prohibits students like jacobs from wearing not because liberty feared students would undertake to do so for religious reasons,but because liberty did not want students to encounter any distractions during the school day.id.
indeed,a school uniform policy like liberty is the quintessence of a neutral rule of general applicability.smith,at.the policy applies to all students equally regardless of the students religious beliefs,and it prohibits conduct,wearing clothing in colors and styles other than that prescribed by the uniform policy that presents no obvious impediments to the free exercise of any particular religion or religions.thus,like other regulations that have been found to be neutral and of general applicability,the district regulation and the individual uniform policies it authorizes do not implicate the free exercise clause.
dresser free exercise claim 
although dresser makes a somewhat different free exercise argument,our analysis is,in essence,the same.
dresser contends that his school arbitrarily denied him a religious exemption from its mandatory uniform policy and that this denial itself violated his free exercise rights.as the district court concluded,dresser is correct that his school was not permitted to inquire into the validity or orthodoxy of dresser religious beliefs when deciding whether or not to exempt him from its mandatory uniform policy.see jacobs,d at citing littlefield,at.the district court,however,already struck the religious exemption on this aspect of its decision neither party appeals.see id.
thus,the only argument dresser can make now other than the argument that the district court remedy for curing the regulation grant of unfettered discretion to school administrators impermissibly leaves the regulation without any religious exemption argument that is now moot is that he is entitled to at least nominal damages based on bridger prior refusal to grant him an exemption from its uniform policy.as explained in the previous section,however,the district school uniform policies are neutral laws of general applicability and,thus,even if dresser beliefs about were sincerely held and religious in nature,see malik brown,cir,he had no right under the free exercise clause to a religious exemption.smith,at.
accordingly,we conclude that the district mandatory school uniform policies infringed upon neither jacobs nor dresser free exercise rights 
iv.due process claims 
plaintiffs final contention is that their due process rights were violated because they were each made subject to a mandatory school uniform policy that was implemented without following the parental survey procedures included in the original regulation 
we first clarify that plaintiffs are not making the due process argument typically made in school policy,that district schools disciplined students like jacobs and terry for violating the mandatory uniform policies without first confirming,via fundamentally fair procedures,that the alleged violations actually occurred.goss lopez,d recognizing need for procedural due process before student can be suspended and thereby deprived of her legitimate entitlement to a public education and her interest in her good name,reputation,honor,and integrity.jacobs and terry admit they violated their schools uniform policies and have never contended that they were,in jacobs case,repeatedly being given fair warning of the prohibited conduct or an opportunity to explain their behavior.see id.at.
instead,plaintiffs make the novel argument that the district schools at issue violated due process when they acted in complete defiance of their own regulations and instituted school uniform policies absent the requisite level of parental approval.
as the district court correctly concluded,however,even if the manners in which these district schools implemented their uniform policies violated the regulation they did not violate the fourteenth amendment.it has long been recognized that individuals have no due process right to participate in government policymaking.see inv.state bd.of equalization.due process not violated when taxpayer adversely impacted by new local ordinance was given no opportunity to be heard before ordinance was passed.moreover,plaintiffs provide no authority for their suggestion that a federal due process claim lies whenever a local entity deviates from its own procedures in enacting a local regulation accordingly,although it might be preferable for schools to seek parental approval before instituting controversial school policies,and it might be a violation of state law for schools not to do so if a local statute or regulation so dictates the due process clause in no way requires this.see id.at.
conclusion 
we thus affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the district.neither the district regulation nor the individual school uniform policies implemented thereunder violate plaintiffs free speech,free exercise,or due process rights.

the district court and the majority have determined,in very thoughtful opinions,that the school ban on her speech need only withstand intermediate scrutiny to pass constitutional muster,and that it does in this case.however,this conclusion directly conflicts with tinker des moines independent community school district,d,and chandler mcminnville school district,cir.it also represents a substantial rewriting and undermining of the first amendment protections afforded by tinker.
therefore,i respectfully dissent.
as everyone agrees,chandler governs the analysis of student speech in our circuit.chandler establishes three categories of student speech vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly offensive speech analysis of which is governed by bethel school district number fraser,d speech analysis of which is governed by hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,d and speech that does not fall into either of the first two categories analysis of which is governed by tinker.at.
everyone also agrees that the speech at issue in this case does not fall under either of the first two categories.therefore,under chandler,the analysis must be controlled by tinker.id.however,rather than applying the plain terms of chandler,the district court and the majority have imported and imposed a new analytical framework that can not be reconciled with supreme court jurisprudence,or with ours.
in examining student speech,the supreme court has consistently focused on the nature of the speech itself,as we recognized in chandler.id.if vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly offensive speech is at issue,the fraser analysis applies,and the governmental regulation is reviewed in that context.when speech is involved,the hazelwood analysis applies.when issues of speech and other expressive conduct are involved,the tinker analysis applies,and the governmental action is reviewed in that context.id.in short,under the supreme court analytical framework,and under ours,the initial inquiry is the character of the speech at issue.only once that has been established do we examine the governmental response.
the government has,to my dismay,urged an by the district court and the amounts to little more than an analytical sleight of hand,a trick of misdirection.rather than examining the nature of the speech,the majority has instead decided that the focus should be on the regulation of the speech.if the regulation is content and,the majority reasons,then the type of expressive conduct at issue is irrelevant.in that instance,regardless of the type of speech involved,a deferential level of scrutiny applies.
that reasoning,of course,is diametrically opposed to the teachings of fraser,hazelwood,and tinker.one need only examine the facts of tinker and chandler to see the logical disconnect.in tinker,the supreme court held that a school could not prohibit students from wearing black armbands.in chandler,we held that a school could not prohibit students from wearing buttons.if we applied the liberty high school uniform policy to those cases,that policy would have prohibited students in tinker and chandler from wearing those same armbands or buttons however,under the majority analysis,this would not have resulted in a constitutional violation because the regulations were content and.it is obvious that the majority holding can not be reconciled with tinker and chandler.it is the character of the speech,not the content of the governmental regulation that forms the framework of the first amendment analysis in student speech cases.
the analysis of this case should have been conducted under tinker.in tinker,the supreme court confirmed a student right to free speech in public schools.in balancing that right against the state interest in maintaining an ordered and effective public education system,the court declared that a student speech rights could only be curtailed if the speech would impinge on other students rights or would result in a substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.at.
here,there is no dispute that kim jacobs wearing of a that contained expressions of her religious faith would not impinge on the rights of other students.nor is there any suggestion that her could possibly have resulted in a substantial disruption or material interference with school activities.plainly then,under the standard described in tinker,the school lengthy suspension of jacobs violated her first amendment rights.
even if we were to adopt the majority legal analysis and assume tinker only applies to viewpoint and restrictions on student speech,the result in this case still can not be sustained.the lynchpin of the majority liberty high school had a viewpoint and unsupported,even by the limited record at hand.the school prohibits all messages on clothing,except for messages that support the school.the literal language of the rule describes logos and designs but the affidavits provided in this case indicate that other messages were allowed,so long as they expressed sentiments 
confining messages to content can not be said to be.a regulation is content based if either the main purpose in enacting it was to suppress or exalt speech of a certain content,or it differentiates based on the content of speech on its face.aclu city of las vegas,cir.here,shirts with messages touting the school athletic teams are permitted,while a shirt bearing an spirit message would be prohibited.a policy that allows students to wear messages that express support of the school,while prohibiting messages that oppose school policy can not be considered such a policy is indubitably.indeed,expressing sentiments constitutes paradigmatic political speech.nor can a policy become merely because each student is forced to adopt the message.thus,on the face of this record,the liberty high school policy can not be considered viewpoint or.
even assuming the majority analysis is correct and intermediate scrutiny applies,the school uniform policies at issue here fail at step one of that analysis.as the majority agrees,a viewpoint or restriction on speech is constitutional if it furthers an important or substantial government interest the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.turner broad,fcc,d internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states,d.
so what is the important or substantial government purpose here it is not,as some have suggested in similar contexts,to reduce divisions.rather,the state purpose of the school uniform and printed message ban is to promote school spirit.assuming this is an important government assumption majority neglects to consider whether the record demonstrates that the school uniform policy actually furthers this interest.
the school argues that the imposition of mandatory school uniforms and the ban on expressive messages results in an improvement of the educational process in individual schools through increasing student achievement,promoting safety,and enhancing a positive school climate.there is no empirical evidence of this in the record,only conclusory affidavits filed by school officials.indeed,the only empirical evidence in the record is that kim jacobs academic performance suffered as the direct result of the imposition of the speech ban on this record,the governmental interest in promoting school spirit can not come close to outweighing kim jacobs first amendment rights.
there are,of course,other issues in this case,and it is easy to be diverted by them.there is the broader question of freedom of dress.see gowri ramachandran,freedom of dress state and private regulation of clothing,hairstyle,jewelry and makeup,tattoos,and piercing.there are interesting and important questions about the legal difference between dress codes which limit the universe of clothing options and mandatory uniform policies which define the universe of clothing.there is the question of whether,following a tinker analysis of jacobs speech claims,her free exercise clause claims should be subjected to strict scrutiny under a hybrid rights analysis.see miller reed,cir.all of these issues,and more,form part of the larger question of the constitutionality of mandatory school uniforms.
however,in the present context,these are questions that need not be answered.the simple question for me is whether the district court and the majority properly rejected the traditional tinker analysis.because i believe the law of our circuit mandates that tinker applies,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for a proper reexamination of the case under tinker.i would not reach any of the other issues urged by the parties.
for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
the regulation was passed pursuant to section of the nevada revised statutes,which authorizes t he board of trustees of a nevada school district,in consultation with the schools within the district and parents and legal guardians of pupils who are enrolled in the district,to establish a policy that requires pupils to wear school uniforms.
this dress code contained typical student dress provisions,such as prohibitions on wearing hats in class,wearing clothing that is obscene,disruptive,or hazardous to student safety,and wearing skirts that are too short.none of the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of this basic dress code.
significantly,in its original incarnation,the regulation required any school considering a uniform policy to first conduct a parental survey.only if at least of the school parents returned the,of those responding,at least favored the the policy be implemented.
although the second and third purposes were not expressly listed in the original version of the regulation,they were listed in a revised version of the regulation and,according to an unrebutted affidavit from the district superintendent,were purposes of the regulation from the outset.
the other schools involved in this case implemented similar uniform policies,though most of these did not allow student clothing to contain a school logo.
her teachers apparently provided jacobs with homework,corrected that homework,allowed her to take tests,and communicated with her via telephone and.
jacobs was not penalized academically in fact,the undisputed evidence shows that her academic performance improved.
nor was jacobs forced to transfer to another school rather,she she is entitled to she would rather attend a school without a dress code than comply with the dress code at liberty.
jacobs also alleged violations of article,section of the nevada constitution and other provisions of nevada law.because article,section of the nevada constitution is coextensive with the first amendment to the united states constitution,mirage,and because none of the state law claims are at issue in this appeal,this decision focuses only on jacobs arguments under the united states constitution.
the preliminary injunction was based on the district court finding that liberty uniform policy was likely implemented without complying with the original regulation parental survey claim plaintiffs have since abandoned.see infra part iv objecting to policy implementation only insofar as it violated due process,not state law.
under the revised version of the regulation,a school could implement a uniform policy if,of the parental survey responses it received,at least expressed approval for the policy.a minimum response rate was no longer needed.
this portion made an exception to the uniform policy for nationally recognized youth organizations such as the boy scouts or the girl scouts.the district court reservations were based on its tentative conclusion that that portion of the regulation created a clothing exception.compare infra part.
like jacobs original complaint,the amended complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as appropriate damages.
dresser no longer attends bridger and,as plaintiffs counsel conceded at oral argument,does not presently attend a school in the district with a mandatory uniform policy.
the explanation given by the district deputy superintendent for the denial of a similar application filed by dresser brother,quinn who is not a named plaintiff in this suit,was that the dressers religion did not require its members to wear certain items of clothing to school and that the dressers made no showing that the uniform policy prevented their son from engaging in conduct that was required by his religion.
john doe i also alleges that he was unconstitutionally forbidden from wearing a say no to uniforms button at school however,as the district court properly found,this claim appears nowhere in the amended complaint and the brief treatment the subject was given in plaintiffs summary judgment filings was insufficient to assert a cause of action meriting further discussion.jacobs clark county sch,d.
these exempted students from complying with the uniform policies when doing so violates the student parent religion and permitted school principals to grant exceptions for designated spirit days,special occasions,or special conditions were found unconstitutional because they provided almost unlimited discretion to school administrators.see jacobs,d at citing city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d free exercise clause violated when unbridled discretion given to enforcing authorities.defendants do not appeal these rulings,discussed infra part argue that the district court decision to strike the religious exemption on excessive discretion grounds solved one constitutional problem only by creating another.
although the district court did not address plaintiffs compelled speech argument in its decision,the argument was properly raised both to the district court and to this court thus,we consider the argument on appeal.donovan crisostomo,cir.we do not,however,consider plaintiffs argument that the uniform policies worked to foreclose to plaintiffs an entire medium of expression,see city of ladue gilleo,d,as that argument was not properly raised to the district court.marx loral,cir.
jacobs alleges that,although her scholastic record did not suffer as a result of her repeated suspensions,she nevertheless suffered compensable reputational damage,as well as damages emanating from her missed classroom interactions.defendants counter that jacobs has put forth no admissible evidence of such damages.although we note that jacobs did put forth competent evidence that she was suspended for days and that missing classroom time caused her some educational harm,we need not decide whether this evidence would,itself,be sufficient to support a claim for compensable damages.as explained below,even taking the facts in the light most favorable to jacobs,none of jacobs constitutional rights were violated thus,the district court properly dismissed jacobs suit at the summary judgment stage.
specifically,because we find such relief inappropriate on the merits,we need not consider and,thus,do not decide whether plaintiffs requests for declaratory and injunctive relief are justiciable.
such conduct is unquestionably protected by the first amendment.see canady bossier parish sch,cir.
we need not decide whether such conduct is imbued with sufficient communicative intent to be protected by the first amendment.see spence washington,d per curiam.rather,we follow the fifth circuit lead and assume without deciding that wearing clothing different from one classmates is sufficiently expressive of a student views about to merit first amendment protection.see littlefield forney indep.sch,cir canady,at.
intermediate scrutiny precise contours vary slightly depending upon which constitutional right is at issue.in the first amendment context,intermediate scrutiny takes the form of the test for restrictions on expressive conduct,see united states,d,and the time,place and manner test for viewpoint and restrictions on pure speech,see turner broad,fcc,d.see also clark cmty.for creative,d confirming that the two tests are,in essence,identical.
that is,that the restriction is unconstitutional unless the school can show that engaging in the forbidden conduct would materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.id.quoting burnside byars,cir.although tinker did not equate its substantial interference test with the strict scrutiny test that is now commonly used in first amendment cases perhaps because that terminology was not in common parlance at the time,see first bank of boston bellotti,d earliest supreme court case using this terminology in the free speech context,plaintiffs argument rests on the substantial interference test being more difficult to withstand than the intermediate scrutiny test.
we take up this unresolved question in part.
as supreme court jurisprudence since tinker has made clear,and restrictions on speech are,for the most part,equally pernicious and,thus,restrictions of either variety must ordinarily be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny.see,bartnicki vopper,d ass for advancement of psychoanalysis cal.bd.of psychology,cir both and speech restrictions trigger strict scrutiny.
see tinker,at.pinard clatskanie sch.dist,cir students suspended for signing petition criticizing football coach lavine blaine sch,cir student expelled for showing teacher poem he wrote containing imagery of violent death and suicide chandler,at students prohibited from wearing buttons containing the word scab during a teacher strike karp becken,cir student suspended for attempting to distribute signs protesting school refusal to renew an english teacher contract hatter city high sch,cir students suspended for distributing leaflets and wearing tags opposing school chocolate drive.to our knowledge,every other circuit has applied tinker in this manner,as well.see,guzick drebus,cir applying tinker when student suspended for refusing to remove an antiwar button,cert.denied,d scoville bd.of educ.of joliet high sch.dist,cir applying tinker when students expelled for distributing a newspaper critical of the school see also coral acad.of,d applying tinker when student prohibited from reciting poem containing the words hell and damn.although the supreme court recently suggested that there are some instances in which even restrictions may be analyzed under a less demanding standard than that used in tinker,see morse frederick,d upholding school ban on sign reading bong hits jesus even though it did not substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school,the morse holding in no way contradicts our holding,that speech restrictions need not withstand tinker scrutiny either.
this conclusion does not contradict chandler,as plaintiffs contend,but merely recognizes that there exists a fourth category of student speech that had not been explored by either this court or the supreme court prior to chandler and,thus,was left unaccounted for in that case recitation of student speech law.
from this point forward unless otherwise noted,we use the term to capture the dual concepts of and,and do the converse with the term.see supra note explaining that viewpoint and speech restrictions are equally disfavored in first amendment jurisprudence and,thus,are interchangeable insofar as they are both subject to the same degree of judicial scrutiny.
see turner,at.t he principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of agreement or disagreement with the message it conveys.internal quotation marks,citation,and alterations omitted.
we also reject plaintiffs argument that the regulation is because it allows students to convey messages of conformity,but prohibits students like dresser from expressing their views about nonconformity.first,it is unlikely students complying with a school uniform policy would be viewed by others as communicating their approval for conformity,see spence,at,thus undermining dresser argument that his school uniform policy facilitates communication of conformist messages at all.second,under dresser logic,any policy requiring students to behave like their fellow students could be seen as favoring conformity and disfavoring,yet nobody would seriously contend that requiring students to raise their hands before speaking,being polite to classmates,most relevant to this a gym uniform,would be a speech restriction containing an implicit preference for conformist expression.
notably,these restrictions apply only during the school day and do not limit all speech,just speech that is communicated via students clothing.
contemplates a fourth prong of the intermediate scrutiny,that the regulation be within the government power to enact.at.because plaintiffs do not question the district power to implement mandatory school uniform policies under,no further discussion of this prong is necessary.accord littlefield,at.
if anything,the scrutiny should be even less demanding,as the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings,and the rights of students must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.morse.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because we find that the district school uniform policies withstand intermediate scrutiny,however,we have no occasion to consider whether an even more lenient standard would be consistent with the constitution.
