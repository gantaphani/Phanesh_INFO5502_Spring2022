on november,freedom from religion foundation,a national organization whose purpose is to protect the fundamental constitutional principle of separation of church and state,and individual plaintiffs anne gaylor,annie laurie gaylor,and dan barker collectively,the plaintiffs initiated this action.pursuant to,plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of a wisconsin program which subsidizes telecommunications access for both public and private,sectarian and nonsectarian,schools.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the program was constitutional except for that portion which provided unrestricted cash grants to private,sectarian schools in order to reduce the cost of their existing telecommunications access expenses.the court granted summary judgment in part in favor of the defendants,finding the access portion of the program was constitutional,and in part in favor of the plaintiffs,finding that the grant aspect of the program was unconstitutional under the establishment clause.the defendants appeal from the summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs as to the grant portion of the program.although the plaintiffs had initially appealed the summary judgment in favor of the defendants that the major portion of the program was constitutional,after the publication of mitchell helms,d,a case which challenged the constitutionality of state and federal school aid programs as applied to parochial schools in louisiana,plaintiffs dismissed their cross appeal.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court holding.
background 
the wisconsin budget act.act,created the technology for education achievement board the teach board,which administers the educational telecommunications access program.stat.the program.defendants are members of the teach board.the program is funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications providers who are permitted to increase their rates to customers in order to recover the costs.the individual plaintiffs are taxpayers of the state of wisconsin and are local telephone service customers of ameritech wisconsin.the individual plaintiffs pay a monthly surcharge to ameritech by which ameritech recovers its contributions used to fund the program.
under the terms of the program,private elementary and secondary schools and colleges,technical colleges,cooperative educational service organizations,public library boards,and public school districts are able to request that the teach board provide them with access to one data line or video link,which enables the user to access the internet.a video link also enables the user to create an interactive television whereby students and a teacher can see,hear,and speak to each other via television from remote locations.the data lines and video links provided by the state under the program are heavily subsidized.although program participants are charged per month for a data line and per month for a video link,the cost to the program to provide a data line and a video link is approximately and per month,respectively.
private schools and colleges,almost all of which are religiously affiliated,are not permitted to participate in any of the broader aspects of the legislative initiatives,but are authorized only to participate in the portion of the program that allows them to contract with the state for access to a data line or video link,or to receive grants to reduce the net cost of their existing data line or video link.these private schools account for approximately ten percent of the total cost of the program.the program does not in any way control the content of information received by participants over the data lines or video links,although such links are sometimes used to transmit religious information.
the program was amended in by.act to provide grants to school districts and private schools which had contracts for access to a data line or video link in effect on october.the grant amount is the difference between the cost to the program to supply a link less the ordinary contribution of the school,but not to exceed the actual contract cost.stat.g.no statutory restriction is placed on the use of the grant funds,although a letter accompanying the grant provides that the funds are to be used for educational technology purposes includ ing making payments on the existing service contract,purchasing hardware and software,providing training to teachers and staff,upgrading existing networks,wiring school buildings,or completing any other educational technology project.
prior to the district court ruling,the program had awarded annual grants of to schools and colleges.a portion of that total,approximately three percent,has been awarded to nine private,schools and colleges participating in the grant portion of the program.these nine schools represent not quite seven percent of the total number of schools participating in this aspect of the program.only these unrestricted cash grants to religious schools are at issue in this appeal.
ii.analysis 
standing is the threshold question in every federal case,determining the power of the court to entertain the suit.warth seldin,d.under article iii,only a plaintiff with a personal stake in a case or controversy has standing.gonzales north township,cir.this personal stake can be established only if the plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact.warth,at.at the summary judgment stage,the plaintiff must produce evidence in the form of.e affidavits or documents that support the injury allegation.see united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,d gonzales,at.plaintiffs have met the standing requirement by showing that as taxpayers their tax dollars have gone to support an allegedly unconstitutional program which contributes unrestricted cash grants to religious schools.see flast cohen,d gonzales,at freedom from religion,zielke,cir.
cash grants 
we review de novo the decision of the district court to grant summary judgment.see gonzales,at citing anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we must review the record in the light most favorable to the defendants in this case and make all reasonable inferences in their favor.see anderson,at.citation omitted.because the parties do not dispute the material facts,we review de novo the district court conclusions of law.see freedom from religion,city of marshfield,cir citation omitted.
the establishment clause,which states that congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion,const.amend,cl,prevents the government from promoting or affiliating with any religious doctrine or organization.see county of allegheny american civil liberties union,d gonzales,at.the establishment clause also is a specific prohibition on forms of state intervention in religious affairs lee weisman,d.this applies equally to state legislatures under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see cantwell connecticut.in addition,the wisconsin constitution,art.i,provides,nor shall any money be drawn from the treasury for the benefit of religious societies,or religious or theological seminaries,which has been held to be the equivalent of the establishment clause by the wisconsin supreme court.see jackson benson,citation omitted.
in an effort to prevent sponsorship,financial support,or active involvement of the government in religious activity,see walz tax comm n,d,the supreme court formulated a test to determine whether a statute complies with the establishment clause.see lemon kurtzman,d.under this test,a statute does not violate the establishment clause if it has a secular legislative purpose,its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion,and it does not create excessive entanglement between government and religion.id.at.in agostini felton,d,the supreme court modified the lemon test in cases inv
