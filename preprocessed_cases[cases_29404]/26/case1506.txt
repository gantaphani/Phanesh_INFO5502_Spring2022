in order to accommodate emergencies,vacations,and illness,school districts offer independent study programs.unlike independent study programs,independent study allows the student to remain enrolled in classes while being absent for brief periods,generally from five to school days.during their absence,students are responsible for completing assignments.
under education code section,school districts must adopt written policies containing guidelines for independent study in order to be eligible for state funding for pupils engaged in independent study subdivision c of section specifies eight items to be included in independent study agreements.
modesto city schools modesto appeals from an order denying its petition for writ of administrative mandamus to overturn an administrative decision interpreting section as requiring school districts to strictly adhere to subdivision c in written policies for both and independent study programs.modesto independent study written agreements failed to include all the requirements set forth in subdivision c.as a result,real parties in interest office of the state controller sco and department of finance collectively,real parties determined modesto must forfeit over in independent study funding.
on appeal,modesto contends the plain language of section does not require districts to adopt all the items listed in subdivision c under the doctrine of administrative collateral estoppel,an earlier finding of an education audits appeal panel appeal panel precludes relitigation of the issue and the finding that modesto independent study agreements were deficient was based on an invalid underground regulation.we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the statute

a the maximum length of time,by grade level and type of program,that may elapse between the time an independent study assignment is made and the date by which the pupil must complete assigned work.

modesto independent study 
modesto adopted a board policy authorizing an independent study program as an optional alternative for students to reach curriculum objectives and fulfill graduation requirements.at modesto,some independent study is short term,lasting as little as five days or as many as days.independent study may last as long as a semester.
unlike those in independent study programs,independent study students continue to be enrolled in their regular classes and never leave the regular school program.students receive an assignment sheet for each subject from the teacher,specifying assignments to be completed during the independent study period.students return to class at the end of the independent study.parents voluntarily request independent study for their children,often because of vacation plans.
independent study generally lasts an entire semester.students enrolled in college or vocational courses,students who work,and students who prefer to work at their own pace participate in independent study.students are from regular classes.
the audit report 
in november an independent auditing firm completed an audit of modesto for the through fiscal year audit report.the audit report found modesto independent study agreements fully complied with section.however,modesto independent study agreements lacked five of the elements required under section,subdivision c.
modesto appealed the finding to the appeal panel.in a proposed decision,the administrative law judge alj dismissed the appeal,finding a lack of jurisdiction to adjudicate issues of law.the appeal panel declined to adopt the proposed decision and remanded for further evidence.
the appeal panel ultimately adopted a proposed decision granting modesto appeal,finding the list of items in section is consistent with the list of items adopted by the modesto city schools board in its policy.the plain meaning of the language is that a school district must adopt written policies that include certain requirements for the independent study contracts.the modesto city schools complied with this requirement of the education code and is eligible to receive apportionments for the independent study students who were the subjects of this matter.
modesto requested that the final decision be designated a precedential decision.the appeal panel denied the request.
the audit report 
in the independent auditing firm conducted a subsequent audit of modesto audit report.the audit report found the same deficiencies as the audit report.the sco certified the audit report.
the audit report concluded that five requirements of section,subdivision c were missing from modesto independent study agreements.the agreements lacked the following elements the number of missed assignments allowed before evaluation the objectives and methods of study for the pupil work a statement of the number of course credits,or other measures of academic accomplishment,to be earned by the pupil upon completion the inclusion of a statement in each agreement that independent study is an optional educational alternative and a statement that instruction may be provided through independent study only if the pupil is offered the alternative of classroom instruction.
the auditor recommended that modesto ada average daily attendance computation for funding be eliminated for independent study 
modesto again appealed the finding as to the independent study agreements.modesto also filed a motion for summary disposition,arguing the final decision on the audit report was binding upon the audit appeal.following a hearing,the alj denied the motion.
the alj concluded the public interest exception to the rule of collateral estoppel applied and allowed the issue of compliance with section to be relitigated.the alj found,the funding and regulation of independent study programs is an important public interest which impacts hundreds of schools,thousand of students and parents,and the public treasury.the alj also noted were collateral estoppel to apply,the state of california would be bound to the statutory interpretation of the administrative law judge,in all audits of all of the state school districts which provide or independent study programs.
the parties stipulated to the entry of the transcript of the hearing on the audit appeal.the appeal panel adopted the alj proposed decision in the audit appeal as its final decision.the alj found the legislature intended to pay ada apportionment for independent study programs only when the programs complied with quality control measures.one of those quality control measures was the creation of a specific contract between the teacher and the,setting forth the elements specified in section,subdivision c.the intent of the independent study contract included providing written notice to students and parents of options to independent study,and notice of board policies regarding conditions of independent study.the intent of the independent study contract was also to memorialize and bind the students and teachers to an agreement on the obligations of the student and the teacher during the independent study period.
the alj also concluded in light of the legislative intent of section it is clear that the legislature sought to enact a comprehensive program for ensuring fiscal and academic accountability of independent study programs.there is no fiscal or academic accountability in a program where a school board enacts a policy but is not required to impose the policy upon its independent study programs.
modesto filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus.following a hearing,the trial court denied the writ.the trial court found the word adopt,as used in section,does not necessarily have a plain meaning and therefore consideration of the statute legislative history is appropriate.the trial court review of the legislative history indicated the legislature intended that the elements specified in subdivision c of section be included in the actual written agreements for each pupil and not merely in a written policy voted on by modesto board.the trial court also found collateral estoppel did not apply for two reasons the issue is one of law,and the public interest exception applies.finally,the trial court found the audit guide used by the auditor in evaluating modesto compliance with section did not amount to an underground regulation.
following entry of judgment,modesto filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
on appeal following a trial court decision on a petition for writ of mandate,we need only review the record to determine whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.however,we review questions of law independently.thus,where the facts are undisputed and the issue involves statutory interpretation,we exercise our independent judgment and review the matter de novo.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d.
the present appeal raises three issues of law on which we exercise our independent judgment the meaning of adopted written policies as used in section,which denies apportionments to school districts for independent studies unless the districts have adopted written policies including certain prescribed requirements whether the doctrine of administrative collateral estoppel compels adherence to the appeal panel decision upholding the audit report finding and thereby precludes relitigation of modesto compliance with section and whether the audit guide used in performing the challenged audit constitutes an underground regulation.
the meaning of section 
as is often the case in matters of statutory construction,both parties assert the disputed phrase here,adopted written policies is clear and unambiguous and its meaning is plain,though they disagree over what the phrase means.it is not uncommon in such a contest for parties to support their varied interpretations with reference to disparate dictionary definitions of critical terms.black law dictionary may be set against webster in its various incantations,or various dictionary definitions of the same word may be put in play.what is unusual about the present controversy is that while the parties cite different editions of the same dictionary collegiate dictionary,they agree on the same definition,adopt means to take up and practice or use or to accept formally and put into effect.
real parties argue this means the independent study agreements must contain language implementing the requirements of the adopted policy.modesto contends adopt,when used in conjunction with policy the general principles by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs,requires only the formal acceptance of written principles for an independent study program.therefore,section requires a district to adopt formal policies enumerating the specific items listed in subdivision c it does not require the inclusion of those items in each independent study contract.
we read the language of a statute in context and in light of the nature and purpose of the statutory scheme.hunt superior court cal th,d.while modesto correctly advises that our obligation is to apply the plain meaning of the words used,the meaning it assigns to the critical words here at issue is neither plain nor plausible in light of the context in which the words appear.modesto reading,which limits its obligation under section to the formal acceptance of written principles,ignores portions of the webster definition and effectively eviscerates the legislative mandate.
section does not merely refer to general policies of student accountability it prescribes the content and form of such policies.thus it compels written policies that include a requirement that a current written agreement for each independent study pupil shall be maintained on file,subd.c.moreover,the content of the written agreement is set forth in detail and includes the items omitted from modesto independent study agreements.it can not plausibly be argued that modesto has put into effect the policy required by section when all that it does is express approval in principle without implementing the requirements set forth in the statute.
modesto proposed construction of section is completely at odds with legislative history.the summary digest explains that the amendments to section would prohibit school districts from receiving apportionments for independent study unless written policies are adopted regarding the maximum length of time,by grade level and type of program,that may elapse between the independent study assignment and completion,and the number of missed assignments permitted before a formal evaluation is required,a current written agreement containing specified information which is signed by the pupil,and pupils in independent study are identified in records by grade level,placement,and the school in which they are enrolled.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.stats,summary,italics added.
the senate committee on education also provided a staff analysis of the proposed bill.the analysis states,in part this bill would require lea local educational agencies that offer isp independent study program to do the following adopt rules and regulations regarding a the maximum length of time that a student has to complete instructional assignments.b the number of missed assignments that will automatically trigger a formal evaluation to determine if isp is an appropriate placement.include in each pupil written agreement the elements listed in section,subdivision c specify that an lea will not receive apportionment for pupils in isp unless it does each of the following a maintains a written agreement,as specified,for each pupil.com.on education,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics added.
in a letter to then governor george deukmejian,senator gary hart explained the legislative intent behind section t he lack of specification in current law governing independent study has allowed programs to vary widely in structure and quality.sb would enact quality control standards for independent study that establish student teacher ratios,require districts to adopt local policies to ensure proper monitoring of the program,expand the written agreements that specify the instructional plan for each independent study pupil and require the state department of education to begin compiling data to determine the level of ac
