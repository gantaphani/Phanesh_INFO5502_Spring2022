discussion 
section a provides that an educational loan is not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless excepting such debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.while this court is obliged to accept the bankruptcy court undisturbed findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous,we review de novo conclusions as to the legal effect of those findings.united states richman in re talbot,cir.whether a debtor student loans would impose an undue hardship under a is a question of law.woodcock chemical bank,nyshesc in re woodcock,cir.it requires a conclusion regarding the legal effect of the bankruptcy court findings as to the debtor circumstances,and is therefore reviewed de novo.see also long educ.credit mgmt.in re long,cir collecting cases.
undue hardship standard 
the bankruptcy code does not define undue hardship,nor has the tenth circuit designated a test for the determination of the term.in an unpublished decision,cuenca department of education,wl,at cir,we noted that undue hardship is something more than inconvenience or doing without luxuries,stating that the discharge of a student loan should be based upon an inability to earn and not simply a reduced standard of living.
the court in cuenca found that the debtor earned per year,his wife did not work,he was not burdened with a number of old debts,and that he had derived a benefit from his education.in refusing to discharge the debtor student loan,the court stated,cuenca income is not at or below poverty level.many families would be envious of his annual income.id.
in enacting a,congress was primarily concerned about abusive student debtors and protecting the solvency of student loan programs.see in re andresen,cir.congress itself had little to say on the dischargeability of student loans.the phrase undue hardship was lifted verbatim from the draft bill proposed by the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states.the commission noted that the reason for the code provision was a rising incidence of consumer bankruptcies of former students motivated primarily to avoid payment of educational loan debts.report of the comm on the of the united states,doc,pt.ii,reprinted in collier on bankruptcy,app.pt.c at ed.hereinafter commission report.upon graduation,the typical student has little or no property that can be distributed to creditors,but may have substantial future earning potential.section a was designed to remove the temptation of recent graduates to use the bankruptcy system as a method of unencumbering future earnings.
these bankruptcies contravened the general policy that a loan that enables a person to earn substantially greater income over his working life should not as a matter of policy be dischargeable before he has demonstrated that for any reason he is unable to earn sufficient income to maintain himself and his dependents and to repay the educational debt.id.the commission implemented this policy by recommending the delay of dischargeability for five years a time period that gives the debtor an opportunity to try to meet his payment obligation.id.at.after five years,the exception would be lifted in recognition of the fact that in some circumstances the debtor,because of factors beyond his reasonable control,may be unable to earn an income adequate both to meet the living costs of himself and his dependents and to make the educational debt payments.id.during the first five years,however,a student loan could only be discharged if its payment would impose an undue hardship on the debtor.
the commission noted that in order to determine whether nondischargeability of the debt will impose an undue hardship,
the rate and amount of his future resources should be estimated reasonably in terms of ability to obtain,retain,and continue employment and the rate of pay that can be expected.any unearned income or other wealth which the debtor can be expected to receive should also be taken into account.the total amount of income,its reliability,and the periodicity of its receipt should be adequate to maintain the debtor and his dependents,at a minimal standard of living within their management capability,as well as to pay the education debt.
the various courts of appeals that have applied the undue hardship provision of a have adopted two tests.most circuits have adopted a version of the second circuit test in brunner new york state higher education services,cir.see united states dep t of educ.gerhardt in re gerhardt,cir hemar ins.of am.cox in re cox,cir united student aid funds,pena in re pena,cir.higher educ.assistance agency faish in re faish,cir cheesman.student assistance in re cheesman,cir in re roberson,cir.the eighth circuit has instead adopted a totality of the circumstances test in determining undue hardship.see andrews student loan assistance in re andrews,cir see also in re long,at.
the brunner test requires the debtor to prove 
that the debtor can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.
at.under the brunner analysis,if the court finds against the debtor on any of the three parts,the inquiry ends and the student loan is not dischargeable.id.
the facts in brunner weighed heavily against the debtor,and thus the court refused to discharge the student loan.the debtor was not disabled or elderly and had no dependents.she was also skilled and well educated.she did not recount to the court any specific jobs that she had sought and been refused,and did not attempt to find a job outside of her chosen field of work.she only had of student loan debt,but two months prior to the bankruptcy hearing,she withdrew from her savings to buy a car.moreover,she filed for discharge within a month of the date the first payment of the loans came due,made virtually no attempt to repay,and did not request a deferment of payment.brunner state higher educ.svcs.in re brunner,
many subsequent courts employing the brunner analysis,however,appear to have constrained the three brunner requirements to deny discharge under even the most dire circumstances.see,healey.higher educ.in re healey,debtor failed first brunner prong,because,although she was unable to maintain a minimal standard of living on her current income,she did not demonstrate that she was making a strenuous effort to maximize her personal income within the practical limitations of her vocational profile in re walcott,debtor failed second brunner prong because,since a per hour position teaching literacy classes was the highest hourly wage she has ever earned,her current prospects appear brighter than at nearly any other time since her graduation in re roberson,at debtor,who was divorced,unemployed,and living in a apartment that did not have even a kitchen or toilet,failed second brunner prong because he did not present a certainty of hopelessness in re,debtor,who had nerve damage,bronchitis,and arthritis,and whose daughter had epilepsy,mother had cancer,and grandchildren had asthma,failed good faith prong because s he intentionally chose to help her family financially.
these applications show that an overly restrictive interpretation of the brunner test fails to further the bankruptcy code goal of providing a fresh start for the honest but unfortunate debtor,stellwagen clum,and can cause harsh results for individuals seeking to discharge their student loans.
under the eighth circuit totality of the circumstances test for undue hardship,bankruptcy courts should consider 
the debtor past,present,and reasonably reliable future financial resources a calculation of the debtor and her dependent reasonable necessary living expenses and any other relevant facts and circumstances surrounding each particular bankruptcy case.simply put,if the debtor reasonable future financial resources will sufficiently cover payment of the student loan still allowing for a minimal standard of the debt should not be discharged.
id.at citations omitted.
relevant factors that different courts consider when examining the totality of circumstances of a debtor situation include,but are not limited to,whether the debtor has made a good faith effort to negotiate a deferment of payment whether the hardship will be whether the debtor has made any payments of the student loans whether a debtor is permanently or temporarily disabled whether the debtor has tried to maximize income and minimize expenses whether the debtor has an ability to obtain gainful employment in her area of study and the ratio of the student loan to the total indebtedness.see lawson hemar serv.of am.in re lawson.
according to the eighth circuit,the totality of the circumstances test is a less restrictive approach than the brunner test.long,at.it recognizes the inherent discretion contained in a,and allows each undue hardship case to be examined on the unique facts and circumstances that surround the particular bankruptcy.see also in re johnson,rigid adherence to a particular test robs the court of the discretion envisioned by congress in drafting a.it has also been suggested that the totality of circumstances test better considers the debtor situation in light of the fresh start policies of a,because it does not let a single factor become dispositive against a finding of undue hardship.see,in re afflitto,in re law.
on the other hand,it is not necessarily true that a totality of circumstances analysis of each debtor situation avoids the harshness of the brunner analysis.under this standard,courts may choose from a multitude of factors and apply any combination of them to a given case,suggesting that just about anything the parties may want to offer may be worthy of consideration.as a result,it has an unfortunate tendency to generate lists of factors that should be that grow ever longer as the case law develops.see,in re smither,noting factors a court must consider.legal rules have value only to the extent they guide primary conduct or the exercise of judicial discretion.laundry lists,which may show ingenuity in imagining what could be relevant but do not assign weights or consequences to the factors,flunk the test of utility.in re plunkett,cir.
an ad hoc,approach has been justified as more in accordance with legislative intent.see,wilson.higher educ.loan,each undue hardship discharge must rest on its own facts.it is correct to state that congress wanted undue hardship to be a standard.as a practical matter,however,the two tests will often consider similar debtor current and prospective financial situation in relation to the educational debt and the debtor efforts at repayment.
we do not read brunner to rule out consideration of all the facts and circumstances.under the first aspect of brunner,the bankruptcy court is to inquire about whether the debtor can maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying the debt.this evaluation necessarily entails an analysis of all relevant factors,including the health of the debtor and any of his dependents and the debtor education and skill level.the second brunner factor similarly requires an analysis of all the facts and circumstances that affect the debtor future financial position.finally,the good faith part includes an analysis of the debtor situation in order to determine whether he has made a good faith attempt to repay the loan by maximizing income and minimizing expenses.
we therefore join the majority of the other circuits in adopting the brunner framework.however,to better advance the bankruptcy code fresh start policy,and to provide judges with the discretion to weigh all the relevant considerations,the terms of the test must be applied such that debtors who truly can not afford to repay their loans may have their loans discharged.additionally,we think that the good faith portion of the brunner test should consider whether the debtor is acting in good faith in seeking the discharge,or whether he is intentionally creating his hardship.
the first part of the debtor can not maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying the student loan with the legislative policy behind a,that student loans should not as a matter of policy be dischargeable before the debtor has demonstrated that for any reason he is unable to earn sufficient income to maintain himself and his dependents and to repay the educational debt.commission report,supra,at.this first part should serve as the starting point for the undue hardship inquiry because information regarding a debtor current financial situation generally will be concrete and readily obtainable.
the second brunner element,which requires that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans,properly recognizes that a student loan is viewed as a mortgage on the debtor future.id.however,in applying this prong,courts need not require a certainty of hopelessness.instead,a realistic look must be made into debtor circumstances and the debtor ability to provide for adequate shelter,nutrition,health care,and the
