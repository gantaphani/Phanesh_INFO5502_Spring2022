the institute of chartered financial analysts of india icfai appeals from the district court september reinstatement of a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff,the cfa institute by its ruling,the court determined that it possessed personal jurisdiction over icfai under federal rule of civil procedure k.on appeal,icfai contends that the court erred in its application of rule k and lacked personal jurisdiction in these proceedings.as explained below,we conclude that it was unnecessary for the court to reach and address rule k,because it possessed jurisdiction over icfai under virginia statute.we thus affirm the judgment.
at the outset,we identify and briefly explain the three rulings at issue in this appeal.the first is the october,default judgment entered in favor of the cfa institute and against icfai,premised on the existence of personal jurisdiction over icfai under the virginia statute.that ruling is comprised of a set of findings of fact and conclusions of law the opinion,and an order entering default judgment the order.see inst.of chartered fin.analysts inst.of chartered fin.analysts of india,by the second ruling,issued on may,the district court vacated the order on the ground that it lacked personal jurisdiction over icfai under virginia statute when it entered the default judgment in.see cfa inst.inst.of chartered fin.analysts of india.may,the relief order.finally,by the third ruling,made on september,the court reinstated the order.that ruling is comprised of a memorandum opinion the reinstatement opinion and an order the reinstatement order.see cfa inst.inst.of chartered fin.analysts of india,in the reinstatement opinion,the court explained that,although it lacked personal jurisdiction over icfai under virginia statute,it possessed such jurisdiction under rule k.
turning to the pertinent facts of this case,the cfa institute is a association based in charlottesville,virginia it was founded in for the purposes of administering a unique and intensive program of specialized study and testing in the field of financial analysis and conferring upon qualifying candidates the right to use a charter reflecting membership the cfa program.opinion.the cfa institute owns and uses the trademark chartered financial analyst the cfa mark icfai,established in,is an indian corporation headquartered in hyderabad,india.its purpose is the study of corporate finance,financial services and financial analysis in india.id.at.the cfa institute and icfai are separate business entities.
the parties underlying relationship began in about,when icfai founder,yasaswy,travelled to charlottesville and approached cfa institute officials about establishing a cfa program in india although nothing was apparently agreed upon during the charlottesville meeting,cfa institute representatives travelled to india in august,and a business agreement was then reached the license agreement.pursuant thereto,the cfa institute authorized icfai to establish a cfa program in india.in an apparent effort to reflect this new relationship,icfai changed its corporate name from the institute of certified financial analysts of india to the institute of chartered financial analysts of india.
icfai representatives visited the cfa institute in virginia on at least one additional occasion,when,in,yasaswy and another icfai official attended a cfa institute board meeting in virginia as special guests of honour.furthermore,in november,icfai executive director,subhash sarnikar,directed,among other correspondence,a letter to the cfa institute,requesting expanded permission to use cfa institute intellectual property in india.
in,the relationship between the parties began to sour when the cfa institute ascertained that icfai was violating the license agreement by marketing its version of the cfa program in the united states and canada through written and online materials.concerned that icfai use of the cfa program in these countries could confuse consumers,the cfa institute notified icfai that it was in violation of the license agreement.as a result,on december,icfai agreed to recognize the cfa institute superior rights in the cfa mark and to cease using it in the united states and canada the settlement agreement.
unfortunately,the settlement agreement survived less than two years.in january,suspecting that icfai was violating the settlement agreement,the cfa institute terminated the license agreement.a year thereafter,on january,icfai responded by notifying the cfa institute by letter that it would no longer abide by the settlement agreement.
as a result of the foregoing,the cfa institute,on july,filed its complaint against icfai in the eastern district of virginia,alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act,plus breach of contract.when icfai failed to appear in the proceedings,the district court,by its order,entered a default judgment against icfai.the default judgment,inter alia,enjoined icfai from using the cfa mark,promoting employment opportunities for icfai in the united states and canada,and holding itself out as in any way affiliated with the cfa institute 
in its opinion,the district court identified several of icfai contacts with the cfa institute in virginia that supported the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the commonwealth.from those facts,the court concluded that the cfa institute claims arose out of conduct by icfai in the commonwealth of virginia that icfai intentionally patterned its cfa program on the plaintiffs well established program based in the commonwealth of virginia that icfai sent representatives to the commonwealth of virginia to meet with the cfa and that icfai representatives attended cfa board meetings and had meetings with cfa officers in virginia.opinion.thus,the court concluded that it possessed personal jurisdiction over icfai under virginia statute additionally,the court observed that icfai had waived any objection to personal jurisdiction by directing correspondence to the court 
more than eight years after the order,on december,icfai appeared before the district court and requested it to reopen the proceedings and vacate the default judgment.icfai sought such relief under federal rule of civil procedure b,claiming that the default judgment was void because the court lacked personal jurisdiction when it was entered.in support of its rule b motion,icfai maintained that indian currency regulations had prevented it from retaining counsel in,and it was thus unable to timely contest the complaint.on may,observing that it appear ed that the court lacked personal jurisdiction at the time default judgment was entered,the court granted icfai rule b motion and vacated the order.relief order 
on may,the cfa institute requested that the district court reconsider its relief order and reinstate the order.this request was predicated on two separate grounds.first,the cfa institute contended that,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure h,icfai had waived its objection to personal jurisdiction by virtue of the five letters it submitted to the court in.second,the cfa institute asserted that,even if icfai contacts with virginia failed to satisfy virginia statute,its contacts with the united states as a whole warranted the court exercise of personal jurisdiction under rule k 
three months later,on september,the district court filed its reinstatement opinion and order,reinstating the order the reinstatement opinion summarized the procedural posture of the case,explaining that the court,in making its relief order,had found merit in icfai arguments and found that it lacked personal jurisdiction over icfai in.reinstatement opinion.the court then addressed the cfa institute contentions,first concluding that the waiver argument was without merit.id.at.although a party may waive its objection to personal jurisdiction under rule h,the court explained,the party does not waive an objection to jurisdiction by failing to respond or appear.in these proceedings,it was undisputed that icfai neither filed any responsive pleadings nor made a general appearance.id.and,the court observed,the letters written by icfai to the court were deemed improper and stricken from the record.id.thus,it found no basis from which to conclude that icfai had waived an objection to personal jurisdiction or had submitted to such jurisdiction in these proceedings.
the district court,however,agreed with the cfa institute rule k contention.in contrast to the extensive findings made in the opinion,the reinstatement opinion made a more limited assessment of the facts underlying the court jurisdictional analysis.by the reinstatement opinion,the court observed that,the parties,at a minimum,agree to the following 
a s of icfai then executive director,sarnikar registered a corporation on behalf of icfai in california made the decision to let that registration expire and had a relationship with transworld university,a california entity.in addition to these california contacts,an icfai representative visited virginia in,although defendant avers no business was conducted an icfai representative attended a cfa institute board meeting in virginia in icfai corresponded and collaborated with the cfa institute over an extended period and the entities are parties to a settlement agreement.
reinstatement opinion the court thus concluded that icfai contacts with the united states as a whole support a finding of personal jurisdiction under rule k,and it reinstated the order.
icfai has timely appealed,contending that the district court erred in entering the reinstatement order.put succinctly,it contends that the court misapplied rule k and erred in concluding that it possessed personal jurisdiction over icfai.
we assess de novo whether the district court possessed personal jurisdiction over the defendant in this proceeding.see christian sci.bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ,scientist nolan,cir.any relevant factual findings made by the court,however,are reviewed for clear error.see new wellington fin.flagship resort dev,cir.finally,a court of appeals is entitled to sustain the judgment of a lower court on any ground apparent from the record.see cochran morris,cir observing the authority of courts of appeals to uphold judgments of district courts on alternate grounds.
before assessing the district court ruling under federal rule of civil procedure k,we are obliged to first determine whether the district court possessed personal jurisdiction over icfai under the virginia statute.pursuant to rule k a,a federal court assessing such a jurisdictional issue borrows and applies the applicable statute and governing principles from the forum state.see rule k a s erving a summons establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.if the state statute fails to authorize the court exercise of personal jurisdiction,we must only whether rule k is satisfied.united states swiss am.bank,cir analyzing personal jurisdiction under relevant state statute before proceeding to rule k analysis.as explained below,we need not reach or address the reinstatement opinion rule k analysis,because virginia statute authorizes the court exercise of personal jurisdiction over icfai.
in order for a district court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant pursuant to a state statute,two requirements must be satisfied.first,the forum state statute must authorize the exercise of such personal jurisdiction.second,if that authorization exists,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that the defendant have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state.see christian sci.bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ,scientist nolan,cir 
in assessing whether virginia statute authorized the exercise of personal jurisdiction over icfai,we observe that the commonwealth provides multiple bases for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.see.here,the cfa institute necessarily relies on the first of those ten bases,that icfai was t ransacting any business in virginia.id.at a.significantly,the state and federal courts have construed virginia statute as extending personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the full extent permitted by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see,peninsula cruise,new river yacht sales,see also young new haven advocate,cir.thus,we determine whether icfai was t ransacting any business with the cfa institute under virginia statute by simply assessing whether icfai had sufficient minimum contacts with virginia to comport with due process standards.in other words,if icfai contacts with the cfa institute in virginia satisfy due process,then they also satisfy virginia statute.see carefirst of,carefirst pregnancy,cir recognizing that,in such circumstances,our statutory inquiry merges with our constitutional inquiry.
turning to the due process analysis,the supreme court has recognized that a district court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant only if the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state.see int l shoe washington.this minimum contacts test is premised on the concept that a corporation that enjoys the privilege of conducting business within a state bears the reciprocal obligation of answering to legal proceedings there.see id.at.indeed,a single act by a defendant can be sufficient to satisfy the necessary quality and nature of such minimal contacts,although casual or isolated contacts are insufficient to trigger such an obligation.id.at.see also mcgee int l life ins,d recognizing jurisdiction on basis of defendant single contract with forum state.in order to be subject to a court exercise of personal jurisdiction,a defendant must have fair warning that a particular activity may subject him to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign.burger king rudzewicz,d quoting shaffer heitner,d stevens,concurring in judgment.we have also observed that the defendant actions must be directed at the forum state in more than a random,fortuitous,or attenuated way.esab group,centricut,cir.
our precedent recognizes that a district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant may rest upon limited contacts with the forum state,so long as due process is not offended.in hirschkop grad,robinson,we affirmed a default judgment against defendants who had been sued in virginia by a virginia law firm.see,cir.even though the defendants activities in virginia were limited,we agreed with the district court that their contacts with the commonwealth satisfied virginia statute and due process.see id.the jurisdictional facts were essentially these the defendants met with the plaintiffs in virginia to discuss the possibility of entering into a business relationship the defendants retained the plaintiff some disputes between the parties were settled over the telephone,with the defendant in oregon and the plaintiff in virginia the defendants travelled to virginia at least once to meet with the plaintiff to discuss disputed fees and the defendants sent correspondence and mailed payments to the plaintiff in virginia.see id.as explained below,the quality and nature of icfai contacts with virginia are akin to those of the hirschkop defendants,and they likewise support the court exercise of personal jurisdiction over icfai in virginia.
as explained above,the controlling inquiry in this appeal is whether exercising personal jurisdiction over icfai under virginia statute comports with the due process clause.this jurisdictional analysis is necessarily,and we are first obliged to identify those facts supporting the exercise of personal jurisdiction over icfai in virginia.of icfai seven stipulated contacts specified in the reinstatement opinion,four concern icfai relationship with the cfa institute in virginia collectively,the reinstatement stipulations
