we must decide whether columbia union college,an institution of higher education affiliated with the adventist church,may receive a grant from the state of maryland sellinger program.the parties do not dispute that columbia union satisfies each of the neutral statutory requirements for participation in the program.the maryland higher education commission,however,denied the college request for money because the commission believed that columbia union was a pervasively sectarian institution,and thus to give the college money would violate the establishment clause.
we disagree.the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that columbia union was not pervasively sectarian.because state aid is allocated on a neutral basis to an institution of higher education which will not use the funds for any sectarian purpose,we affirm the judgment of the district court that columbia union qualifies for sellinger program funds.
columbia union is a private college affiliated with and controlled by the adventist church.approximately of the college traditional students are adventists.according to the college program bulletin,students may major in fifteen subjects leading to a bachelor of arts degree.eighteen majors lead to a bachelor of science degree.columbia union offers majors in subjects typical of any college,such as accounting,biochemistry,business administration,communication,computer science,english,general studies,history,mathematics,music,and psychology.
the college applied for a grant from maryland joseph sellinger program.the sellinger program gives public aid to private colleges within the state.under the program,the state makes annual payments directly to the eligible institutions.to qualify for sellinger funds,an institution must satisfy six neutral criteria.first,the college must be,inter alia,a private college or university that was established in maryland before july.second,the institution must be approved by the maryland higher education commission,the agency statutorily assigned to administer the program.third,the college must,inter alia,be accredited.fourth,the institution must have awarded the associate of arts or baccalaureate degrees to at least one graduating class.fifth,the college must maintain one or more programs leading to such degrees other than seminarian or theological programs.sixth,the institution must submit each new program or major modification of an existing program to the commission for its approval.see ann.educ.
in addition to these six requirements,the statute also mandates that no sellinger funds may be used for sectarian purposes.id.to comply with this command,the chief executive officer of the qualifying institution must provide the commission with annual pre and affidavits detailing the intended and actual use of the sellinger funds.see.tit.the amount of the grant is determined in part by the number of equivalent students enrolled at the institution.ann.educ.a.students enrolled in seminarian or theological programs are specifically excluded from this computation.id.b.
as of fiscal year,fifteen institutions received sellinger funds.twelve had no religious affiliation and three were affiliated with the roman catholic church.the supreme court held in roemer board of public works of maryland,d,that the maryland colleges affiliated with the roman catholic church were entitled to government funds because despite the religious association of the institutions,the colleges were not so pervasively sectarian that secular activities could not be separated from sectarian ones.at.plurality opinion.
in,columbia union applied for funds under the sellinger program.it asked the commission for the same treatment as the institutions.the college satisfied each of the statutory requirements for participation in the program.two years later,however,the commission denied columbia union application.it stated that since the college was a pervasively sectarian institution,the establishment clause of the first amendment required that the application be rejected.
in late,columbia union requested reconsideration of its application in view of supreme court decisions like rosenberger rector and visitors of the university of virginia,d,which emphasized the importance of neutral criteria in determining eligibility for aid.soon thereafter,the commission notified the college that unless the nature and practices of columbia union have changed very substantially since,the application would continue to be rejected.columbia union officially reapplied for sellinger program funds in november.the institution requested for programs in mathematics,computer science,clinical laboratory science,respiratory care,and nursing.the commission subsequently denied this application because it ruled that the college was still pervasively sectarian.
after the commission denied columbia union application,the college filed a complaint against the director of the commission in his official capacity seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for alleged constitutional and statutory violations.the district court,on for summary judgment,initially ruled for the commission.see columbia union college clarke.it held that the establishment clause prohibits any state from directly funding a pervasively sectarian institution and that columbia union was a pervasively sectarian institution.
on appeal,this court reversed and remanded the case for trial on the issue of whether columbia union is a pervasively sectarian institution.see columbia union college clarke,cir,cert.denied,d columbia union i.preliminarily,the court ruled that the commission denial of funds to the college infringed on columbia union free speech rights because the commission rejected the application solely because of the college alleged pervasively partisan religious viewpoint.id.at.such an infringement on columbia union free speech rights would be justified only as a means of complying with the dictates of the establishment clause.id.at.
in deciding whether the funding of these secular programs would violate the establishment clause,this court relied on the analysis set forth in roemer that the constitution permits direct state money grants to the general secular educational programs of religious colleges only if those colleges are not pervasively sectarian.id.at.
it rejected columbia union argument that subsequent supreme court cases like agostini felton,d,zobrest catalina foothills school district,d,and witters washington department of services for the blind,d,had overruled roemer holding by permitting the government to fund pervasively sectarian institutions so long as the state used neutral criteria to allocate aid.instead,the court held that roemer remains good law,and we,absent a clear directive from the supreme court,are duty bound to enforce it.columbia union i,at.
nevertheless,the court remanded the case to the district court because the record was not fully developed on the issue of columbia union pervasively sectarian status.it noted,however,that a careful reading of roemer leads to the inescapable conclusion that even colleges obviously and firmly devoted to the ideals and teachings of a given religion are not necessarily so permeated by religion that the secular side can not be separated from the sectarian.id.at quoting roemer,at.
chief judge wilkinson dissented from the remand,believing that the record was sufficiently developed to uphold the judgment without ordering an intrusive investigation into the minutiae of the college operations.the dissent stated that although the neutrality principle that courses through the supreme court recent decisions certainly would not forbid maryland from funding columbia union under the sellinger program,the pervasively sectarian doctrine is hanging on,if only by its fingernails.id.at wilkinson,dissenting.
on remand,the district court supervised an extensive discovery process and conducted a lengthy bench trial.after hearing the evidence,reviewing the exhibits,considering the material submitted by the parties,and hearing the arguments of opposing counsel,the court ruled that columbia union was not a pervasively sectarian institution.the state of maryland appeals the district court new determination that columbia union is not pervasively sectarian.the college urges affirmance of the district court judgment on two grounds.first,it argues that the supreme court recent decision in mitchell helms,d,makes clear that the pervasively sectarian inquiry is no longer relevant to determine whether a particular aid program violates the establishment clause.second,columbia union argues in the alternative that the district court correctly found that the college was not pervasively sectarian.we address each of columbia union arguments in turn.
the question of whether pervasively sectarian analysis is still relevant for determining the constitutionality of aid programs turns largely on a recent supreme court opinion interpreting the establishment helms,at.we acknowledged in columbia union i that the pervasively sectarian test had not been overruled by supreme court cases such as agostini felton,at,and rosenberger,at.see columbia union i,at id.at wilkinson,dissenting.since columbia union i,however,the mitchell case has significantly altered the establishment clause landscape by addressing the circumstances under which sectarian schools may be eligible for government aid.
in mitchell,the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of an aid program to parochial primary and secondary schools.mitchell was a case in which the federal government distributed money to state and local governmental agencies,which in turn bought educational material and equipment on behalf of certain public and private schools.the local agencies then lent what they had purchased to the schools.see mitchell,at.plurality opinion.through the program,private schools were able to acquire such items as library books,computers,television sets,and laboratory equipment.see id.at.in the challenged school district,approximately of the funds went to private schools.of the private schools participating in the program,were religiously affiliated.
the court,applying the test outlined in agostini felton,at,held that the federal aid program was constitutional under the establishment clause because the federal program had a secular purpose and because the program did not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.see mitchell,at.plurality opinion applying agostini test id.at,concurring in the judgment same.while six justices agreed with this result,the case did not produce a majority opinion.rather,four justices signed on to the lead opinion in the case.see mitchell,at.plurality opinion.justice,joined by justice breyer,wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment on narrower grounds.see mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment.
because the secular purpose of the program was uncontested,the court focused on whether the aid had the effect of advancing religion.the plurality opinion in mitchell emphasized that the neutrality of aid criteria is the most important factor in considering the effect of a government aid program.indeed,the plurality opinion noted that the court has consistently turned to the principle of neutrality,upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.id.at.plurality opinion.in other words,the plurality opinion would sustain the constitutionality of an aid program so long as the religious,irreligious,and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid.id.the court stated unequivocally that if the government,seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose,offers aid on the same terms,without regard to religion,to all who adequately further that purpose,then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.id.at.internal citation omitted.
the mitchell plurality also made clear that governmental aid can even be divertible to religious use if the criteria used to dispense the aid are neutral and the purpose of the aid is secular.id.at.plurality opinion.thus,for the plurality,the relevant constitutional inquiry was how the aid is assigned,not where the aid goes.indeed,the plurality opinion explicitly noted the irrelevance of a pervasively sectarian inquiry.while acknowledging that there was a period when this factor mattered,particularly if the pervasively sectarian school was a primary or secondary school,that period is one that the court should regret,and it is thankfully long past.id.at.
the plurality cited a variety of reasons to formally dispense with the pervasively sectarian test.id.first,the relevance of the pervasively sectarian analysis in our precedents is in sharp decline.id.the plurality noted that not a single aid program had been struck down under the pervasively sectarian inquiry since,when the court decided aguilar felton,d,and school district of the city of grand rapids ball,d.the plurality pointed out that aguilar had since been overruled in full by agostini felton,at,and ball had been overruled in part by agostini.indeed,the plurality observed that in zobrest catalina foothills school district,at,and in agostini,the court upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.id.at.plurality opinion.
the second reason to abandon the pervasively sectarian test,according to the mitchell plurality,was that the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis,so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government secular purpose.id.third,the plurality remarked that the pervasively sectarian inquiry is offensive because courts should not be trolling though a person or institution religious beliefs.id.at.fourth,the pervasively sectarian analysis conflicts with supreme court decisions which prohibit the government from discriminating in the distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or sincerity.id.finally,the plurality stated that hostility to pervasively sectarian schools has a shameful pedigree that we do not hesitate to disavow.id.the plurality concluded that nothing in the establishment clause requires the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid programs,and other doctrines of this court bar it.this doctrine,born of bigotry,should be buried now.id.at.
justice,joined by justice breyer,concurred in the judgment.although justice agreed with the plurality opinion on many issues,two specific aspects of the opinion compel led her to write separately.id.at,j,concurring in the judgment.first,although she recognized that neutrality is an important reason for upholding programs against establishment clause challenges,she would not make neutrality,and neutrality alone,the one factor of singular importance in the future adjudication of establishment clause challenges to government programs.id.at.justice noted that the court has never held that a program passes constitutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid.id.at.instead,justices and breyer would hold that neutrality is important,but it is by no means the only axiom in the history and precedent of the establishment clause.id.quoting rosenberger,at,concurring see also good news club milford central school,d w e have held that a significant factor in upholding governmental programs in the face of establishment clause attack is their neutrality towards religion.internal quotations omitted.
second,justice criticized the plurality for approving the actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination.id.at.she wrote that the court has long been concerned that secular government aid not be diverted to the advancement of religion.id.at.actual diversion concerned justice because if religious indoctrination is supported by government assistance,the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion.id.at.justice concerns with governmental aid to religious schools would be lessened so long as these schools did not actually use the aid for religious purposes.see id.
justices and breyer agreed with the plurality opinion,however,that the federal aid program in mitchell passed constitutional muster.applying the agostini test,the opinion found that the government did not act with the purpose of advancing religion and that the aid did not have the effect of advancing religion.see id.at.
moreover,the concurring opinion joined the plurality opinion in expressly overruling meek pittenger,d,and wolman walter,d.see mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment.in both meek and wolman,the court struck down aid programs similar to the aid program in mitchell.the meek and wolman courts ruled as they did because the religious schools receiving the materials and equipment were pervasively sectarian.mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment citing meek,at,and wolman,at.justice opinion did not take issue with the plurality holding that the pervasively sectarian doctrine should be buried now.id.at.plurality opinion.instead,she specifically criticized the meek and wolman courts for apply ing an irrebuttable presumption that secular instructional materials and equipment would be diverted to use for religious indoctrination.id.at.instead of focusing on this irrebuttable presumption that even the secular courses in a religious school are inescapably religious,wolman,at,justice would require plaintiffs to prove that the aid in question actually is,or has been,used for religious purposes.mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment.by focusing on actual diversion of aid instead of the presumption that any secular class at a religious school would inevitably inculcate religion,justice acknowledged her agreement with the plurality that the pervasively sectarian doctrine was becoming ever more problematic for establishment clause purposes.id.at,concurring in the judgment.
thus,although justice and justice breyer would not go as far as the plurality,their separate opinion establishes three fundamental guideposts for establishment clause cases.first,the neutrality of aid criteria is an important factor,even if it is not the only factor,in assessing a public assistance program.second,the actual diversion of government aid to religious purposes is prohibited.third,and relatedly,presumptions of religious indoctrination inherent in the pervasively sectarian analysis are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral programs under the establishment clause.id.at.the concurring opinion,which is the controlling opinion from mitchell replaced the pervasively sectarian test with a principle of neutrality plus.neutrality is a necessary and important consideration in judging establishment clause cases,but it may not be sufficient in and of itself.instead,courts must examine whether actual diversion of aid occurs and whether the particular facts of each case reveal that the establishment clause has been violated.id.at.internal quotations omitted.it is to this inquiry that we now turn.
columbia union argues that it is entitled under mitchell to sellinger program funds without resort to examining the college pervasively sectarian status.we agree.
first,neither party disputes that the sellinger program has a secular purpose.see mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment stating that it is important to ask whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion internal quotations omitted.the sellinger program is designed to provide aid to private colleges in maryland,regardless of affiliation.as the supreme court held in roemer,the purpose of maryland aid program is the secular one of supporting private higher education generally,as an economic alternative to a wholly public system.roemer,at.plurality opinion.of the fifteen schools currently receiving sellinger program funds,only three are affiliated with a religious institution.in short,the sellinger program is in no sense a vehicle for the advancement of religious purposes.
second,the aid also does not have the effect of advancing religion.see mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment.in order to determine effect,we must first examine the neutrality of the criteria used to assign the aid.see id.at.the sellinger program is indisputably premised upon neutral criteria.several additional factors serve to reinforce the program constitutionality.these factors,namely the prohibition against using any sellinger money for religious purposes,the safeguards in place to prevent such aid from being used for sectarian purposes,and the fact that the assistance is being afforded to higher education,convince us that the state may give aid to columbia union under the sellinger program.
the neutral features of the sellinger program are six in number,and columbia union meets each one.first,the institution is a private college or university that was established in maryland before july.ann.educ.second,columbia union is approved by the maryland higher education commission.id.third,the college is a ccredited by the commission on higher education of the middle states association of colleges and schools.id.fourth,columbia union has awarded the associate of arts or baccalaureate degrees to at least one graduating class.id.fifth,the college m aintain s one or more earned degree programs,other than seminarian or theological programs,leading to an associate of arts or baccalaureate degree.id.and sixth,the institution has submitted each new program and each major modification of an existing program to the maryland higher education commission for its review and recommendation as to the initiation of the new or modified program.id.the fact that columbia union meets every requirement of the statute,and the fact that fifteen other institutions have also satisfied these same requirements,show beyond cavil that the sellinger program assigns funds in a neutral and manner,without regard to religion.mitchell,at.plurality opinion.
under the plurality opinion,the sellinger program secular purpose and its neutral criteria would practically dispose of this case.see id.at.and under the analysis of justice and justice breyer,the neutrality of the sellinger program remains a critical factor in considering its constitutionality.see id.at,concurring in the judgment w e have emphasized a program neutrality repeatedly in our decisions approving various forms of school aid.citing cases.additional considerations,however,underscore the constitutionality of sellinger assistance to the college.
a second consideration is one precisely identified by justice lack of any evidence of actual diversion of government aid to religious purposes.see id.at,concurring in the judgment.it is not of consequence that a sectarian school offers secular courses like computer science because the presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral programs under the establishment clause.id.at.instead,plaintiffs must show evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.id.emphasis added.
here,the state can not make a showing of actual diversion.the only evidence it produced related to the pervasively sectarian status of the school,not to the use of aid in an improper fashion.and it is impossible for maryland to make the requisite showing of actual diversion in this case for one simple reason columbia union has yet to receive any money under the sellinger program.consequently,the state can not show that this money has resulted in religious indoctrination.id.at.
in addition to the absence of evidence of actual diversion,there are safeguards against future diversion of sellinger program funds for sectarian purposes.the statute requires that a qualifying institution may not use sellinger program funds for sectarian purposes.ann.educ.columbia union satisfies this prerequisite as well.the president of columbia union signed a sworn affidavit stating that the funds would not be used for sectarian purposes.moreover,the program assigns the amount of aid based on the number of equivalent students enrolled at the institution,excluding students enrolled in seminarian or theological programs.id.indeed,the requirements that funds not be used for sectarian purposes and that students enrolled in sectarian programs be excluded from the total number of students signify that,if anything,sectarian college
