janet reinhardt appeals from the grant of summary judgment on both her rehabilitation act and first amendment retaliation claims.on appeal,reinhardt makes three major claims which,she argues,require reversal of the district court orders.reinhardt contends that the district court incorrectly ruled that her protected a state level made pursuant to her official job duties rather than as a private citizen the district court erred in finding that she had not shown a materially adverse employment action and the district court erred in concluding that defendant met its burden in coming forth with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its action or that reinhardt had not met her burden in establishing a genuine issue as to pretext.our jurisdiction arises under,and we reverse.
background 
reinhardt has been employed as a pathologist slp by albuquerque public schools board of education aps since.during the time relevant to this action,she worked at rio grande high school.slps with a caseload receive a contract standard contract.aps grants a contract increase if an slp caseload supports such an increase extended contract.
starting in,reinhardt regularly complained to aps administrators that she was not receiving accurate and timely caseload lists of students,letter.she believed the inaccurate lists were leading to qualified special education students not receiving speech and language services.inaccurate lists also had the potential to affect slps contract status and salaries.as she was unable to get aps to respond to her repeated complaints about the inaccurate caseload lists and corresponding deprivation of services to qualified students,reinhardt consulted an attorney and filed an individuals with disabilities education act idea complaint with the new mexico public education department nmped against aps on october,state complaint.the state conducted an investigation and ordered aps to take corrective action.
in addition to complaining about aps failure to deliver services to special education students at rio grande high and filing the state complaint,reinhardt also advocated for the rights of a particular high school student john doe.during the school year,reinhardt began advocating for him to receive a neuropsychological evaluation.he did not receive the evaluation until summer of.after the evaluation,she advocated for him to receive specialized reading instruction during the school year.
before the school year,reinhardt previously had received extended contracts.on august,reinhardt was again granted an extended contract for the upcoming school year based on the belief that she would be serving more than a full caseload.on august,the assistant principal at rio grande high assigned reinhardt to work with only grade students for the school year.the remainder of the students were divided between the other two slps at rio grande high.reinhardt initial caseload list comprised only six students,well below a caseload.reinhardt believed that to grade students should have been receiving services.on september,aps reduced her to a standard contract because her caseload did not support an extended contract.reinhardt requested a contract increase based on her caseload on january,and was denied.
in june,reinhardt brought suit against aps for,inter alia,first amendment retaliation pursuant to and for retaliation in violation of of the rehabilitation act,based on her advocacy for the rights of disabled students.the district court granted aps motion for summary judgment on reinhardt retaliation claim.the court concluded that she had not met her burden in establishing a prima facie case of retaliation because she failed to show that aps subjected her to any materially adverse action.the court further found that even if reinhardt had established a prima facie case,aps provided legitimate,reasons for the actions at issue,and reinhardt failed to demonstrate that aps reasons were pretextual.the district court also granted aps summary judgment on reinhardt first amendment retaliation claim.applying garcetti ceballos,the court held that plaintiff communications were made pursuant to her official duties and were therefore not protected by the first amendment.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.see jarvis potter,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.unsupported conclusory allegations do not create a genuine issue of fact.l m,bei sensors,f d,cir.with respect to the claim,we review the establishment of a prima facie case of retaliation de novo.in first amendment cases,we have an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.deschenie bd.of educ.of cent.consol.sch.dist,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
section retaliation claim 
the standard for retaliation claims under the rehabilitation act is the same as the standard for retaliation claims under the americans with disabilities act ada.jarvis,at.in the absence of direct evidence,reinhardt may rely upon the framework of mcdonnell douglas green.she can establish a prima facie case by showing that she engaged in protected activity that she suffered a materially adverse action by aps either after or contemporaneous with her protected activity and a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.proctor ups,cir applying burlington santa fe ry.white,in the context of ada retaliation claims jarvis,at.thereafter,aps may produce evidence of a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for the adverse action.jarvis,at internal citation omitted.if aps does so,the burden of production shifts back to reinhardt to show that the proffered reason is pretextual.id.
protected activity 
at the summary judgment stage,reinhardt presented three types of protected activity her advocacy for john doe her longstanding complaints about aps failure to deliver services to special education students at rio grande high by failing to provide slps with timely and accurate caseload lists and filing the state complaint.aps did not dispute that reinhardt engaged in protected activity when she advocated for john doe beginning in,but aps argued that plaintiff internal complaints about inaccurate caseload lists and her state complaint relate to her first amendment retaliation claim and not her claim.the district court recognized the factual dispute between the parties regarding the time frame of the protected activity,but it did not resolve the issue,nor did it address which activities were protected.aps does not further address the issue of reinhardt protected activities in its brief.
all three forms of reinhardt advocacy on behalf of disabled students constitute protected activity under the rehabilitation act.section and the ada prohibit discrimination against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this act or because such individual made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this act.a incorporated by reference by d.the school is required to provide a free appropriate public education by providing education and related services that are designed meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons.a b sweet sch,app x,cir holding that a public school psychologist complaints regarding potential idea violations were protected from retaliation under see also barker riverside county office of,cir holding that a teacher has standing to sue the county office of education for retaliation under where she alleged that she was constructively discharged after advocating for the rights of disabled students.the third circuit has noted that protected activity must go beyond merely assisting special education students but that affirmative action in advocating for,or protesting discrimination related to,unlawful conduct by others falls within protected activity.montanye wissahickon sch.dist,app x,cir.we agree with the ninth and third circuits that attempting to protect the rights of special education students constitutes protected activity under the rehabilitation act.it is apparent from the undisputed facts that reinhardt engaged in protected activity for the purposes of through at least october,when she filed the state complaint.
materially adverse action 
on appeal,reinhardt limits her argument to four actions that were briefed below to establish a materially adverse action the reduction of her salary in september when aps reduced her extended contract to a standard contract aps refusal to increase her standard contract to an extended contract despite her requests through march,aps assigning her only grade students beginning in the school year and aps telling nmped in that a police report had been filed against her in.aplt.br.aplee.br.
reinhardt argues that any loss of salary is a materially adverse job action.aplt.br.aps counters that reinhardt has never explained why being assigned to serve all of the grade students was materially adverse.aplee.br.it notes that reinhardt reduction to a standard contract was not materially adverse because she was still employed under a contract with the same benefits and was not entitled to an extended contract.aplee.br.reinhardt argues that being assigned to serve only grade students,which reduced her workload,and the resulting reduction of her extended contract to a standard contract cost her the salary that she was accustomed to receiving under her usual extended contract.she also alleges that aps deliberately maintained inaccurate caseload lists that artificially reduced her workload to reduce her salary and refused to extended her contract once her caseload increased.
the supreme court has held that an adverse action for purposes of a retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act of,is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.burlington northern,at.to establish an adverse action,a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we have applied this same standard to retaliation claims under the ada,and ada standards apply to claims.see,jones,cir ada claims jarvis,at section claims.we construe the phrase adverse employment action liberally and do not limit it to monetary losses in the form of wages or benefits.annett of,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.acts that carry a significant risk of humiliation,damage to reputation,and a concomitant harm to future employment prospects may be considered adverse actions,although a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities will not suffice.id.citation omitted.
contrary to aps assertion,being assigned to serve only grade students was not merely an alteration in job responsibilities.aplee.br.the changed assignment directly led to a reduction in compensation because reinhardt no longer qualified for an extended contract.when her caseload increased,aps did not grant her an extended contract,and this also affected her salary.in fact,because reinhardt original caseload list only included six students,rio grande high assistant principal acknowledged that it would be reasonable that reinhardt would be fearful for her job.this is not to say that a denial of overtime opportunity is always a materially adverse action but under these facts,we think a reasonable employee might have been dissuaded from advocating for special education students knowing that her workload and salary would be reduced.bergeron cabral,cir denial of overtime opportunities may constitute an adverse employment action.
as for reinhardt allegation that aps falsely told nmped in that a police report had been filed against plaintiff in,such an action could be materially adverse because it could damage her reputation and harm future employment prospects.see annett,at berry stevinson chevrolet,cir false report.however,the record does not support that aps told nmped that it had filed a police report against plaintiff.reinhardt states that she has never seen the police report which was allegedly made against me in it was mentioned in two or three statements that were sent to the new mexico public education department in response to the state complaint i filed in the fall of.neither aps nmped responses that allegedly mention the police report nor the actual police report appear in the record.see.e.
causal connection 
we are persuaded that reinhardt has shown sufficient facts to establish a causal connection between her advocacy for disabled students and the adverse employment actions taken against her.causal connection may be established by producing evidence of circumstances that justify an inference of retaliatory motive,such as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action.haynes level commc ns,llc,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.reinhardt continuously complained about inaccurate caseload lists,and it is undisputed that she advocated for john doe through the school year.she was assigned to teach only grade students on august,and on september,aps reduced her to a standard contract.given the normal summer break in the school year,the adverse actions closely followed reinhardt protected activity as they occurred at the beginning of the next school term.and while the denial of her january,request for an extended contract based on her increased caseload occurred well after her advocacy for john doe,aps refusal may be part of the original pay reduction action and occurred shortly after reinhardt filed the state complaint in october.
aps legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action and reinhardt showing of pretext 
to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext,reinhardt must demonstrate that aps proffered reason is unworthy of belief.pinkerton.of,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.reinhardt can meet this standard by producing evidence of such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.if a plaintiff advances evidence upon which a factfinder could conclude that the defendant allegedly nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment decisions are pretextual,the court should deny summary judgment.
aps states that it assigned reinhardt only grade students for the school year because she had experience transitioning middle school students to high school through her work during the previous school year.aplee.br.reinhardt notes that at least one of the other two slps at rio grande high had also previously worked with grade students.there is also no explanation in the record why reinhardt could not be assigned other students in addition to the graders.being assigned to serve only grade students resulted in such a low original caseload that it would be reasonable that reinhardt would be fearful for her job.
as for reducing reinhardt pay in september,and refusing to extend her contract in january,aps argues that it was unnecessary to give her an extended contract because her schedule did not warrant one.however,reinhardt argues that aps deliberately maintained inaccurate caseload lists that artificially reduced her workload to reduce her salary.the state investigation concluded that aps was maintaining inaccurate lists,which resulted in qualified special education students not obtaining services.furthermore,there is a factual dispute as to how aps actually calculates extended contracts and whether reinhardt qualified for such a contract during.aps has stated that an slp must have students to qua
