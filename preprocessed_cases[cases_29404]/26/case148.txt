this case concerns the tragic accident that took the lives of kristine guest and joshua rau on february.kristine father,stephen guest,acting as administrator of kristine estate,sued paul smith college of arts and sciences paul smith or the college and paul smith employee toni marra collectively,defendants for their allegedly negligent conduct prior to kristine death the district court for the northern district of new york sharpe,judge granted summary judgment to defendants,finding that they had no legally cognizable duty to kristine.see guest hansen,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.guest,who was represented by counsel in the district court,appealed pro se.
this case presents a question that has not previously been resolved in our circuit whether the administrator of an estate may represent the estate pro se,where the administrator is the estate sole beneficiary.we expressly left this question open in pridgen andresen,cir.we now hold that an administrator can proceed pro se where an estate has neither creditors nor beneficiaries other than the administrator.this allows us to consider the merits of guest appeal.
as to those substantive merits,we conclude that new york tort law does not provide a cause of action in circumstances such as these.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.

the relationship between the college and the lake 
paul smith is a college located on the northern shore of lower regis lake the lake in adirondack park.the college owns over acres of property,much of it forest.the campus itself is on the edge of the lake,miles from the nearest town several of the college buildings,including some of its dormitories,are steps from the lake.although the college owns much of the land around the lake,it does not own the lake itself,which is state property.the college promotional materials cite the lake and the surrounding,forest as one of the college principal attractions.
paul smith students occasionally built bonfires and consumed alcohol on the lake once it froze over,viewing it as a place where paul smith s college had no jurisdiction.pl.app.college safety officers sometimes intervened on the lake,breaking up parties and stopping dangerous behavior.on some occasions,they called the state police on others,they did not.
events on campus the weekend of february,
on friday night and early saturday morning,february,paul smith students held a bonfire party on the lake,which was visible and audible from campus.defendant toni marra,paul smith director of residence life,and campus safety officer jamie shova observed a large fire,yelling and screaming,and contacted the state police.pl.app.a little later,shova saw a truck doing donuts driving quickly in a tight circle on the ice of the lake.by the time the state police arrived,the party had dispersed a trooper told campus security to call the state police immediately if they observed any unsafe or illegal behavior.pl.app.shova later saw the same truck and confronted the driver,who acknowledged having drunk eight to ten beers.although marra confiscated the driver keys,she instructed shova not to call the state police.
the following night,the night of february,students again threw a party centered around a bonfire on the lake,located about to yards from the shore and in view of the main campus and of various dormitories.the fire was built with wood that students brought from the college forestry cabin.because of the cold temperature,students would frequently return to the dormitories to warm up,before heading back onto the lake.the party was apparently a raucous affair,with beer freely available to the crowd of students,both of legal drinking age and below.by one estimate,the party at its peak had between eighty and one hundred students present,and there were as many as twenty snowmobiles driving around the lake.
shortly before midnight,a snowmobile carrying two students crashed into a tree the students were unharmed.a little while later,campus safety received a report of the snowmobile crash.although they were informed that there were no injuries,marra and shova went to the lake around shova believed that the party was getting out of control,but marra instructed him not to attempt to shut it down or take any disciplinary actions as it would cause a riot.pl.app.instead,the two stayed at the party for about fifteen minutes,then advised the students to be safe,keep the speed down,and call campus safety if there was sic any problems.pl.app.

kristine was,at the time of her death,a student at quinnipiac university in hamden,connecticut.on february,kristine and three friends drove to paul smith to visit rau,a paul smith student,to celebrate his twentieth birthday.the group went to the town of saranac lake for dinner,then returned to rau dorm room at or,where they began playing a drinking game.around,the group went out to the lake,which was about fifteen steps from rau dormitory.the bonfire party had already been going on for four or five hours at that point.kristine and rau went back and forth from rau dorm room to the bonfire party repeatedly over the next several hours.like many other students,the group kristine and rau were with brought alcohol with them on their trips from campus to the lake and back.
kristine and her friends returned to rau dorm room around.they had,by then,apparently stopped drinking alcohol.around,they headed back out to the lake,hoping,in due course,to watch the sunrise.a heavy fog that had lain over the lake much of the night had begun to lift,and rau friend christopher hansen agreed to let rau drive his snowmobile around the lake.there were approximately four other snowmobiles still riding around the lake.rau gave rides to kristine two friends,without incident.but then rau drove out further onto the lake with kristine.neither was wearing helmets.the two crashed into a promontory at a peninsula called peter rock,a piece of land owned by the college.the snowmobile and its passengers left the ground,crashing into trees and a on peter rock.kristine and rau were killed.
procedural background 
proceedings in the district court 
stephen guest,kristine father,was appointed administrator of her estate after her death.represented by counsel,he filed suit against marra and the college,alleging that they acted negligently by,among other things,failing to intervene in the bonfire party and insufficiently enforcing the college policy against underage drinking.
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing principally that they did not have any duty to supervise or control kristine activities,and that they are entitled to immunity from liability for snowmobiling injuries such as these,pursuant to new york general obligations law 
on december,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in its entirety.principally,the district court found that defendants owed kristine no duty of care.first,it noted that new york courts had rejected the doctrine of in loco parentis,and hence colleges had no general duty to supervise or control their students conduct so as to prevent them from harming others,even where as a practical matter defendant can exercise such control.guest,wl,at,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting christie.nor did marra or the college assume a duty when marra went out to the lake,because her doing so did not place kristine in a more vulnerable position than she otherwise would have been in.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the court next considered new york law of premises liability,noting that landowners have a duty to control intoxicated guests only on their own property,and are not generally liable for their actions once they leave the landowner property.the fact that rau and kristine did return to college property at the moment of their deaths,when they crashed at peter rock,was immaterial,the court found plaintiff did not allege that peter rock was i
