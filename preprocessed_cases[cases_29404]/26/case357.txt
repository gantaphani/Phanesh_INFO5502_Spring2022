michael adams appeals from the judgment of the district court for the eastern district of north carolina awarding summary judgment to the sixteen defendants collectively defendants,each of whom is affiliated with adams employer,the university of north carolina wilmington uncw or the university adams brought three claims against the defendants alleging religious and discrimination,as well as retaliation,in relation to the decision not to promote him to the position of full professor at uncw.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims,concluding they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,and reverse and remand in part the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
in,uncw,a public university of the state of north carolina,hired adams as an assistant professor of criminology in the department of sociology and criminal justice the department.over the next five years adams earned strong teaching evaluations from both peers and students.during this period,he received two faculty awards,published several articles,and was involved in numerous activities at uncw and in the larger community.in,adams was promoted to the tenured position of associate professor.
in,adams became a christian,a conversion that transformed not only his religious beliefs,but also his ideological views.after his conversion,adams became increasingly vocal about various political and social issues that arose within both the uncw community and society at large.he became a regular columnist for and appeared on radio and televisions broadcasts as a commentator.in,he published a book entitled welcome to the ivory tower of babel confessions of a conservative college professor,a collection of columns and new material.throughout this time,adams continued to receive strong teaching reviews from students and faculty.
as adams cultivated his conservative standing beyond the uncw campus,some tension evolved within the uncw community.some uncw employees indicated discomfort with adams views and his manner of expressing them.from time to time,uncw officials fielded complaints from members of the board of trustees,the faculty and staff,and the general public about adams public expressions of his views.correspondence about the complaints indicates that while uncw officials,some of whom are named defendants,occasionally expressed personal disagreement with the content of adams columns,they uniformly recognized that the first amendment and principles of academic freedom protected adams writings and other expressions of his views.at one point,defendant levy,then interim chair of the department,suggested that adams alter the tone of his speech to be less caustic and more cerebral like william buckley in order to make things a whole lot more pleasant around the office.
in,adams applied for promotion to the position of full professor.at uncw,the promotion process is,meaning that adams could apply at any time and there was not an advertised opening for the position.the uncw faculty handbook the handbook described the criteria for a promotion.applicants are evaluated in four areas teaching,research or artistic achievement,service,and scholarship and professional development and an applicant record should demonstrate evidence of steady growth and maturation.moreover,excellence in teaching and in artistic achievement or research rank highest among the criteria for tenure and promotion decisions.j.the handbook specifically notes that meeting any quantifiable measures provided does not guarantee the award of tenure or promotion.rather,the applicant must provide persuasive documentation that qualitative criteria as well as any quantifiable accomplishments have been met.
the handbook also contains specific explanations of the requirements for promotion to full professor.for the teaching component,excellence is expected and will be reflected in teaching performance and content and in teaching activities outside the classroom,as well as in the sharing of teaching skills.with respect to research accomplishment,faculty are expected to demonstrate a tangible record of substantial contributions to one discipline including more tangible evidence of accomplishment than that of the associate professor rank,although the difference in artistic and research expectations for a full professor is not solely quantitative.greater quality,maturity,significance and originality are expected at this rank.for the service component,the criterion is as generally described above,except that candidates must show evidence of leadership in various service areas.scholarship and professional development are continuing expectations of every faculty member,and are demonstrated primarily in growth and improvement in teaching,research accomplishments,and service contributions.
adams application included standard information regarding his education and professional history,as well as his academic status at uncw,including courses taught,information about advisees,committees,and boards he had served on at uncw,the results of recent peer evaluations,and honors and awards he had earned during his time at uncw.adams also listed ten authored or r efereed publications including juried or writings that had been published since,and one additional article of this type that had been accepted for publication.
relevant to the issues in this case,adams application also cited some of the external writings and appearances he had made since his conversion experience in.adams also listed publications as part of his research and scholarship,including his book welcome to the ivory tower of babel and another book he had that was under consideration for publication,indoctri nation how universities are destroying america under the service heading,in the optional subcategories subheading,adams included the following 
please note that my informal advising to student organizations,especially christian groups,is also a prominent part of my service activities 
also note that i use my national column published on and sometimes in human events to help christian groups fight discrimination.one prominent example is a florida college that tried to ban a christian group from showing the passion of the christ.my column revealed that the school had falsely claimed to have a ban on showing r rated movies.when i discovered they had showed secular r rated movies in the past,the school reversed its position.i routinely expose such cases of bigotry on our campuses.
and under the other subheading for service,adams referred to being an activist in the campus free speech movement,which has generated a good deal of publicity for uncw,and he included a positive quote about himself from nationally syndicated talk show host neal boortz.as part of his community service,adams listed numerous speeches on academic freedom as well as conservative issues,which he had given to conservative organizations and at universities,as well as radio and television interviews.we will refer collectively to the foregoing materials listed in his application,which were not primarily devoted to purely academic subjects in his field,as adams speech.it is this speech which is a primary focus of adams claims.
under standard uncw procedure,cook,the department chair,after consultation with senior department faculty,was responsible for determining whether to recommend adams for promotion to full professor.if she did not recommend him,the application process ended.if she did recommend him,then the process would continue to the next level of consideration.
upon receiving adams application,cook forwarded it to the senior department faculty,asking for their initial impressions prior to a meeting at which they would discuss the application more formally.cook then compiled the individual comments into a document summarizing the major themes raised in the initial senior faculty review with the goal of creating a document for discussion in the meeting of senior faculty.participants in the meeting that followed,some of whom voted in favor of adams promotion and some of whom did not,uniformly described the process as professional and lacking rancor or hostility toward either the content of adams speech or his political or religious beliefs.to the extent that adams columns and book were discussed,the conversation centered on how to evaluate the materials for scholarliness because they were not or traditional academic writing related to his academic discipline.in the end,the senior faculty voted to oppose adams promotion.cook undertook her own review,but in part because she looks for overwhelming support from the senior faculty,which she found lacking,she agreed with their decision,and did not recommend adams for promotion to full professor.
following this decision,adams asked cook for a written explanation.her draft response noted that adams had an adequate record though there were concerns as to each criteria for promotion,and that the area of research was inadequate to merit promotion to professor at this time because adams scholarly productivity was too thin.cook subsequently edited this explanation.in the correspondence she eventually sent to adams,cook explained that the decision was based exclusively on the promotion application and supplementary materials you submitted and cook consultation with the senior faculty in accordance with existing uncw policies and procedures.j.she indicated an overwhelming consensus of the senior faculty did not support the promotion and found the lack of support from the senior faculty provided compelling evidence that adams record did not merit promotion to professor at this time.
when asked about certain differences between her initial draft and the final explanation,cook explained that while adams teaching and service were adequate,that did not mean that they were sufficient to equal the significant standards required for promotion and that what she meant was that while there were concerns in all three criteria,the areas of concern in adams teaching or service record would not have kept him from promotion had his research record been stronger.when adams requested an additional explanation,cook expressed reservations that distilling the reasons for denial into one sentence as you requested earlier runs the risk of being incomplete.she reiterated the criteria for the rank of professor and concluded 
the overriding concern regarding your record to date is in the area of scholarly research productivity.the scholarly criterion for promotion to professor requires that a tangible record of research is accomplished to merit promotion.since your last promotion in to tenured associate professor,your scholarly productivity in venues does not demonstrate a cumulative tangible pattern of academic expertise in sociology,criminology criminal justice to merit promotion to professor at this time.the teaching criterion for promotion to professor requires one to have documented distinguished accomplishment in that professional arena.while your teaching record is the strongest aspect of your application for promotion thus far,it does not satisfy this standard.the service criterion requires a significant record of service your service record to the university and to the academic disciplines is judged to be insufficient for promotion.
additional facts relevant to each argument on appeal are discussed in context below as we review the district court holding as to each claim.
after receiving a letter from the eeoc,adams filed his complaint in the district court asserting claims under for first amendment retaliation and viewpoint discrimination,denial of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment,and religious discrimination under title vii the complaint named the defendants in their individual and official capacities.
the defendants first moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion as to monetary claims against the defendants in their official capacities and as to adams title vii claims for religious discrimination against the defendants in their individual capacities

iii.overview 
adams complaint alleged,in essence,three causes of action religious discrimination,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et title vii viewpoint discrimination and retaliation for protected expression,in violation of the first amendment,pursuant to and denial of equal protection,in violation of and the fourteenth amendment.on appeal,adams argues the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on each of these claims was erroneous either because material facts were in dispute or the district court made substantive errors of law in analyzing the claims.
before undertaking our analysis,it is important to underscore the context in which we consider adams claims.following the supreme court directive,courts have been reluctant 
to trench on the prerogatives of state and local educational institutions because of the courts responsibility to safeguard their academic freedom,a special concern of the first amendment.if a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies,far less is it suited to evaluate the substance of the multitude of academic decisions that are made daily by faculty members of public educational institutions decisions that require an expert evaluation of cumulative information and are not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.

for this reason 
u niversity employment cases have always created a decisional dilemma for the courts.unsure how to evaluate the requirements for appointment,reappointment and tenure,and reluctant to interfere with the subjective and scholarly judgments which are involved,the courts have refused to impose their judgment as to whether the aggrieved academician should have been awarded the desired appointment or promotion.rather,the courts review has been narrowly directed as to whether the appointment or promotion was denied because of a discriminatory reason.
smith of north carolina,cir internal citations omitted.it is with this understanding of the limited review courts may undertake in cases involving employment decisions of academic institutions that we consider adams claims.
iv.title vii claim 
adams asserted the defendants violated title vii protection against religious discrimination by subjecting him to numerous,intrusive,and harassing investigations,asking him to terminate his first amendment activities,and refusing to promote him to full professor because of his outspoken christian and conservative beliefs.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants based on its conclusion that adams had not brought forth direct or indirect evidence of religious discrimination.viewing adams arguments as surmises and conjecture,the court held adams failed to produce any record evidence that reflected a discriminatory attitude which bore directly on the contested employment decision,as required under rhoads,cir.furthermore,the district court found adams failed to establish a material factual dispute under the analysis set forth in mcdonnell douglas green.
adams contends on appeal that he produced direct and indirect evidence of religious discrimination that created a triable issue of fact as to the reason for denying him promotion to full professor.adams points to his religious and conservative views and the senior faculty comments about his publications as direct evidence that he was denied a promotion based on those views.as indirect evidence of discrimination,adams asserts he was the only professor with his credentials to be denied a promotion to full professor in the past years.in addition,he cites idiosyncrasies and misrepresentations during the promotion decision process as evidence of pretext.
title vii makes it an unlawful practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual because of such individual religion.a.to prove his claim,adams had to demonstrate that the defendants treated him differently than other employees because of his religious beliefs.chalmers tulon,cir emphasis omitted.adams satisfies this burden at the summary judgment stage if he establishes that his job performance was satisfactory and provides direct or indirect evidence whose cumulative probative force supports a reasonable inference that the employment decision was discriminatory.id.quoting lawrence mars,cir see also hill,at.
having reviewed the record in the light most favorable to adams,we agree with the district court that he failed to set forth direct evidence of religious discrimination.to do so,adams was required to show that religion was a motivating factor in the decision not to promote him.hill,at quotation omitted.adams did not make such a showing on this record,and his arguments demand pure speculation.there is simply no direct evidence that the defendants treated adams differently based on his religious beliefs.
we also conclude the district court properly held that adams failed to satisfy his burden for proving discrimination using the analysis of mcdonnell douglas.to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination,adams had to show that he belongs to a protected class he suffered an adverse employment action at the time of the adverse action,he was performing his job at a level that met his employer legitimate expectations and was qualified for the promotion and he was rejected under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.taylor.union,cir,abrogated on other grounds as recognized by hill,at.if a prima facie case is presented,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.hill,at.if the employer meets that burden of production,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer stated reasons were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the district court found,and the defendants do not contest,that adams met the first two mcdonnell douglas prongs.the district court assumed without deciding that adams also satisfied the third prong and was qualified for promotion to full professor.although the defendants do contest this point,we will also assume adams was qualified for promotion because the last mcdonnell douglas prong is dispositive of adams claim.
the district court did not err in concluding adams failed to satisfy the fourth prong of establishing his prima facie case that he was denied a promotion under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.adams contends such an inference arises from the fact that he is the only christian conservative in his department and the only professor in the past years to be denied the rank of full professor at the department level with teaching awards and ten or more refereed publications on his application.appellant opening br.as the district court observed,this argument fails in several respects.although adams contends he is the only conservative christian,his title vii claim rests on evidence of religious discrimination rather than political or social ideology and adams forecasts no evidence that he is the d epartment only christian.furthermore,adams comparison of his qualifications to those of others in the department can not,by itself,meet his burden.there must be some additional tie to a religious motive for the decision not to promote him and adams failed to make that showing.although some of his writings contained religious content and were considered during the decisionmaking process,that fact,in and of itself,does not give rise to an inference of discrimination.adams conjecture links the two,but nothing more substantial does.
but even if we assume that adams had established a prima facie case,the defendants satisfied their burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.hill,at.the defendants offered numerous legitimate reasons for the decision not to promote adams,including the small number of single author publications since adams last promotion.
consequently,even if the burden then shifted back to adams to show pretext,we hold that he has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the defendants explanation is purely pretextual.a plaintiff alleging a failure to promote can prove pretext by showing that he was better qualified,or by amassing circumstantial evidence that otherwise undermines the credibility of the employer stated reasons.heiko colombo sav.bank,cir.due to the nature of adams promotion,he was not competing against someone else who got the position,he can not show he was more qualified than another applicant who was promoted.adams posits instead that he was as qualified as other individuals who had previously been promoted to full professor.adams attempt to compare qualifications ignores the inevitable element of subjectivity involved in promotion decisions in the university setting.see smith,at.subjectivity in such promotion decisions is permitted so long as it lacks discriminatory intent.id.at quoting powell syracuse,cir t he law does not require,in the first instance,that employment be rational,wise,or only that it be nondiscriminatory.purely numerical comparisons are thus insufficient to demonstrate pretext in this context.id.at s ince professors are individuals and perform different roles within a department,it is difficult to compare the reasons for promoting one faculty member with the reasons for promoting or not promoting another.
importantly,in demonstrating the defendants decision was pretext,adams had to prove both that the reason was false,and that discrimination was the real reason.jiminez mary washington,cir quotation omitted.adams can not rely on his own assertions of discrimination,which in and of themselves are insufficient to counter substantial evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for an adverse employment action.williams cerberonics,cir.in light of adams burden of proof,we find no error in the district court determination that the record lacked evidence to support adams allegations of religious discrimination.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on adams title vii claim.
first amendment claims 
adams separately argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on his first amendment retaliation and viewpoint discrimination claims.to begin our examination of this argument,we review principles that guide our analysis.
the first amendment protects not only the affirmative right to speak,but also the right to be free from retaliation by a public official for the exercise of that right.suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir.while government employees do not lose their constitutional rights at work,the supreme court has repeatedly held that the government may impose certain restraints on its employees speech and take action against them that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public.see city of san diego roe,pickering bd.of,t he state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.see also urofsky,at t he state,as an employer,undoubtedly possesses greater authority to restrict the speech of its employees than it has as sovereign to restrict the speech of the citizenry as a whole.
in pickering board of education,and connick myers,the supreme court analyzed the competing interests at play between the public employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the government,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.connick,at quoting pickering,at.in mcvey stacy,cir,we explained that pickering and connick balance those competing interests in the context of a claim for retaliation by requiring the court to determine 
whether the public employee was speaking as a citizen upon a matter of public concern or as an employee about a matter of personal interest whether the employee interest in speaking upon the matter of public concern outweighed the government interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public and whether the employee speech was a substantial factor in the employee adverse employment decision.
at the mcvey test see also lee york cnty.sch,cir.
to avoid summary judgment on his retaliation and viewpoint discrimination claims,adams was required to adduce evidence sufficient to show material facts in dispute as to each of the three prongs of the mcvey test.the district court,in granting summary judgment to the defendants,considered only the first mcvey prong,whether adams speech was that of a citizen speaking upon a matter of public concern.the court made no ruling as to the other mcvey factors.accordingly,we examine whether the district court erred in awarding summary judgment based on the first mcvey prong.
citing garcetti ceballos,for the proposition that when a public employee makes a statement pursuant to his official duties,he does not speak as a citizen,the district court observed that it must focus not on the content of the speech but on the role the speaker occupied when he said it.the court then concluded that when adams listed his columns,publications,and public appearances in his promotion application,he implicit ly acknowledge d that they were expressions made pursuant to his professional duties that he was acting as a faculty member when he said them.as a consequence,the district court concluded that adams speech was not protected by the first amendment because adams inclusion of the speech in his application for promotion trumped all earlier actions and marked his speech,at least for promotion purposes,as made pursuant to his official duties.
as we explain below,the district court misread garcetti.the district court decision rests on several fundamental errors including its holding that protected speech was converted into unprotected speech based on its use after the fact.in addition,the district court applied garcetti without acknowledging,let alone addressing,the clear language in that opinion that casts doubt on whether the garcetti analysis applies in the academic context of a public university.see garcetti,at.nor did the district court take into consideration the only fourth circuit case addressing a similar issue,lee,at 
the district court initial error lies in its conclusion that adams speech,which the defendants agree was protected first amendment speech when initially given,was converted into unprotected speech based on factors that came into play only after the protected speech was made.although the district court framed the issue properly by noting it must focus not on the content of the speech but on the role the speaker occupied when he said it,j,the court subsequent analysis ignores the role adams occupied when he spoke.instead,the court basis for determining the first amendment did not protect adams speech was adams subsequent inclusion of past protected speech as part of his promotion application.in effect,the district court held that adams speech in his columns,books,and commentaries,although undoubtedly protected speech when given,was somehow transformed into unprotected speech because cook and others read the same items from a different perspective long after adams speech was uttered.
the district court cited no precedent for this determination,that protected speech can lose its first amendment protected status based on a later reading of that speech.although the defendants understandably agree with the district court holding,they also provide no precedent for the phenomenon of converting protected speech to unprotected speech after the fact.nor does the district court analysis find any support in garcetti,which focused on the nature of the employee speech at the time it was made.see at.nothing about listing the speech on adams promotion application changed adams status when he spoke or the content of the speech when made 
we do not agree with the district court observation that its holding was required because otherwise it 
would allow those in adams position to place employers in a double bind either neglect employee requests and refuse to look at material,fueling allegations of free speech violations grounded in the refusal or consider the material,knowing that doing so will open them up,in the event of an adverse outcome,to claims of free speech violations for basing denials on protected speech.
this purported catch is illusory.adams inclusion of the speech at issue as part of his application process asked the defendants to consider it not according to the content qua speech,but as factoring into the sweeping requirements of scholarship and service necessary to support his promotion to full professor.the defendants were not precluded from examining the materials for a permissible purpose using lawful criteria.at the same time,their review of those materials can be examined for an impermissible discriminatory use.this bind is no different than the commonplace consideration of criteria that govern all university employment decisions.it does not open the defendants up to an insurmountable dilemma as misidentified by the district court.
accordingly,we find the district court conclusion that adams speech was converted from protected to unprotected speech to be error as a matter of law.
we are also persuaded that garcetti would not apply in the academic context of a public university as represented by the facts of this case.our conclusion is based on the clear reservation of the issue in garcetti,fourth circuit precedent,and the aspect of scholarship and teaching reflected by adams speech.
in garcetti,the supreme court conducted a specific analysis associated with the first prong of the mcvey test and the pickering connick factors,to determine whether a public employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.the plaintiff,ceballos,wrote a memorandum as part of his official duties as a deputy district attorney asserting various perceived inaccuracies in an affidavit used to obtain a search warrant in a pending criminal case.ceballos employer,the county district attorney office,subsequently altered ceballos duties,and ceballos sued alleging retaliation based on his memo.id.at.the supreme court determined that ceballos claim failed because he was not speaking as a citizen when he wrote the memo.in so doing,the court concluded,r estricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.it simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.id.at.accordingly,the supreme court held the first amendment does not protect a government employee from discipline based on speech made pursuant to the employee official duties.id.at.
toward the conclusion of its analysis,and in response to
