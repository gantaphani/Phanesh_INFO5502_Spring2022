morrow sued the school district,romer,and lagrosa alleging that their statements to the press invaded his privacy the first cause of action and defamed him the sixth cause of action.the trial court granted defendants motion to dismiss the invasion of privacy and defamation causes of action pursuant to code of civil procedure section the statute morrow timely appeals,contending the trial court erred in finding the dismissed causes of action arose from defendants constitutionally protected speech activity and morrow failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on either claim.in connection with these arguments,morrow challenges the trial court evidentiary rulings that struck numerous statements from the two declarations morrow submitted in opposition to the motion.finally,he argues the trial court award of attorney fees to defendants should be reversed.we affirm,finding the challenged statements were constitutionally protected,revealed no private information,and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making its evidentiary rulings or in ordering attorney fees.
statement of facts and procedural background 
plaintiff allegations 
morrow became the principal of jefferson high school in,after serving with distinction as principal of several inner city schools.jefferson had traditionally been a secondary school.under his leadership,numerous improvements were made to the school and jefferson academic standing improved significantly.a series of violent campus disturbances among students occurred on april,april,and may.several students were injured others were arrested.according to morrow,romer and lagrosa falsely blamed him for the disturbances,which he attributed to defendants failure to provide jefferson with sufficient security his repeated requests.in essence,morrow alleged defendants invaded his privacy and defamed him by making statements to a reporter that were published in a los angeles times report on june,some of which were repeated in a june report.the statements were critical of his handling of the incidents and disclosed morrow purported retirement plans.morrow was removed as principal of jefferson and reassigned to a desk job within the school district.he retired on january,having been forced out of the district.he alleges that the negative comments by romer and lagrosa,along with the decision to remove him as principal of jefferson,caused him humiliation,embarrassment,pain and suffering,and damage to his professional reputation resulting in pecuniary losses.
with regard to his invasion of privacy claim,morrow alleged that defendants disclosures to the los angeles times concerning his handling of the campus disturbances amounted to a performance evaluation,which should have been conducted in a closed session of the school board pursuant to government code section.in his defamation claim,morrow alleged romer wrongfully made the following false and damaging statements to the los angeles times reporter,which were published in the newspaper stories on june and stronger leadership was needed at jefferson implicitly disparaging morrow leadership ability morrow had retirement plans that did not fit with the district needs and morrow handling of the april and may disturbances had accelerated a decision to replace him 
defendant evidence 
in support of their motion,defendants submitted declarations by lagrosa and romer.lagrosa stated that at the time of the relevant incidents,she was superintendent of the local district responsible for jefferson.she was one of morrow supervisors romer was lagrosa supervisor.she spent a lot of time at jefferson following the riots and formed the opinion that morrow was not providing strong leadership and should be replaced at the end of the school year.lagrosa informed romer that her decision to replace morrow was based on morrow handling of the student disturbances.she met with morrow after the second or third student fracas to discuss his future plans.lagrosa told morrow that she had heard he was planning to retire from the school district and was looking for a new job.morrow said he did plan to retire,but for financial reasons did not want to leave the district until january.according to lagrosa,morrow assumed she probably would want a new team in place by the start of the new school year in july,rather than have to replace morrow the following january.lagrosa agreed and told morrow that she would find him a position elsewhere in the district at his current salary until january 
romer,as superintendent of schools for the lausd,had an official duty to communicate with the press about matters of public concern.more specifically,in the event of incidents of student violence,it was his official duty to let the general public know what the lausd was going to do about it.following the violent episodes on the jefferson campus in april and may,romer concluded morrow had been unsuccessful in controlling the students,and because of the way he handled the student disturbances,morrow had to be replaced at the end of the school year.romer understood that morrow intended to retire,but he was aware of no plan to replace morrow prior to the student disturbances.lagrosa informed romer that she had decided to replace morrow at the end of the school year because of his handling of those disturbances.it was romer opinion that morrow had to be replaced in june because stronger leadership was needed at jefferson right away.
in late may,romer agreed to an interview with a los angeles times reporter because he considered the student disturbances at jefferson to be of concern to the public and he knew that the public wanted to know what the district would do about it.romer told the reporter that the high school needed stronger leadership,that morrow would be replaced as principal,and that morrow handling of the student disturbances had accelerated the decision to replace him.romer also told the reporter that morrow retirement plans did not fit with the district needs meaning the district needed to replace morrow at the end of the school year,prior to morrow planned retirement date.
michael,ed,president of the associated administrators of los angeles aala and longtime school district employee,provided a declaration supporting morrow opposition to defendants motion.declaration was admitted as evidence from a percipient witness rather than as an expert witness.according to,morrow was an aala member at the time of the jefferson incidents and defendants decision to replace him as principal.the collective bargaining agreement cba in effect between aala and lausd established the procedural due process rights of district administrators such as morrow under article vii of that agreement,which was the exclusive mechanism for evaluating the performance of and disciplining of the certificated supervisory unit for poor performance.at no time did any of the defendants invoke article vii as to morrow.was never contacted by any of the defendants about morrow job performance.understood that morrow has an outstanding reputation in the lausd academic community with regard to his truthfulness and his job performance.
in morrow own declaration,he stated that he was a member of aala at all relevant times and that the aala was the exclusive representative of certificated supervisors.the cba established the exclusive procedure for taking personnel actions against members.morrow considered his job performance and retirement plans to be highly personal and expected any questions concerning them to be addressed pursuant to article vii of the cba.morrow also summarized his employment history with the district,including his efforts to improve academic performance and security at the ways in which defendants ignored or hindered many of those efforts.morrow attributed the outbreak of student violence to defendants failure to heed his warnings and believed that defendants were unfairly placing the blame on him.
concerning his retirement plans,morrow explained that he had no desire to leave jefferson.in december,prior to the student disturbances,he began making retirement plans because his direct supervisor told him lagrosa intended to replace him as principal.the fact that morrow had not received a district performance evaluation that year was consistent with an intent to replace him.morrow could not remember the persons he spoke to about retirement prior to the disturbances,but they did not include lagrosa.he did not speak to her until may,when she was visiting the high school.she approached morrow in front of the cafeteria and told him she was speaking to romer on her cellular phone.the superintendent was being interviewed by a los angeles times reporter.lagrosa asked morrow if he had told anyone he was planning to retire.morrow said that he had spoken to his administrative team and direct supervisor in january,but only because he had heard that lagrosa wanted to replace him.according to morrow,in june,romer apologized to morrow for making the statements to the press concerning morrow job performance,stating that he got false information.
according to morrow,defendants lacked any basis for transferring him from jefferson.he declared that romer statements and defendants actions compelled him to retire seven years earlier than he had originally planned.he also attributed loss of income and earning capacity to those statements and actions.he is currently employed,but receiving less compensation and fewer benefits.
the newspaper reports 
the june,los angeles times article began the principal of jefferson high school agreed tuesday to step down amid criticism by city and school district officials over his handling of a spate of student brawls that many say have been fueled by racial tensions.principal norm morrow will be replaced at the troubled south los angeles campus on july,six months before he planned to retire,said rowena lagrosa,the los angeles unified school district local superintendent who met with morrow on tuesday to finalize the change.the move came on a day when los angeles antonio villaraigosa and schools roy romer expressed concerns over morrow ability to lead.the report explained that the had visited the previous week,the day after police broke up a campus brawl involving more than students.it was the third fight in the past six weeks at the school the events at jefferson have unfolded amid other violent outbreaks on several campuses in the city and elsewhere in southern california.while the fighting at many schools has occurred between b lacks and latinos,district officials have cautioned that factors other than race,such as overcrowding,have also played a role in the violence.romer also voiced the need for stronger leadership at jefferson,saying in an interview that morrow had retirement plans that did not fit with the district needs.the principal handling of the recent violence had accelerated a decision to replace him,romer said.according to the report,morrow declined to comment tuesday morning on his retirement plans and could not be reached after his meeting with lagrosa.
on june,the los angeles times reported that school district officials had hired a new principal,who would replace morrow on july.the hiring comes two weeks after district roy romer announced that morrow would be replaced at jefferson six months before his retirement amid criticism over his handling of the outbreaks of violence on campus.morrow will be transferred to another district position.romer said in a recent interview that the principal management of the recent violence accelerated a decision to replace him.the changes come after three melees,the first involving more than students near the school cafeteria.three students were hurt.in the second,more than b lack and latino students fought in a brawl that officials said had links to a gang dispute.six students were detained and two of them were arrested.another suffered a broken hip.the third fight,involving about students,occurred on the eve of a planned day of dialogue event that district officials had scheduled after the first two brawls.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court found government code section did not proscribe romer from discussing morrow performance outside a closed school board hearing.the trial court also found neither romer nor lagrosa revealed any private information concerning morrow.alternatively,to the extent any private information was revealed,the disclosure was privileged.a principal leadership or lack thereof in handling student violence and melees on a campus is the subject of legitimate public concern.romer,in his role as superintendent,had an official obligation to make a public report concerning the outbreak of violence at jefferson.pursuant to that official duty,romer properly used a public forum to express his concern that jefferson have a principal who could handle and eliminate the violence.there is no doubt that school violence is an issue of public concern,and discussion of such violence in a newspaper is a public forum and i think that the statements appear to have been pretty circumspect under the circumstances.
discussion 
the trial court properly granted defendants special motion to strike 
morrow argues his invasion of privacy and defamation claims were not subject to the statute because the statements by romer and lagrosa were not constitutionally protected,but even if they were,he made a sufficient factual showing of a probability of prevailing on those two claims to overcome defendants motion.we hold that none of the challenged statements divulged private information,but rather amounted to constitutionally privileged comment by a public officer in the proper discharge of an official duty under civil code section,subdivision a.accordingly,morrow claims were subject to an motion.moreover,the defamation claim independently failed because the challenged statements constituted either nonactionable opinions or nondefamatory statements of fact.
in evaluating an motion,the trial court first determines whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.under code of civil procedure section a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech shall be subject to a special motion to strike code civ,subd.b.rusheen cohen cal th,d.if the court finds the defendant has made the threshold showing,it determines then whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.in order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim code civ,subd.b,a plaintiff responding to an motion must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at,d.a plaintiff opposing a code of civil procedure section motion must support its claims with admissible evidence.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d.
we independently review both the question of whether morrow causes of action arise from protected activity and whether he has shown a probability of prevailing on the merits.greka integrated,lowrey th,d gallimore state farm fire casualty ins.th,d computerxpress,jackson th,d.
protected activity 
the code of civil procedure provides that for purposes of an motion,an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.code civ,subd.e.morrow argues the statements to the los angeles times concerning his handling of the student violence,leadership abilities,and retirement plans did not concern an issue of public interest,but were private personnel details that could be divulged only within a formal personnel evaluation subject to the protections of the cba.like the trial court,we disagree.
morrow he the incidents of student violence on the jefferson campus were of public interest.these were very serious incidents.the los angeles times published the following account the first brawl involved about students near the cafeteria.three students were hurt.in the second,more than b lack and latino students got into another lunchtime fight that officials said had links to a gang dispute.six students were detained and two of them were arrested.another student suffered a broken hip.prior to the june and reports,the los angeles times had run at least seven articles on the outbreaks of violence at jefferson,quoting morrow in most of them as to his assessment of the incidents and plans to respond to them.the los angeles times also reported that the police chief,mayor,and visited the campus in response to the incidents.the events undeniably were of at least citywide concern morrow assertions to the jefferson principal,morrow was at the center of the story.see brv,superior court th,d without doubt,the public has a significant interest in the professional competence and conduct of a school district superintendent and high school principal leventhal vista unified school dist,debate over public issues,including the qualifications and performance of public officials such as a school superintendent,lies at the heart of the first amendment.
nevertheless,morrow contends the challenged statements did not concern the student violence,but merely revealed matters of private retirement plans and the reasons for a personnel action.a fair reading of the relevant newspaper articles shows,however,morrow assertion is untenable.while it is possible to imagine an instance in which a school administrator retirement plans would be of purely private interest,that was not the case here.to the contrary,romer and lagrosa only mentioned morrow retirement plans to the extent they directly concerned the school district solution to the student violence.there is no evidence that any gratuitous details were offered to the press and certainly none were published.
we find the analysis by the federal appeals court in stevens tillman cir to be instructive.there,plaintiff stevens,an elementary school principal,sued the president of a association and her supporters for a variety of claims including defamation.in the course of finding the principal was a public figure for purposes of the new york times sullivan,d standard,the seventh circuit explained stevens was not an elected public official,but as principal she possessed great discretion over the operation of mollison school.how she used that discretion was the subject of legitimate public debate the statements at issue here dealt with the way stevens ran mollison school,not with her private life.stevens tillman,supra,at.the same was true of morrow 
morrow erroneously claims the cba proscribed romer from making the challenged statements,except in a closed session of the board of education.as the cba recognizes in article v,however,the district retains all rights not enumerated in the cba or otherwise placed outside the cba scope by government code section.that code section limits the cba scope of representation to matters relating to wages,hours of employment,and other terms and conditions of employment,and its definition of terms and conditions of employment does not encompass the right of the district executive officers to make public comments on a represented administrator performance when it impacts on issues of public concern,subd.a all matters not specifically enumerated are reserved to the public school employer and may not be a subject of meeting and negotiating.moreover,the cba identifies the right to assign personnel to any location as one of the rights retained by the school district.in short,the challenged statements were not the kind of formal personnel evaluation contemplated by article vii of the cba.bellflower education bellflower unified school dist.d.the subject of the grievance,violation of evaluation procedures,is within the allowable scope of collective bargaining under the government code.
morrow argues the personnel exception in the brown act created a right to privacy that covered the information provided to the press.the personnel exception,found in government code section,authorizes a local legislative body to hold a closed session to consider personnel matters,which the statute defines as the appointment,employment,evaluation of performance,discipline,or dismissal of a public employee.it also authorizes a local legislative body to hold a closed session to hear complaints or charges brought against a public employee by another person or employee,unless the employee requests a public session.paragraph two of section sets forth the notice that a local legislative body must provide to the employee a s a condition to holding a closed session on specific complaints or charges brought against an employee by another person or employee.the purposes of the personnel exception are to protect employees from public embarrassment and to permit free and candid discussions of personnel matters by a local governmental body.this exception should be narrowly construed.fischer los angeles unified school dist.th,d.
the personnel exception is inapplicable,as stated above,because defendants statements were not the equivalent of a personnel evaluation under the cba in addition,morrow argument turns the brown act on its head,because the general purpose of the brown act is to increase public awareness of issues bearing on the democratic process.the brown act requires open public meetings and gives people the right to attend meetings of local legislative bodies,subject to statutory exceptions.citation.the brown act establishes the general rule that meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public,and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency,except as otherwise provided in this chapter,subd.a.the brown act has the objective of facilitating public participation in local government decisions and curbing misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation.fischer los angeles unified school,supra,th at,d.
the statute plain meaning,as bolstered by the brown act overarching purpose and the requirement that the personnel exception be read narrowly,forecloses an interpretation that would equate the kind of generalized criticism roemer made to the press with a formal evaluation of performance as contemplated under government code section.stated another way,as a federal district court pointed out,while the brown act allows public employees to demand that a governing body air complaints about the employee in public,it does not grant the employees the right to force the conflict behind closed doors.leventhal vista unified school,supra.at.indeed,if the cba or the brown act proscribed romer from making the challenged statements to the press,there would be a serious question as to the constitutionality of either see id.at school board bylaws imposing restrictions on raising complaints against school district employees at open board meetings,when applied to cover even informal criticism,violated the first amendment,despite the contention that the public expressive rights were outweighed by the school district interest in protecting privacy and property rights of employees.
probability of prevailing on the merits 
having found the invasion of privacy and defamation causes of action arose from protected free speech activity,we proceed to the question of whether morrow has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on those claims based on admissible evidence.in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant code civ,subd.b though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.wilson parker,covert chidester,supra,cal th at,d.yu signet th,d see also jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th at,fn,d.
to prevail on a claim for invasion of privacy by means of the publication of private facts,morrow must prove a public disclosure of a private fact which would be offensive and objectionable to a reasonable person,and which is not of legitimate public concern.shulman group w productions,cal th,d.as our supreme court explains,lack of newsworthiness is an element of the private facts tort,making newsworthiness a complete bar to common law liability.id.at,d.the assessment of that question involves accommodating conflicting interests in personal privacy and in press freedom as guaranteed by the first amendment to the united states constitution.ibid.as long as the publication was of legitimate public concern,there can be no tort liability under this theory where the facts disclosed bear a logical relationship to the newsworthy subject of the broadcast and are not intrusive in great disproportion to their relevance even if the subject of disclosure was a private person involuntarily caught up in events of public interest.ibid.
our protected activity analysis demonstrated both the legitimate newsworthiness of the challenged publication and the lack of any legally protected privacy interest in the information disclosed to the press.it follows that morrow can not prevail on his privacy invasion claim.the trial court was correct in finding that to the extent the challenged disclosures included any private fact,the disclosure was logically relevant to the newsworthy subject of the violence at jefferson and the school district response to it.even if morrow retirement plans were considered to be a purely private concern,the disclosure was highly relevant to the district response and not particularly intrusive.
morrow defamation claim fares no better because the challenged statements were protected by the executive officer privilege of civil code section,subdivision a.enacted in,the statute states simply a privileged publication or broadcast is one made a in the proper discharge of an official duty.the annotation to the section made by the code commission in indicated that it was intended as a codification of the general principles developed by the courts.saroyan burkett cal d,saroyan.at the time of its enactment,the legal authorities cited by the code commission recognized an absolute privilege only in judicial and legislative proceedings.twenty years later,the united states supreme court applied the privilege to the executive branch of government,holding a communication of the postmaster general to be absolutely privileged.spalding vilas.copp paxton th,d copp.
the privileged nature of romer statements can not be seriously doubted in light of the leading decisions of the california and united states supreme courts.in saroyan,our supreme court followed the precedent of its federal counterpart to bar a defamation suit against the state superintendent of banks by an employee who alleged he was defamed by the superintendent statements to the press relating to his conduct as attorney for the state banking department.the saroyan court extended the executive privilege to state officials corresponding in rank to federal cabinet members.defendant superintendent of banks was such an official he was acting in the exercise of an executive function when he defended the policy of his department,and his statements were related to the defense of that policy.accordingly defendant was protected by an absolute privilege.saroyan,supra,cal d at,see also kilgore younger cal d,extending privilege to state attorney general sued for defamation after releasing a report on organized crime naming the plaintiff as a person suspected of criminal activity copp,supra,th at,d extending privilege to county emergency services coordinator sued for defamation royer steinberg d.extending privilege to school board trustees who passed an allegedly defamatory motion charging the plaintiff,a former superintendent of schools,with improper election activities.
while some appellate decisions have refused to apply the privilege to officials below cabinet rank,frisk merrihew d.denying immunity to school superintendent and school board secretary,we agree with our colleagues in the first district that the weight of authority follows federal precedents in extending the privilege to lower ranking officials.copp,supra,th at,d.most significantly,in the federal supreme court leading decision,barr matteo,d lead opinion of harlan,barr the absolute privilege was extended to the acting director of the office of rent office well below cabinet rank.copp,supra,th at,d see barr,supra,at,fn.omitted we do not think that the principle announced in spalding vilas,supra.can properly be restricted to executive officers of cabinet rank,and in fact it never has been so restricted by the lower federal courts.
as the supreme court explained in barr it is not the title of his office but the duties with which the particular officer sought to be made to respond in damages is entrusted which must provide the guide in delineating the scope of the rule which clothes the official acts of the executive officer with immunity from civil defamation suits.barr,supra,at.indeed,the published statement found privileged in barr can not be meaningfully distinguished from that made by romer.in that case,there was a widely reported scandal developing in a federal administrative agency concerning its employees accumulated leave payments.the defendant,the acting director of the agency,suspended two of his subordinates and released a press release implying in a press release that they were responsible for the misdeeds.royer steinberg,supra,d at,citing barr,supra,at.in finding the defendant statements absolutely privileged,the supreme court stated we think that under these circumstances a publicly expressed statement of the position of the agency head,announcing personnel action which he planned to take in reference to the charges so widely disseminated to the public,was an appropriate exercise of the discretion which an officer of that rank must possess if the public service is to function effectively.barr,supra,at.romer,in his capacity as the chief executive officer of the governing board of the district,subd.a,announced the impending transfer of a district employee as part of the school district response to a notorious crisis in a public high school.
morrow argues the executive privilege can not apply to romer because he was not exercising a policymaking function when he made the challenged statements.consistent with the decisions in saroyan and barr,however,the executive privilege broadly encompass es all discretionary acts essential to the proper exercise of an executive function decision.copp,supra,th at,d.as such,we find morrow reliance on neary regents of university of california d.neary and sanborn chronicle pub.cal d,sanborn misplaced.in neary,a university of california released a veterinarian report investigating dead cattle at the plaintiff ranch.in sanborn,a county clerk told the press that he had been conned by the plaintiff to release funds improperly.in those cases,the privilege was determined not to apply to the defendants acts because they we
