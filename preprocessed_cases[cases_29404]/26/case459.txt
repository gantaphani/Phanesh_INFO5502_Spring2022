travis pace pace appeals the district court dismissal of his claim under the individuals with disabilities education act idea and the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on pace claims under title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada or title ii and of the rehabilitation act.the panel of this court which considered pace appeal concluded that the state of louisiana,the louisiana department of education and the louisiana state board of elementary and secondary education state defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment from all of pace claims.the panel then affirmed the district court dismissal of pace claims against the bogalusa city school board.we took this case en banc,first to consider whether the state defendants were entitled to immunity from pace claims under the eleventh amendment and,second,to consider the merits of pace claims under the idea,ada and.for the reasons discussed below,we now conclude that the state waived its right to immunity under the eleventh amendment and therefore the state defendants are not entitled to immunity from pace and idea claims.on the merits,we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing pace idea claims and that the district court correctly concluded that the dismissal of pace idea claims precluded his inaccessibility claims under the ada and.we reject pace argument that because different legal standards control his inaccessibility claims under,those claims were not litigated in his idea action.a amendment and implementing regulations to the idea expressly require schools to comply with the identical standards for new construction that and their regulations require.
factual and legal background 
the factual and procedural background of this case is accurately and succinctly presented in the panel opinion 
in,at the age of fifteen,travis pace pace was enrolled at bogalusa high school.he is developmentally delayed,confined to a wheelchair,and suffers from cerebral palsy and bladder incontinence.in july,pace mother requested a due process hearing under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,as she believed that pace was denied a free appropriate public education fape due to a lack of handicap accessible facilities at bogalusa high school and deficiencies in pace individualized education programs ieps.the hearing officer found that the bogalusa city schools provided pace with a fape in compliance with the idea,and the state level review panel slrp affirmed the hearing officer decision.
in september,pace filed a complaint with the office for civil rights of the department of education ocr,alleging violations of of the rehabilitation act,a,and title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.the ocr and bcsb resolved allegations that the bcsb operated services,programs,and activities that were physically inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities by entering into a voluntary written agreement under which the bcsb would identify accessibility barriers and the ocr would oversee the development of a compliance plan.
in march,pace filed suit in federal district court,seeking damages and injunctive relief against the bcsb,the louisiana state board of elementary and secondary education,the louisiana department of education,and the state of louisiana,alleging violations of the idea,the ada,of the rehabilitation act,and various state statutes the district court bifurcated pace idea and claims.in separate orders,it affirmed the slrp decision by dismissing pace idea claims,then granted the defendants motions for summary judgment on pace claims.pace appeals both decisions.
ii.state immunity under the eleventh amendment 
we consider first the defendants arguments that they are entitled to sovereign immunity from pace claims under the eleventh amendment.at the core of this eleventh amendment dispute is the question whether,when louisiana accepted particular federal funds,it waived the immunity afforded it by the eleventh amendment to suits under and the idea 
a.the text and function of the eleventh amendment 
we start,as always,with the text.the eleventh amendment states 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state 
these in swift response to the supreme court holding in chisholm that article iii permitted a state to be sued in federal protect states from such litigation the protection thus afforded,however,has long since been expanded beyond the plain text of the amendment.though its precise terms bar only federal jurisdiction over suits brought against one state by citizens of another state or foreign state,the supreme court interpretation of the amendment has recognized that the eleventh amendment accomplished much more.the immunity afforded to states under the eleventh amendment implicates the fundamental constitutional balance between the federal government and the states.therefore,at its core,the eleventh amendment serves as an essential component of our constitutional structure.
nevertheless,eleventh amendment immunity is not absolute.a number of different circumstances may lead to a state litigating in federal court absent eleventh amendment immunity.we begin with an overview of the court current framework for assessing when a suit against a state may proceed in federal court.
exceptions to eleventh amendment immunity 
there are two fundamental exceptions to the general rule that bars an action in federal court filed by an individual against a state.first,a state eleventh amendment immunity may be abrogated when congress acts under,the enforcement clause of the fourteenth amendment second,a state may consent to suit in federal court 
abrogation under of the fourteenth amendment 
congress can strip the states of their eleventh amendment immunity and thereby authorize federal court suits by individuals against the states.when congress does this,it is exercising its power to abrogate eleventh amendment immunity.in reickenbacker foster we examined the supreme court cases concerning congressional abrogation of eleventh amendment immunity under of the fourteenth amendment and derived the following test for determining whether a federal statute is a valid exercise of congress power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and,consequently,whether the statute abrogates eleventh amendment immunity the statute must contain an unequivocal statement of congressional intent to abrogate congress must have identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional action by the states and the rights and remedies created by the statute must be congruent and proportional to the constitutional violation s congress sought to remedy or prevent if these three requirements are satisfied,states are subject to federal jurisdiction in suits under the statute adopted pursuant to,regardless of any absence of consent.
waiver of immunity by consent 
either in the absence of abrogation or in addition to it,a state always has the prerogative of foregoing its protection from federal court jurisdiction under the eleventh amendment a state consent to suit must be both knowing and voluntary.that consent must always be knowing and voluntary follows from college savings bank,in which the supreme court cited johnson zerbst,to define what constitutes effective waiver waiver is effective when it is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.the first part,intentional relinquishment,captures the principle of voluntariness and the second part,known right or privilege,captures the element of knowingness.
when congress conditions the availability of federal funds on a state waiver of its eleventh amendment immunity,we employ a test derived from the supreme court definitive spending power case,south dakota dole to ascertain the validity of the waiver.in dole,south dakota challenged a congressional statute that conditions the states receipt of federal highway funds on their adoption of the minimum drinking age of.south dakota argued that the statute exceeded congress spending power and violated the amendment the court rejected this argument,noting that even though congress is prohibited by the amendment from directly regulating the distribution of alcoholic beverages,the spending clause authorizes it indirectly to entice states to raise their drinking age by dangling the proverbial carrot of federal dollars 
dole embodies an expansive interpretation of congress spending authority.indirect persuasion is constitutional,reasoned the court,because the spending power is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the constitution.congress can,therefore,validly use its spending power to legislate conditions on the disbursement of federal funds even though those conditions would be unconstitutional if enacted as direct prohibitions it goes without saying that,because states have the independent power to lay and collect taxes,they retain the ability to avoid the imposition of unwanted federal regulation simply by rejecting federal funds.
nevertheless,congress power to effect policy through the exercise of its spending power is not unlimited.dole announced the restrictions that control such exercise federal expenditures must benefit the general welfare the conditions imposed on the recipients must be unambiguous the conditions must be reasonably related to the purpose of the expenditure and no condition may violate any independent constitutional prohibition in addition,the dole court recognized a fifth requirement that the condition not be coercive i n some circumstances the financial inducement offered by congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.
thus,dole makes clear that,as long as its framework is employed,congressional spending programs that are enacted in pursuit of the general welfare and unambiguously condition a state acceptance of federal funds on reasonably related requirements are constitutional unless they are either independently prohibited or coercive.when the condition requires a state to waive its eleventh amendment immunity,dole requirement of an unambiguous statement of the condition and its proscription on coercive inducements serve a dual role because they ensure compliance with college savings bank requirement that waiver of eleventh amendment immunity must be a knowing and b voluntary.
clear statement knowing 
in pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman the court analyzed congress power to impose conditions on a state receipt of federal funds and pronounced 
there can,of course,be no knowing acceptance if a state is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.accordingly,if congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys,it must do so unambiguously by insisting that congress speak with a clear voice,we enable the states to exercise their choice knowingly,cognizant of the consequences of their participation 
thus,we know that this stringent rule ensures that when a state foregoes its eleventh amendment immunity in exchange for federal funds,it does so knowingly.in our reading of pennhurst,the only knowledge that the court is concerned about is a state knowledge that a spending clause condition requires waiver of immunity,not a state knowledge that it has immunity that it could assert.at bottom,we conclude that if congress satisfies the rule,the knowledge prong of the spending clause waiver analysis is fulfilled.
ii.voluntary 
if the rule is satisfied,a state actual acceptance of clearly conditioned funds is generally voluntary.the only exception to this presumption arises if the spending program itself is deemed coercive,for then a state waiver is,by definition,no longer voluntary.
in summary,the supreme court has articulated two ways that a state can be subject to an individual suit in federal court,regardless of the eleventh amendment.first,congress may abrogate state immunity.second,the state may waive its eleventh amendment immunity by consent.if waiver results from participation in a spending clause program,the program must be a valid exercise of congress spending power the waiver condition must satisfy the rule thereby ensuring that the state waiver is knowing and the program must be automatically establishing that the waiver is voluntary.
waiver of eleventh amendment immunity pursuant to conditional spending programs 
keeping firmly in mind the court current framework for analyzing when a state may be subject to suit in federal court,we turn to the particular facts and legal contentions of the instant case.the two statutory provisions at issue purport to have conditioned louisiana receipt of federal funds on its waiver of eleventh amendment immunity to suits under and the idea.specifically,conditions a state receipt of federal money on its waiver of eleventh amendment immunity to actions under and other federal statutes 
a state shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment of the constitution of the united states from suit in federal court for a violation of section of the rehabilitation act of,title ix of the education amendments of,the age discrimination act of,title vi of the civil rights act of,or the provisions of any other federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of federal financial assistance 
similarly,conditions a state receipt of federal idea funds on its consent to suit under that act applying the framework set forth in dole,we proceed to determine whether louisiana validly waived its immunity when it accepted the conditioned federal dollars.
louisiana does not dispute that the first and third prongs of the dole analysis,whether the spending clause statute at issue was enacted in pursuit of the general welfare,and whether the condition is sufficiently related to the federal interest in the program funded are satisfied here.consequently,we restrict our consideration to the three remaining prongs of the dole test.following prior panels of this court and every circuit but one that has made these inquiries,we conclude that the statutes at issue validly conditioned louisiana receipt of these federal funds on its waiver of eleventh amendment immunity 
first,we determine whether the conditions contained in and are unambiguous and,consequently,whether louisiana knowingly waived its immunity to actions under and the idea by accepting federal funds.
is the rule satisfied absent use of the words waiver or condition 
in the face of the unequivocal language of to the effect that a state shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment of the constitution of the united states from suit in federal court for a violation of of the rehabilitation act of,louisiana argues legalistically that,because congress did not use the words waiver or condition,the condition fails the rule this absent talismanic incantations of magic words,there can be no little more than frivolous the supreme court has already noted,albeit in dicta,that in congress sought to provide the sort of unequivocal waiver that our precedents demand.more importantly,our decision in pederson louisiana state university,which we remain convinced was correctly decided,forecloses this line of attack 
does the presence of abrogation language preclude a finding of waiver 
louisiana also argues that because and fail as attempts by congress to abrogate eleventh amendment immunity,the same provisions of those statutes can not satisfy the rule for spending clause purposes.we reject louisiana attempt to pigeonhole this statutory language in mutually exclusive terms.
we held in pederson that,in,congress successfully codified a statute which clearly,unambiguously,and unequivocally conditions receipt of federal funds under title ix on the state waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.and in lesage texas we ruled that congress unquestionably enacted with the intent to invoke the fourteenth amendment congressional enforcement power.the purpose of the provision,enacted in,was to legislatively overrule the result in atascadero.thus,in pederson,we recognized as a clear statement for waiver the spending clause,and in lesage,we recognized that the very same provision could satisfy abrogation under of the fourteenth amendment.
just because particular language may or may not function with equal efficacy under both exceptions to eleventh amendment immunity,does not mean that it fails the rule.as we concluded in,the rule requires only that the state has been put on notice clearly and unambiguously by the federal statute that the state particular conduct or transaction will subject it to federal court suits brought by individuals.congress need not declare in the statute whether it is proceeding under abrogation or waiver,or both.for the purpose of the rule,as it may no constitutional impediment to our finding valid waiver by consent.we conclude that the conditions contained in and are unambiguous,as required by dole.
undaunted,louisiana still contends that it did not knowingly waive its eleventh amendment immunity.louisiana and the dissent rely on garcia health sciences which looked to the supreme court decision in board of trustees of the university of alabama to justify departing from the heavy weight of authority supporting waiver based on the clarity of the language in.garrett examined whether,in title i of the ada,congress could constitutionally abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity the garrett court concluded that title i of the ada was outside the scope of valid legislation therefore,congress attempt at abrogation failed,and private suits against states in federal court were barred by the eleventh amendment 
the lawsuits in garcia involved disputes that arose between september and august during that period,it was universally accepted that the ada validly abrogated eleventh amendment immunity.rather than looking at the rule and the state acceptance of funds,garcia analyzed whether a state would have realized known that it was abandoning its eleventh amendment immunity by accepting federal funds during the period of time applicable to the lawsuits at issue there and here the garcia court noted that,during the relevant period,title ii of the ada was reasonably understood to abrogate the state sovereign immunity under congress commerce clause authority.the court also pointed out that the requirements of title ii and are virtually identical.therefore,concluded the court,because the state defendant thought that it could be sued under title ii,it had nothing to lose by accepting federal funds and redundantly waiving immunity to suits in the process 
louisiana and the dissent maintain that we should follow the panel and apply the logic of garcia to the instant case.first,louisiana contends that,because it believed that the rehabilitation act had already abrogated its eleventh amendment immunity,it did not and could not know that it retained any sovereign immunity to waive by accepting conditioned federal funds.likewise,louisiana asks us to conclude that was an unsuccessful attempt at abrogation therefore,maintains louisiana,it could not have knowingly waived its immunity under the idea when it accepted federal idea funds.
even though it found that the statutory provisions at issue are unambiguous the panel nevertheless concluded that louisiana purported waivers of eleventh amendment immunity are invalid because they were not knowing.the panel drew support from the holding in garcia,but its reasoning differed slightly from the second circuit.according to the panel opinion,b elieving that the rehabilitation act and the idea validly abrogated their sovereign immunity,the state defendants did not and could not know that they retained any sovereign immunity to waive by accepting conditioned federal funds.
the fatal flaw with that syllogism lies in the fact that neither the mandates of the rehabilitation act nor the requirements of the idea apply to a state agency that has not received either some federal funding in the case of the rehabilitation act or federal idea dollars in the case of the idea therefore,it is impossible for congress to have abrogated a state immunity to or idea suits if the relevant state agency did not receive federal funds during the time period in which it was alleged to have violated an individual statutory rights.it follows indisputably that louisiana eleventh amendment immunity to and idea claims was intact before the state accepted federal funds.thus,louisiana did have eleventh amendment immunity to waive by accepting the clearly conditioned federal funds.
the dissent nevertheless insists that,during the time that and the idea were thought to abrogate eleventh amendment immunity,louisiana could have believed that it lacked immunity to and idea suits even before it received federal funds under those statutes this ignores the nature of the rehabilitation act and the idea.the acts substantive provisions regulate only state agencies that have accepted the relevant federal funds.thus,it makes no sense to say that the state was subject to private actions for damages under and the idea before the substantive provisions of those statutes applied to it.contrary to the dissent accusation we do not confuse the doctrines of abrogation and waiver rather,we point out before could have avoided suits under and the idea altogether by declining federal funding.louisiana clearly had eleventh amendment immunity to waive at the time that it accepted the federal funds and expressly obligated itself to comply with the dictates of the rehabilitation act and the idea.
further,during the relevant time period,and put each state on notice that,by accepting federal money,it was waiving its eleventh amendment immunity.under dole,if the requirement is met,the state is conclusively presumed to have known that receipt of clearly conditioned federal funds requires the state to abide by the condition,waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.
in addition,the garcia approach is problematic for a number of reasons,the most fundamental of which is that,by focusing its inquiry on what the state could have believed,the second circuit engrafted a element onto the otherwise objective spending clause waiver inquiry.in other words,garcia approach employs the wrong jurisprudential test,because it distorts what is necessary to show knowledge for spending clause waivers.analytically,the knowledge question that we ask when we undertake the spending clause waiver inquiry is coextensive with the rule for,when a state actually accepts funds that are clearly conditioned on a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity,it is held objectively to know that it is accepting all clearly stated conditions.that it might not know subjectively whether it had any immunity to waive by agreeing to those conditions is wholly irrelevant.
the dissent asserts that,by focusing on the requirement,we have disregarded college savings bank clear declaration requirement.but college savings bank was not a case.there,the court invalidated constructive waivers of eleventh amendment immunity based upon the state mere presence in a field subject to congressional regulation.such a constructive waiver is a far cry from a state acceptance of federal funds that are explicitly conditioned on its waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.in fact,the college savings bank opinion expressly distinguished waivers of eleventh amendment immunity,which it said were fundamentally different from illegitimate constructive waivers nothing in college savings bank indicates that,when the requirement is met,a state can be said to lack knowledge that by accepting federal funds it waives its eleventh amendment immunity.
in sum,garcia and the dissent would subjugate the of objective reasoning to the slippery slope of assessing a state subjective belief if,like the panel,we were to follow that approach,we would be getting into the business of looking past the straightforward objective facts,the clear statement requiring waiver and the state actual,uncoerced acceptance of federal funds,in an attempt to fathom what was in a state head,a precarious exercise indeed.the rule guards against post hoc questions about intent.
accordingly,we hold that louisiana waiver of eleventh amendment immunity to actions under and the idea was knowing still,we must determine whether an independent constitutional bar prevents congress from conditioning the receipt of federal funds on a state waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.
can congress condition waiver of eleventh amendment immunity when it exercises its spending power 
louisiana challenges congress power under the spending clause to condition receipt of federal education funds on a state waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.this position is frivolous.we have consistently interpreted supreme court guidance as permitting such conditional spending programs,as has every other circuit that has squarely addressed the issue we do not change course today.
is conditioning acceptance of federal funds a violation of the doctrine 
louisiana also attempts to invoke the doctrine to challenge congress ability to condition the acceptance of federal funds on waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.in the most general sense,the doctrine examines the extent to which government benefits may be conditioned or distributed in ways that burden constitutional rights or principles for at least two reasons,louisiana reliance on the doctrine is misplaced.
first,as evidenced by the dearth of cases employing it in this context the doctrine is most meaningful when the government imposes a condition of questionable constitutional character on an individual right.but here,federal and state sovereigns are on opposite sides of the controversy,and the constitutional right at issue is structural rather than personal.consequently,for the reasons announced in the third circuit analysis in koslow commonwealth of pennsylvania,the doctrine is inapplicable.the koslow court considered whether the rehabilitation act,including,imposed an unconstitutional condition on pennsylvania receipt of federal funds.in refusing to apply the doctrine to the conditioning of federal funds on the waiver of eleventh amendment immunity,the third circuit stated 
t he supreme court has not yet applied the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to cases between two sovereigns.unlike private persons,states have the resources to serve their citizens even if the federal government,through economic incentives,encourages a particular result.a state political the least of which is the power to levy taxes on its ensure the federal government does not coerce the state through economic encouragement.an individual citizen,in contrast,lacks these formidable institutional resources 
we embrace that reasoning.
second,the doctrine,even when applied piecemeal by the supreme court,is anchored at least in part in a theory of coercion or compulsion in this context,that concern is subsumed in the prong of the dole test in other words,in the spending clause context,any role that the doctrine might have in cabining congress authority to give funds in exchange for waiving immunity is already of the standard spending clause analysis.thus,no independent constitutional bar invalidates louisiana waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.
are these programs coercive 
in light of dole,we must determine whether the schemes at issue are unduly coercive.we hold that they are not.a state can prevent suits against a particular agency under by declining federal funds for that agency a state can avoid suit under the idea merely by refusing idea funds.and,to do so in either case,the state would not have to refuse all federal assistance moreover,no circuit has accepted a coercion challenge to either the rehabilitation act or the idea therefore,we refuse to invalidate louisiana waiver on coercion grounds.
abrogation of immunity 
alternatively,pace asks this en banc court to rule that under of the fourteenth fact abrogated louisiana eleventh amendment immunity,leaving louisiana subject to suit on pace ada,rehabilitation act,and idea claims.as we hold that louisiana waived its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to the rehabilitation act and the idea,it is not necessary for us to address pace contention that louisiana immunity to suit under those statutes was also abrogated.neither is it necessary for us to consider whether title ii of the ada abrogates eleventh amendment immunity in this case.first,the supreme court,in tennessee lane held that title ii abrogates sovereign immunity to the extent that it implicates the accessibility of judicial services,but refused to consider its application to other rights,including those considered to be fundamental under the constitution because the supreme court has never before recognized access to public or freedom from disability discrimination in to be fundamental rights,and it is unnecessary to address pace title ii claims given that its rights and remedies are identical to and duplicative of those provided in,we do not address whether the holding in lane extends to disability discrimination in access to public education.
second,when ada claims are directed at architectural barriers,as they are here,the rights and remedies are exactly the same as those provided under the rehabilitation act.this circuit,as well as others,has noted that,because the rights and remedies under both statutes are the same,case law interpreting one statute can be applied to the other the implementing regulations for and title ii are,in all material respects,the same.for example,both statutes implementing regulations prohibit similar types of discrimination in addition,and title ii regulations governing new construction and alterations are effectively the same the two statutes are interpreted to provide the same exception no covered entity is obligated to make a fundamental alteration in its programs finally,the remedies available under and title ii are one and the same.specifically,of title ii states that t he remedies,procedures,and rights set forth in section of the rehabilitation act of shall be the remedies,procedures,and rights this title provides to any person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of section of the ada.section a of the rehabilitation act,in turn,states that the remedies,procedures,and rights set forth in title vi of the civil rights act of shall be available for violations of thus,in barnes gorman the supreme court held that the remedies for violations of of the ada and of the rehabilitation act are coextensive with the remedies available in a private cause of action brought under title vi of the civil rights act for all intents and purposes,therefore,the remedies available to pace under and title ii are the same.the sole difference between the statutes lies in their causation requirements this difference is not implicated,however,where,as here,the challenge is to architectural barriers.
in conclusion,we hold that for all the foregoing reasons,louisiana is not entitled to assert sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment in this case.with that issue determined,we proceed to the question of issue preclusion.
iii.merits 
we turn now to the merits of pace arguments that the district court erred in denying relief to him under the idea,the ada and.
we agree with and adopt that portion of the panel opinion affirming the district court judgment which in turn affirmed the administrative determination that pace was not entitled to relief under the idea.
we pause only to emphasize the somewhat unusual nature of a proceeding under the idea.as required by the statute pace first pursued his administrative claim.he was granted a hearing by a hearing examiner where he had an opportunity to present his evidence demonstrating that the inaccessibility of various portions of the bogalusa campus prevented him from receiving a free and appropriate public education fape.the hearing examiner,after hearing the evidence and making a personal inspection of the campus,rejected pace inaccessibility claims and concluded that the defendants had complied with the idea and had provided a fape to pace pace then challenged the hearing examiner findings and conclusion in his administrative appeal to the state level review panel slrp.the slrp also rejected pace claims and affirmed the hearing examiner in all respects pace then filed suit in federal district court as authorized by i a.a district court in which such an action is filed must receive the record generated by the administrative proceeding and also hear additional evidence presented by the parties the court must then give due weight to the hearing officer finding and make a de novo determination based on a preponderance of the evidence.teague independent school district todd l,cir.the district court considered all of pace claims of inaccessibility that he raised during the administrative proceedings the court considered the administrative record along with the new evidence offered by pace and gave due weight to the findings of the hearing examiner and slrp.ultimately,the district court agreed with the hearing examiner that bogalusa high school had provided pace with a fape by complying with the idea in all aspects,including that the campus was accessible to the pace.the district court conclusion is fully supported by the record and we therefore affirm the district court rejection of pace claims under the idea.
ada and section 
in addition to his idea claims,pace also asserted claims under the ada and in his suit.the district court severed the idea claims from these claims.after dismissing pace idea claims,the district court then considered defendants motion for summary judgment seeking exoneration under and the ada.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on grounds that the factual bases for the claims were indistinct from the resolved idea claims.the district court concluded further that principles of issue preclusion applied to preclude pace from pursuing his redundant claims.pace argues that the district court committed legal error in applying principles of issue preclusion to bar his claims.
issue preclusion or collateral estoppel is appropriate when the identical issue was previously adjudicated the issue was actually litigated and the previous determination was necessary to the decision.see southmark coopers lybrand in re southmark,cir.in southmark we also found that the relitigation of an issue is not precluded unless the facts and the legal standard used to assess them are the same in both proceedings.id.quoting recoveredge pentecost,cir.issues of fact are not identical or the same,and therefore not preclusive,if the legal standards governing their resolution are significantly different.pace argues that the accessibility issues the court litigated under the idea were for the limited purpose of determining whether the bogalusa high school provided pace with a fape under that statute.thus,pace contends,because a significantly different legal standard applies to his accessibility issues under the ada and,these latter claims were never litigated and issue preclusion should not apply.we therefore compare the standards of accessibility under the idea on the one hand and the ada and on the other to determine whether the legal standards are significantly different.
as indicated above,the idea requires states and local educational agencies receiving federal idea funds to make a fape available to children with certain disabilities between the ages of and.the idea imposes extensive requirements on schools to safeguard the disabled child right to a fape.in determining whether a school has provided a student with a fape,the focus is on the individualized education plan iep,a written statement prepared by a team consisting of a representative of the local school district,the disabled child teachers,the child parents and the child.d.the iep includes the child educational performance,his goals,the nature of his disabilities,and a description of the educational and related services that will be provided for the child to meet the stated objectives.the objective is always to tailor the fape to the particular needs of the child.isd michael,cir.
the goal of the idea is to require a fape that will permit the child to benefit from the educational experience.it need not be the best possible education nor one that will maximize the child educational potential.bd.of education rowley,d.
admittedly different from those underlying the idea,the congressional objective of both the ada and is the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.b.title ii of the ada,which applies to public entities including public schools,provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs or activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.see also a.section contains virtually identical language.see a.mandating physical accessibility and the removal and amelioration of architectural barriers is an important purpose of each statute 
the primary difference between the ada and is that applies only to recipients of federal funds.a.this difference does not concern us in this case because no defendant argues that it does not receive federal money.thus,as we stated in section above,for the purposes of this appeal,the ada and and their implementing regulations impose identical obligations on the defendants and grant identical rights to pace 
in pace brief to us on his claims brought under and the ada he complains only that parts of the bogalusa high school campus are inaccessible to him.the only regulations dealing with accessibility in education are found in subpart c of the regulations.section of regulations deals with new construction on school campuses,the basis of pace complaints in this suit.subpart d of the regulations deals with preschool,elementary,and secondary education and those regulations do not purport to cover accessibility in schools rather,the general education regulations on accessibility found in subpart c of apply to new construction on high school campuses such as bogalusa high the ada has no specific section on education,so the general regulations governing accessibility to public buildings also control accessibility to school buildings.
with this background,we turn to pace specific argument that his accessibility claims under the are not precluded by the district court rejection of his accessibility claims under the idea.he argues that his accessibility claims are not precluded because different legal standards apply to his ada and accessibility claims,and these claims have never been litigated or decided.when we consider the equivalent standards for accessibility in schools under the idea on the one hand and the on the other,it becomes clear that we should reject this argument.
congress required in a amendment to the idea that any construction of new facilities must comply with either the americans with disabilities accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities adaag or the uniform federal accessibility standards ufas.b thus,with respect to a physically disabled child such as the pace,the school can comply with the idea accessibility requirements by satisfying either the adaag or ufas 
pace presents no argument that the accessibility standards for new construction of school buildings under the ada or are more demanding or even different from the standards required under the amendment to the idea.this is understandable,because the regulations governing accessibility in schools under the require a school engaged in new construction to conform to the same standards as the idea,either the adaag or ufas.
new construction and alterations of public facilities under title ii of the ada are governed by the regulations found in like the idea,the ada accessibility regulations require a school conducting new construction to comply with either the adaag or ufas.section accessibility regulations are virtually identical to the ada and also demand that schools engaging in new construction comply with the same federal guidelines required by the idea.thus,pace argument that the accessibility standards are different under idea and is meritless.
in summary,under the idea,when,as here,a child complains that his disability renders a portion of the campus inaccessible,this triggers the application of the amendments to the idea.in determining whether the school has met its obligations under the amendment and provided the disabled student with a fape,the hearing examiner,the slrp,and the district court must determine whether the area of the school in question complies with either the adaag or ufas.these are the same federal guidelines the school must comply with to satisfy the accessibility requirements of the ada and.
pace,as he was required to do by the idea,presented his accessibility claims in his administrative claim.in their administrative findings,both the hearing examiner and the slrp discussed the amendment to the idea.this makes it clear that both were aware that new or existing construction to bogalusa high school must meet either the adaag or ufas standards before the school could fully comply with the idea 
the only significant summary judgment evidence pace presented to the district court on his claims was the report and deposition testimony of donald maginnis,an architectural expert.the point of his testimony is that structural changes to the bogalusa campus failed to comply with the adaag.although this same standard applied to pace claim under the idea,he did not introduce this evidence before the hearing examiner.further,pace failed to offer the expert evidence to the district court to support his appeal of the administrative determination under the idea.because the accessibility standards under the idea and the are identical for new construction of school buildings,pace has not demonstrated that the defendants owed him any greater or even different obligation in this respect under than he was entitled to under the idea.thus,the accessibility issue pace litigated in his idea case and lost is the same issue he sought to litigate in his claim.the district court correctly concluded that pace was precluded from relitigating this issue.
the only argument pace presents to us on the applicability of the amendment was presented for the first time in his petition for en banc review.he argued in that petition and argues to the en banc court that the amendment was not triggered because no evidence was presented that idea funds were used to make the improvements to the bogalusa campus.pace relies on the following language in the amendment to 
acquisition of equipment construction or alteration of facilities 
a in general 
if the secretary determines that a program authorized under this chapter would be improved by permitting program funds to be used to acquire appropriate equipment,or to construct new facilities or alter existing facilities,the secretary is authorized to allow the use of those funds for those purposes.
neither the amendment nor the existing statute purports to require a plaintiff to prove the use of idea funds or any other fact as a predicate to seeking relief under the idea against a school for failing to make its campus accessible in response to a student iep.we have found no cases interpreting this amendment or its predecessor.subsection a is simply a restyled version of the existing statute the change is found in subsection b,which incorporates into the idea for the first time the adaag and ufas construction standards.the amended a,like the existing statute,authorizes the secretary to allow the use of idea funds for construction or alterations.
to support pace argument that the amended version of does not apply in this case,amicus seems to argue that structural alterations to meet accessibility demands in a student iep are not part of the calculus in determining whether a student has received a fape.
in weber special education law and litigation treatise,he rejects this suggestion in his cogent discussion of the interplay between the idea,and ada 
schools covered by title ii and section owe obligations not only to students with disabilities but to all persons with disabilities whom they serve.in this sense,the laws are more inclusive than the individuals with disabilities education act idea,whose beneficiaries are children with disabilities who need special education.nevertheless,by requiring school districts to provide an appropriate education in the least restrictive environment,idea overlaps with section and title ii in terms of the children it covers.thus,idea may require a school district to modify programs or facilities to achieve these ends for an individual student.idea funds may be used for removal of architectural barriers or other improvements to accessibility in order to promote appropriate education for children with disabilities.footnotes omitted emphasis added 
weber further describes a school duty under the idea to address accessibility concerns in the iep as a component of appropriate special education and related services in the least restrictive environment.this discussion makes it clear that when a student iep raises concerns of accessibility to the school campus,the determination of whether these concerns have been met is a necessary component in resolving whether the student has received a fape.
the hearing examiner tried this controversy on the premise that the entire idea statute,including the amendment,applied to pace claims,and no one argued to the contrary.the hearing examiner did not require the parties to file extensive papers.however,she did require each party to list the issues they wanted the hearing examiner to address.neither pace nor the school board asserted that an issue was presented with respect to the expenditure of idea funds or any other issue relating to the applicability of the amendment to.considering the strict duty that the adaag and ufas construction guidelines impose on the school,it was also reasonable for the hearing examiner to assume that the school board would object if there was some basis for it to argue that these guidelines did not apply to the architectural improvements ordered by pace iep.it is not surprising that pace did not object to the hearing examiner application of such rigorous standards it was in his interest at the time to require the school to meet the toughest standards possible in making the architectural improvements.
after three hearings,the hearing examiner issued her report finding that bogalusa high had provided pace with a fape.the hearing examiner explicitly found that the adaag guidelines applied,meaning that she concluded that pace accessibility concerns regarding improvements made to the campus triggered the application of the amendment to of the idea.otherwise,the adaag guidelines would be irrelevant.in making her findings,the hearing examiner relied on the voluminous administrative record,which shows that bogalusa received substantial federal idea funds during and,the relevant time period idea regulations make it clear that federal idea funds can not be with state funds the hearing examiner also had the benefit of pace iep and the testimony of the school board maintenance supervisor that the construction changes were made in response to pace iep facilitator instructions.even if a showing of the use of idea funds was required,it was reasonable for the hearing examiner to conclude that idea funds were used and that under the amended version of the school provided pace with a fape.
pace appealed the hearing examiner order to the state level review panel slrp.again,the record reflects no argument from any party to that appeal that the entire idea statute,including the amendment to,did not apply.the slrp in its opinion explicitly applied the amendment,discussed pace arguments,and after rejecting them,affirmed the hearing examiner.
pace then filed suit in federal district court seeking relief under the idea,and the ada.he specifically alleged in his petition that the state received federal idea funds his core claim was that the school had failed to comply with the adaag.
the primary evidence pace presented to the district court was the deposition testimony and report of architect donald maginnis,who testified that the structural changes to the campus failed to meet adaag standards.thus,pace federal claim was predicated on these guidelines,made applicable to the idea by the amendment to.because the hearing examiner and the slrp had rejected pace accessibility claims based on application of these same standards the adaag and ufas,the district court concluded that pace was precluded from relitigating his accessibility issues.
suffering summary judgment in the district court on both his idea and claims,pace sought appellate relief from this court.in his initial brief to the panel,pace argued that the district court erred in accepting the hearing examiner and slrp findings of accessibility to preclude his accessibility claims.however,pace did not base his argument on the inapplicability of the amendment to or that the hearing examiner erred in applying the adaag guidelines to the structural changes.the school board did argue to the panel that the amendment applied and that the hearing examiner and slrp had used the very same federal guidelines in deciding pace idea claims that pace sought to litigate in his action 
faced with the appellee argument that his claims were precluded due to the previous application of the amended version of,pace filed a reply brief with the panel.again,he made no effort to refute the school board argument that the amendment to applied.
without any opposition from pace as to the proper application of to the improvements to bogalusa high campus,the panel accepted the school board unchallenged argument and relied on the amendment to affirm the district court judgment the panel specifically cited the amended version of to support its conclusion that issue preclusion was proper because accessibility to the campus had already been litigated under the same federal standards 
in response to the panel decision,pace sought en banc review,where he argued for the first time that did not apply to the improvements he demanded in his iep,because t here is no proof that construction in this case would be covered by this provision.
in sum,we do not read the amendment to require proof that idea funds were used for improvements to trigger the amendment.even if the statute can be read in this manner,there is evidence to support an inference that idea funds were used to make the structural changes.more importantly,we can not permit pace to change his position at will.he was obviously happy to have the administrative bodies and the trial court apply the amendment to and the strict adaag guidelines when it was helpful to him.he can not at this late date reverse his position when he finds that application of those guidelines are not in his best interest.
pace has one remaining argument in support of his position that issue preclusion should not apply to his claims under the ada and.he argues that the idea savings clause,gives him the right to maintain a cause of action under the ada and we agree that pace is not limited to a claim under the idea and that he can assert claims under the ada and.but his ability to assert claims does not mean that general principles of issue preclusion do not apply to preclude his redundant claims because pace claims under the ada and are factually and legally indistinct from his idea claims,issue preclusion is proper in this case.
because pace is precluded from litigating the question of whether the defendants have any obligation under the ada and to make further architectural or structural changes in the buildings on the bogalusa campus,his claim for an injunction ordering such changes must also fail.
in conclusion,we affirm the district court dismissal of pace claims under the idea and also affirm the district court dismissal of pace claims for damages and injunctive relief under the ada and.
i concur in the court discussion of the merits of pace claims,but i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that the state of louisiana,by accepting federal education funds from to the period here at issue,validly waived its eleventh amendment immunity from suit for violations of and the idea statute.instead,we should hold that under these limited and unusual circumstances,the state did not knowingly waive its constitutional right to be free from suit by private citizens 
alexander hamilton wrote 
it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.this is the general sense and the general practice of mankind and the exemption,as one of the attributes of sovereignty,is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the union.
the federalist,at clint rossiter.the eleventh amendment protects states from suit in federal court precisely out of the recognition of their continued status as.puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.for over one hundred years,the supreme court has extended a state constitutional protection from suit to suits brought by the state own citizens.idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d referring to hans louisiana.
there are two carefully construed exceptions whereby states may become subject to suits by private citizens.congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to of the fourteenth amendment,or the state may waive its sovereign immunity and give its consent to suit.see coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.however,b ecause abrogation of sovereign immunity upsets the fundamental constitutional balance between the federal government and the states,and because states are unable directly to remedy a judicial misapprehension of that abrogation,the court has adopted a particularly strict standard to evaluate claims that congress has abrogated the states sovereign immunity.port auth.feeney,d citations and quotations omitted.similar solicitude for states sovereign immunity underlies the standard that this court employs to determine whether a state has waived that immunity.id.
travis pace advances both abrogation and waiver theories in support of his claims against louisiana.the majority agrees with pace that louisiana waived its sovereign immunity as a condition of accepting federal funds under of the rehabilitation act and idea.in so doing,the majority has forsaken the particularly strict standard the eleventh amendment demands,ignored the supreme court settled test for evaluating a waiver of constitutional rights,and inexplicably discounted the unique factual context from which this case arose.
as a fundamental constitutional component,s tate sovereign immunity,no less than the right to trial by jury in criminal cases,is constitutionally protected.coll.sav.bank,at.at.the same test used in evaluating waiver of other fundamental constitutional rights must be employed in the eleventh amendment context as well.as the court held,there is no justification for creating a separate and distinct test for eleventh amendment waiver purposes.thus,t he classic description of an effective waiver of a constitutional right is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.id.citations and quotations omitted emphasis added.according to the sole applicable test,therefore,waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.moran burbine,d emphasis added.moreover,courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights and do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.johnson zerbst.this circuit,at least until today,adhered to this uniform approach.waivers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be knowing,intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.united states newell,cir quoting brady united states,d emphasis added.a valid waiver requires actual knowledge of the existence of the right or privilege,full understanding of its meaning,and clear comprehension of the consequences of the waiver.id.quoting hatfield scott,cir emphasis in original.
the test for a state waiver of eleventh amendment immunity is no different because congress sought to effect waiver under the spending clause.the supreme court has repeatedly characterized spending clause legislation as much in the nature of a contract in return for federal funds,the recipients agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.barnes gorman,d quoting pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.just as a valid contract requires offer and acceptance of its terms,the legitimacy of congress power to legislate under the spending power rests on whether the recipient voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the contract.barnes,at.citations and quotations omitted emphasis added see also pennhurst,at.at the state consent to suit must be unequivocally expressed.as a result,the test for determining whether a state has waived its immunity from jurisdiction is a stringent one.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.
despite this clear authority,the majority has crafted a novel waiver test for spending clause cases.relying on south dakota dole,d,the majority draws two conclusions a state waiver is knowing so long as congress satisfies the clear statement rule,and the state waiver is voluntary so long as it is.although i agree with the latter conclusion,the former is incorrect college savings bank controls the eleventh amendment waiver inquiry and demands more than a congressional clear statement it also requires the state to make a clear declaration of its intent to waive its immunity.in college savings bank,the supreme court recognized that for a state knowingly to waive its sovereign immunity,not only must congress make clear its intention to so condition federal funds,but the state must expressly and unequivocally waive its immunity.there is a fundamental difference between a state expressing unequivocally that it waives its immunity and congress expressing unequivocally its intention that if the state takes certain action it shall be deemed to have that immunity.coll.sav.bank,at.at.in the latter situation,the most that can be said with certainty is that the state has been put on notice that congress intends to subject it to suits brought by individuals.id.
despite the majority assertion to the contrary,college savings bank confirms that dole clear statement requirement is only half of the waiver equation.see garcia health sci.ctr.of brooklyn,cir concluding that a clear expression of congress intent alone is not sufficient to find that the state actually waived its sovereign immunity by accepting federal funds.the whole point of requiring a clear declaration by the state of its waiver is to be certain that the state in fact consents to suit.coll.sav.bank,at.at emphasis in original.whether congress clearly required that a state waive its immunity before accepting federal funds the first inquiry is not the same thing,however,as whether the state clearly declared its knowing waiver the second inquiry.douglas cal.dep t of youth,dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc emphasis in original.the mere receipt of federal funds can not establish that a state has consented to suit in federal court.atascadero,at.
for a state to evince its clear declaration of intent to waive sovereign immunity,it must possess actual knowledge of the existence of the right or privilege,full understanding of its meaning,and clear comprehension of the consequences of the waiver.newell,at citations and quotations omitted emphasis in original.in all but the rarest of circumstances,acceptance of federal funds offered in accordance with the clear statement rule will meet this test.this case represents an exception to the general rule.
the majority ignores the fact that until the,it was assumed that congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity in legislation enacted pursuant to its article i enumerated powers.the supreme court held otherwise in seminole tribe florida,d,while reaffirming that abrogation remained permissible through a proper exercise of power under of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.in the statutes here at,and was enacted under the commerce clause.since,however,all three statutes enhance the rights of the disabled,and all three express a clear congressional intent to abridge the states eleventh amendment immunity,federal courts routinely permitted suits by private individuals to proceed against the states.as late as,while applying the supreme court narrow construction of the abrogation authority this court still held that the ada validly abrogated state sovereign immunity.coolbaugh louisiana,cir,cert.denied,d overruled by reickenbacker foster,cir 
surely louisiana should not be penalized for construing the counterpart abrogation language in and as this court subsequently did in coolbaugh.instead,the state acted quite rationally in assuming between and that it had no sovereign immunity to waive when it accepted federal education funds under conditions specified by and idea.the state voluntarily accepted federal funds,but its acceptance was not a knowing waiver of immunity.as the second circuit put it,since the proscriptions of title ii of the ada and are virtually identical,a state accepting federal funds could not have understood that in doing so it was actually abandoning its sovereign immunity from private damage suits,since by all reasonable appearances state sovereign immunity had already been lost.garcia,at citations omitted 
the majority offers two principal arguments against this result.first,the majority conflates abrogation and waiver when positing that louisiana did have eleventh amendment immunity to waive by accepting the clearly conditioned federal funds.see majority,at.emphasis in original.on the contrary,coolbaugh confirmed,until garrett and reickenbacker overruled it,that congress had validly exercised its abrogation authority,rendering louisiana amenable to suit notwithstanding the eleventh amendment.the majority suggestion that congress can abrogate sovereign immunity,but still permit the states to retain their eleventh amendment immunity,misapprehends the import of abrogation 
still,congress may,in its discretion,choose to trigger enforcement of any federal statute,even after it has abrogated sovereign immunity,on the receipt of federal funds.in response,a state,by refusing federal funds,may reject the terms of the contract and potentially avoid statutory liability to private individuals.but whether it can avoid liability based upon a theory is a different question from whether it retained eleventh amendment sovereign immunity thus,the relevant eleventh amendment inquiry remains whether louisiana reasonably believed,based on objective evidence,that the rehabilitation act and the idea validly abrogated its sovereign whether it could have chosen to reject the federal funds anyway.
second,the majority contends that requiring the state to make a clear declaration problematically engraft s a element onto an otherwise objective spending clause waiver inquiry.see majority op.at.unfortunately,the majority misunderstands the nature of the clear declaration requirement,a requirement consonant with the supreme court longstanding objective approach to waiver.the supreme court uniformly applies a totality of the circumstances test to waiver questions involving fundamental constitutional rights.fare michael,d.only if the totality of the circumstances reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the rights have been waived.see burbine,at.at.hence,the supreme court considers a variety of objective factors,not subjective intent,to determine whether a constitutional right has validly been waived.fare,at.at see also united states sonderup,cir relying on the objective indicia to determine whether a voluntary,knowing and intelligent waiver was made.college savings bank clear declaration requirement reiterates the supreme court waiver test in the eleventh amendment context,and so would 
given this court ruling in coolbaugh that the state had no immunity to waive,followed by an unsuccessful en banc poll and the supreme court denial of certiorari in that case,it is inconceivable that louisiana somehow,based on the straightforward objective facts,knowingly chose to waive a right that was when it acted.in a sense,the state of louisiana is being forced,by today majority,to bear the burden of this court mistake of law in coolbaugh.consider this analogy the police instruct a criminal defendant,for his own good,to sign a waiver of counsel form,while telling him that the waiver is meaningless,because you have no counsel rights to waive.who would argue that the waiver is knowing,especially if the police showed him a court decision confirming this view that the dupe is an individual defendant rather than the state does not,per college savings,make this a different case,nor does the fact that the waiver falls under the spending clause rather than some other type of enactment.the majority opinion violates college savings bank.
in this rare instance,louisiana could not have knowingly waived its sovereign immunity in the relevant time period before the garrett decision.the majority approach strangely counsels states to disregard governing caselaw when supreme court doctrine is evolving.such an argument makes no more sense in this unusual context than it would in any other.
ii.abrogation 
pace alternatively argues,and this dissent must determine,whether congress abrogated louisiana sovereign immunity with respect to claims brought under title ii,and the idea.pace would extend the court recent decision in tennessee lane,d,which held that title ii of the ada validly abrogates state sovereign immunity insofar as it implicates the physical accessibility of the fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts.the majority here,having found a waiver of the state immunity,declares it unnecessary to opine on abrogation.the majority goes on,however,to observe that,in lane,the supreme court refused to consider whether title ii abrogates other rights,including those considered to be fundamental under the constitution.see majority op.at,citing.at.the majority also comments that the court has never before recognized access to public education or freedom from disability discrimination in education as fundamental rights,citing plyler doe,d city of cleburne cleburne living,d.
i agree with the majority dicta that suggests lane is currently of limited application.moreover,because lane was written very narrowly,i conclude that this court decision in reickenbacker remains valid in holding that ada title ii,apart from the lane scenario,does not validly abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity.see reickenbacker,at.the fate of abrogation was also sealed in reickenbacker based on the court conclusion that title ii and impose virtually identical obligations.id.for the reasons stated in reickenbacker and in the panel opinion,i would hold that congress could not constitutionally abrogate state sovereign immunity in or the similarly structured idea statute pursuant to of the fourteenth amendment.the remedies imposed by those laws far exceed those imposed by the constitution,and i can not conclude that they are congruent and proportional to the legislative findings of unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled by the states.reickenbacker,at.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,i conclude that during a narrow period of time,based on uncertainty in the supreme court evolving eleventh amendment doctrine,the state of louisiana did not knowingly waive its eleventh amendment sovereign immunity when it accepted federal funds under a.
