private and intervenor united states collectively plaintiffs appeal the district court approval of the location proposed by madison county school district mcsd or the district for a new high school in that district.madison county was ordered to desegregate its de jure dual school system in.it has since entered into a number of consent decrees,including one earlier this year.this most recent consent decree has been approved by all parties and by the district court and resolves all disputed issues between the,significantly,student only that of the location of the new high school.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in approving the district construction plan for the new high school,insisting that it would not meet the district obligation,as a former de jure segregated district,to further desegregation.we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the district proposed site satisfies the obligations imposed by law,including all applicable consent decree provisions.
facts and proceedings 
the district is one of the many school districts in mississippi that were ordered to dismantle their de jure dual school systems since then,the district has been the subject of a number of other desegregation orders and consent decrees.among other things,the district is required to make all decisions regarding the construction of school facilities in such a way as to further desegregation.
the district is and surrounds the county seat of canton,which is not a part of the district.the desegregation order divided the district into three zones zone i is a rural,sparsely populated area located in the northeast part of the county zone ii,in which of the district students reside,is in the southern part of the district and includes the cities of ridgeland and madison and zone iii,like zone i,is a rural,sparsely populated area but is located in the western part of the county and includes the town of flora.zone i has its own high school velma jackson,and none of the parties have suggested that it be considered or included in plans regarding the new high school.zones ii and iii are presently served by a single high school,madison central high school madison central.
the instant dispute is an outgrowth of the district determined need to construct new schools,specifically a new high school,because of the tremendous population growth,largely white,over the last ten years.the district enrollment was predominately black until the late,but since that time the student population has grown dramatically and become increasingly white as a result of the population boom in the vicinity of the predominately white communities of madison and ridgeland.this is evidenced by the fact that enrollment in these areas surged by between the and school years.this rapid growth led to the overcrowding of madison central it had a projected capacity of students,but its enrollment had reached students by april.population growth around the cities of madison and ridgeland is predicted to continue for the foreseeable future in contrast,the rural areas of the district have experienced,and likely will continue to experience,little or no growth.thus,the overcrowding problem at madison central will be exacerbated in the near future while velma jackson high school in zone i will remain unaffected.
to remedy this situation and address a number of concomitant problems,the district proposed to construct several new schools and renovate other existing facilities,subject to the passage of a bond issue for those purposes.in may of,following preclearance by the united states attorney general,county voters approved,by the requisite supermajority,a million bond issue for the construction and renovation of school facilities.the bond issue was validated by the chancery court of madison county in september of.the bond proposal,as approved by the voters,included a number of details,specifying in relevant part that the new high school would be located in ridgeland,a predominately white area ridgeland site.this new high school ridgeland high or the new high school would have an initial capacity of students and a capacity of,and would be built on land to be purchased by the district.like madison central,the new high school would serve students from zones ii and iii,and its initial enrollment would be taken from among those students currently attending the overcrowded madison central.
after passage and certification of the bond issue,the district filed a motion in district court to modify the existing desegregation plan,seeking approval to construct five new schools one high school,two middle schools,and two elementary schools,renovate existing schools,and make related student reassignments.plaintiffs opposed mcsd plan,claiming that it violated the desegregation order,a number of consent judgments and federal law,because,inter alia,it failed to further desegregation and imposed travel burdens inequitably between black and white students.the parties subsequently entered into a consent decree the consent decree which the district court approved,that settled their disagreement on all points of difference except the location of the new high school.among other things,the consent decree resolved the racially inequitable transportation burdens borne by the black students of the district and generally alleviated the excessive transportation burdens borne by other students,both black and white.
plaintiffs continued to advocate an alternative,more centrally located site for the new high school,on a parcel of land already owned by the district at the intersection of highways and hwy.site.plaintiffs contend that locating the new high school on their preferred site would have reduced the travel burdens on a number of students and ensured that the new school would be less predominately white.
the district court,after a hearing,entered its memorandum opinion and order granting the district motion and approving the plan.it ruled that the proposed ridgeland site will not negatively affect desegregation in the district,now or in the future.despite finding mcsd construction plan in some respects,inexplicable,and and recognizing that c onstructing a high school half the size of the existing madison central which leaves little actual growing room at madison central does not seem particularly prudent,the district court reluctantly approved mcsd construction plan because it did not find ultimately that the district construction renovation plan either negatively affects desegregation in the district,or that there exists at this time a reasonable prospect for further desegregation.plaintiffs appealed and filed a motion to stay the order,which was granted by the district court.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision approving mcsd proposed location of the new high school for clear error we review the district court findings of fact under that same standard under the clearly erroneous standard,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.we review errors of law de novo 
obligation of the district to further desegregation 
the original desegregation order for madison county,entered in pursuant to our decision in hinds county required that the county be divided into the three attendance zones described above,transportation of students be performed on a and basis,and a ll school construction,school consolidation,and site selection including the location of temporary classrooms in this system shall be done in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school structure once this desegregation plan is implemented.in considering proposals for the construction or renovation of schools in a system still subject to a desegregation order,w e can not tolerate resegregation of a former dual school system,and the school board of such a system must demonstrate t
