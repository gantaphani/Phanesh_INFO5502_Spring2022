in nlrb yeshiva university,d,the supreme court first determined that faculty at colleges and universities may be managerial employees exempt from the protection of the national labor relations act nlra or the act,et.since yeshiva,the battle lines over organizing unions among faculty have been drawn with predictable arguments.college and university administrations typically argue that their faculties involvement in academic affairs is extensive and managerial.unions argue it is limited and circumscribed.and so it is here.petitioner point park university the university or point park argues that the act bars its faculty from organizing a bargaining unit because they are managers.the union argues they are not.yeshiva and our explanation of its application in college nlrb,provide the national labor relations board nlrb or the board guidance how to resolve this type of dispute.because neither the regional director nor the board followed that guidance and thus failed to adequately explain why the faculty role at the university is not managerial,we grant the university petition for review,deny without prejudice the board for enforcement,and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion so that the board can provide such an explanation or reconsider its conclusion.
point park university,located in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,has students,faculty,and employees.founded in as point park college,it was chartered as a university in and renamed to reflect its new status.students at the university pursue bachelors degrees in fifty majors and seven masters degrees through four schools arts and sciences,business,the conservatory of performing arts,and the adult and professional studies program.point park authority structure consists of a board of trustees,a president who also serves as a member of that board,a vice president of academic affairs who also serves as dean of the faculty,an associate vice president of academic affairs,deans of the four schools,department chairs,program directors,and the faculty.
in,the newspaper guild of workers of america,local,the union filed a petition with the board seeking to represent a bargaining unit of all faculty at point park.the university contested the petition,arguing that all its faculty members were managerial employees and that some of the faculty were supervisors both barred by the act from organizing a union.the regional director of region six of the nlrb convened nineteen days of hearings between november,and january,to consider the union petition.the regional director concluded that the faculty were eligible for union representation and that the university had failed to prove,under yeshiva,that the faculty exercise such plenary,absolute or effective authority or control to warrant their exclusion from the protection of the act as managerial employees.the regional director also found that some faculty members were supervisors and thus barred by the act from joining a union,while others were not 
the university filed with the board a timely request for review of the regional director decision,see,arguing that the decision departed from established board precedent and was clearly erroneous with respect to a number of facts not at issue here.the board denied point park request for review.after an election,the union was certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative.the university refused to recognize or bargain with the union,and the union filed an unfair labor practice charge in response.the board general counsel issued a complaint against the university,alleging that it had violated sections a and of the act,a,by fail ing and refus ing to recognize and bargain with the union.in defense of its conduct,point park challenged the board decision to certify the union and asked the board to reopen the record to consider additional,newly discovered evidence.the board granted the general counsel motion for summary judgment,ordered point park to bargain with the union,and refused to reopen the record.
point park filed a timely petition for review with this court,and the board filed a for enforcement of the board order.point park petition brings the entire nlrb the regional director underlying decision to certify the faculty as a bargaining this court for review,at citing boire greyhound,d.
the gravamen of point park petition is that the board erred in determining that the university faculty are not managerial employees under the act and are thus entitled to form a union.we conclude that we are unable to review adequately the board decision because the regional director failed to follow our guidance in that he explain which factors he found significant and which less so,and why in determining,pursuant to yeshiva,that point park faculty were not managerial employees.see at.
the supreme court set off a seismic shift in the law of labor relations in american higher education when it held in yeshiva that,in some circumstances,faculty members,who for many years the board had thought were protected by the national labor relations act,might instead be barred by the act from organizing a union the proper analysis,the court held,turns on the type of control faculty exercise over academic affairs at an institution.a brief explanation of the history of the sometimes expanding,sometimes contracting protections of the act by congress and the supreme court will help explain why the correct application of yeshiva analysis is so important to the proper resolution of this case.
as enacted in,the national labor relations act broadly authorized any employee,excluding agricultural laborers and domestic servants,to organize a union.see national labor relations act of,stat.the supreme court held that under this expansive language even supervisors enjoyed the protection of the act.packard motor car nlrb.we see no basis in this act whatever for holding that foremen are forbidden the protection of the act when they take collective action to protect their collective interests.in quick response to the supreme court,congress removed supervisors from the act protection,see labor management relations act of,ch,stat,codified as amended at the term employee shall not include any individual employed as a supervisor,but also explicitly included professional employees within the act reach,see id.codified as amended at,b codified as amended at b authorizing professional employees to unionize where a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit.from the time the board first asserted jurisdiction over a university faculty in until the supreme court decided yeshiva in,the board considered faculty members at institutions of higher learning professional employees whose union activities were protected by the act.see post ctr.of long island.
in,the supreme court recognized another exception to the act when it held in nlrb bell aerospace that congress intended to exclude from the protections of the act all employees properly classified as managerial,d.although the act did not contain an express statutory exclusion for management employees like what congress had provided for supervisors,the court reasoned that they were regarded as so clearly outside the act by the congress that first created the act that no specific exclusionary provision was thought necessary.id.at.managerial employees,who can not form or join a union,were those who formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer.id.at.quotation marks omitted.the key inquiry,the court later explained,was whether employees were aligned with management.yeshiva,at.citing bell aerospace,at.
since bell aerospace,the board determinations in cases involving union petitions to organize have often turned on the distinction between professional employees,who may unionize,and managerial employees,who may not making that distinction requires the board to conduct a inquiry into the specific responsibilities of employees.see salinas newspapers,t he supreme court and the board,in determining managerial status,weigh the facts elicited to determine whether or not the persons at issue are involved in the formulation,determination and effectuation of management policies quoting simplex,curtis noll,whether or not a person is managerial is to be determined on a basis after close examination of the duties performed by the person in question while occupying a position alleged to be managerial.
even after bell aerospace,the board continued to find that faculty at colleges and universities were professional,not managerial,employees.see,goddard college,the discretion exercised by core faculty members,both individually and collectively,regarding such matters as student recruitment and admissions,completion of degree requirements,and curriculum,clearly is indicative of professional,rather than managerial status ne,the existence of shared authority may well indicate that faculty members are professionals,but it does not necessarily make them managerial.
as long as faculty were understood to be professional employees,which they clearly are,and not also managerial employees under bell aerospace,the task of the board was relatively straightforward.see id.that all changed with yeshiva,when the supreme court applied the definition of managerial employee in bell aerospace to faculty at a college or university and held for the first time that some faculty members,even though they are professional employees,may also be managerial employees,barred by the act from union activities.at.
yeshiva imposed significant demands upon the board in determining whether faculty members are managerial employees,holding that this mixed question of fact and law can not be determined on the basis of conclusory rationales rather than examination of the facts of each case.id.in other words,context is everything.every academic institution is different,and in determining whether a particular institution faculty are managerial employees excluded from the act or professional employees included in the act,the board must perform an exacting analysis of the particular institution and faculty at issue.that analysis must look beyond descriptions of the role of faculty or the administration of a university.in yeshiva,the court looked repeatedly to the actual role of the faculty in the academic affairs of the university the key inquiry is how a faculty is structured and operates.id.at.emphasis added.the board task under yeshiva is made more difficult by the fact,frankly acknowledged by the court in yeshiva,that the act is not easily applied to labor relations in the university setting 
the act was intended to accommodate the type of relations that prevail in the pyramidal hierarchies of private industry.in contrast,authority in the typical mature private university is divided between a central administration and one or more collegial bodies although faculties have been subject to external control in the united states since colonial times,traditions of collegiality continue to play a significant role at many universities,including yeshiva.for these reasons,the board has recognized that principles developed for use in the industrial setting can not be imposed blindly on the academic world.
id.at.internal citations,quotation marks,and footnote omitted.thus,the board must determine whether the faculty in question so controls the academic affairs of the school that their interests are aligned with those of the university or whether they occupy a role more like that of the professional employee in the pyramidal hierarchies of private industries.see id.that is by its very nature a inquiry.
the court also noted that the core professional activities of faculty that are common at most colleges and universities determin ing the content of their own courses,evaluat ing their own students,and supervis ing their own research are not enough,by themselves,to remove faculty from the protection of the act.id.at.emphasis added.the court determined,however,that the faculty at yeshiva university were involved in activities far beyond the core professional activities of a typical that fit the bell aerospace definition of managerial employees.as the court explained 
the controlling consideration in this case is that the faculty of yeshiva university exercise authority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial.their authority in academic matters is absolute.they decide what courses will be offered,when they will be scheduled,and to whom they will be taught.they debate and determine teaching methods,grading policies,and matriculation standards.they effectively decide which students will be admitted,retained,and graduated.on occasion their views have determined the size of the student body,the tuition to be charged,and the location of a school.
id.at.this is the heart of the court decision in yeshiva.the faculty authority in the academic matters yeshiva become the template for board analysis of whether faculty are managerial employees.specifically,the board must consider the degree of faculty control over academic matters such as curriculum,course schedules,teaching methods,grading policies,matriculation standards,admission standards,size of the student body,tuition to be charged,and location of the school.see,duquesne,loretto heights college.
like point park university,college sought review of a board decision that its faculty were not managerial employees and were thus entitled under the act to organize a union.see,at.the college had argued to the regional director and the board that its faculty were indistinguishable from faculty the board had held to be managerial employees in previous cases.in ruling against the college,neither the regional director nor the board discussed these precedents.
we found such silence insufficient and remanded the case for the board to provide a more fulsome explanation of its decision.although an agency is by no means required to distinguish every precedent cited to it by an aggrieved party,id.at,we held that where a party makes a significant showing that analogous cases have been decided differently,the agency must do more than simply ignore that argument,id.at.we then stressed the need for a clear explanation by the board when applying yeshiva test 
the of factors on which yeshiva launched the board and higher education can lead to predictability and intelligibility only to the extent the board explains,in applying the test to varied fact situations,which factors are significant and which less so,and why in the absence of an explanation,the totality of the circumstances can become simply a cloak for agency worse the board may have an adequate explanation for the result it reached but we can not assume that such an explanation exists until we see it.
id.citation omitted and emphasis added.that is where we find fault with the board analysis here.
because congress has delegated to the board responsibility for determining the appropriate bargaining unit,see b,we accord deference to the board exercise of its authority,at.we can not be deferential,however,where the board fails to adequately explain its reasoning.id.at.the supreme court has held that when the board so exercises the discretion given to it by congress,it must disclose the basis of its order and give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which congress has empowered it.nlrb metro.life ins,d citation omitted.we are,however,indulgent toward administrative action to the extent of affirming an order where the agency path can be discerned even if the opinion leaves much to be desired.wait radio fcc,citation omitted see also casino airlines,ntsb.without a clear presentation of the board reasoning,it is not possible for us to perform our assigned reviewing function and to discern the path taken by the board in reaching its decision.see metro.life ins,at.
nor can our court fill in critical gaps in the board reasoning.we can only look to the board stated rationale.we can not sustain its action on some other basis the board did not mention.see sec chenery.it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.this is not a new concer
