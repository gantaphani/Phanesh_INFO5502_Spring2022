we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment on plaintiffs federal law claims,reverse in part the district court order granting summary judgment on plaintiffs state law claims,vacate the district court order addressing costs,and remand for further proceedings.
this appeal implicates overlapping federal statutes addressing discrimination on the basis of disability.specifically,we address the requirement that all children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education fape,and the distinct but overlapping features of fape set forth under the different statutory schemes.the related statutory schemes at issue here are the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,section of the rehabilitation act of section,and title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.the parties entered into a settlement agreement that narrowed the scope of plaintiffs claims so only claims under the rehabilitation act and the ada are at issue,but we review all three statutes to clarify the different definitions and standards for fape that must be applied on remand.we also discuss plaintiffs state law tort claims.
facts and procedural background 
attended school in the paradise valley unified school district at various times between and september of.from august,through january,attended seventh grade at vista verde middle school in the uniquely gifted program for students with high iqs and one or more learning or behavioral disabilities.during that time,periodically demonstrated aggressive,disruptive,and noncompliant behavior.in november of,individualized education plan iep team,which included herself and her parents,adopted an iep setting forth various educational services that would be provided to unfortunately,in december of,behavior began to deteriorate.by january of,she refused to go to class,destroyed school property,threatened to harm herself,wrote graffiti on a bathroom wall,and was uncooperative with a school resource officer,eventually physically striking that officer.was suspended from vista verde following the last incident.
in february,iep team met and adopted an addendum to iep.pursuant to the addendum,was to be transferred to the roadrunner school,a school primarily designed for children with emotional disturbances,where she was to participate in an assortment of counseling,behavior management,and special education programs.the iep addendum indicates that parents visited roadrunner and agreed that it would be an appropriate placement for,and that parents were informed that would not be restrained at roadrunner unless she became a danger to herself or others.
demonstrated behavioral issues on her second day at roadrunner.she resisted entering the school that day and had to be physically escorted onto the premises by staff members and led to the intervention room.during that incident,kicked a paraprofessional in the face.officer lori welsh,a city police officer who worked as security at the school,was summoned and she arrested for aggravated assault and criminal damage.officer welsh placed in handcuffs and detained her until her mother arrived to pick her up.
later,on march,officer welsh was again summoned by one of teachers to escort to the intervention room.officer welsh attempted to handcuff for allegedly poking her in the eye,but resisted and eventually scratched officer welsh in the face and neck.officer welsh placed in an arm bar,applied handcuffs,and called for backup.was eventually arrested for aggravated assault,transported to the police precinct for booking,and placed in a juvenile detention room where she kicked the table and chair.after being transported to the juvenile court center,was released to her parents.the charges stemming from both incidents were later dismissed,and returned to the roadrunner school.she was eventually moved to the howard gray school,a private psychiatric school,at district expense.
on june,and her parents filed an administrative due process complaint with the arizona department of education alleging that was denied a fape by the school district and its named representatives and employees the school district defendants.the administrative complaint sought remedies available under the idea.plaintiffs also filed the present action in arizona state court against the school district defendants,the city of phoenix,and officer welsh.defendants later removed the action to the united states district court for the district of arizona.
in their first amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged a denial of fape under the procedural provisions of the idea,title ii of the ada,and section of the rehabilitation act,as well as various state common law tort claims against the school district defendants.plaintiffs principal claims relate to the school district alleged failure to provide adequate accommodations,including a functional behavior assessment fba,a behavior intervention plan bip,and a aide,and to the school district decision to change placement from vista verde to the roadrunner school.plaintiffs alleged that having further accommodations would have allowed to continue attending vista verde.
in april of,plaintiffs and the school district defendants entered into a settlement agreement releasing plaintiffs idea claims.among other things,the settlement released the school district defendants of all liability for administrative remedies available under the idea relating to the failure to provide with a fape under the terms of that act the settlement agreement expressly reserved plaintiffs ability to proceed on their other federal claims pending in district court.on april,the district court also approved a settlement agreement dismissing all claims against the city of phoenix and officer welsh.
in may of,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school district defendants on all remaining claims,dismissing plaintiffs claims under section of the rehabilitation act and title ii of the ada,as well as plaintiffs state tort law claims.after the district court entered its final judgment,the school district submitted a bill of costs to the clerk of court and plaintiffs filed objections thereto.the clerk issued a judgment on taxation of costs in favor of the school district,but plaintiffs later filed a motion seeking review of that judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d and sanctions for defendants allegedly improper reimbursement request.the district court agreed with plaintiffs and vacated the clerk assessment of costs.plaintiffs timely appealed the order granting summary judgment and defendants timely the order vacating costs.

discussion 
in the district court,the parties briefing conflated the requirements for claims made under the idea,the ada,and section of the rehabilitation act.because remand is necessary,we clarify the relevant standards for disability discrimination claims by disabled children based on access to educational services.we also briefly address plaintiffs state law claims.the parties dispute concerning costs is mooted by the need to remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
federal legislation addressing special education for disabled children.
there are three primary and overlapping pieces of federal legislation applicable to plaintiffs discrimination claims the idea,section of the rehabilitation act,and title ii of the ada.
congress enacted the idea to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education or fape that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,employment,and independent living.mark lemahieu,cir quoting d a.the idea focuses on making a fape available to disabled students through development of individualized education programs ieps defining fape in part as special education and related services that are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section d.states receiving federal financial assistance under the idea must have in place policies and procedures to properly develop ieps for qualifying children.id.the idea creates a cause of action for children and parents to pursue injunctive or other prospective relief through a civil action following an administrative due process hearing in order to compel compliance with the act and proper implementation or modification of the child iep.see i c iii lemahieu,at.
section of the rehabilitation act is broader than the idea it is concerned with discrimination in the provision of state services to all individuals with disabilities.lemahieu,at.it provides that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the united states shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.like the idea,section applies to public schools that receive federal financial assistance.b b see also lemahieu,at.section provisions are not expressly affirmative in nature,but the rehabilitation act empowers federal agencies to devise regulations aimed at preventing prohibited discrimination.see lemahieu,at.
the regulations adopted pursuant to section require qualifying public schools to provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person.a lemahieu,at fape is defined differently for purposes of section than it is for the idea.under those section regulations,fape requires regular or special education and related aids and services that i are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and ii are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of,and.b emphasis added.section regulations gauge the adequacy of services provided to disabled individuals by comparing them to the level of services provided to individuals who are not disabled.one method of ensuring that the educational aids and services are designed to meet individual education needs as required under b i is to implement an iep developed in accordance with the idea,b,but a showing that fape was denied under the idea does not necessarily establish a denial of fape under section.lemahieu,at plaintiffs who allege a violation of the section fape requirement may not obtain damages simply by proving that the idea fape requirements were not met.
title ii of the ada was modeled after section of the rehabilitation act.duvall county of kitsap,cir.it provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.although title ii is different from section in several respects,see ex rel.bright tustin unified sch,cir for purposes of this appeal the elements of a valid title ii claim do not differ in any material sense from those of a valid section claim and the two may be addressed together.
we have held that contains an implied private right of action for damages to enforce its provisions.lemahieu,at.a plaintiff bringing suit under section or title ii of the ada must show she is a qualified individual with a disability she was denied a reasonable accommodation that she needs in order to enjoy meaningful access to the benefits of public services and the program providing the benefit receives federal financial assistance.mark hamamoto,cir.a plaintiff may satisfy prong two by showing that the federally funded program denied her services that she needed to enjoy meaningful access to the benefits of a public education and that were available as reasonable accommodations.id.at.a plaintiff can also satisfy prong two by showing that the program denied her meaningful access to public education through another means,such as by violating a regulation that implements section prohibitions.lemahieu,at see alexander choate,d interpreting section to requir e that an otherwise qualified handicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers.
finally,to prevail on a claim for damages under section and title ii,plaintiffs must prove a mens rea of intentional discrimination and that standard may be met by showing deliberate indifference,not only by showing discriminatory animus.lemahieu,at quoting duvall,at.under our case law,d eliberate indifference requires both knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely,and a failure to act upon that likelihood.duvall,at.the plaintiff establishes the requisite knowledge or notice on behalf of the defendant when she shows that she alerted the public entity to her need for accommodation or where the need for accommodation is obvious,or required by statute or regulation.id.
thus,a public entity can be liable for damages under if it intentionally or with deliberate indifference fails to provide meaningful access or reasonable accommodation to disabled persons.lemahieu,at.
ii.the district court improperly dismissed meaningful access and reasonable accommodation arguments.
meaningful access 
we have held that a plaintiff may establish denial of meaningful access under section and title ii by showing there was a violation of one of the regulations implementing section,if such violation denied the plaintiff meaningful access to a public benefit.mark hamamoto,cir.to support such a cause of action,the regulation must be an implementing regulation within the meaning of alexander sandoval,d.see mark lemahieu,cir according to sandoval,regulations can only be enforced through the private right of action contained in a statute when they authoritatively construe the statute regulations that go beyond a construction of the statute prohibitions do not fall within the implied private right of action,even if valid.quoting sandoval,at.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that defendants denied meaningful access to educational benefits by violating two of section regulations b and a.section requires a school district to provide regular or special education and related aids and services that i are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and ii are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of regulations,including among others.b emphasis added.plaintiffs claim that placement at roadrunner denied her meaningful access because certain educational opportunities such as art,music,and gifted classes were not available at roadrunner,and because she was inappropriately placed in the intervention room for a total of approximately sixty hours.they also claim that the school district defendants denied meaningful access to the curriculum at both vista verde and roadrunner because they failed to provide her appropriate behavioral supports and services at the two schools,as reflected in her allegedly deficient ieps.therefore,plaintiffs argue,educational opportunities at vista verde and roadrunner were not as adequate as those provided to her peers at vista verde.b i.
section mandates that a disabled student be placed in the least restrictive regular educational environment,and requires that school districts comply with various evaluative procedures and justify any changes in placement.a.plaintiffs argue that the school district transferred her to roadrunner school without complying with procedural requirements,and that this transfer prevented her from accessing certain educational opportunities.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs meaningful access argument.in doing so,it appeared to reason that parents consent to placement at roadrunner waived the claim.the district court also ruled that was not qualified to participate in the art,music,and gifted education classes of which she claimed to be deprived,because she had repeatedly refused to do so at vista verde.finally,the court noted that parents participated in the iep team meetings where they had an opportunity to raise concerns that roadrunner behavioral policies were inappropriate for students diagnosed with autism.
the district court reliance on parents consent was misplaced.we have previously held that claims challenging the placement of a disabled child are not barred simply because the parents of the child consent,or fail to object,to such placement.ex rel.fresno unified sch,cir.the conclusion in arose from an idea claim rather than claims under section or title ii,but we are persuaded that a claim that meaningful access has been improperly denied within the meaning of these latter statutes is not precluded or waived based on a parent consent to an iep,at least where the issue is one that requires specialized expertise a parent can not be expected to have.id.providing that parents affirmative insistence on an intervention,such as mainstreaming,may be a relevant consideration in meaningful access analysis.given the complex presentation of behavioral challenges,the question whether roadrunner was an appropriate placement for required specialized expertise.because the district court relied on parents consent to placement at roadrunner in dismissing plaintiffs meaningful access claim without evaluating whether educational needs were met as adequately as those of her peers,its decision must be reversed and remanded.
that said,on remand the district court will need to evaluate in the first instance whether plaintiffs have a valid claim under these or other section regulations.see lemahieu,at.it is unclear from the appellate record exactly which regulations plaintiffs allege were violated by defendants and which violations allegedly prevented from meaningfully accessing public education.thus,on remand,the district court should evaluate which claims for violation of section regulations plaintiffs preserved whether those regulations fall within the scope of the prohibition contained in itself,lemahieu,at citing sandoval,at whether the school district violated those regulations and whether the school district violation of those regulations prevented from accessing her public education,hamamoto,at.
reasonable accommodation 
a plaintiff may establish prohibited discrimination under section and title ii by showing that a public entity denied her a reasonable accommodation necessary to achieve meaningful access to her education.to succeed on such a claim,a plaintiff must show that the defendant failed to make reasonable modifications that would accommodate the plaintiff disability without fundamentally altering the nature of the program or activity,americans with disabilities practice and compliance manual wong regents of the of,cir,and that the accommodation would have enabled her to meet the program essential eligibility requirements.ex rel.haw.dep t of,cir.
relying on the report and deposition testimony of their behavioral psychologist expert,jolenea ferro,bcba d,plaintiffs argued below that needed further behavioral services,including a full time behavioral aide,to meaningfully access her education.they also assert that the school district inquiry into these accommodations would have demonstrated that they were necessary,reasonable,and available and that they would have allowed to continue her education at vista verde rather than be transferred to roadrunner.
the district court dismissed this claim,noting that o n the evidence presented,it can not be assumed that if had been provided a functional behavior assessment,a behavior intervention plan,and a behavioral aide,she would have had fewer behavior problems and would not have posed a danger to herself and others.but this conclusion directly contradicts the conclusions of ferro,whose report and testimony plaintiffs submitted in support of their reasonable accommodation claim.ferro stated that outbursts at vista verde demonstrate d that ag needed the accommodations of an fba and a bip to have meaningful access to her education.ferro opinions were corroborated by evidence that classroom teacher believed that needed more behavioral support and that the teacher sought assistance to better meet needs.this evidence creates an issue of material fact as to whether accommodations,such as a personal behavioral aide,would have helped remain at vista verde.moreover,defendants did not dispute in the district court or on appeal that a aide could have been available.
the district court also observed that parents never requested some of the services she later argued the school district should have provided.we agree with this observation,but it overlooks that parents did not have the expertise nor the legal duty to determine what accommodations might allow to remain in her regular educational environment.see americans with disabilities practice and compliance manual a plaintiff failure to expressly request an accommodation is not fatal to a claim where the defendant otherwise had knowledge of an individual disability and needs but took no action.duvall,at section create s a duty to gather sufficient information from the disabled individual and qualified experts as needed to determine what accommodations are necessary.
as a consequence,we conclude that a triable factual dispute exists as to whether the services plaintiffs fault the school district for failing to provide were actually reasonable,necessary,and available accommodations for thus,summary judgment on this issue was improper.see.a 
deliberate indifference 
where,as here,the plaintiff seeks damages under section and the ada,she must show the defendant had notice of her need for an accommodation and fail ed to act.duvall,at.she can establish notice by showing that she alerted the public entity to her need for accommodation or that the need for accommodation was obvious,or required by statute or regulation.id.when an entity is on notice of the need for accommodation,it is required to undertake a investigation to determine what constitutes a reasonable accommodation.id.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs damages claims after concluding from ferro deposition testimony that plaintiffs did not show the school district was on notice of the need for accommodations.specifically,the district court relied on ferro testimony that some of the services that plaintiffs claim were necessary were not legally required by federal or state statute.
reliance on this testimony was error for three reasons.first,ferro was not in a position to provide an expert legal opinion.see,hangarter provident life accident ins,cir a n expert witness can not give an opinion as to her legal conclusion,an opinion on an ultimate issue of law.similarly,instructing the jury as to the applicable law is the distinct and exclusive province of the court.internal citations omitted.second,though the di
