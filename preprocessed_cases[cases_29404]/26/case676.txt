background 
by all accounts kathleen lifton had been an exemplary teacher during her stint as a kindergarten teacher at norwood park.in,however,things changed.in june of that year,she decided that the kindergarten program at norwood park could use some adjustments,and she brought her suggestions to the attention of the school principal,william meuer.lifton proposed modifying the school schedule so that students would have staggered dismissal times.she also proposed rearranging her teaching schedule to focus on academic subjects in the morning,when she believed students were better able to concentrate.she wanted to teach from to without a break,working through lunch with half the kindergartners while the other half ate lunch with a teacher aide.the remainder of the kindergartners school day would be staffed by the teacher aide and parent volunteers.meuer responded that they could discuss her proposal in the future but that it was too late to change the program for the upcoming school year with only two months notice.
in addition to her teaching duties,lifton was a teacher representative on norwood park local school council lsc,a group comprised of parents,teachers,administrators,and community members charged with certain planning and oversight responsibilities at the school,in addition to authority over the spending of certain discretionary funds.on june,shortly after talking to meuer about her proposal for restructuring the kindergarten program,lifton sent a flyer home to parents inviting them to an upcoming lsc meeting on june.the flyer read,in pertinent part it not working but we can fix it be part of history in the making.take a sneak peak sic at next year kindergarten program regretfully babysitting will not be provided.
this flyer troubled meuer for two reasons.first,and most importantly,he had just told lifton that it was too late to change the kindergarten program with only two months notice,yet she decided to take her plan to parents anyway.his second objection concerned lifton cancellation of babysitting service,which was customarily provided for lsc and pta meetings at the school.lifton had told meuer in early june that she did not want her classroom used for babysitting because it had been trashed during a recent pta meeting meuer said he would look into it and offered to relocate the service.but lifton had no business cancelling the babysitting service.
lifton unauthorized flyer about the lsc meeting was followed by an even more unusual communication she sent to parents two weeks later.on june lifton sent a letter to parents with the following message yesterday,i cried and slept and slept and cried,unmotivated to complete your child report card as i had planned you know your child best.please complete the final quarter of the report card.how does it feel to you the letter then asked for parental input on her kindergarten restructuring plan,again stating,l et just call it history in the making.meuer learned about this letter when an angry parent came to his office demanding an explanation,and other parents called the school district regional office to complain.meuer initiated a review of lifton actions,but because school was out for the summer,he could not conduct a disciplinary hearing until august,the first day of the year.
in the meantime,soon after school recessed for the summer,lifton went to mexico on a vacation with her sister.however,she had not completed required tasks such as turning in her attendance records,lesson plan books,and room keys,and cleaning out her classroom.when she returned from vacation,lifton attended an lsc meeting on july,where she learned that the first item on the council agenda was the renewal of meuer contract.lifton previously had expressed her view that meuer contract should not be renewed by the lsc during the summer,preferring that the committee address the matter in the fall.in her opinion renewal of meuer contract was not a rush and other issues should be given priority.accordingly,at the july meeting,lifton moved to form a vision committee to evaluate meuer and consider adding terms to his contract this motion was adopted.lifton kindergarten proposal was also raised at the july meeting,and meuer and lifton met a few days later to discuss it again.
later in july,lifton sent a third letter dear kindergarten friend and sent to her which she described her trip to mexico.among other things,she told the children that a bird pooped in her lap at a restaurant and that her sister got in big trouble for taking things that do belong to her.this letter also troubled meuer he had not seen it in advance and questioned whether the content of the letter was appropriate for a letter from a teacher.
meuer met with lifton and her union representative on august.the meeting lasted more than an hour,although they did not finish their business that day and no discipline was ever initiated by meuer.the same day,however,in separate proceedings,the chicago board of education issued a warning resolution to lifton,recommending a suspension.the warning resolution cited twelve deficiencies in lifton performance,mostly relating to the sending of unauthorized and inappropriate letters home,as well as her failure to grade student report cards and finish duties.the warning resolution was recommended by defendant arne duncan,the chief executive of the chicago public schools.duncan testified in an affidavit that he had no knowledge about the predisciplinary meeting at the school between lifton and meuer,nor did he know that lifton had opposed the early renewal of meuer contract.
lifton kept teaching for approximately two weeks after the warning resolution was issued.on september she attended parents night at the school the assistant principal was in her classroom observing her interaction with parents.that same night the lsc held a meeting at which lifton told council members that she was the victim of a witch hunt because she had not supported meuer early contract renewal.lifton taught her class the next day a friday,but thereafter did not return to school,first taking a personal day and then nine consecutive sick days.after the fifth sick day,the assistant principal asked for a doctor note,a request lifton found upsetting.lifton eventually went on medical leave through january,when she resigned.she never served a suspension.
ii.discussion 
lifton contends that her discipline was retaliation for first speech,namely,her proposed changes to the kindergarten program and her opposition to meuer early contract renewal.she also claims that she was denied due process of law,defamed,and subjected to intentional infliction of emotional distress.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.russell harms,cir.
retaliation claim 
a analysis applies to lifton retaliation claim was her speech constitutionally protected if so,was the defendants action against her motivated by her constitutionally protected speech and if she can show that her constitutionally protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants action against her,can the defendants show that they would have taken the same action in the absence of her exercise of her first amendment rights vukadinovich bd.of sch.trs.of newton sch,cir.the first two inquiries make up a plaintiff prima facie retaliation case,and the third allows an employer to rebut that case by showing that it would have taken the adverse employment action regardless of the plaintiff protected speech.if the
