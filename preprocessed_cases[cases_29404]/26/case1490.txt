education code section guarantees certificated public school employees up to five months of sick leave the certificated employee regular salary less the amount actually paid to a substitute teacher in his or her absence per illness or accident if they are unable to work for an extended period due to a medical condition and have exhausted their accumulated sick leave.under this provision,is a teacher who is injured as the result of a series of accidents,receives treatment for her injuries during a leave of absence,returns to her job,works for nearly two years without incident and then takes another medical leave for injuries related to the original accidents,entitled to a second paid statutory leave although a simple causal relationship,however attenuated,between the original illness or accident and a subsequent medical condition or injury does not necessarily disqualify a certificated employee from a second period of sick leave under section,when,as here,the subsequent injury was known and potentially treatable during the original medical leave,the second leave falls within that provision per illness or accident limitation.
bonita veguez,a certificated employee of the long beach unified school district district,began a medical leave of absence on march.on december,veguez filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking orders directing the governing board of the district and its superintendent a to grant her five months of paid leave pursuant to section,b to reinstate her as of september,the beginning of the school year,pursuant to section,which requires a school district to reinstate an employee who becomes medically able to return to work within the statutorily prescribed time,and c to make her whole for any wages and benefits she lost because the district refused to allow her to return to work once she was medically able.the trial court granted the petition in part and denied it in part.
we agree with the trial court conclusion veguez was ineligible for statutory leave in because the medical condition for which she was treated at that time and the injuries for which she had been treated and received differential pay two years earlier fall within the per illness or accident limitation of section.accordingly,we affirm that portion of the trial court order denying veguez petition for writ of mandate to compel the district to award her an additional five months of differential pay.however,veguez demonstrated she was medically able to return to work within the time period prescribed by section.we therefore reverse that portion of the trial court order conditioning veguez reinstatement on a new medical examination by a physician selected by the district and remand for further proceedings to determine the appropriate award of backpay and benefits to which veguez is entitled.
factual and procedural background 
veguez accidents 
veguez has been employed by the district since.until she worked as a special education teacher in the school orthopedic program,where her job duties included lifting children who needed assistance.in july and again in november veguez suffered accidents,injuring her back and both knees in each incident.veguez did not use any sick leave as a result of the july accident but did use all of her accumulated sick leave while recovering from the injuries sustained in the november accident.she also filed workers compensation claims in connection with both incidents 
veguez remained off work from november until may.after exhausting her sick leave,veguez requested and was granted sick leave under section for a period 
treatment for the injuries 
in veguez underwent surgery on her right knee to ameliorate pain caused by a degenerative arthritic condition,aggravated by the injuries she sustained in the accidents.although the accidents apparently aggravated a degenerative arthritic condition in her left knee as well,she did not have surgery or receive any treatment for her left knee during her leave of absence.
veguez subsequent medical leave 
veguez returned to work in may with certain medical restrictions,which the district accommodated by reassigning her to a position as a resource specialist.unprompted by any precipitating accident or event,the pain in veguez left knee began to worsen in december and increased throughout.at the recommendation of her personal physician,john santaniello,veguez took a leave of absence from her employment in march and began receiving injection treatments for her left knee.after once again using all of her accumulated sick leave,veguez requested differential pay under section.the district denied her request on the ground the five months statutory paid leave veguez had received following her accident exhausted her rights under section.instead,pursuant to section,the district placed veguez on a reemployment list effective march,
veguez medical examination for her workers compensation claims 
on august,veguez was examined by alexander angerman,the agreed workers compensation medical examiner ame in connection with her workers compensation claims.angerman concluded veguez condition was not yet permanent and stationary and agreed veguez should proceed with the lumbar epidural block injections she had scheduled within the next several weeks.while suggesting that veguez return to see him approximately two months after receiving the scheduled injections,angerman concluded it would be reasonable for veguez to attempt to return to the same job duties she had been performing in march to see how she does.
the district denial of reinstatement 
on august,santaniello determined veguez was ready and able to return to work and released her for full duty as of september.nonetheless,the district refused to reinstate veguez,asserting that,in accordance with the parties stipulation in the workers compensation case,the only medical opinion it could consider was that of the ame and the ame had not formally released veguez to return to work.
veguez petition for writ of mandate 
on december,veguez filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court under code of civil procedure section,seeking orders directing the district to pay her five months of differential pay for her leave of absence from march through august,to reinstate her to her former position and to award her backpay and other consequential damages arising from the district refusal to reinstate her as of september.
the trial court denied veguez request for differential pay under section,concluding that her left knee injury had existed in and was a product of the same accident for which she had already received differential pay.as for veguez request for reinstatement,the court granted the petition in part,ordering the district to appoint a physician to examine veguez and determine whether she is medically able to return to work in a position for which she is credentialed and qualified if she is found to be eligible at the time of examination,you the district are to find her eligible as of september,unless the examining physician finds that she was unable to return to work until some later date.you are also to determine the amount of back pay due petitioner from the date upon which you determine that she was entitled to be.
both the district and veguez have filed timely appeals from the judgment.
contentions 
the district contends the action is barred because veguez did not exhaust the internal grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement governing the terms of her employment the action is subject to workers compensation preemption the district did not violate section in refusing to reinstate veguez because only the ame had the authority to certify her as medically able to return to work and he did not certify her return and veguez failed to demonstrate that a position for which she was credentialed and qualified was available in september.
veguez contends the court erred in denying her claim for differential pay under section and ordering her to submit to another medical examination as a prerequisite for reinstatement.

standard of review 
a traditional writ of mandate lies to compel the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station,or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled,and from which the party is unlawfully precluded code civ,subd.a see also santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d.in reviewing the trial court ruling on a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section,the court of appeal considers whether the findings and judgment are supported by substantial evidence.caloca county of san diego th,d.however,when the facts are undisputed and the issue turns on statutory interpretation,appellate review is de novo.rancho santa fe th,d.
governing law 
certificated employees in the california public school system are entitled to days of sick leave each year for illness or injury.if the employee does not use the full amount of leave in any school year,the leave may be accumulated year to year.once accumulated sick leave is exhausted,certificated employees are statutorily entitled to an additional five months of differential pay,the difference between the certificated employee regular salary and the amount actually paid to a substitute teacher in his or her absence,subd.a.the statutory leave may extend over more than one school year,but the employee is limited to one period per illness or accident,subd.b.
prior to former section provided that certificated employees absent from their duties because of illness or accident for a period of five months or less were entitled to collect during that period their regular salary,less the sum actually paid to a substitute teacher filling their position or,if no substitute was employed,the amount that would have been paid to the substitute if one had been employed.stats,ch.the statute did not expressly limit the number of times a certificated employee could assert his or her right to a leave,either in the same or subsequent years,leaving unresolved the question whether the benefit was available once in the teacher career or whether the period was automatically renewed every school year or only by some other intervening event,such as the onset of a different illness or accident california teachers governing board d.the few cases that had addressed the issue suggested former section authorized a renewed benefit each school year even if the need for medical leave was caused by the same illness or accident for which the teacher had already received five months of differential pay.see also jefferson classroom teachers jefferson elementary school dist.d.indicating,without deciding,that an additional benefit was available each year for any illness or injury even if it was to be utilized as a result of an illness or injury for which the employee had previously received differential pay.
former section was also silent on the question whether its minimum pay guaranty ran concurrently with the employee sick leave benefits or if it commenced only after the employee had exhausted his or her sick leave.
in the legislature amended section to address those questions.stats,ch.the amendments adopted were recognized as a compromise between school districts,which sought to limit the benefit provided,and the teacher unions,which sought the broadest possible benefit for its members.see com.on education,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,bill is a tradeoff between competing issues of importance to management and labor in the public schools.
as amended,section authorizes the benefit to be applied consecutively to the employee use of accumulated sick leave,thus guaranteeing the certificated employee the longest possible compensated leave time,subd.b.on the other hand,the amendments also expressly limited the total differential pay available in any one school year to five months and restricted an employee to one period per illness or accident,confirming that the benefit could be available more than once in a teacher career but nonetheless narrowing the circumstances under which employees could obtain differential pay finally,the legislature also enacted section,requiring school districts to place an employee who has exhausted both sick leave and leave and is still unable to return to work on a reemployment list for a prescribed period of time months for probationary employees,months for permanent employees and to return the employee to a position for which he or she is credentialed and qualified if the employee becomes medically able to return to work within the prescribed time period.
veguez was not required to exhaust the internal grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement 
under the heading statutory sick leave the collective bargaining agreement between the district and the teachers association of long beach,veguez bargaining representative,provides for a benefit substantially similar to that contained in section.the collective bargaining agreement further requires a teacher challenging either the interpretation or application of the agreement or claiming a violation of the agreement to follow a series of prescribed internal grievance procedures,culminating in binding arbitration.
the district contends that,because veguez claim for differential pay falls within the terms of her collective bargaining agreement,her failure to exhaust the internal grievance procedures set forth in that agreement bars her petition for writ of mandate.however,veguez challenges neither the district interpretation nor its application of her collective bargaining agreement,but rather its denial of her rights under section.lawsuits to enforce rights guaranteed by the education code are not subject to internal exhaustion requirements.tracy educators superior court th,d tracy united teachers los angeles unified school dist.th,d,united teachers see e xcept as provided in sections right to dismissal hearing and rights of terminated employee,any contract or agreement,express or implied,made by any employee to waive the benefits of this chapter or any part thereof is null and void.
the district argues tracy and united teachers involved collective bargaining agreements that narrowed the teachers statutory rights and asserts that when the collective bargaining agreement is identical to the provisions of the education code,the employee has effectively bargained for a different forum to resolve the statutory issues.contrary to the districts contention,however,the method for calculating an employee benefit set forth in the collective bargaining agreement governing veguez employment differs from the calculation required by section by guarantying the teacher of his or her regular salary without regard to the actual cost of a substitute teacher.veguez petition for writ of mandate does not seek the benefit provided by the collective bargaining agreement,but the differential salary prescribed under section.under these circumstances veguez had no duty to exhaust internal grievance procedures before seeking a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section.tracy,supra,th at,d united teachers,supra,th at,d.
veguez action is not preempted by the workers compensation law 
the district also insists veguez claim is barred by the exclusivity provisions of the workers compensation law.see,subd.a liability for the compensation provided by this division,in lieu of any other liability whatsoever,shall exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of employment.while common law tort claims are generally preempted shoemaker myers cal d,claims for separate injuries under distinct statutory schemes are not.see city of moorpark superior court cal th,d,employee statutory claims for discrimination under either the fair employment and housing act or not preempted by workers compensation exclusivity pearl workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,state employee lawsuit for retirement disability benefits not preempted although both the public employees retirement law and the workers compensation law are aimed at the same general goals with regard to the welfare of employees and their dependents,they represent distinct legislative schemes.we may not assume that the provisions of one apply to the other absent a clear indication from the legislature.veguez seeks differential pay and reinstatement under sections and,not tort damages for her injury.accordingly,the trial court properly held her claims were not preempted by the exclusivity provisions of the workers compensation law.
the trial court properly denied veguez petition for differential pay 
veguez insists she was eligible for additional benefits while on medical leave in to treat her left knee pain because the injuries to both her knees were the result of the cumulative trauma from a series of accidents,not a single,distinct incident,and the injury to her left knee is separate from the earlier injury to her right knee.to support her position that her medical leave is not subject to the per illness or accident limitation of section,veguez relies on the report of santaniello,who opined that the right and left knee problems are distinct,the right knee problem preceded the left knee by several years in its onset and severity,the right knee problem was more advanced than the left knee when he initially saw veguez after her accidents in and the left knee problem did not become significant clinically until the end of.
section,however,limits the availability of benefits not in terms of severable injuries,but rather in terms of a distinct illness or accident.a teacher who suffers multiple injuries in a single accident is entitled to only one period for that accident.the question in this case,therefore,is not whether the injuries veguez sustained to her knees in were different in degree and they whether the left knee injury for which veguez currently seeks differential pay is a product of the same illness or accident for which she received differential pay in within the meaning of those terms in section.
veguez first suggests that,because she returned to work in and continued in her job until,any subsequent treatment for her left knee must be considered a new illness as a matter of law.relying on legislative history indicating the amendments were designed in part to curb abuses by teachers who continued to accumulate sick leave without ever intending to return to work see com.on education,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,bill allows management to remedy the potential for abuse by employees who manipulate the system and never intend to return to work,veguez contends the phrase per illness or accident must be interpreted to mean each injury or condition that temporarily incapacitates an employee and prevents her from being able to fulfill her job duties.once the employee returns to work,the incapacitating illness or accident has effectively concluded and any subsequent medical condition,whether or not related to the prior illness or accident,triggers the employee right to an additional period of differential pay.
the ascertainment of legislative intent is the paramount principle of statutory interpretation.covenant care,superior court cal th,d,in re michael cal d.we begin,of course,with the actual language of the statute.in re michael,at.because the terms illness or accident,undefined in this statute,may be subject to different interpretations,however,we agree resort to legislative history is appropriate to help determine the legislature intent.see people birkett cal th,d,the plain language of the statute controls if however,the statutory language leaves doubt about its meaning,we may consult other evidence of the legislature intent,such as the history and background of the legislation lungren deukmejian cal d.
the pertinent legislative history does not support veguez interpretation of section.as we have explained,section was amended in in an effort to address concerns by the teachers unions over the districts application of the benefit concurrently with the employee utilization of accumulated sick leave,thereby depriving many teachers of the value of the statutory leave provision,while also meeting some school districts goals of limiting the total amount of available leave time.if anything,the legislative history indicates a desire to narrow the circumstances under which a certificated employee may obtain differential pay leave by limiting the employee to one period per illness or accident as well as one leave period per school year regardless of the cause for the leave.nothing in the legislative history remotely suggests an intent to create a temporal definition to the terms illness or accident,allowing a renewal of a benefit following the employee return to work 
veguez further argues her knee problems were caused by a series of accidents two or more and she is therefore entitled to a separate period of differential leave for each accident that contributed to her injuries.veguez insists the legislature use of the term per accident in the amendments to limit additional periods of differential pay means a teacher injured by multiple accidents may claim an equal number of periods of differential pay.
veguez application of this novel construction of section to her situation ignores the fact that the damage to her knees was cumulative and that it was only after the last accident occurred in november that she took any medical leave at all.while prior incidents may have contributed to some degree to her general medical condition,because there was no further accident causing any injury to veguez right knee following her return to work in may,the medical leave veguez took in,like her earlier medical leave,was necessarily the product of the november accident for purposes of section.any other interpretation of the per accident limitation would produce absurd consequences,plainly at odds with the intent of the amendments for example,if veguez were correct,a teacher who repeatedly fell say,on occasions without serious injury but who finally sought medical treatment would be entitled to periods,whether or not she had suffered more than one discrete injury and whether or not she ever returned to work.nothing in the language or legislative history of the amendments to section requires us to reach that result.see bruce gregory cal d,it is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.
finally,veguez argues,as a factual matter,her left knee condition must be considered a separate illness because it did not exist in,at least to the same degree it existed in when she took her second leave of absence.veguez position is plainly inconsistent with her own concession that the pain in her left knee is directly attributable to the accidents.nonetheless,she insists her left knee did not require treatment in or and for that reason must be considered a new illness even if it is a product of the same accident.she urges that the fact an injury or other medical condition may relate to a prior accident does not necessarily disqualify it as a new illness or accident for purposes of qualifying for differential pay under section.
considered in the abstract,without regard to the facts in the record before us,veguez argument has merit.section does not necessarily preclude a second period of differential pay for a new medical leave simply because the teacher current illness relates in some way to a prior accident.a serious accident could not only cause immediate injury but also create a predisposition for,or serve as a causative element of,an illness that does not manifest itself until months or even years after the employee has apparently recovered from the accident and successfully returned to work.for example,a head injury sustained in an accident may bear some relationship to a stroke suffered years later.it can hardly be said,however,that the stroke itself is an injury suffered in the initial accident.
on the other hand,an injury that is the immediate byproduct of an accident does not become new or different simply because treatment has been postponed or because the condition has deteriorated over time.it would,without question,defeat the plain language of the per accident limitation if an employee were allowed to obtain more than one benefit in those circumstance
