this case calls upon us to decide whether the equal protection clause requires maine to extend tuition payments to private sectarian secondary schools on behalf of students who reside in a school district that makes such payments available on a limited basis to private nonsectarian secondary schools.we hold that the equal protection clause does not impose any such obligation.accordingly,although our reasoning differs from that of the district court,we affirm the entry of summary judgment in the defendants favor.
background 
by statute,maine commits to providing all persons with an opportunity to receive the benefits of a free public education.ann.tit,west,and vests authority in local school districts to fulfill that undertaking by maintaining and supporting elementary and secondary education,id.school districts,known in maine bureaucratic argot as school administrative units,enjoy some flexibility in administering this guarantee.they may satisfy the state mandate in any of three ways by operating their own public schools,see id,by contracting with outside public schools to accept their students,see id,or by paying private schools to provide such an education,see id.state law bars a school district that exercises the third option from paying tuition to any private sectarian school.id.
the town of minot comprises a school administrative unit.it has decided to operate its own grade school kindergarten through eighth grade,but has chosen to outsource secondary education.to this end,minot has contracted with a neighboring school town of educate at least of its eligible students at poland regional high school prhs.the contract gives minot the right to send up to of its high schoolers to other approved nonsectarian secondary schools private or public so long as those students can demonstrate that they have educational needs that prhs can not satisfy.the superintendent of school union,which consists of the school administrative units of poland,mechanic falls,and minot,reviews applications for such alternative placements on a basis.by operation of section,however,sectarian schools can not win approval for publicly funded tuition payments and,thus,minot can not underwrite tuition for youths seeking to attend such schools.
john and belinda eulitt and kelly mackinnon are parents residing in minot who,on their own dime,send their daughters to dominic regional high school,a catholic secondary school that is indisputably sectarian.they believe that,under minot education plan,the state and the town should pay tuition directly to dominic on behalf of their daughters because prhs does not offer classes in catholic doctrine or teach from a catholic viewpoint and,therefore,does not meet the full range of their daughters educational needs.the parents have not submitted formal applications for such funding because section,which forbids the payment of public dollars to sectarian schools,would prevent the superintendent from approving any such applications.instead,as parents and next friends of their daughters,they brought suit in maine federal district court against various state educational authorities.pertinently,their complaint alleged that section restriction on the approval of sectarian schools for placements funded by public tuition payments violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because that restriction discriminates on the bases of religion,religious speech,and viewpoint.additionally,the complaint asserted a separate equal protection claim on behalf of dominic,in which the parents argued that section strips the school of equal protection of the laws because it denies the school the ability to receive public funds for providing secondary education services even though it allows private nonsectarian schools to receive such stipends.
in due course,the parties for summary judgment.the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge who recommended,inter alia,that summary judgment be granted in favor of the defendants on the equal protection claims.eulitt me.dep t of,wl,at.the magistrate judge ruled that the equal protection clause does not compel the provision of public funds to private sectarian schools,even when a school district has chosen to subsidize the payment of tuition to private nonsectarian schools on a limited basis.id.at.on objection,see b.b,the district court concurred with the magistrate judge recommended decision,but it did so solely on the ground that this court decision in strout albanese,cir,had authoritatively answered exactly the same questions plaintiffs now urge this court to decide,and,therefore,pretermitted further inquiry under the doctrine of stare decisis.eulitt me.dep t of,d.this appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
the appellants hawk three propositions on appeal.first,they urge that the doctrine of stare decisis does not foreclose consideration of their substantive claims.second,they contend that the establishment clause does not compel maine to eschew public funding of sectarian education and,hence,does not prevent the state from providing the redress that they seek.third,they asseverate that section violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates on the bases of religion,religious speech,and viewpoint.we consider these propositions sequentially.
stare decisis.
as a general matter,the doctrine of stare decisis precludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously been heard and authoritatively determined.stewart dutra constr,cir.in other words,stare decisis renders the ruling of law in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision.gately massachusetts,cir emphasis in original.for present purposes,the question reduces to whether our earlier decision in strout constitutes such a bar.
strout arose in a very similar posture.there,we upheld the constitutionality of section against equal protection,establishment,and free exercise challenges brought by parents not the present plaintiffs who sought public funding for their children matriculation at dominic.strout,at.the strout panel rejected the equal protection challenge because maine had shown a compelling interest in avoiding an establishment clause violation through the exclusion of sectarian schools from its secondary education tuition program.id.at.two members of the panel further speculated,in dictum,that if maine proffered interest had been found to depend upon an erroneous understanding of the establishment clause that is,if it had been determined that payments to sectarian schools were permissible under that clause,then the state exclusion of sectarian schools from the tuition program would not withstand scrutiny.id.at.
three years later,the supreme court decided zelman,d.that opinion altered the landscape of establishment clause jurisprudence in the school finance context by upholding a program that allowed parents in cleveland to elect to apply school vouchers toward their children tuition at private sectarian schools.id.at.the zelman court announced that indirect public aid to sectarian education is constitutionally permissible when the financial assistance program has a valid secular purpose,provides benefits to a broad spectrum of individuals who can exercise genuine private choice among religious and secular options,and is neutral toward religion.id.at.
last term,the supreme court again addressed the application of the first amendment to educational funding issues.the court upheld a washington state college scholarship program that prohibited the application of scholarship funds toward the pursuit of a devotional theology degree.locke davey,d.in so doing,the court reaffirmed that there is room for play in the joints between the religion clauses.id.at quoting walz tax comm n,d.by this,the davey court meant that there are some state actions permitted by the establishment clause but not required by the free exercise clause.id.
the zelman opinion raises the distinct possibility that strout view of maine asserted interest depended upon an incorrect interpretation of the establishment clause strictures.davey also casts doubt on the reasoning of strout because it clarifies,and subtly alters,the decisional framework to be applied to equal protection claims that are rooted in allegations of religious discrimination.the district court nevertheless declined to consider the effects of zelman and davey on the continuing vitality of strout.we do not find fault with that cautious approach.see crowe bolduc,cir noting that district court correctly regarded circuit precedent as good law even though a subsequent supreme court dictum had presaged the demise of the rule stated therein.until a court of appeals revokes a binding precedent,a district court within the circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent unless it has unmistakably been cast into disrepute by supervening authority.see sarzen gaughan,cir explaining that stare decisis requires lower courts to take binding pronouncements at face value until formally altered agostini felton,d reaffirming that the court has the prerogative to overrule its own decisions.
we are,of course,in a somewhat different position.even though our system of justice places a premium on finality,stability,and certainty in the law,stewart,at,stare decisis is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule,carpenters local union fid.guar,cir.thus,a panel of the court of appeals has some flexibility,modest though it may be,with respect to its own precedents.
ordinarily,newly constituted panels in a circuit should consider themselves bound by prior panel decisions.see united states rodriguez,cir united states wogan,cir.this rule is a specialized application of the stare decisis principle.it is,however,subject to at least two exceptions,either of which may warrant a departure from a prior holding.
the first exception comes into play when a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority,such as a decision of the supreme court,a decision of the en banc court,or a statutory overruling.williams ashland eng g,cir.that exception does not apply here.although zelman did confirm that the state may provide funding for sectarian education in certain instances,see zelman,at,the decision depended upon the court careful consideration of the facts underlying the cleveland voucher program,see id.at.even after zelman and davey,it is fairly debatable whether or not the maine tuition program could survive an establishment clause challenge if the state eliminated section and allowed sectarian schools to receive tuition funds thus,the newly emergent supreme court case law does not necessarily undercut the strout panel premise,at,that maine could not extend funding to sectarian schools under its program without violating the establishment clause.
a second exception exists when recent supreme court precedent calls into legitimate question a prior opinion of an inferior court.carpenters local union,at see also crowe,at.in that context,a reviewing court must pause to consider the likely significance of the neoteric supreme court case law before automatically ceding the field to an earlier decision.see williams,at explaining that stare decisis may yield in those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision,although not directly controlling,nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel,in light of fresh developments,would change its collective mind.
we think that this exception applies here.in strout,the panel explicitly relied on the present state of jurisprudence in determining that maine interest in excluding sectarian schools from its tuition program would survive any level of scrutiny because the establishment clause likely required the state to maintain such an exclusion.strout,at.in reaching this conclusion,the panel candidly observed that the guidance provided by the supreme court has been less than crystalline.id.zelman and davey obviously constitute significant developments in the pertinent jurisprudence and shed new light on the case law upon which the strout decision hinged.if these decisions,collectively,do not make the law crystalline,they at least provide more focused direction than was available to the strout panel.consequently,we find it incumbent upon us to reject a rote application of stare decisis here and to undertake a fresh analysis.see arecibo cmty.health care,puerto rico,cir.
b.the establishment clause.
the appellants second proposition invites us to determine whether the state asserted interest in maintaining section parochial school exclusion in order to avoid an establishment clause violation is a valid one.this proposition is asserted out of order because the response to it depends upon what level of scrutiny we should apply in this case,the proposition itself is not susceptible to consideration at a preliminary point in our analysis.we explain briefly.
it can not be gainsaid that establishment clause defenses sometimes trigger consideration of hypothetical statutory schemes to determine whether entanglement concerns actually justify a particular feature of a challenged law.however,such defenses should not be addressed until a court has identified the right at issue and ascertained the level of scrutiny that attaches to it.see,good news club milford cent,d weighing the validity of a school establishment clause defense after finding that the challenged restriction constituted viewpoint discrimination and that strict scrutiny therefore applied widmar vincent,d determining first that religious group exclusion from open forum was discriminatory,and then reviewing school establishment clause defense for retaining its existing forum access policy instead of adopting a hypothetical policy that would be more inclusive.that sequence is particularly significant in view of the axiom that federal courts should withhold decision on vexing constitutional questions until consideration of those questions becomes necessary.see.state fed of labor mcadory.noting that i t has long been the court considered practice not to decide abstract,hypothetical or contingent questions,or to decide any constitutional question in advance of the necessity for its decision citations omitted el dia,hernandez colon,cir similar.
that ends this aspect of the matter.consideration of the question that the appellants seek to section or some similar restriction is indispensable to maine obligation to keep its tuition program in compliance with the establishment premature at this juncture.instead,we explore the contours of the right at issue and ascertain what level of scrutiny an establishment clause defense would have to survive.
equal protection.
the heart of the appellants claim is the proposition that section violates both the equal protection rights of dominic and the appellants own equal protection rights as parents and next friends of their children because the statute discriminates on the bases of religion and religious speech.before untangling this argument,we first address the threshold question of standing.
standing.we start with the question whether the appellants have standing to raise a constitutional claim on behalf of dominic.an individual who asserts the constitutional rights of a third party must,of course,satisfy the article iii requirements of injury in fact,causation,and redressability with respect to the claim.see valley forge christian coll.americans united for of church state,d.in addition,that party must satisfy the prerequisites that arise from prudential limitations on the jurisdiction of the federal courts,namely,that the litigant personally has suffered an injury in fact that gives rise to a sufficiently concrete interest in the adjudication of the third party rights that the litigant has a close relationship to the third party and that some hindrance exists that prevents the third party from protecting its own interests.powers ohio,d playboy enters.pub.serv.comm n,cir.
in the case at hand,the appellants contend that section causes them injury in fact because it compels the superintendent to reject all applications for the funding of a high school education at dominic on the ground that the school is religiously oriented and,thus,ineligible to receive tuition payments.therefore,the statute restriction on the school translates into the parents inability to gain approval for the public funding of their children sectarian education.this link between the appellants interests and those of dominic may suggest the type of special relationship that would support a departure from the general proscription on jus tertii claims.see,craig boren,d finding vendor satisfied jus tertii requirement to advocate for rights of consumers who may wish to purchase its wares pierce soc y of sisters.recognizing standing of religious schools to assert the rights of potential pupils who might seek access to their education services.
assuming for argument sake,but without deciding,that both an injury and a sufficient relationship exist,the appellants nonetheless stumble on the third step of the jus tertii standing framework they have wholly failed to show any obstacle preventing dominic from bringing suit to protect itself against the imagined infringements.the appellants have advanced no credible suggestion either that dominic is generically unable to assert its rights or that the circumstances of this case create some idiosyncratic barrier to such a suit.then,too,all of the environmental factors point the other way.for one thing,section does not impose or threaten to impose any criminal or civil penalty for any action that might be taken by sectarian schools.thus,this case does not fall into the isthmian category of cases in which courts have recognized jus tertii standing because a third party is understandably reluctant to engage in the allegedly protected activity for fear of prosecution or other penalty see,broadrick oklahoma,d recognizing standing to bring first amendment overbreadth claims.for another thing,the appellants are not exposed to any criminal or civil penalty because of their interaction with the school accordingly,cases in which the putative litigant faced such penalties by providing assistance or service to the holder of the right are inapposite.see,craig,at.finding standing where litigant,a beer vendor,faced sanctions and loss of license for sales to men between eighteen and twenty years of age.and,finally,this case is not one in which the has little or no financial incentive to pursue suit or,alternatively,would face great difficulty in demonstrating that the alleged injury was likely to reoccur.see,powers,at.noting that the barriers to suit by a potential juror who believes he has been excluded because of race are daunting because of the small financial stake involved as well as the difficulty of proving that such discrimination would recur.
at the expense of carting coal to newcastle,we add that the underlying justifications for the prudential limitation on standing could be thwarted were the appellants allowed to serve as for dominic.those justifications include the venerable tenet that third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their own rights.singleton wulff,d.they also include the wise counsel that,sometimes,the holder of a right has reasons of its own for not pursuing potential claims.see,friedman harold,cir.an exception to these basic maxims sometimes is warranted because a congruence of interests exists between a litigant and a third party.see playboy,at.here,however,it is by no means apparent that the appellants and dominic share a common interest it is entirely possible that the school has refrained from litigation precisely because it is not interested in participating in maine tuition program and thereby subjecting itself to any number of concomitant state regulations,am.library ass odom,finding that researchers seeking access to certain library materials could not assert library property rights friedman,at finding that bankruptcy trustee was an inappropriate party to assert certain rights of debtor.
for these reasons,we hold that the appellants lack standing to advance dominic equal protection claim.
this holding does not end our odyssey.although the appellants lack standing to pursue their jus tertii claim,they do have standing in their own right to seek global relief in the form of an injunction against the enforcement of section and a declaration of the statute unconstitutionality.the appellants have established standing directly based on their allegation that section effectively deprives them of the opportunity to have their children tuition at dominic paid by public funding.even though it is the educational institution,not the parent,that would receive the tuition payments for a student whose educational requirements application was approved,it is the parent who must submit such an application and who ultimately will benefit from the approval.because section imposes restrictions on that approval,the parents allegation of injury in fact to their interest in securing tuition funding provides a satisfactory predicate for standing.see bennett spear,d explaining that harm produced by determinative or coercive effect upon a third party satisfies the injury in fact requirement when the harm is fairly traceable to that effect.
the merits.we thus proceed to the merits of the appellants equal protection claim and consider whether recent supreme court precedents,especially the court opinions in zelman and davey,provide a sound basis for overturning strout.
in undertaking this examination,we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo,considering the record and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the summary judgment losers here,the appellants.garside osco drug,cir.our consideration is not inextricably linked to the district court stare decisis theory rather,we may affirm the entry of summary judgment on any independent ground fairly presented in the record.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.
the appellants first contend that section discriminates against them on the basis of religion by forcing them to choose between a publicly funded education and what they describe as their fundamental right of religion.appellants br.at.they attempt to position this harm under the rubric of equal protection avoiding any detailed reference to the free exercise clause even though that clause defines the scope of the fundamental right to religion incorporated by the fourteenth amendment equal protection guarantee.see johnson robison,d.
this crabbed approach will not wash.in davey,the supreme court clearly rejected this type of effort to erect a separate and distinct framework for analyzing claims of religious discrimination under the equal protection clause.see davey.at confirming that the free exercise clause provides the primary framework for assessing religious discrimination claims.along these lines,the court held that if a challenged program comports with the free exercise clause,that conclusion wraps up the religious discrimination analysis.see id.thus,rational basis scrutiny applies to any further equal protection inquiry see see also johnson,at.explaining that once a law is found to be valid with respect to the free exercise right,there is no occasion to apply to the challenged classification a standard of scrutiny stricter than the traditional test in addressing an equal protection claim.accordingly,we inquire whether intervening supreme court precedent alters the panel conclusion in strout that section marks no free exercise violation.
in strout,the panel held that section imposes no substantial burden on religious beliefs or therefore does not implicate the free exercise it does not prohibit attendance at a religious school or otherwise prevent parents from choosing religious education for their children strout,at.far from undermining that analysis,davey reinforces it.indeed,davey confirms that the free exercise clause protection of religious beliefs and practices from direct government encroachment does not translate into an affirmative requirement that public entities fund religious activity simply because they choose to fund the secular equivalents of such activity.see davey.at.consequently,the appellants effort to characterize maine decision not to deploy limited tuition dollars toward the funding of religious education as an impermissible burden on
