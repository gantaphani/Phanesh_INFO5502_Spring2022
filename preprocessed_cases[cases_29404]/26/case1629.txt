in this case,we conclude that the special infancy toll applicable in wrongful death actions involving sole infant distributees under hernandez v new york city health hosps.is not available for personal injury claims.we therefore affirm the order of the appellate division.
plaintiff eugenia brennan heslin is the administrator of the estate of the decedent,egypt phillips.egypt,born in may,lived with her two young sisters and their mother tanya rose.egypt biological father,a convicted felon,had abandoned her.in early,rose boyfriend,james smith,moved in with the family.in may and again in august,egypt was taken to health care facilities for treatment of various injuries,including a broken clavicle and head trauma.according to plaintiff,these instances of suspected abuse were reported to defendants county of greene,county of greene mental health,county of greene department of social services county of greene child protective services collectively,the county defendants.following the august incident,smith was apparently ordered to leave the family home.however,on november,egypt died tragically as a result of injuries intentionally inflicted upon her by smith.
about two weeks later,smith and rose were each charged in connection with egypt death.rose pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and was subsequently sentenced to a prison term of to years.following a jury trial,smith was convicted of murder and sentenced to a term of years to life imprisonment.
in december,shortly after egypt death,plaintiff was appointed as the attorney for the children,egypt sisters,in connection with an abuse and neglect proceeding pending in family court against smith and rose.in addition to serving as attorney for the children formerly referred to as a law guardian in family court,surrogate court appointed her as the administrator of egypt estate in october.
until plaintiff application,no one had petitioned surrogate court to handle the administration of egypt estate under scpa and.rose and the biological father were each disqualified because of their felony status see scpa d.although the task would have ordinarily fallen to egypt siblings under the priority of decedent relatives established in scpa,they too were ineligible based on their infancy see scpa a.because no other relative sought to be appointed guardian for the siblings under article of the scpa,they had no adult representative who could function as the administrator or consent to anyone else assuming that role see scpa.out of concern for the fate of egypt siblings,plaintiff pursued appointment as administrator pursuant to the fallback provision of scpa b,allowing any qualified petitioner to become an administrator in the court discretion.
in the course of fulfilling her duties as attorney for the children and administrator of egypt estate,plaintiff determined that egypt siblings had potential claims against the county defendants and private individuals based on their alleged negligence contributing to egypt death at the hands of smith.on november,plaintiff served a notice of claim on the county defendants in her capacity as administrator of egypt estate.five days later,plaintiff commenced this action against the county defendants alleging causes of action for wrongful death and personal injury any damages recovered would ultimately benefit the siblings as egypt sole distributees by intestacy plaintiff simultaneously moved pursuant to general municipal law for leave to file a late notice of claim for the personal injury cause of action.
supreme court granted the motion and extended the time to serve the notice of claim to november,the date it was actually filed.initially,the court determined that the wrongful death claim was timely because the notice of claim was filed within days from plaintiff appointment as administrator and the action was commenced within two years of egypt death,as required by statute see general municipal law a.turning to the personal injury cause of action,the court found that the notice of claim was untimely because it was not filed within days after the claim arose.recognizing that it lacked the discretion to extend the time beyond the expiration of the applicable and limitations period,the court relied on our decision in hernandez v new york city health hosps.to conclude that the toll afforded by cplr applied,based on the infancy of egypt siblings,and,as a result,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiff appointment as administrator in october.in hernandez,this court held that the cplr infancy toll applies when an infant is the sole distributee in a wrongful death action.relying on the factors in general municipal law,the court granted plaintiff leave to file the late notice of claim.
the appellate division reversed and dismissed the personal injury claim,but agreed that the wrongful death claim was timely dept the court held that supreme court lacked discretion to enlarge the time to serve the late notice of claim because the personal injury claim was,reasoning 
supreme court reliance on the infancy toll of cplr,on behalf of decedent infant distributees,to extend the statute of limitations on the personal injury claim was not proper inasmuch as such a claim is brought on behalf of decedent and is personal to her,not her surviving infant distributees id.at.
we granted plaintiff leave to appeal.
eptl b,referred to as the survival statute,provides that n o cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of the person in whose favor the cause of action existed.for any injury an action may be brought or continued by the personal representative of the decedent.as a condition precedent to initiating a personal injury action against a municipality,a notice of claim must be served within days after the claim arises see general municipal law a.the action must also be commenced within the statutorily prescribed and limitations period see general municipal law.although a court is authorized to extend the filing of a notice of claim beyond the period,the time for filing may not be extended beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations see general municipal law.
in this case,egypt first sustained injuries at some point in early and died on november.since a notice of claim was not filed within days of her death,leave to file a late notice was necessary.the personal injury claim accrued no later than the date of her death and,absent the application of a toll,the and limitations period expired in february.because the request for leave to file a late notice was not made within that time frame,as mandated by general municipal law,an extension of time to file such notice is not statutorily authorized unless the limitations period was tolled.
plaintiff asserts that the statute of limitations for the personal injury cause of action was tolled under cplr due to the infancy of egypt sole sisters in particular,plaintiff submits that supreme court appropriately applied the rationale of hernandez,which held that cplr tolls the statute of limitations where the sole distributee in a wrongful death action is an infant,to this personal injury claim.while the dissent adopts this position,we can not agree based on the fundamental distinction between the natures of the two claims.
in hernandez,the decedent died intestate in april in a facility operated by defendant new york city health and hospitals corporation,leaving her infant son as her sole distributee.letters of guardianship were issued to the infant grandmother in december and an administrator of the estate was appointed with the guardian consent later that month.in february,the administrator was granted leave to file a late notice of claim.but she did not commence a wrongful death action until december,more than one year and days after decedent death the defendant moved to dismiss the wrongful death action as.on appeal,a majority of this court concluded that the action was timely by virtue of the cplr infancy toll,holding that where the only distributee is an infant,the distributee infancy serves to toll the limitations period until the earliest moment there is a personal representative or potential personal representative who can bring the action,which the court stated would occur upon the appointment of a guardian or majority of the distributee,whichever occurs first at.
in reaching this result in hernandez,we were careful to limit our analysis to wrongful death actions authorized by eptl,emphasizing that such claims belong to a decedent distributees rather than the estate standing in place of the decedent.for example,we observed that any damages recovered are exclusively for the benefit of decedent distributees and that the cause of action is not part of and bears no legal relationship to decedent estate id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,any damages must be measured by the effect of the wrongful act on the pecuniary loss suffered by the individual distributees as a result of decedent death id.in contrast,we noted that a personal injury action brought under eptl b seeks damages for an injury to the decedent and belongs to the estate.finally,we stressed that in a wrongful death case involving a sole infant distributee,it is the infant child who has suffered any loss recognized by law id.
hence,even though cplr applies when the person entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy and the person entitled to bring a wrongful death claim under eptl is the estate personal representative in hernandez we employed the cplr toll based on the infancy of the distributee himself.in that unique context,where no personal representative was otherwise available,it was reasonable to look to the distributee infancy status because the wrongful death claim belonged to him and would compensate him for damages that he directly sustained as a result of his mother death.as we put it,the distributee was the only person whose interests are at stake in bringing this wrongful death action id.in effect,we treated the distributee as the plaintiff under the tolling statute because,for all intents and purposes,the claim was his own.
following hernandez,appellate division case law has consistently declined to extend the toll rule fashioned in hernandez outside the wrongful death context see matter of hidalgo v new york city health hosps,dept kemp city of new york,dept see also baker bronx lebanon hosp,dept these courts recognized that,unlike a wrongful death claim that directly compensates a decedent distributees for their own damages,a personal injury claim is designed to compensate the decedent for injuries suffered and is personal to the other words,it is a claim assumed by the estate.
in the present case,the appellate division acted in accord with these precedents see heslin county of greene,dept,and we believe it correctly drew a distinction between the two causes of action in holding that hernandez should be limited to the wrongful death arena.as we explained in hernandez itself,a wrongful death action belongs to the decedent distributees and is designed to compensate the distributees themselves for their pecuniary losses as a result of the wrongful act see eptl.the proceeds are paid directly to the distributees in the proportions directed by the court,determined by their respective monetary injuries see eptl.in comparison,a personal injury action on behalf of the deceased under eptl b seeks recovery for the conscious pain and suffering of the deceased and any damages awarded accrue to the estate see ratka francis.such a claim is personal to the deceased and belongs to the estate,not the distributees.the types of damages that are recoverable are different and the calculations of damages for the two claims are based on separate factors.
moreover,because it is the estate that recovers in a personal injury action,any proceeds will first be applied to outstanding liens,debts or expenses see eptl,scpa.only after the obligations of the estate are fulfilled would any remaining funds be paid to beneficiaries or distributees.this is in stark contrast to the damages recoverable in a wrongful death action,where any proceeds are generally not subject to the claims of the estate creditors see warren heaton,surrogate court practice c,at ed.in short,the two causes of action are predicated on essentially different theories of loss which accrue to different parties ratka,at 
unlike the infant distributee in hernandez,who was the only party that suffered any loss recognized by law as the beneficiary of a wrongful death claim hernandez,at,the infant distributees here do not seek to recover their own damages through a personal injury claim.rather,they hope to inherit through intestacy any damages that their sister would have been entitled to had she survived.the rationale underlying a court may take into account the infancy of the distributee because the wrongful death claim belongs to and is for the sole benefit of the distributee id.at n simply does not apply here,despite the sympathetic plight of egypt siblings.put differently,the necessary connection between infant distributees and a personal injury action brought on behalf of the deceased under eptl b is missing since such a claim redresses a wrong suffered by the deceased,not the distributees.
plaintiff nevertheless urges that the tolling rule adopted by hernandez should apply with equal force to personal injury actions because eptl b,like eptl,authorizes a personal representative to bring the action and,in this case,egypt siblings would be the ultimate beneficiaries of any damages recovered under either claim.plaintiff points out that no personal representative existed to bring the personal injury action until her appointment as administrator in october,after the statute of limitations had expired.despite that unfortunate occurrence,we can not disregard the fundamental legal distinction between the two causes of action,and the argument of the plaintiff and dissent would result in a rule that is unsupported by the key jurisprudential underpinning of unique status of a distributee as the direct beneficiary and source of a wrongful death claim.
in fact,it is notable that eptl,a provision,similarly enables a personal representative to commence all other types of action that survive the decedent death.taken to its logical conclusion,plaintiff position would result in the application of the cplr toll to any cause of action belonging to a and infant leaves only infant distributees.a decedent personal claims could potentially be pursued more than a decade later on the basis that an infant distributee would be entitled to any damages recovered by the estate through intestate succession the adoption of such a rule,impinging on the settled policies underlying statutes of repose,must be made by the legislature.
we therefore conclude that supreme court improperly relied on the cplr toll to permit a late notice of claim for the personal injury action based on the infancy of the decedent siblings.because the applicable statute of limitations expired before the filing of a late notice of claim,the appellate division correctly denied the motion and dismissed the personal injury claim.
accordingly,the order of the appellate division should be affirmed,with brennan heslin,as administrator of the estate of egypt phillips,deceased v county of greene,et.
ciparick,dissenting 
because i believe that plaintiff,administrator of the estate of the infant decedent whose sole distributees are her infant sisters,is entitled to the infancy toll pursuant to cplr in this personal injury action as we applied it in hernandez v new york city health hosps,i respectfully dissent.
here,as in hernandez,the decedent died intestate,survived only by infant distributees.however,the majority opines that the rule we announced in hernandez can not apply to a personal injury cause of action for conscious pain and suffering because of the fundamental distinction between the natures of personal injury claims and wrongful death claims majority,at.the majority observes that the two claims are predicated on different theories of loss and are compensable by different measures of damages see id.at.specifically,the majority states that a personal injury cause of action for conscious pain and suffering
