lisa kerr appeals the district court order granting appellees motion to dismiss her civil action pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.because we conclude that the district court properly determined both that sovereign immunity bars kerr claims against the marshall university board of governors mubg,and that the allegations in kerr pro se complaint against the other appellees fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,we affirm.
after practicing law for more than fifteen years,kerr enrolled in marshall university master of arts in teaching mat program to obtain a west virginia teaching license.a practicum,edf,is a required component of the mat program.
in the fall of,kerr was a student in edf.a few weeks before the end of the semester,however,kerr left her post in protest over differences with her supervising teacher.kerr was unable to resolve these differences with the marshall administration and did not return to her post.she was not awarded credit for edf,and she received neither her mat nor her teaching license.
on march,after unsuccessfully pursuing reconsideration through marshall internal process,kerr filed a complaint in the southern district of west virginia.the complaint named as defendants mubg gene kuhn,kerr supervising teacher in edf judith southard,kerr marshall supervisor for edf sandra bailey,the edf program coordinator at marshall teresa eagle and lisa heaton,both deans of marshall college of education and david pittenger,the dean of marshall graduate studies collectively,appellees.
we set forth the relevant facts as alleged in kerr complaint.see wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir.to provide context to kerr allegations,we also draw on the marshall university mat and post bac programs student teacher handbook the handbook or handbook,on which kerr complaint relies and which is integral to her complaint 
edf,the culminating clinical experience for mat students,requires all day student teaching under direct supervision in a public school setting.the marshall handbook contains regulations by which participants must abide.participants must also follow any additional directives given by the marshall supervisor,who serves as the student teacher primary marshall contact for any issues.over the course of the semester,student teachers are expected to collaborate with their supervising classroom teachers and marshall supervisors to improve their lesson planning,lesson presentation,and classroom management.
as the above arrangement suggests,the student teacher does not have exclusive control of the classroom.for example,the student teacher is not solely responsible for determining grades,and the supervising classroom teacher retains ultimate responsibility to the school administration,the school board,and the parents for promoting the best interests of their students.
edf participants receive a grade of credit or no credit based in part on an evaluation of classroom performance by the student supervising classroom teacher and marshall supervisor,which becomes a permanent part of the student teacher record.students must receive a score of at least basic on all competencies to receive credit for the course.id.
the handbook prescribes the attendance policy students are required to be present every day,but are allowed one to three absences for documented illnesses.if absences total more than three days,students will be required to complete an extended experience or return in a subsequent semester to complete the missed time.id.
kerr teaching experience deteriorated over the course of the fall semester.although the specific events of which she complains began in november,kerr also makes general references to a lack of support on the marshall side throughout the semester.
on the marshall side,during the fall semester,bailey was marshall edf coordinator,and southard was the marshall supervisor for students enrolled in edf.the complaint alleges that at the beginning of the semester,on or around august,bailey and southard learned that kerr is homosexual.kerr claims that each time she requested academic or professional support during the fall semester,she was stonewalled by bailey and southard.southard routinely ignored kerr emails,and the two marshall university employees gave antagonistic,perfunctory,dismissive and even dishonest responses to kerr reasonable requests for advice.id 
on the classroom side,kerr complaint focuses on her relationship with her supervising classroom teacher,kuhn.the gist of kerr complaint is that kuhn did not support her authority with the students.for example,according to kerr,students commented to her,we do have to do the work you give us.kuhn going to give us a good grade anyway.when kerr approached kuhn with her concerns,he responded with silence or cursory.id.kerr claims that she did not notify southard or bailey of the student comments or the resistance to her teaching because she had received no meaningful support from defendants southard or bailey in response to prior requests.id.despite these issues,kerr received positive evaluations until november.
on november,however,kerr discovered the grades kuhn had entered into the online grade book.in kerr view,kuhn had inflated the grades to such an extent as to amount to a free pass not to do the work kerr assigned.id.at this point,kerr decided to report her concerns to her marshall supervisor.
kerr sent an email to southard and kuhn,advis ing the two that kuhn conduct had seriously undermined the professional relationship in the exercise of her best professional judgment,kerr would suspend further interaction with kuhn pending from marshall and she understood that she had fully satisfied the requirements for student teaching.id.at that point,neither kuhn nor southard had completed kerr evaluation of classroom performance.the next day,bailey in her capacity as edf coordinator responded to the message and a meeting was set for december.
at the december,meeting,kerr met with bailey and eagle,a dean of marshall university college of education.bailey and eagle informed kerr that she would be denied academic credit for her student teaching experience,would not receive her master degree,and would not be recommended for teacher certification.during the meeting,bailey read allegations against kerr from statements provided by kuhn and southard,of which kerr complains she had no prior knowledge.id.kerr was handed documents that included kuhn evaluation,which kerr read and attempted to dispute,but she was told that the statements were dispositive against her.id.according to kerr,she was notified that her only opportunity to be heard would occur during the appeal process.kerr sought to persuade the marshall administration to reconsider its decision,but,on december,the grade was entered into kerr permanent academic record.id.
marshall provides an internal,appeals process to mat students who are dissatisfied with a given grade.the grade is reviewed first by course staff,then by the deans of the college of education,and finally by the dean of graduate studies.kerr submitted a appeal statement with supporting exhibits at the first stage of her appeal,before appellees southard and bailey.they upheld the denial of credit,and kerr moved to the second step.
appellees eagle and heaton,both deans of marshall college of education,decided the second step of kerr appeal.the complaint alleges that,in refusing to change kerr grade of no credit,eagle and heaton relied on new false statements plainly contradicted by marshall own records and failed to address the evidence and arguments kerr had presented.
appellee pittenger,the dean of graduate studies at marshall,heard kerr final appeal.kerr submitted an additional appeal statement that included exhibits.pittenger nevertheless upheld kerr grade of no credit,stating that kerr had raised her complaints about kuhn too late in the semester for marshall to address them in the manner kerr desired.
on march,kerr filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia.the complaint raises seven claims defamation against appellees mubg,kuhn,southard,and bailey tortious interference with a business expectancy against appellees mubg,kuhn,southard,bailey,and eagle the tort of outrage against appellees mubg,kuhn,southard,bailey,and eagle a violation of kerr due process rights under against appellees mubg,southard,bailey,and eagle a violation of kerr equal protection rights pursuant to,on the basis of kerr sexual orientation,against appellees mubg,southard,bailey,eagle,heaton,and pittenger a violation of kerr equal protection rights under,as a class of one,against appellees mubg,southard,bailey,eagle,heaton,and pittenger and a violation of the fair labor standards act flsa,against appellees mubg and kuhn.kerr seeks compensatory damages against mubg and the individual appellees and injunctive relief against mubg.
appellees moved to dismiss kerr action pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge for the submission of proposed findings and recommendations pursuant to b b.the magistrate judge reviewed the complaint and the parties memoranda of law and recommended that the district court grant appellees motion to dismiss in its entirety.see kerr marshall.bd.of governors,wl,at,magistrate judge report.kerr objected to all but one of the magistrate judge proposed findings and to all of the magistrate judge recommendations.the district court,reviewing the in light of those objections,granted appellees motion to dismiss.kerr marshall.bd.of governors,wl,at,district court opinion.this appeal followed.
on appeal,kerr argues that the district court erred in granting appellees motion to dismiss.kerr claims that the district court erred by submitting her claim to a magistrate judge for,that mubg was not entitled to sovereign immunity,and that her complaint plausibly alleged each of her seven claims.after setting out the relevant standard of review,we address each of kerr arguments in turn.
we review de novo a district court application of sovereign immunity,wildlife fed limehouse,cir,and dismissal for failure to state a claim,clatterbuck,at.
in our review of a b dismissal,we accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the complaint.wag more dogs,llc cozart,at.in order to state a claim,those f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atl.twombly,citation omitted.a complaint must therefore allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.in reviewing the motion,we are not bound by the legal conclusions drawn in the complaint.adcock freightliner llc,cir.citing dist,united mine workers of,wellmore coal,cir.
we are mindful of our obligation to liberally construe a pro se complaint.see jehovah clarke,cir.citing jackson lightsey,cir.although this court has not determined whether a pro se plaintiff who is also an attorney receives the benefit of this liberal construction,we need not decide that issue here kerr complaint fails whether or not it is liberally construed.we note that kerr arguments are not always a model of clarity.out of an abundance of caution,on these facts,and in accordance with the liberal construction we afford a pro se complainant,we construe kerr arguments as best we can given the thrust of her appeal.
we first consider kerr argument that t he district court erred in giving the complaint short shrift because plaintiff is acting pro se,appellant br.at,and applied an standard,id.at kerr seems particularly troubled by the fact that her civil action was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to the district court standing order,claiming that there is zero authority for subjecting actions to.see id.at.we hold that the district court demonstrably did not give kerr complaint short shrift.
first,as the indicates,the district court assigned kerr complaint to the magistrate judge pursuant to b b.magistrate judge report at.section b permits a district court to assign any pretrial matter to a magistrate judge kerr is correct that two of the three categories of matters that may be referred to a magistrate judge for pursuant to b b relate to prisoner litigation.but she is incorrect that this means the district court lacked the authority to refer her matter to a magistrate judge or that the magistrate judge somehow treated her action analogously to prisoner litigation.
moreover,the district court accurately stated and applied the proper standard of review of the magistrate judge.in its memorandum opinion and order dismissing kerr complaint,the district court reviewed de novo each of the magistrate judge findings and recommendations to which kerr objected.see b c in doing so,the district court also considered the fact that kerr was a pro se plaintiff and afforded her pleadings a liberal construction.district court opinion at citing estelle gamble,loe armistead,cir.
contrary to kerr argument,the district court did not merely adopt the bulk of the magistrate proposed findings and recommendation.see appellant br.at.rather,the district court conducted an exhaustive review of the magistrate judge.in fact,the district court reasoning substantively differs from the with respect to a number of kerr claims we hold that the district court properly referred appellees motion to dismiss to a magistrate judge,and the referral and review process did not prejudice kerr in any way.
next,we address kerr argument that the district court erred in dismissing all claims against mubg on sovereign immunity grounds in doing so,the district court found mubg to be an arm of the state for purposes of sovereign immunity and held that no exception to state sovereign immunity applied.district court opinion at.thus,sovereign immunity barred all claims against mubg.id.at.kerr does not contest the district court finding that mubg is an arm of the state.instead,kerr argues that her claims fall into an exception to sovereign immunity because the j udicially implied exceptions to title ix can not survive obergefell and bostic.appellant br.at.
kerr alleges that her equal protection rights were violated on the basis of her sexual orientation.we need not reach the merits of the argument,however,because as kerr acknowledges,her complaint makes no mention of title ix as a basis for liability or relief,or as an exception to sovereign immunity.see appellant br.at.we agree with the district court that,w hile the court liberally construes plaintiff claims,it will not fundamentally rewrite the causes of action provided in the complaint.district court opinion at.in short,even liberally construed,kerr complaint does not present this legal issue.
we turn next to kerr argument that the district court erred in its decision to dismiss all of kerr claims against the remaining appellees for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as we explain below,on the basis of the facts in the complaint and the handbook on which the complaint relies,we are constrained to disagree.
we begin with kerr claim for defamation against appellees mubg,kuhn,southard,and bailey.we note that the allegedly defamatory statements,which kuhn made in connection with his evaluation of kerr student teaching,underlie most of kerr claims.the district court found that the complaint general assertions that kuhn statements included false accusations,without any additional information or context,did not provide any indication that kuhn statements were not based on opinion.district court opinion at.on appeal,kerr argues that the district court erred in determining that the statements kuhn made about kerr in his evaluation of her were opinions not capable of defamatory meaning.appellees contend that the district court properly determined that the statements were not capable of a defamatory meaning,and in the alternative,that the statements were protected by qualified privilege.
as we explain below,we agree with the district court that all of the specific statements were solely opinion along the lines of the statements found to be by the supreme court of appeals of west virginia.id.citing hupp sasser.even if the complaint had alleged statements capable of defamatory meaning,the claim would still fail because the statements alleged are privileged.
under the familiar erie doctrine,we apply state substantive law and federal procedural law when reviewing claims.see hartford fire ins.harleysville mut.ins,cir.erie tompkins.a successful claim for defamation under west virginia law requires proof of defamatory statements a nonprivileged communication to a third party falsity reference to the plaintiff at least negligence on the part of the publisher and resulting injury.syl.pt,belcher stores,citing syl.pt,crump beckley newspapers.in other words,
to have a defamation claim,a plaintiff must show that false and defamatory statements were made against him,or relating to him,to a third party who did not have a reasonable right to know,and that the statements were made at least negligently on the part of the party making the statements,and resulted in injury to the plaintiff.
bine owens.
whether a statement is capable of a defamatory meaning is a matter of law for the court to decide.syl.pt,belcher,at citing syl.pt,long egnor.as the west virginia supreme court has noted,a statement of opinion which does not contain a provably false assertion of fact is entitled to full constitutional protection.syl.pt,hupp,at quoting syl.pt,maynard daily gazette.this inquiry is.id.at.
kerr complaint alleges that kuhn evaluation contained three types of defamatory language f alse accusations of dishonest and unethical conduct against kerr d irect statements by both defendants kuhn and southard that kerr was unqualified to become a teacher and e valuations of kerr as unsatisfactory in numerous areas which had previously been evaluated as positive.thus,we consider whether,under west virginia law,statements in an academic evaluation that an individual is dishonest,unethical,unqualified to become a teacher,and unsatisfactory,are capable of defamatory meaning.
in hupp sasser,the west virginia supreme court of appeals considered statements made by the dean of west virginia university school of journalism that a graduate assistant was unprofessional and that the graduate assistant behavior was unacceptable.at.the west virginia supreme court held that those statements were not capable of defamatory meaning,even if they might not reflect the same conclusion that other individuals would reach when considering the plaintiff behavior.id.at.because those statements were clearly not provably false,they were protected.id.
here,statements that kerr was unqualified and performed unsatisfactory ily are analogous to those the west virginia supreme court rejected in hupp.although kerr might disagree with them,kuhn statements are clearly not provably false.see id.to the extent that the first category of statements expressed kuhn judgment that kerr is dishonest and unethical,those statements would also be opinions not capable of defamatory meaning under hupp.
even if the complaint had plausibly alleged that appellees had made statements capable of defamatory meaning,appellees statements would still be protected by qualified privilege under west virginia law,any defamation claim must be based on a non privileged communication to a third party.syl.pt,belcher,at citing syl.pt,crump,at.like determining whether a statement is capable of defamatory meaning,at least in the absence of controversy as to the facts,the existence of a qualified privilege is a question of law for the courts.syl.pt,id.citations omitted.we evaluate that privilege here on the bases of the facts alleged in kerr complaint and the handbook policies,and we hold that the statements were protected by qualified privilege.
the supreme court of west virginia has explained that 
q ualified privileges are based upon the public policy that true information be given whenever it is reasonably necessary for the protection of one own interests,the interests of third persons or certain interests of the public.a qualified privilege exists when a person publishes a statement in good faith about a subject in which he has an interest or duty and limits the publication of the statement to those persons who have a legitimate interest in the subject matter however,a bad motive will defeat a qualified privilege defense.
syl.pt,id.at quoting syl.pt,dzinglski weirton steel.importantly,the of qualified privilege is an essential element of a defamation claim under west virginia law.thus,in order to state a claim for defamation,a complaint must plausibly allege,among other facts,that appellees published the statements to individuals who did not have a legitimate interest in them.
with respect to publication,kerr complaint alleges that kuhn communicated the statements to defendants southard,bailey,and mubg,and that southard at least negligently ratified,adopted and on information and belief actively solicited defendant kuhn false and defamatory statements and communicated them to defendants mubg and bailey.further,kerr contends that bailey ratified the statement and communicated it to mubg,which also ratified kuhn statements before it communicated them to kerr prospective employers and other members of the public,as part of kerr permanent academic record.id.
although the complaint accuses southard,bailey,and eagle of ratifying kuhn statements,the complaint never alleges that the statements were published outside of the marshall administration,much less to a third party who did not have a reasonable right to know.see belcher.at the handbook belies any argument that putting the evaluation in kerr permanent academic record constituted publication to a third party without a reasonable right to know.the evaluations are automatically placed in students permanent academic records,but students must consent to having their evaluations made available to potential employers.kerr therefore does not plausibly allege that any third parties without a reasonable right to know had access to her academic record.
here,the handbook readily establishes that kuhn had a duty to review kerr integrity,professionalism,and competence in kerr student teaching evaluation and that his candor would benefit the public interest.given that kerr was pursuing her teaching license,and given kuhn position as her supervising classroom teacher,it was reasonably necessary to ensure that the social studies students in west virginia were taught by qualified educators.thus,the district court did not err in dismissing kerr defamation claim 
the district court also dismissed kerr second claim for tortious interference with business expectancy against appellees mubg,kuhn,southard,bailey,and eagle.on appeal,kerr contends that the district court erred by factually finding contrary to the complaint that kerr had no valid expectancy of employment.appellant br.at.we disagree.
under west virginia law,a claim for tortious interference with business expectancy requires proof of four elements existence of a contractual or business relationship or expectancy an intentional act of interference by a party outside that relationship or expectancy proof that the interference caused the harm sustained and damages.syl.pt,structures,of virginia,quoting syl.pt,torbett wheeling dollar sav.trust.while no written contract is required for a claim for tortious interference,the complaint must still allege that the interference caused the harm sustained.
kerr claims that she had been invited and encouraged to apply for two teaching positions,that kerr had applied for one of those positions,and that kerr expected to be interviewed as soon as she graduated from marshall and received her teaching certification.kerr claims that kuhn statements in his evaluation of her performance which southard,bailey,and eagle included in her permanent academic record interfered with her expectation that she would be a gainfully employed teacher after receiving her mat and teacher certification.because kerr expectation of employment was mere speculation,however,she has not plausibly alleged that the interference could have caused the harm sustained.
according to the allegations of the complaint itself,kerr supposed business expectancy was but a subjective hope.as the complaint notes,kerr was still weeks away from earning her mat and teaching license and did not have the ability to gain employment as a teacher at the time the statements were made.the complaint in no way alleges that kerr had completed the course requirements of edf,let alone all of the requirements to become a teacher,by november,when the conduct at issue occurred.even accepting kerr statement in her november,email that she understood that she had fully satisfied the requirements for student teaching,the complaint does not allege that she completed the other requirements for edf credit.
more to the point,kerr did not have an existing offer for employment or reasonable expectation with which any of the appellees could have interfered.she had not been offered an interview for the job to which she applied,and she had not even applied to the other.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed kerr claim for tortious interference.
we turn next to kerr contention that the district court erred in dismissing her claim for the tort of outrage also known as intentional infliction of emotional distress against appellees mubg,kuhn,southard,bailey,and eagle.the district court held that kerr failed to state an outrage claim because the conduct alleged did not meet the outrageous standard required by west virginia law.district court opinion at.kerr argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding appellants had not acted outrageously.
under west virginia law,the tort of outrage requires proof of four elements 
that the defendant conduct was atrocious,intolerable,and so extreme and outrageous as to exceed the bounds of decency that the defendant acted with the intent to inflict emotional distress,or acted recklessly when it was certain or substantially certain emotional distress would result from his conduct that the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiff to suffer emotional distress and,that the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.
syl.pt,travis alcon,whether conduct may reasonably be considered outrageous is a legal question,syl.pt,which courts determine on a basis,hines hills dep t stores,citing restatement second of torts.
in order for the outrageous standard to be met,the conduct must be so outrageous in character,and so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.harless first nat.bank in fairmont,quoting restatement second of torts,cmt.the conduct must be more than merely annoying,harmful of one rights or expectations,uncivil,negligent or overzealous.hines,at citing courtney courtney.
the complaint alleges that the appellees engaged in reckless or intentional conduct by causing the false and misleading statements in kuhn evaluation to be included in kerr permanent academic record and by denying or conspiring to deny kerr academic credit,her degree,and her teacher certification.kerr also claims that eagle threat to provide kuhn evaluation to potential employers constituted the tort of outrage.we agree with the district court that appellees conduct does not rise to the exacting standard imposed by west virginia law.see district court opinion at citation omitted.
while the allegations in the complaint do not depict the marshall administration as particularly kind or sympathetic in their interactions with kerr,the complaint does not identify any behavior that was beyond all possible bounds of decency.kuhn unflattering comments notwithstanding,kerr did fail to complete her student teaching assignment.on these facts,we hold that the district court properly dismissed kerr claim of outrage.
kerr contends that her due process rights were violated by appellees mubg,southard,bailey,and eagle when they depriv ed her of protected property interests in academic credit,graduation,certification and prospective employment without notice or opportunity to be heard.procedurally,the district court determined that kerr was given all the process she was due substantively,the district court defer red to appellees professional academic judgment,because there was no evidence the decision was arbitrary or capricious.district court opinion at 
kerr argues on appeal that the district court erred in ruling that universities have a due process right to establish and withhold procedural protections on a whim.appellant br.at.as a preliminary matter,we note that the district court did not make this holding in dismissing kerr due process claim.we construe kerr argument to be that the district court erred in assuming that kerr had a property interest in the continuation of academic endeavors and determining that she was nevertheless given all the process that was due.this argument,too,fails.
we do not believe that kerr alleged even the protected property interest that she argues this court should recognize.even if there were a protected property interest in academic credit,graduation,certification and prospective employment,the complaint does not plausibly allege that kerr had a legitimate claim of entitlement to that property interest,even construed liberally.even still,marshall provided ample process through its tripartite appeals process,and the record contains ample justification for marshall decision.
in order to state a claim for a violation of due process,a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support a finding that the plaintiff was deprived of life,liberty,or property,by governmental action.equity in athletics,dep t of,cir.quoting beverati smith,cir.the fourteenth amendment does not create a property interest itself,rather the property interest must be created or defined by an independent source.id.citations omitted.for a property interest in a certain government benefit,a person must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.mallette arlington cty.emps.supplemental ret.ii,cir.quoting bd.of regents roth.
both substantive and procedural due process rights are triggered by a legitimate claim of entitlement to a property interest.for procedural due process claims,the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in life,liberty,or property is not in itself unconstitutional what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest without due process of law.zinermon burch,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.substantive due process claims,however,deal with the reasonableness of the governmental decision.where executive action is concerned,a violation of an individual substantive due process rights exists only when the official action is so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.hawkins freeman,cir.quoting cty.of sacramento lewis.
here,kerr did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the property interest of academic credit,graduation,certification,and prospective employment that she claims triggered her due process protections.the complaint is clear that kerr was weeks away from receiving her mat when she notified marshall that she would not return to her edf assignment.although kerr told marshall that she believed she had completed the student teaching requirements,kerr complaint does not allege that she did so.importantly,kerr does not allege that she had completed any of the three components of her edf grade,which included her student teaching evaluation as well as a portfolio and oral presentation.and because kerr did not complete the requirements for edf credit and therefore graduation and teacher certification,she did not allege that she had the legitimate claim of entitlement to the due process she argues she was denied.
regardless,marshall provided kerr as a student with a grade complaint the process she was entitled to,as outlined in the handbook.under the handbook,kerr was not entitled to abandon her student teaching and also expect to earn credit in the course.indeed,the edf attendance policy is strict,and kerr does not allege that her absences were excused by any of the handbook approved reasons.by kerr own admission,she received scores of unsatisfactory across numerous metrics,which itself precludes credit in edf.kerr allegations also establish that she in fact had shortcomings in the classroom students were disengaged,refused to take her direction,and claimed they did not have to do the work she assigned.kerr also readily admits that she left her placement on november,and made it clear,unilaterally,that she would not return.attendance and classroom instruction are both required as part of edf.
to the extent that kuhn or southard would have been required to implement an improvement plan for kerr if she had stayed in the program,the allegations in the complaint reveal that kerr did not consider this to be an option.kerr allegations are clear that,for her,the incident with kuhn undermined any professional training or experience that kerr might further gain in defendant kuhn classroom and that she considered herself to have completed the course requirements.kerr therefore did not return for the final weeks of her assignment.
furthermore,kerr was given ample opportunity to challenge her grade using marshall internal processes.she presented her argument to five different marshall administrators,including the dean of marshall graduate studies.with respect to three of those five administrators including pittenger,the final the complaint does not allege that they harbor any resentment against kerr for any reason,or even that they had interacted with kerr outside of the appeals process.after kerr three appeals to marshall,her grade of no credit stood because her complaints about kuhn,even if they were legitimate,were raised too late for marshall to take corrective action during the fall semester.the internal appeals process was sufficient to protect kerr procedural due process rights,and this court should not upset the decision absent an indication that the substance of marshall decision was arbitrary and capricious.
the complaint,read in light of the handbook,does not plausibly allege that the decision to award kerr a grade of no credit was arbitrary and capricious,much less that it shock ed the conscience,as would be required to state a claim for a violation of kerr substantive due process rights.marshall had multiple rational reasons to award a grade of no credit to kerr.kerr received unsatisfactory marks on her evaluation,left her placement early,and never requested reassignment to complete her coursework before the end of the semester.the district court therefore properly dismissed kerr due process claim.
kerr claims for a violation of her equal protection rights against appellees mubg,southard,bailey,eagle,heaton,and pittenger include both a discrimination theory and a theory.on appeal,kerr argues that the district court erred by creating a broad academic discretion loophole in constitutional mandates that can be invoked on b.appellant br.at.we construe kerr argument to be that the district court erred by finding that kerr failed to allege discriminatory intent required for her equal protection violation on a sexual orientation discrimination theory,and by holding that,in an academic setting,it is not possible to state a claim for an equal protection violation under a class of one theory.we address each argument in turn.
kerr first equal protection claim arises from allegations that marshall discriminated against her on the basis of her sexual orientation.the district court dismissed this claim,holding that kerr complaint failed to make specific allegations as to when or how each individual defendant learned of kerr sexual orientation and was completely devoid of any allegation that defendants treatment of kerr differed from similarly situated students.district court opinion at.on appeal,kerr argues that she herself could represent both the person discriminated against and the similarly situated individual by alleging how she was treated before and after appellees discovered her sexual orientation.
although kerr complains that appellees eagle,heaton,and pittenger violated her equal protection rights,there is no allegation of overt discriminatory animus on the part of any appellee.rather,the only fact alleged that relates to discrimination is that bailey and southard had knowledge of kerr sexual orientation.based on the complaint allegations,the district court properly dismissed kerr equal protection claim for intentional discrimination.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment declares that n o state shall deny to any person the equal protection of the laws,amend.xiv.this does not forbid states from classifying individuals at all rather it keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.nordlinger hahn.this court has noted,
t o succeed on an equal protection claim,a plaintiff must first demonstrate that he has been treated differently from others with whom he is similarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the result of intentional or purposeful discrimination.once this showing is made,the court proceeds to determine whether the disparity in treatment can be justified under the requisite level of scrutiny.
morrison garraghty,cir.
absent knowledge of kerr sexual orientation,eagle,heaton,and pittenger could not have intentionally discriminated against kerr on that basis.further,the complaint does not allege any interactions with bailey and southard before they learned of kerr sexual orientation,much less interactions that stand in contradistinction to how appellants treated kerr after the discovery.although the complaint alleges that southard and bailey knew kerr is homosexual,it does not allege that bailey and southard ever dealt with kerr before they knew her sexual orientation the complaint alleges that the two learned of this fact at the beginning of the fall semester,in august.thus,kerr equal protection claim for intentional discrimination fails 
kerr also alleges that the decision of appellees mubg,southard,bailey,eagle,heaton,and pittenger to deny her credit for edf constituted an equal protection violation under a theory.an equal protection violation can be stated under this theory if it can be shown that the government action constituted irrational and wholly arbitrary discrimination of that individual.vill.of willowbrook olech.in other words,there must be no rational basis for the difference in treatment.willis town of marshall,cir.
kerr challenges the district court holding that the supreme court decision in engquist or.dep t of,holding that a class of one equal protection theory does not apply in the context of public employment,precludes a equal protection claim in the setting.see district court opinion at.as we have explained above,the complaint,read in light of the handbook,does not plausibly allege conduct from which we could conclude appellees lacked any rational basis for giving kerr a grade of no credit in edf.we therefore need not decide whether a class of one equal protection theory is possible in the public education setting and hold that the district court did not err in dismissing this claim.
