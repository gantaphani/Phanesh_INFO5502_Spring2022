this case began as a dispute over the results of cm special education evaluation under the individuals with disabilities education act,et idea,but now has a convoluted procedural history,including three separate district court lawsuits and two administrative complaints.many of these issues are outside of the narrow scope of this appeal,however,and will not be addressed in this opinion.
this appeal is limited to two distinct issues.first,the administrative law judge alj dismissed several of cm claims against lafayette school district and the lafayette board of education collectively,lafayette prior to holding a due process hearing because the claims alleged conduct outside the idea statute of limitations.cm parents,mm and em collectively mm,sought review in the district court,which held that mm was not an aggrieved party under the idea because the alj had not yet held a due process hearing or issued a final ruling on mm complaint.second,the district court dismissed mm separate claims against the california department of education cde,in which mm alleged that the cde had failed to comply with its obligations under the idea when it closed its investigation of the allegations against lafayette.mm claimed that the cde had failed to properly supervise the hearing officers of the office of administrative hearings.the district court held that mm first claim was duplicative of his claim in another pending district court matter before the same judge,and that mm second claim failed to state a claim.we affirm because mm prematurely filed his complaint against lafayette in the district court and the cde has no authority to supervise the independent hearing officers.
cm is a boy who lives with his parents,mm and em,within the boundaries of the lafayette school district.cm began kindergarten in the lafayette school district in when he was six years old.at the time,he displayed deficits in the areas of reading,articulation,vision,and fine motor skills.during kindergarten,the district provided special reading,speech,and language services to cm as a guest of the district special education program.mm submitted a written request to the district to evaluate cm for learning disabilities on october,early in cm first grade year.lafayette did not provide an assessment plan for cm until february.
lafayette conducted cm initial evaluation in march and april.district staff and mm held the first meeting of cm individual education plan iep team on april,to discuss the results of cm educational assessment.the iep team determined cm was eligible for special education and related services and developed a program based on the assessment results.mm now complains that the initial evaluation was flawed because,among other things,the evaluation was conducted by individuals unqualified to select the appropriate tests or administer them.however,mm does not allege that he voiced any of these concerns at the time of the april,meeting,or at any time thereafter until he filed his due process complaint on april.
during the year after the initial evaluation,mm advised lafayette staff of his continued concerns that cm was falling further behind at school and that cm had special educational needs.mm asked lafayette if it would provide additional evaluations regarding cm speech and language needs,and his auditory processing.lafayette refused to provide additional evaluations,but recommended that mm obtain assessments of cm privately.between november and march,mm obtained private evaluations at his own cost that indicated cm had an auditory processing disorder that was related to his learning disability.there is no indication mm shared the results of the assessments with lafayette when they were completed.instead,mm apparently waited until september,to advise lafayette that he disagreed with the initial evaluation and request an independent educational evaluation iee 
once mm disagreed with the initial evaluation and requested an iee,lafayette had two choices.it could,without unnecessary delay,provide the requested iee or file a request for a due process hearing to defend the initial assessment with the california department of general services,office of administrative oah.b cal.c.lafayette declined to provide an iee,but it did not immediately request a due process hearing regarding the disagreement.
on november,mm filed a compliance complaint with the cde,alleging that lafayette failed to comply with idea procedures after his request for an iee.cde began an investigation.on december,lafayette filed a due process hearing request with the oah to defend its initial evaluation of cm the oah case.on december,lafayette requested that cde stay its investigation of mm complaint because the iee issue was pending before the oah in lafayette due process request.on january,cde closed its investigation pursuant to lafayette request.
on april,mm filed a due process complaint with the oah against lafayette the oah case,alleging separate issues.several of the issues concern lafayette alleged failure to identify cm disability before april.lafayette filed a motion to dismiss the claims that arose before april,as being barred by the statute of limitations in the idea,f c.on may,the alj dismissed claims one through six because they arose before april.the rest of the issues remained live in the oah case,and were to be resolved at the due process hearing.
rather than wait for the resolution of the oah case at the due process hearing,mm filed a lawsuit against lafayette in the district court on august,challenging the alj dismissal of the claims that the alj had determined were barred by the statute of limitations.lafayette filed a motion to dismiss mm complaint,but before the hearing on the motion,mm filed a first amended complaint fac.the fac added the lafayette board of education as a defendant,and included new claims against the cde and its superintendent,who the fac also added as defendants after all defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the district court dismissed the fac on june.
claims against lafayette 
the first three claims in the fac,all against lafayette,challenged the alj dismissal of the six claims,sought a determination that lafayette initial evaluation of cm educational needs was inadequate,and sought attorney fees.the district court found that these claims were premature as mm was not an aggrieved party because the aoh case was still pending.the court dismissed these claims without prejudice to once the alj issued his final ruling.
the fourth claim was based on cde closure of its investigation of mm complaint and alleged violations of the fifth amendment,the idea,and.the court dismissed the fourth claim for relief with prejudice,finding it was duplicative of another pending district court action before the same judge,case,and because it was based entirely on the administrative record in the oah case,the subject of case.
claims against cde 
the fac fourth claim was also brought against the cde,and as discussed,was dismissed with prejudice as duplicative of another pending case.the fifth claim,which was brought against cde,the dgs and its director,alleged that cde failed to conduct proper oversight of the oah hearing process and that it failed to provide appropriate instruction and guidance for the oah hearing officer in violation of the fifth amendment,the idea,and.the district court dismissed the fifth claim against cde with prejudice,finding that cde had no authority to oversee or supervise the individual hearing officers of the oah,which is an independent state agency.
the district court granted mm leave to file an amended complaint against dgs not later than june,and granted leave to against lafayette once the alj had issued his final decision.when mm failed to file an amended complaint,the court dismissed the entire action without prejudice on july.the court entered judgment on august,mm timely filed his notice of appeal on august,we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.

ii.claims against lafayette 
the idea provides a right to bring a civil action to a ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made by the alj in a due process hearing.i a.the alj dismissed several of mm claims against lafayette prior to the due process hearing because they arose outside of the idea statute of limitations.the district court dismissed mm fac against lafayette,finding that cm and his parents were not yet aggrieved parties within the meaning of the idea because the alj had not yet issued his final decision.mm contends that the idea does not require a plaintiff to wait until a final decision has been issued before seeking judicial review challenging rulings.this court has not previously addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff must wait until an alj issues a final decision before seeking judicial review.
the idea provides a private right of action in the district courts by an aggrieved party under two circumstances.i first,a party may bring suit if he or she is aggrieved by the findings and decision made under subsection f or k i a.mm contends that he brought his action under subsection f.however,subsection f concerns due process hearings,and the only decision contemplated by the plain meaning of that subsection is the decision following the due process hearing f,f e.because the ruling dismissing the six claims at issue here was rendered before the due process hearing,this subsection does not apply thus,the first cited provision of i does not provide mm a right to bring suit challenging this ruling.
a second provision under i allows an action by any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under this subsection id.i a.subsection i concerns decisions made in two made in a due process hearing and decisions made during a state administrative appeal.id.i.nothing in subsection i specifically allows immediate judicial review of a ruling.
the district court concluded that mm claims were premature since the alj had not yet held a due process hearing and issued a decision.the district court read i to permit a claim only by parties aggrieved by the findings and decision issued by a hearing officer after the due process hearing emphasis added.several cases,including those cited by the district court,support this interpretation and indicate that a party may not proceed as an aggrieved party under the statute until a final decision has been issued following a due process hearing.the clearest such statement is in the district court decision in lake washington 
plaintiff is not aggrieved by the decision made by the alj,for the simple reason that the alj has not yet rendered his final decision.the idea does not permit a plaintiff,allegedly aggrieved by a prehearing order,to file a complaint in federal court while administrative proceedings are still pending and seek the functional equivalent of an interlocutory appeal.
lake.sch.dist.office of superintendent of pub.instruction,wl,at.april.on appeal,we affirmed.lake.sch.dist.office of superintendent of pub.instruction,cir stating o nce the state educational agency has reached a decision,an aggrieved party may sue in federal court.however,we did not reach the issue of whether a plaintiff may seek interlocutory review of a ruling in the district court because we held that the school district lacked constitutional standing and that the idea provided a right of action only to students and parents,not the school district.id.at.
the supreme court has also used language that suggests that a party in an idea case must wait for the final decision following the due process hearing before filing suit in district court.in winkelman ex rel.winkelman parma city school district,d,the court explained that,o nce the state educational agency has reached its decision,an aggrieved party may commence suit in federal court any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made by the hearing officer shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.id.at quoting i a alteration original.however,winkelman did not involve interlocutory review of a ruling,so its language is dicta.
we have similarly stated the rule as permitting judicial review following a final determination of the due process hearing.lucht molalla river sch,cir stating a parent of a disabled child has the right to appeal the final decision of the administrative agency to the district court emphasis added.lucht does not decide the issue,however,because it did not involve a decision and there was no analysis developing the stated rule.id.s tatements made in passing,without analysis,are not binding precedent.thacker fcc in re magnacom wireless,llc,cir.
in addition,other circuits have also suggested that a party may only file suit after the alj has issued a final decision following the due process hearing.after describing the hearing process and the administrative appeals available under the idea,the second circuit noted that 
the idea does not permit students or their parents to sue the moment they are dissatisfied with the outcome of any of these proceedings.rather,the idea grants prospective plaintiffs a federal or state cause of action only at the end of the administrative process to parties who are aggrieved by the final decision of a state educational agency,or,if the agency does not provide an internal avenue of appeal,by the final decision of the impartial hearing officer.
coleman newburgh enlarged city sch,cir staub,concurring.the discussion in coleman came in the context of requiring the parents to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit in court.however,mm arguably did exhaust his administrative remedies as to the six claims the alj dismissed.the question is whether he can immediately seek review of that dismissal in the district court,or must wait until the alj renders a final decision as to the remaining claims in his due process complaint.this question bears a strong resemblance to a familiar jurisdictional limitation over appeals from district court actions.
if mm sought to appeal a district court order dismissing some,but not all,claims before trial,the dismissal would not be appealable due to the final judgment rule.the supreme court has instructed that,as a general rule,a party is entitled to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered,in which claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation may be ventilated.digital equip.desktop direct,d.an order that adjudicates fewer than all claims of all parties is not final.nascimento dummer,cir.
although technically not applicable to the district court review of an idea case,the principles behind the final judgment rule emphasizing deference to the district court or in this case,the alj,the promotion of judicial efficiency,and avoiding the harassment and cost of multiple appeals of various rulings,see firestone tire rubber risjord,d all apply to judicial review of the alj decision on an idea claim in the same way that they apply to appellate court review of a district court ruling.while the district court did not expressly rely on it,the rationale behind the final judgment rule seems to be the same as the rationale behind the district court dismissal allowing mm to appeal aspects of the due process proceedings in a piecemeal fashion would run counter to the idea and would hinder efficient resolution of the administrative proceedings.
the final judgment rule is a jurisdictional requirement based on the statutory grant found in,which expressly provides that jurisdiction of the courts of appeals is limited to final judgments of the district courts.the idea,however,does not contain such an express limitation conditioning jurisdiction only to final rulings by aljs.therefore,while the principles behind the final judgment rule are helpful to the analysis of the issue,the final judgment rule is not itself a jurisdictional limit the district court consideration of an idea case.
thus,case law suggests that a party must wait for the final decision following a due process hearing to seek review in the district court
