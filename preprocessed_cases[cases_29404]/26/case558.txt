steubenville city schools,superintendent richard lucci,in his individual capacity only,and board members,daniel spahn,ruth ann bruzzese,william kerr,william hendricks,and richard beal,in their official capacities only,appeal the district court denial of qualified immunity in this action claiming a deprivation of plaintiff first and fourteenth amendment rights in defendants failure to offer plaintiff a permanent teaching position.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
patrick barrett barrett,received his bachelor degree in education in and was subsequently certified to teach elementary education.in november,wells elementary school wells,a steubenville city school,hired barrett as a substitute teacher.beginning in january,barrett substituted for an term,taking the place of a first grade teacher on maternity leave.the principal at wells,john holub holub,then offered barrett a substitute teaching position for the remainder of the school year to take the place of a fourth grade teacher on maternity leave.barrett accepted the position with the hope of receiving a teaching contract for the following school year.
in may,barrett was scheduled to be interviewed for a teaching position with steubenville city schools.prior to the interview,holub advised barrett that richard lucci lucci,who would be assuming the position of superintendent during the next school year,would not give barrett a teaching contract unless his son attended steubenville city schools.from the time that he was in kindergarten,barrett son had attended all saints,a catholic school.after barrett conversation with holub,barrett was interviewed by steubenville city schools administrators,including lucci,superintendent.lucci asked barrett where his son would be attending school the following year,and barrett told him that his son would finish the eighth grade next year at all saints.after the interview,barrett had another conversation with holub,who again indicated that lucci would not give barrett a teaching contract until he moved his son out of all saints and into steubenville city schools.
during the summer of,two teaching positions became available.barrett did not receive an offer for either position.in fact,a teacher who had not substituted with steubenville city schools was hired,despite a tradition within the school district to hire teachers who had previously substituted.
in august,barrett again interviewed with now superintendent lucci and informed him that his former job had recalled him back to work and he needed to make a decision.barrett asked lucci for a teaching contract with steubenville city schools.barrett claims that lucci told him,i ca promise a job if someone new is in this position,but if i am,you have a future here because you do such a good job.barrett claims that he relied on this promise in declining to return to his position with his former employer and instead served for another year as a substitute teacher.
during the school year,holub often expressed to barrett lucci disapproval of barrett son attending private school.barrett claims that in may,holub once again told barrett that he would never receive a teaching contract until he enrolled his son in steubenville city schools.also in may,lucci informed barrett that he should consider moving his son to public school for at least one year,insisting that barrett son would like it.barrett claims that he was under such pressure,especially after turning down employment with his former employer,that during the summer he enrolled his son in steubenville high school for the school year.even after he enrolled his son in steubenville city schools,barrett was not offered teaching positions when they became available.
in august,barrett again went to speak with lucci about his position.lucci asked barrett how his son felt about changing schools,and barrett replied that his son was unhappy.lucci informed barrett that it would be held against him if his son did not attend steubenville high school.lucci also explained to barrett that the school board liked for teachers to enroll their children in the public school system because it looked good to those parents whose children attended steubenville city schools.lucci stated that if barrett returned as a substitute,then he would be given a contract after his period was complete 
barrett began the school year as a substitute teacher with the expectation that he would receive a teaching contract.barrett,however,reconsidered his decision regarding his son education,removed him from steubenville high school,and enrolled him in catholic central high school.on september,barrett met with lucci and the assistant superintendent.barrett claims that lucci told him that he was being removed from his position as a fourth grade substitute teacher at wells.when barrett questioned lucci about the reason for his removal,lucci told him that he was being disloyal.lucci also expressed that he thought public high school would be better for barrett son.barrett then reminded lucci of his agreement to grant him a contract after barrett completed his sixty days of teaching in the classroom.lucci became irate,denied ever making such a promise,and ordered barrett to clean out his classroom that day.
consequently,in june,barrett filed suit in the district court against steubenville city schools,superintendent lucci,in his individual capacity,and board members spahn,bruzzese,kerr,hendricks,and beal,in their official capacities only.barrett asserted several claims,including civil rights violations under,religious discrimination under ohio law,breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and tortious interference with present contractual relations or prospective contractual relations or both.defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted defendants motion as to barrett federal and state claims of religious discrimination and as to barrett claim of equal protection and free exercise of religion under.the district court denied,however,defendants motion as to barrett parental rights claim under and the remaining state law claims.defendants timely filed this appeal.
the only issue before us on appeal is whether lucci is entitled to qualified immunity.in answering that question,we must determine whether the district court erred in finding that there is a clearly established constitutional right for parents to direct the education of their children and that lucci actions violated that right.for the reasons that follow,we find that the district court did not err in its conclusion.
ii.discussion 
a denial of summary judgment is ordinarily not a final judgment and therefore not reviewable on appeal.hoover radabaugh,cir.the present case,however,involves a decision by the district court to deny qualified immunity to a public official accused of violating plaintiff constitutional rights.d istrict court denials of qualified immunity may be appealed as collateral orders where the defendant is a public official asserting the defense of qualified immunity,and the issue appealed concerns not which facts the parties might be able to prove,but whether certain alleged facts reflect a violation of clearly established law.id.citations omitted.because defendants are not challenging the facts but rather claim that they did not violate the law,the jurisdictional requirements are met in the present case.
whether qualified immunity applies to an official actions is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.virgili gilbert,cir.qualified immunity is an affirmative defense that shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.once the defense is raised,the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the defendant conduct violated a right so clearly established that a reasonable official in that position would have clearly understood that he or she was under an affirmative duty to refrain from such conduct.rich city of mayfield heights,cir.the plaintiff,thus,bears the ultimate burden of proof to show that the defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity.wegener covington,cir.on appeal,in viewing the facts in favor of the plaintiff,we must decide first whether a constitutional violation occurred and second whether that right was clearly established.hoover,at.
violation of constitutional right 
to state a cause of action under,a plaintiff must allege the deprivation of a right secured by the united states constitution or a federal statute by a person who was acting under color of state law.spadafore gardner,cir.in this case,barrett has filed a complaint where the first claim for relief is entitled violation of civil rights.second amended complaint.in his complaint,under this particular claim,barrett alleged that he was told by defendant lucci that the school board wanted the children of its teachers enrolled in steubenville city schools.id.barrett alleged that holub told him that lucci was impressed with plaintiff patrick barrett qualifications but that he would not be hired for a position because plaintiff son attended a catholic school.id.barrett also alleged that he was denied teaching positions while his son was enrolled in private school,but once he enrolled his son in steubenville city schools,lucci promised him a contract.id.finally,barrett alleged that,after barrett removed his son from public school and him in private school,lucci terminated barrett for being disloyal.id.after citing the factual allegations,barrett then indicated that the defendants deprived him of not only his first amendment right to freedom of religion,but also of equal protection under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.id.
appellants argue that these allegations and legal assertions are insufficient to show a violation of barrett constitutional right to direct the education of his child.to support their argument,appellants cite our recent decision in spadafore gardner.in spadafore,we reviewed a dismissal of claims against defendants in their individual capacity.at.we found that the plaintiffs claims of violations were not adequately set forth in their complaint.id.at.in so finding,we noted that nowhere in the complaint wa s specifically invoked against the individual defendants.id.at.we also indicated that f rom the language of the complaint,one can not ascertain which substantive constitutional rights were allegedly violated.nor was this clarified in the plaintiffs response to the defendants motion for summary judgment.id.at.
here,the facts are clearly distinguishable.first,barrett provided a detailed description of the alleged violations.he asserted that lucci not only conditioned his employment on where his son attended school,but also terminated him once his son was removed from public school.barrett specifically pleaded these allegations under the claim for violations.additionally,unlike the plaintiff in spadafore.barrett clarified any possible confusion in his response to defendants motion for summary judgment we,therefore,find that the facts as alleged by barrett set forth a claim that lucci violated his constitutional right to rear his child.
constitutional right clearly established 
once we have found a violation of a constitutional right under the plaintiff facts,we must then determine if that right was clearly established.hoover,at.we look to whether a reasonable official would understand that his actions violated that right.id.at.this court has emphasized that to find a clearly established constitutional right,a district court must find binding precedent by the supreme court,its court of appeals or itself.ohio civil serv.employees ass seiter,cir.in an extraordinary case,decisions of other circuits may be used to clearly establish a principle of law if they point unmistakably to the unconstitutionality of the conduct complained of and are so clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no doubt in the mind of a reasonable officer that his conduct,if challenged on constitutional grounds,would be found wanting.id.a few admittedly novel opinions from other circuit or district courts are not enough to form the basis for a clearly established constitutional right in the sixth circuit.id.
here,the district court correctly determined that the right to direct the education of one child was clearly established.both the supreme court and this court have repeatedly recognized that parents have a fundamental right to raise their children,including directing their children education.see,meyer nebraska.recognizing the right of the parent to give his children education suitable to their station in life pierce society of sisters.striking down state law that required parents to send their children to a public school for a period of time because it unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control wisconsin yoder,d finding that primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring american tradition zelman,d thomas,concurring emphasizing that t his court has held that parents have the fundamental liberty to choose how and in what manner to educate their children ohio ass of indep.sch.goff,cir recognizing that because parents have a constitutional right to direct their children education,organization has standing to bring claim on behalf of parents johnson city of cincinnati,cir stressing that b oth supreme court precedent and our national tradition suggest that a family member right to participate in child rearing and education is one of the most basic and important associational rights protected by the constitution.more specifically,the supreme court has also indicated that parents have a constitutional right to send their children to private schools and a constitutional right to select private schools that offer specialized instruction runyon mccrary,d.thus,it is clearly established that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children.
that barrett has the fundamental right to educate and raise his children,in and of itself,does not provide lucci with clearly established law that his actions violated this right.there is,however,precedent from both the supreme court and the sixth circuit that makes clear that lucci actions violated barrett fundamental parental right.in perry sindermann,the supreme court found unconstitutional the nonrenewal of a teaching contract on the basis of a teacher exercise of a constitutionally protected interest,d stating that the government may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests.we have decided several cases applying the principle of law set forth in perry.in littlejohn rose,we found that the refusal to rehire a teacher violated the constitutionally protected right of privacy if such denial was based on the teacher divorce,cir it is clear from the supreme court analysis in perry that a person involvement in activity shielded by the constitutionally protected rights of privacy and liberty constitutes an impermissible reason for denying employment.in adkins board of education of magoffin county,kentucky,plaintiff was denied employment with a school board simply because of her marriage to a person who her employer disliked.in finding that the district court erred in granting defendants motion to dismiss,we specifically stated that w hile the plaintiff had no contractual right to a job,she could not be deprived of her public employment for exercising a constitutional right.id.at.similarly,in montgomery carr,we found that i f the only motivation for a public official in taking some adverse employment action against a public employee is the public employee protected activity,then regardless of the level of scrutiny applied,such action is unconstitutional.therefore,based on precedent specific to this court,the government can not deny someone employment simply because that person is exercising his fundamentally protected right 
in this case,barrett made a decision to send his son to private school.barrett choice i
