education code section provides that,nonteaching community college positions qualify for classified service,entitling these employees to various job protections and benefits,such as vacation and sick leave.employees who work more than percent of a college year also are entitled to classified status.the issue presented here is whether substitute employees similarly qualify for classified status if they work more than percent of the academic year while temporarily replacing absent classified employees.
the california school employees association csea and three substitute nonacademic employees who worked days or more during the college year appeal the denial of their writ of mandate to compel the south orange county community college district the district to recognize the workers as classified employees.besides reclassification,csea sought lost wages,benefits and all other emoluments of employment and reinstatement for one of the claimants whose employment allegedly had been terminated.the district contends section excludes substitute employees from classified service regardless of the length of their service.it also argues csea claim is barred by res judicata,collateral estoppel,laches,and failure to provide notice under the government claims act,et.
we conclude that section entitles substitute workers to classified employee status if they work more than percent of the college year.we also conclude the district was entitled to notice under the government claims act.because the failure to provide notice does not affect csea claim for reclassification under section,we reverse the judgment.
facts and procedural background 
the district governing board oversees irvine valley college and saddleback college,and employs approximately teachers and classified employees who provide nonteaching services.per section,substitute employees and workers employed for less than percent of the college year were not entitled to classified service designation.according to the district,samuel hamblen,alfredo osuna,and gerald schwab were district employees falling within the latter category.
the district hired hamblen as a substitute warehouse worker during the school year.substituting for several classified employees,hamblen worked days during the college year.the district hired hamblen in august as a probationary classified worker after he submitted an application and interviewed for the position.before his hiring,the district did not consider hamblen a classified employee.
the district hired osuna as a substitute custodian and during the school year,he worked days while filling in for various employees.in august,the district hired osuna as a probationary employee after he participated in the competitive hiring process.as with hamblen,the district did not recognize osuna as a classified employee based on his service during the previous year.
schwab worked as a maintenance worker for the district from until july.according to his declaration,he worked over days in each of those years,but did not specify whether it was as a substitute or employee.the district disputes schwab claim he was discharged in may,claiming it never hired him as a regular or probationary employee,even though schwab applied for several openings.schwab claimed the district did not consider him a classified employee,therefore,he was not given a written notice of cause or provided a hearing to contest his discharge.
in,csea,hamblen,osuna,and schwab,citing section and provisions of csea collective bargaining agreement cba with the district,filed a formal grievance,alleging the trio had earned classified status by working over days as substitutes during the academic year.the dispute proceeded to an administrative hearing,with the arbitrator concluding the cba was too ambiguous to support petitioners claims they were entitled to classified status.the arbitrator declined to interpret section,explaining an arbitrator role should be confined to conventional contract interpretation,and suggesting the superior court should decide the issue.
in october,csea and the individual petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel the district to award classified status and lost wages to hamblen,osuna,and schwab.the trial court rejected the petition.interpreting section,the trial court concluded t he phrase,employed and paid for less than percent of a college year does not modify the term substitute in section.rather,that phrase modifies only the term employee.the court also found relief barred because the individual petitioners failed to comply with the notice provisions of the tort claims act,this appeal followed.
education code section 
this case concerns the proper interpretation of section.the statute provides,in relevant part,as follows the governing board of any community college district shall employ persons for positions that are not academic positions.the governing board shall classify all those employees and positions.the employees and positions shall be known as the classified service.substitute and employees,employed and paid for less than percent of a college year,shall not be a part of the classified service.italics added.
the legislature statutory scheme defines a classified position by describing what it is not.thus,e very position not defined by the regulations of the board of governors as an academic position and not specifically exempted from the classified service according to the provisions of section or shall be classified as required by those sections and shall be a part of the classified service.california school employees governing board cal th,fn,d.
with this legislative framework in mind,the parties agree employees working less than percent of the college year are specifically excluded from classified status.conversely,employees working more than percent of the academic year qualify for classified service because they are not specifically excluded under the statute.
the issue here is whether substitute employees are subject to the same requirement that they must work more than percent of the college year to gain classified status,or whether they are excluded altogether.the trial court adopted the district argument that the language employed and paid for less than percent of a college year did not modify the term substitute,but only the phrase immediate antecedent,employee.thus,a substitute employee can not qualify for classified status regardless of how many days the substitute worked during the academic year.we disagree.
we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.the primary purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the legislature intent.id.at,d.we turn first to the statutory language,being careful to give the statute words their plain,commonsense meaning.citation.if the language of the statute is not ambiguous,the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary.ibid.but if our analysis of the statutory language leaves doubt about meaning,we may consult other evidence of the legislature intent,such as the history and background of the measure.people birkett cal th,d.
in our view,the statutory language is clear.here,following routine grammatical construction,substitute is an adjective modifying the word employees.consequently,the statute can be read as follows substitute employees,employed and paid for less than percent of a college year,shall not be a part of the classified service.treating the word substitute as a noun,the trial court concluded the clause employed and paid for less than of a college year modified only the phrase employee.but under this interpretation the pertinent part of the statute would read substitute shall not be a part of the classified service.this makes no grammatical sense unless the reader pluralizes the word substitute.similarly,to achieve the district desired interpretation,a reader could assume the word employees implicitly follows substitute,so the sentence would read,substitute employees and employees,employed and paid for less than percent of a college year,shall not be a part of the classified service.our role,however,is not to redraft the statute,but to simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in the statute,not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been included.in other words,the courts may not,under the guise of construction,rewrite the law or give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.county of santa barbara connell th,d.
the district agreed at oral argument that the word substitute is an adjective modifying employees,but contends the last antecedent rule requires us to conclude the phrase employees is the only term modified by the clause employed and paid for less than percent of a college year.we are not persuaded.
the last antecedent rule,a hoary rule of statutory construction,provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.white county of sacramento cal d,white furtado sierra community college th,d.as with most rules,certain exceptions apply,and here they compel rejection of a mechanical application of the last antecedent rule.indeed,these exceptions underscore csea argument the word substitute is modified by the clause employed and paid for less than percent of a college year.
one exception stems from the legislature selection of certain punctuation.as our high court observed,e vidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.white,supra,cal d at,people steffens th,d sutherland,statutes and statutory construction singer.here,the qualifying phrase employed and paid for less than percent of a college year is separated from its antecedents by a comma,evidence that the qualifying clause applies to both substitute and employees.our supreme court has noted another exception the legislature use of the word or in a statute indicates an intention to use it disjunctively so as to designate alternative or separate categories.white,supra,at.as csea points out,the words substitute and are joined by the conjunction and,evidencing an intent that the terms be viewed as a single,joint last antecedent.
other courts have assumed the statute provides that substitute employees qualify for classified service if they work more than percent of the academic year.in california school employees oroville union high sch.dist.d.oroville,the appellate court interpreted section,an identically worded measure applying to elementary and secondary level employees.there,the court rejected csea claim a substitute employee need not serve all days in a single school year to earn classified status.in reaching this result,the court observed the unambiguous language of the statute provides that substitute employees shall not be a part of the classified service where they have been employed and paid for less than percent of the academic year.id.at,italics added.california sch.employees trona joint unified sch.dist.d,implicitly reached the same conclusion.there,two substitute employees argued they were entitled to benefits as classified employees under the predecessor statute to section.former.the court of appeal determined the word working in the phrase working days did not include saturdays and sundays,which meant the substitutes,who had worked and days,fell short of the statutory requirement.trona,supra,d at.the court would not have addressed the issue if all substitutes were excluded from classified service under the statute,as the district claims here.
based on the foregoing,we reject the district argument the last antecedent rule compels the conclusion section excludes all substitutes from classified service.in doing so,we recognize that p rinciples of statutory construction are not rules of independent force,but merely tools to assist courts in discerning legislative intent.renee superior court cal th,d.it is to this issue we now turn.
the district contends that when section is viewed as a whole,it is apparent the legislature intended to exclude from classified service all substitute employees,including those who worked more than percent of the college year.the district argument is not supported by the legislative history.in,the legislature amended section to include the following definition substitute employee,as used in this section,means any person employed to replace any classified employee who is temporarily absent from duty.because there was no reference to the requirement a substitute employee must work more than percent of the college year to attain classified service,the district surmises the amendment revealed the legislature intent to exclude from classified service all substitute employees,even those working more than percent of the academic year.according to the district,the amendment either provides evidence the legislature originally intended that the percent limitation apply only to employees,with substitute employees excluded altogether from classified service,or the amendment itself accomplished this result.
legislative history provided to the trial court,relating to and amendments to section,does not support the district position.rather,it reflects that the legislature understood the percent limitation applied to substitutes.for example,an analysis of assembly bill reg.sess.provided to the assembly education committee noted that c urrent law provides that governing boards of school and community college districts may hire persons for positions and such employees that are employed for less than percent of the school year are known as substitutes or employees neither of which shall be deemed as a classified employee.italics added.a similarly worded staff analysis summary was provided to the senate committee on industrial relations the governing boards may also hire substitute or employees for employment for less than percent of the school year.substitute or employees are not part of the classified service.
furthermore,according to the assembly education committee legislative analysis,dated march,the amendment was necessary precisely to curb the college practice of hiring substitute employees indefinitely to fill permanent positions.the analysis noted the districts saved money because substitute employees do not receive health benefits,vacation or sick leave,holidays,seniority or any other benefits of a classified employee.to remedy this,the legislature defined substitute employee as any person employed to replace a classified employee temporarily absent from duty,but allowed districts to hire substitutes for days while searching for a permanent replacement.no legislative analysis advised or suggested the amendment was intended to exclude all substitute employees from classified service,even if they worked more than percent of the college year in a position filled by an absent classified employee.the amendment author,assemblyman patrick johnston,summarized the effect of the proposed amendment in his letter urging the governor to sign the measure,but made no suggestion the amendment would exclude all substitute employees from classified service,regardless of how long they worked.in light of this evidence,we reject the district suggestion the amendment excluded from classified service substitutes who worked more than percent of the academic year.
the district fares no better when we consider the amendment.while this case was pending in the trial court,the legislature amended section to add the following qualification to hiring employees before employing a employee,the governing board,at a regularly scheduled board meeting,shall specify the service required to be performed by the employee pursuant to the definition of classification in subdivision a of section,and shall certify the ending date of service.the ending date may be shortened or extended by the governing board,but shall not extend beyond percent of a school year.according to the district,the legislature reference to the percent limitation in the section defining employee,and the failure to mention the percent limitation in the amendment defining substitute employee,makes clear that the percent limitation applies only to employees and not substitutes.the district offers no evidence to support this conclusion,which requires the adoption of a substantive change in the law through implication.balen peralta junior college dist.cal d,because substitute and temporary classifications are not guaranteed procedural due process by statute,courts presume they are narrowly defined and should be strictly interpreted.we also note the decision in oroville,supra,d,interpreted the percent restriction as applicable to both substitute and employees.it is a principle of statutory construction that when the legislature amends a statute without altering portions of the provision that have previously been judicially construed,the legislature is presumed to have been aware of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.marina point,wolfson cal d.in sum,if the legislature had intended to broaden the exclusions from classified service,we presume it would have said so directly.lesher communications,city of walnut creek cal d,repeals by implication disfavored.
the district next claims that construing section to allow substitute employees classified service would lead to absurd consequences.we are not persuaded.
when interpreting an ambiguous statute,consideration must be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.in this regard,it is presumed the legislature intended reasonable results consistent with its expressed purpose,not absurd consequences.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d.as discussed above,however,we do not find section ambiguous.true,in rare cases,statutory ambiguity is not a condition precedent to further interpretation,and the literal meaning of the words may be disregarded to avoid absurd results.but this approach is reserved for extreme cases where the absurdity is patent unzueta ocean view school dist.th,d.we must exercise caution using the absurd result rule otherwise,the judiciary risks acting as a by rewriting statutes to find an unexpressed legislative intent.id.at,d.with these principles in mind,we now consider the district absurd consequences argument.
according to the district,awarding classified service to substitute employees working more than days during the college year requires the district potentially to employ two classified employees for the same position.this is absurd,we are told,because classified status would create an illusion of permanency since the district,upon the incumbent return,would immediately terminate the former substitute and now newly classified probationary employee.but the result is the same even if substitutes are denied classified status the substitute employee would be discharged upon the classified employee return.the only difference is that the substitute worker,if employed more than days during the academic year,is entitled to various benefits,such as health insurance,while eligible.this outcome is not a patently absurd consequence.indeed,the legislature has taken into account the fiscal needs of community college districts by providing for summary discharge of probationary employees,subd.a.in addition,the districts may lay off classified employees if the college is unableto pay their salaries,subd.c.the legislature has balanced this concern with the rights of employees.simply put,it is not absurd to provide health coverage and other benefits for substitute workers whose service could extend well beyond the threshold requirement for classified service.the district may not view this as wise,but that does not render the statutory scheme absurd.see unzueta ocean view school,supra,th at,d.
the district other attempts to demonstrate the statute absurd consequences are equally unavailing.the district claims it would be forced to stagger the employment of different substitute employees to avoid any one replacement worker from meeting the classified service requirement,resulting in costly retraining of new substitutes.but as noted above,the legislature statutory framework provided various fiscal protections for community college districts.the district also complains the competitive hiring procedure is unfairly bypassed when a substitute employee qualifies for classified service.but the legislature reasonably could conclude only qualified substitutes would be retained to work more than percent of the college year,and therefore the importance of providing benefits to these workers takes precedence over hiring concerns,especially considering any new hire would be a probationary employee.in any event,questions concerning the conferral of employment rights and the allocation of economic resources involve policy decisions more appropriately addressed to the legislature,not the courts.eureka teacher board of education d.eureka.
government claims act notice provisions 
we now turn to whether petitioners are barred from obtaining lost wages based on their failure to provide notice under the government claims act.see,et the notice requirements ensure prompt claims investigation and possible settlement,enable the public entity to make appropriate fiscal adjustments,and provide the opportunity to avoid future liability by taking remedial steps to prevent a reoccurrence.phillips desert hospital dist.cal d,baines pickwick city of los angeles th,d baines.therefore an action for money or damages against a public entity may not proceed unless a written claim has first been presented to the governmental entity and the claim either has been granted or rejected.unless a specific exception applies,a suit for money or damages includes all actions where the plaintiff is seeking monetary relief,regardless whether the action is founded in tort,contract or some other theory.hart county of alameda th,d.
government code section lists several exceptions to the general rule that public entities must be provided notice of all claims for money or damages.relevant for our discussion is subdivision c,which excludes from notice requirements c laims by public employees for fees,salaries,wages,mileage or other expenses and allowances.here,the substitute employees claim for lost wages,based on their misclassification,falls within this exception.but this does not resolve the issue because another provision may override the exception.
government code section provides,in part a claims against a local public entity for money or damages which are excepted by section,and which are not governed by any other statutes or regulations expressly relating thereto,shall be governed by the procedure prescribed in any charter,ordinance or regulation adopted by the local public entity.b the procedure so prescribed may include a requirement that a claim be presented and acted upon as a prerequisite to suit thereon.if such requirement is included,any action brought against the public entity on the claim shall be subject to the provisions of section and section.
per government code section,the district adopted board policy,which in relevant part provides notwithstanding the exceptions continued sic in section of the government code of the state,all claims by public officers or employees for fees,salaries,wages,overtime pay,holiday pay compensating time off,vacation pay,sick leave pay,and any other expenses or allowances claimed due from the district,when a procedure for processing such claims is not otherwise provided by state or local laws,shall be presented within the time limitations and in the manner prescribed by sections through of the government code of the state.such claims shall further be subject to the provisions of section of the government code of the state relating to the prohibition of suits in the absence of the presentation of claims and action thereon by the district.
although petitioners were not required to provide the district notice under government code section et,the district contends notice was required under government code section and board policy.csea argues their claim was not based on money or damages,and therefore any monetary relief was merely incidental to their equitable ac
