plaintiff and appellant jane hemady plaintiff,a student,was struck in the face with a golf club by another student during a seventh grade physical education golf class.plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries from defendants and respondents the long beach unified school district the district and the instructor of the middle school golf class,brian feely feely,collectively,defendants.
this appeal requires us to determine the applicable standard of care that governs defendants potential liability for injuries occurring in a middle school golf class.under the general rule,persons have a duty to use due care to avoid injury to others,and may be held liable if their failure to use due care injures another person,cheong antablin cal th,d.we refer to this as the prudent person standard of care.
however,in knight jewett cal th,d,knight and kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d,kahn,the supreme court established an exception to the prudent person standard of care in certain sports settings.childs county of santa barbara th,d.this is because dangerous conditions or conduct are often an integral part of the sport itself.knight,at,d.to prevent a fundamental alteration of certain sports and to guard against chilling a coach role or discouraging vigorous participation in sports activities,in some cases,under the primary assumption of risk doctrine,a coach or coparticipant potential liability is not governed by the prudent person duty of care.rather,the coach or will only owe the plaintiff a limited duty of care not to intentionally injure a player or engage in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.id.at,d,kahn,at,d.we will refer to this as the limited duty of care.
in this case,as we will discuss,we find the defendants potential liability must be determined pursuant to the prudent person duty of care rather than the limited duty of care.that is because the policies that support the limited duty of care do not apply to a seventh grade golf class.applying a prudent person standard of care to determine defendants potential liability will not result in a fundamental alteration of the game of golf or the loss of an integral part of the sport.likewise,applying a prudent person standard of care in this case will not chill a coach role in challenging students to improve their golf game,and will not discourage vigorous participation by student athletes.
moreover,historically,the california supreme court has applied the prudent person standard of care to determine liability of school districts and their employees for injuries to students which occurred during school hours.see bellman san francisco dist.cal d,bellman injuries occurred during tumbling physical education class pirkle oakdale union.school dist.cal d,pirkle injuries occurred during supervised touch football game at noon recess and dailey los angeles unified school district cal d,dailey injuries occurred during unsupervised slap boxing after lunch.the supreme court in knight and kahn gave no indication that it intended to overrule or disapprove these authorities,which remain viable today.
because the trial court concluded that the limited duty of care applied,we reverse the summary judgment in favor of defendants and remand the action to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff sustains personal injury 
at the time of the incident,plaintiff was a seventh grade student at stanford middle school in long beach,california the school.physical education was a mandatory class at the school as part of the regular curriculum one of the options to satisfy the physical education requirement was the golf class.
in her declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,plaintiff stated that although she had never played golf,she enrolled in the class because the game interested her.
defendant feely began teaching physical education classes in.during the summer of,feely attended an seminar for teaching golf.this was the only training feely received for teaching a golf class.in september,feely began teaching physical education golf at the school.
the golf class commenced on september.on october,during the sixth day of golf class,feely was teaching the students the mechanics of the full golf swing.before feely permitted the students to take full swings,he identified safety precautions with regard to the golf club.feely told the students that golf clubs were made of wood or metal and could hurt them if they were hit by one.feely also instructed the students to stand behind the student hitting the ball.in feely opinion,being hit by a golf club was not an inherent risk in golf if the students followed the rules.
on the day in question,feely separated the students in the class into groups.he explained the whistle commands and signal system for when to hit the practice wiffle balls and when to rotate positions.the students at the front cones were to hit four balls.the other students were to stand and wait in a designated and marked area feet behind the students hitting the wiffle balls.
feely provided evidence that his practice was to blow a whistle to indicate when to hit the balls,when to retrieve the balls,and when the next student in line was to take a turn hitting.plaintiff,however,provided a declaration that feely did not follow this practice.according to plaintiff,the class was unorganized and uncontrolled,and feely instructions were confusing.according to plaintiff,at times students were left to their own devices to decide when it was time to hit and when it was time to change positions.
at some point,the student in front of plaintiff appeared to be finished.according to plaintiff,the student was looking around and not doing anything.plaintiff then stepped forward to place a ball on the grass.without warning,the student in front of plaintiff swung her club back and hit plaintiff in the mouth.in her declaration,plaintiff stated that feely had not given the whistle command for the person in front of plaintiff who hit her to hit the ball.in addition,plaintiff declared that feely did not give the whistle command to indicate when to change positions.at the time of the incident,feely was at one end of the field talking to other students.
plaintiff files suit 
on october,plaintiff,a minor,by and through her guardian ad litem,filed suit against the long beach unified school district,stanford middle school and instructor feely.the trial court overruled defendants demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence,but sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to all remaining causes of action.
trial court grants defendants motion for summary judgment 
in their motion for summary judgment,defendants asserted that pursuant to kahn,supra,cal th,d,plaintiff was required to show that feely conduct breached the limited duty of care.defendants asserted that as a matter of law,plaintiff could not make this showing.
in plaintiff opposition,she asserted that the prudent person standard of care governed defendants potential liability,not the limited duty of care.alternatively,plaintiff asserted that there were material facts in dispute as to whether feely conduct breached the knight kahn limited duty of care.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.the trial court ruled that the limited duty of care governed defendants potential liability.the trial court also found that plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact that defendants breached the limited duty of care.the trial court denied plaintiff motion for new trial.plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.
issue presented 
this appeal presents the issue of whether the limited duty of care or the prudent person standard of care governs the potential liability of defendants 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a trial court order granting a motion for summary judgment.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.a defendant moving for summary judgment must show that either one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
discussion 
duty of care is a question of law for the court 
in the area of sports activities,the court decides the existence and scope of a defendant duty of care as a question of law.the applicable duty of care depends on the nature of the sport at issue and the parties general relationship to the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d,kahn,supra,cal th at,d.it is for the court to decide whether an activity is an active sport,the inherent risks of that sport,and whether the defendant has increased the risks of the activity beyond the risks inherent in the sport.american golf superior court th,d see also ford polaris industries,th,d.
the knight and kahn cases and assumption of risk doctrine 
the knight and kahn courts recognized that some sports have inherent dangers and if tort liability rested on whether those dangers were eliminated,the fundamental nature of the sport would be altered.for example,for some people,part of the excitement and thrill of skiing is navigating the moguls.although the moguls are an inherent and dangerous aspect of skiing,if the moguls were eliminated,the nature of skiing would be changed and it would not be as exciting or challenging.another example is touch football.if tort liability depended on whether players conducted themselves under the usual concepts of negligence law,this could chill the vigorous activity of the participants.
in kahn,supra,cal th at pages through,d,the court also recognized that when students are learning a new sport,the coach or teacher must be able to push the student beyond the student present abilities or the student will never improve.in order to encourage coaches and teachers to fulfill their roles,they must be relieved of the usual prohibitions of negligence law.
thus,in order to preserve the fundamental nature of various sporting activities and to give coaches and teachers the necessary latitude to challenge and push their students,knight and kahn articulated the concept of a limited duty of care.
specifically,in knight,the supreme court addressed the proper application of the assumption of risk doctrine in light of the high court adoption of the comparative fault doctrine in li yellow cab cal d.knight used the assumption of risk doctrine to delineate the duty of care one player owes to another player in the context of a sport or activity that involves an inherent risk of injury.knight,supra,cal th at,d.in that case,the defendant collided with and injured the plaintiff during a touch football game.id.at,d.the plaintiff sued for negligence and assault and battery.id.at,d.
in knight,supra,cal th at pages through,d,the supreme court explained that in primary assumption of risk cases,a has no duty to protect another player from a particular risk of injury inherent in the sport or activity.otherwise,to impose liability could result in the elimination of a fundamental aspect of the sport or activity.this does not mean,however,that a coparticipant is free of all liability when a sport or activity involves an inherent risk of injury.on the contrary,in cases in which the primary assumption of risk doctrine applies,a is subject to the limited duty of care not to intentionally injure another player,or to engage in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.id.at,d.
in knight,supra,cal th at page,d,the court examined the nature of a defendant duty to plaintiff in the context of a sporting event.the court found that a defendant duty depended on the nature of the sport and its inherent risks.a defendant had no duty to eliminate the risks inherent in the sport.however,a defendant could not increase the risks over and above those inherent in the sport.id.at,d.duty also depended on the defendant role in or relationship to the sport.the court found it was important not to allow potential tort liability to alter the fundamental nature of the sport id.at,d,or to chill vigorous participation in the sport.id.at,d.
based on these considerations,the court adopted the limited duty of care test knight,supra,cal th at,fn,d,wherein a participant in an active sport will only be liable to other participants if intentionally injures another player or engages in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.id.at,d.the court concluded that the case fell within the primary assumption of risk doctrine,and thus the defendant had a limited duty of care to the plaintiff.id.at,d.
in kahn,supra,cal th,d,the court applied the primary assumption of risk principles of the knight case to hold that a coach of a high school swim team owed a limited duty of care to an injured swimmer.id.at,d.
in kahn,supra,cal th at page,d,a novice member of the junior varsity swim team executed a practice dive into a shallow racing pool and broke her neck.she sued her school district and coach.the kahn plaintiff had no prior experience as a competitive swimmer and had a fear that she would suffer traumatic head injury from diving into shallow water.she informed the two coaches of this concern when she joined the team.nevertheless,later in the swim season,minutes before a swim meet,one coach informed the plaintiff that she would have to dive to compete on the relay team.the plaintiff objected but the coach responded that unless she dove,she would not participate in the swim meet.two teammates offered to show plaintiff how to perform a shallow water dive.on her third practice dive,the plaintiff broke her neck.ibid.
the kahn plaintiff alleged that the swim team coach negligently failed to train or supervise the swim team and negligently directed her to dive without giving her adequate training or supervision.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.
the kahn court explained that the policies underlying the knight case applied to the kahn facts.thus,courts should avoid applying a duty of care to mitigate inherent dangers in a sport or activity if to do so would result in a fundamental alteration of the sport or activity,avoid applying a duty of care which would chill a coach role to challenge or push student athletes,and avoid applying a duty of care which would discourage vigorous participation in the sport or activity.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.
the kahn court adopted the limited duty of care articulated by knight and held a sports instructor may be found to have breached a duty of care to a student or athlete only if the instructor intentionally injures the student or engages in conduct that is reckless in the sense that it is totally outside the range of the ordinary activity citation involved in teaching or coaching the sport.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.
the limited duty of care does not apply to a seventh grade golf class 
whether the limited duty of care applies in a particular case is determined by an objective analysis of the nature of the sport or activity and the parties relationship to that activity.cheong antablin,supra,cal th at,d.
engaging in this objective analysis,we examine the policy rationales presented in knight and kahn.we conclude that being hit in the head by a golf club swung by another golfer is not an inherent risk in the game of golf,especially in physical education golf taught to a group of seventh graders.thus,application of the prudent person standard of care in this case will not require a fundamental alteration of the game of golf.in addition,determining defendants potential liability pursuant to the prudent person standard of care will not chill a coach role to challenge student athletes or discourage competition or vigorous participation.
a.the nature of the game of golf 
as instructed by the kahn court,we look first at the nature of the sport kahn,supra,cal th at,d,a seventh grade physical education course in golf taught as part of the regular school curriculum.we must determine whether being hit in the head by a golf club is an inherent risk in the game of golf,such that applying a prudent person standard of care would require some kind of fundamental alteration of the game of golf.
we note that the knight court left open the question of whether the limited duty of care applied to golf.knight,supra,cal th at,fn,d.however,in yancey superior court th,d yancey,the court addressed the issue of whether being struck in the head by a discus was an inherent risk of the discus activity and compared some aspects of discus throwing to golf.there,a participant in a community college discus physical education class struck another participant who was on the field retrieving a discus.the injured plaintiff sued the other player.
the yancey court explained that before throwing the discus,the defendant did not observe the field,did not warn the plaintiff that he was about to throw,and failed to observe elementary safety precautions before throwing.yancey,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that the careless conduct of a participant in throwing a discus without ascertaining the target area was not an inherent risk of the activity.the yancey court explained discus bears some similarity to golf.neither sport has,as one of its objectives,the endangering of coparticipants.anyone playing golf is subjected to a risk of being hit by a ball struck by another golfer on the course.still,it is common knowledge that golfers check their intended target area and make sure it is clear before hitting a shot.they also warn persons who may be in danger of being hit with the cry of fore.nothing in the facts alleged in yancey complaint support a legal conclusion that similar commonsense precautions are inappropriate in a physical education discus class.id.at,d.
the yancey court further explained requiring discus participants to check the target area before launching a throw will not alter or destroy the inherent nature of the activity itself.at most,it may cause a slight delay before the thrower begins.yancey,supra,th at,d.
in this case,defendant feely provided testimony that being hit in the head by a golf club is not an inherent risk in the game of golf,if students follow the rules.
applying the same analysis as the yancey court,and based upon the testimony of defendant feely,we conclude that being hit in the head by a golf club swung by another golfer is not an inherent risk in golf.imposing upon golfers a prudent person duty of care to ascertain the area around them prior to swinging the golf club will not fundamentally alter or eliminate an integral part of the sport.we reach this conclusion because once a golfer has checked the surrounding area,the golfer is then free to swing the golf club.for the same reason,imposing a prudent person duty of care upon a coach or teacher to ensure that golfers maintain a safe distance between each other while hitting the golf ball will not result in a fundamental alteration of the game of golf.ensuring a safe distance between golfers has nothing to do with the mechanics of the golf swing or the fundamental nature of the game of golf.
like the discus activity in yancey,imposing a prudent person standard of care to mitigate any risk of being hit by a club by the alleged improper conduct of the class of seventh graders may result in some minor additional delay as the students change places,but it will not require any alteration of the inherent nature of the game.
in conclusion,the primary rationale underlying the knight and kahn cases for applying the limited duty of care,to prevent alteration of a fundamental nature of a sport or activity,does not apply under these facts.
applying a prudent person standard of care will not chill a coach role to push or challenge or discourage vigorous participation by coparticipants 
the limited duty of care applies to certain athletic activities to avoid discouraging vigorous participation by coparticipants and to avoid chilling a coach role in challenging or pushing student athletes.imposing a prudent person standard of care to mitigate a risk of being hit in the head with a golf club does not conflict with or negatively affect these policy goals.
in this case,plaintiff hemady presented evidence that her injury resulted from the manner in which the physical education golf class was conducted,with students,allegedly insufficient supervision,and conflicting whistle commands.in other words,plaintiff claims that defendants feely and the district failed to provide sufficient personnel to supervise the class,and failed to ensure a proper system for signaling the students when to change places.
plaintiff does not assert that defendant feely challenged her to perform beyond her capacity.nor does plaintiff claim that feely directed her to attempt a particular golf swing without providing adequate instruction or supervision.on the contrary,plaintiff was standing in line and awaiting her turn to hit the wiffle balls.she was not playing golf or attempting any particular golf swing when the injury occurred.
applying a prudent person standard of care in this case to determine liability will not chill a coach role to challenge students or to push them to try to hit the ball more accurately or further.it may require school districts and coaches to evaluate the size,staffing,and organization of physical education golf classes.however,the class,reducing class size or providing more personnel will not prevent or deter a physical education teacher from teaching the basic mechanics of the golf swing and challenging students to improve their golf game.
with respect to vigorous participation of coparticipants,the yancey court addressed this issue in the context of the discus class,explaining neither do we see any indication that vigorous participation in the discus likely would be chilled if legal liability were imposed on a participant for injury caused by his or her failure to observe that the target area is clear before throwing the discus.yancey,supra,th at,d.
we reach the same conclusion as the yancey court in the context of this golf class.applying a prudent person standard of care in this case to determine liability will not deter vigorous activity.requiring school officials to ensure student safety by providing additional personnel or decreasing the size of the class will not affect a student vigorous participation.
in addition,there is no evidence that the seventh grade physical education golf class was competitive.education code section,subdivision d requires school districts to offer physical education with emphasis given to such physical activities that are conducive to health and to vigor of body and mind.likewise,the district seventh grade physical education curriculum does not identify competitiveness or learning competitiveness as a goal of the class.therefore,imposing a prudent person standard of care will not chill student athlete competitiveness.
because the policy considerations underlying the knight and kahn cases do not apply here,we conclude that the prudent person standard of care governs defendants potential liability.
historically,under california law,the prudent person standard of care has determined the liability of school districts and their employees for injuries to students during regular school hours 
in the cases discussed below,the california supreme court applied a prudent person standard of care to determine whether a school district or its employees were liable for injuries to a student which occurred during school hours.there is no indication in knight or kahn that the supreme court intended to overrule or disapprove of this long line of cases.
in bellman,supra,cal d,a high school sophomore enrolled in a beginner tumbling physical education class.physical education was mandatory.because the gymnasium class was full,the bellman plaintiff was required to take tumbling.id.at.during the tumbling class,the student plaintiff suffered a head injury while attempting to perform an exercise which involved diving over two students into a forward roll.id.at.
in bellman,supra,cal d at page,the california supreme court affirmed a jury verdict for the plaintiff.the court concluded that substantial evidence supported the jury finding that a school district employee had not used ordinary care,had acted negligently.as to the standard of care,bellman explained the question is whether the school officials used the same care as persons of ordi
