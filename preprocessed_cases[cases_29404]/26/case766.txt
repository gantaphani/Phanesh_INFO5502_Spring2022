creighton university is a private university in omaha,nebraska.in,creighton hired roxana recio as an associate professor of spanish in the department of modern languages and literatures the department in the college of arts and sciences the college.recio is of spanish origin and a naturalized citizen.creighton also hired recio husband,enrique rodrigo,as a spanish professor.in,recio was granted tenure as an associate professor.as of the time this court heard oral argument in this case,both recio and her husband retained their positions at creighton.
in january,members of the department,including recio,interviewed michelle evers,a candidate for a spanish professorship.recio and evers then engaged in email correspondence that continued from january to april.creighton hired evers she began teaching in august.years later,on february,the spanish faculty held a section meeting that was attended by both recio and evers.on february,recio made a written complaint about evers behavior at the meeting as well as problems that recio was experiencing in the department.on february,evers sent a letter to the dean of the college,stating that she had received inappropriate and offensive communications from recio.the communications referenced by evers consisted of some of the emails recio had sent evers from january to april.
on march,evers formally complained to creighton that recio had sexually harassed her,alleging that in,shortly after evers interviewed for employment as a faculty member at creighton,recio sent her a series of obsessive,email communications and made inappropriate advances of a strong sexual nature when evers ended email contact with recio,recio repeatedly and relentlessly tried to contact and evers believed that the portion of recio february complaint concerning evers was in retaliation for evers refusal to communicate with recio.pursuant to creighton policies and procedures,a sexual harassment committee the committee heard evidence and,on april,issued a report to creighton president,john schlegel.the committee recommended that recio employment be terminated.although fr.schlegel concluded that the committee report had substantial merit,he did not terminate recio.rather,on may,fr.schlegel placed recio on probation until may,conditioning her continued employment on recio having no communication or contact with evers making no statements to others about evers completing a program of psychological counseling,approved by the dean and at her own cost,for a period of one year ending may,attending an educational program,also approved by the dean,dealing with issues of communication,appropriate interaction with others,teamwork,and submitting to close monitoring and documentation of her conduct in the classroom,attendance at classes,scheduling and maintaining of office hours for students,and her interactions with faculty throughout the year of probation.
recio and her husband spent the summer of in spain,as they had done every summer for the years they had been at creighton.on july,recio with the nebraska equal opportunity commission neoc and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that creighton imposition of probation was based on her spanish national origin.creighton received notice of the complaint on july.on august,creighton wrote recio to notify her that,because she could not commence the counseling program specified by the terms of her probation while she was in spain,the program would begin upon her commencement of the program after her return.
on april,when college faculty were to receive their employment contract for the following year,the dean notified recio that her contract would be delayed because he needed to confer with general counsel as to the appropriate form of her contract as a result of her probationary status.on april,the dean sent recio a new employment contract that required her agreement to the terms of the august,letter regarding the duration of the counseling program.the dean also noted that,because recio was again planning to spend the summer of in spain,her counseling requirement would not be completed until she resumed counseling upon her return from spain.recio,through counsel,objected to the contract language,and an agreement was reached in which recio employment contract stated only that she was on probation through may.a separate letter agreement addressed the counseling requirement.
on may,recio a second complaint with the neoc and the eeoc,alleging that creighton had retaliated against her for filing the july discrimination charge.recio completed her probation on may,with no violations.on june,the neoc,having completed its investigation of the july discrimination charge,issued a determination of no reasonable cause,stating that t here was no evidence to show that the level of discipline was based on recio national origin.on may,the neoc terminated the processing of the retaliation charge and,at recio request,issued a letter.
recio filed this action on may,alleging that creighton retaliated against her for the filing of the july discrimination complaint in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii.to.recio seeks injunctive relief prohibiting creighton from discriminating against her for engaging in conduct protected by title vii,damages in excess of,and other relief.recio complaint alleges acts of retaliation but she does not challenge the process creighton used that resulted in her discipline for alleged misconduct or raise any issue of discrimination based on her national origin.the district court divided the alleged retaliatory actions into acts that preceded recio retaliation charge and those that followed the charge.however,we note that,in determining whether creighton retaliated against recio for filing the july discrimination complaint,the basis of this title vii action,it is the date of the july complaint,not the may retaliation complaint,that is key.
the district court granted creighton motion for summary judgment,finding that recio failed to show two of the three elements of a prima facie case of retaliation the materially adverse a reasonable employee would have found the allegedly retaliatory actions to be materially adverse and the causation creighton allegedly retaliatory actions were causally linked to her protected conduct.the district court further found that,even if recio had demonstrated a prima facie case,creighton had offered legitimate reasons for each of the allegedly retaliatory actions,and recio had not provided any evidence that creighton reasons were pretexts for retaliation.recio brings this appeal.
on appeal,recio contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to creighton because she demonstrated a prima facie case of retaliation and made a showing of pretext,rebutting creighton stated legitimate reasons for the allegedly retaliatory actions.recio further claims that the district court erred by failing to identify the significant number of disputed issues of material fact present in this case resolving factual disputes in creighton favor by inappropriately drawing factual inferences and determinations of credibility in a light most favorable to creighton and applying a standard of review improperly slanted in favor of creighton.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to recio,as the nonmoving party.harris brownlee,cir.
