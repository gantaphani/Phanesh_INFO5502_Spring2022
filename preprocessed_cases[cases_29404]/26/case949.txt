general background 
the federal government distributes funds under title iv of the hea,in order to assist with the costs of secondary education.in order to receive federal funds under the hea,schools must enter with the doe into a program participation agreement,in which they agree to abide by a host of statutory,regulatory,and contractual requirements.ex rel.hendow university of phoenix,cir hendow see also a.among these requirements is a recruiterincentive compensation ban,which prohibits institutions from paying recruiters incentive payments based on the number of students they enroll.more specifically,this ban prohibits schools from provid ing any commission,bonus,or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance.a.this requirement is meant to curb the risk that recruiters will sign up poorly qualified students who will derive little benefit from the subsidy and may be unable or unwilling to repay federally guaranteed loans.hendow,at citation omitted.
in,the doe amended its previous regulations and created a safe harbor provision interpreting and clarifying this ban on compensation.the regulation provides that an educational institution may,without violating the ban on incentive compensation,provide payment of fixed compensation,such as a fixed annual salary or a fixed hourly wage,as long as that compensation is not adjusted up or down more than twice during any twelve month period,and any adjustment is not based solely on the number of students recruited,admitted,enrolled,or awarded financial aid.b ii a safe harbor provision.both the ban on incentive compensation and the safe harbor provision were in effect when this suit was filed 
factual and procedural background 
corinthian,a public company headquartered in orange county,california,operates vocational schools throughout the united states.the individual defendants are members of corinthian board of directors.ey is the independent auditor of corinthian.relators are a former employee of and an independent contractor to corinthian.
on march,relators filed under seal a qui tam action on behalf of the united states government,et seq,against corinthian,the individual defendants,and ey collectively defendants.see b.in their complaint,relators assert against defendants four causes of action under the false claims act fca,a,current version at a a,b,c,g.relators also assert several state law claims.on february,the united states gave notice it would not intervene in the action.as relevant here,the allegations in the complaint are as follows.
corinthian receives billions of dollars from the federal government under title iv of the hea.despite the hea ban on incentive compensation,corinthian,as a matter of corporate practice,pay s recruiters bonuses amounting to to of their base pay based on the number of students they recruit.more specifically 
as a matter of corporate practice since at least july,recruiters have been required to meet a certain enrollment quota,depending on their salary grade and title.those recruiters that exceed their quotas receive raises of to of their base salary,every six months,depending on the number of new recruits they sign up.the bonus criteria are set forth in a matrix designed by corinthian.employees failing to meet their quotas are disciplined,demoted,or terminated.
the promotion guidelines applicable to corinthian recruiters are presented in a document entitled corinthian admissions representative compensation program compensation program,which is attached to the complaint as exhibit defendants do not contest the authenticity of this document.see lee city of los angeles,cir.
according to the complaint,corinthian and the individual defendants are liable to the united states under the fca because of their use of false statements to obtain hea,title iv loan funds.specifically,in requesting and receiving approximately dollars annually,corinthian and the individual defendants falsely represented that corinthian complied with hea prohibitions against using incentive payments for recruiters,which is a core prerequisite to receive any hea title iv funds.
the complaint also alleges that ey falsely certified that corinthian was in compliance with recruiter compensation prohibitions.ey allegedly rubber stamped the information provided to it by corinthian and issued its compliance audits and financial statement audit opinions knowing them to be false in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information provided to the united states.ey thereby fraudulently caused the united states to pay title iv,hea program funds to corinthian by such false and fraudulent compliance audit and financial statement audit opinions.
in essence,then,relators allege that corinthian and the individual defendants violated the hea by firing admissions representatives who failed to enroll a minimum number of students,and by compensating admissions representatives based on the number of students they enrolled.relators additionally allege that defendants certified to the doe corinthian compliance with the hea ban on incentive compensation in order to collect federal funds for which they were ineligible,in violation of a,and current version at a a,b,c,g.
on august,corinthian and the individual defendants moved to dismiss relators complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b,b,and b.on the same day,ey filed a separate motion to dismiss under the same provisions.the district court granted both motions,concluding that relators failed under rule b to state an fca claim.the district court held that the complaint failed to allege that corinthian compensation program violated the hea,that is,that corinthian made any false statement to the united states government in certifying their compliance with that statute.the district court reasoned that the challenged recruiter compensation program falls within the doe safe harbor provision because,under its guidelines,increases in recruiter salaries are not awarded solely on the basis of the number of new enrollees that the recruiter achieved.the court also reasoned that,because corinthian reasonably relied upon the safe harbor provision,it could not have acted with scienter as required by the fca.because the district court held the fca claims against the individual defendants and ey were contingent upon corinthian collages liability,it also dismissed with prejudice the claims against these parties.finally,the district court dismissed the state law claims on the ground that relators lacked standing to assert them.
relators appealed.in this appeal,they ask us to review the district court conclusion that the allegations in the complaint do not state a claim under the fca,and the court decision to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.they do not challenge the dismissal of the state law claims.
the focus of any rule b dismissal both in the trial court and on appeal is the complaint.schneider california dep t of corrections,cir.we review dismissals under rule b de novo,accepting as true all allegations of fact in the complaint and construing them in the light most favorable to the relators.zimmerman city of oakland,cir.
under the pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure,we must determine whether the complaint contains sufficient factual matter that,taken as true,state a claim for relief is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.pursuant to this analysis,only pleaded facts,as opposed to legal conclusions,are entitled to assumption of the truth.id.at.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.id.at.if the complaint does contain such supporting factual allegations,we assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.id.at.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.at.the plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement,but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.id.
furthermore,i n alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.because they involve allegations of fraud,qui tam actions under the fca must meet not only the requirement of rule,but also the particularity requirements of rule.see bly magee california,cir.notably,rule b requires only that the circumstances of fraud be stated with particularity other facts may be plead generally,or in accordance with rule.see iqbal.at meijer,ferring in re ddavp direct purchaser antitrust litig,cir,cert.denied,d.
we can affirm a b dismissal on any ground supported by the record,even if the district court did not rely on the ground.livid holdings,salmon smith barney,cir.
we first consider whether the facts presented in the complaint allege an fca violation by corinthian.the fca makes liable anyone who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement that is material to a false claim for payment or approval by the united states government.a.a claim under the fca can be based on the allegation that a party has falsely certified compliance with a statute or regulation as a condition to government payment.see hendow,at.the essential elements of an fca claim are a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct,made with requisite scienter,that was material,causing the government to pay out money or forfeit moneys due.id.at.
a.a false statement 
defendants argue that the complaint does not allege that corinthian made a false statement under the fca,because,as a matter of law,the alleged compensation program falls within the doe safe harbor provision and therefore does not violate the hea.
as stated above,relators allege that corinthian falsely certified compliance with the hea prohibition against paying any commission,bonus,or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollment or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in student recruiting or admissions activities the complaint contains two factual allegations to support the purported violation of the hea.first,the complaint states that,as a matter of corporate practice,corinthian recruiters receive a to salary increase every six months for exceeding certain enrollment quotas it also states that employees who fail to meet their enrollment quotas are disciplined,demoted,or terminated.we consider these allegations in reverse order.
termination based on recruitment numbers 
relators allege that employees were disciplined,demoted,or terminated on the basis of their recruitment numbers.this does not state a violation of the incentive compensation ban.even as broadly construed,the hea does not prohibit any and all decisions on the basis of recruitment numbers it prohibits only a particular type of incentive compensation.thus,adverse employment actions,including termination,on the basis of recruitment numbers remain permissible under the statute terms.see ex rel.bott silicon valley colleges,app x,cir holding that t he decision to fire an employee is not covered by the act because termination is not a prohibited commission,bonus,or other incentive payment.citing a the complaint allegation that corinthian imposes adverse employment consequences on the basis of recruitment quotas does not,therefore,state a violation of the hea incentive compensation ban,and also does not support the claim that a false statement was made.
compensation based on recruitment numbers 
to support an fca false statement,the complaint also alleges that corinthian awards salary increases on the basis of recruitment numbers,in violation of hea incentive compensation ban.defendants argue that corinthian recruiter compensation policy,as alleged,falls within the doe safe harbor provision and does not as a matter of law violate the hea.as discussed above,the safe harbor provision allows institutions to pay salary increases to recruiters only if any adjustment is not based solely on the number of students recruited,admitted,enrolled,or awarded financial aid.b ii a emphasis added.
the complaint does not expressly use the word solely in alleging that corinthian awards promotion salary increases on the basis of recruitment numbers.nonetheless,it does allege that the increases in salary are based on and depend on the number of students that the recruiter signs up.it then refers to the corinthian compensation program,which is attached to the complaint as exhibit the program can be summarized as follows 
only those employees with a rating of at least good are eligible for promotions.
assuming that an employee is eligible for a promotion,the salary increase for which the employee is eligible is determined by the greater of the minimum of the salary range for the position to which they are being promoted category and a percentage salary increase related to how successful that recruiter has been in the previous period category.
the category increase that corresponds to a particular employee is determined by the number of net starts achieved in that period,combined with his overall performance rating good or excellent for that period.
at first glance,then,it appears that corinthian promotion and salary increase system does not rely solely on recruitment numbers,but also takes into account whether the employee receives an overall performance rating of good or excellent.on this basis,corinthian argues that its method of awarding salary increases does not violate the hea.
the mere inclusion of this performance rating in corinthian compensation program,however,does not allow us to conclusively determine whether its method of awarding salary increases falls within the safe harbor provision.at this stage,we have no information as to the basis on which a good versus excellent performance rating is assigned to a corinthian recruiter.without an understanding what an employee must do to achieve a rating of good,we can not determine whether the rating is based upon substantive requirements that are separate and distinct from recruitment numbers if,for example,recruiter performance ratings are awarded on the basis of the number of students that a recruiter enrolls,then this rating system would not in fact provide an additional basis on which compensation decisions are made.under such a system,corinthian would,in essence,make adjustments to recruiter salaries based solely on the number of students enrolled by that recruiter.interpreting the safe harbor provision so that it covers such a system would directly undermine the hea express prohibition on incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments,see a.
moreover,w hen construing a statute or regulation,we look to the whole law,and to its object and policy,not simply to a single sentence or member of a sentence.owner operator indep.drivers ass n,swift transp,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the plain language of a regulation will not control if clearly expressed administrative intent is to the contrary or if such plain meaning would lead to absurd results.webb smart document solutions,llc,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the performance rating of at least good requires an employee merely to fulfill basic performance requirements that are expected of any employee such as showing up on time,then construing the safe harbor provision so that these ratings serve as an independent basis for compensation increases would lead to an absurd result.under such a system,educational institutions could entirely circumvent the hea incentive compensation ban by simply formalizing,through a performance rating system,the basic requirements expected of any employee,that is,the requirements of employment itself allowing the safe harbor provision to shield such a program from hea recruiter compensation requirements would render meaningless the purpose or objective of the statute.owner operator indep.drivers ass n,at.
relators do not allege any facts regarding the meaning or basis of the good versus excellent performance ratings included in the compensation program attached to the complaint.as a result,while it is certainly possible that corinthian compensation program falls outside the safe harbor provision thereby rendering false corinthian certification of hea compliance,the complaint falls short of stating a plausible claim for relief.this deficiency,however,can readily be cured,and relators are therefore entitled to amend.
leave to amend 
although relators did not seek leave to amend before the district court,the court expressly contemplated whether amendment was appropriate.because the court concluded that the compensation program falls within the safe harbor provision as a matter of law,it held that leave to amend was unwarranted.
because the issue was expressly addressed and decided by the district court,raised on appeal,and fully briefed by both parties,it is subject to review by this court.see kimes stone,cir noting that a court of appeals may consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal where it presents a purely legal question and consideration of the issue will not prejudice the opposing party see also balistreri pacifica police,cir.
the trial court denial of leave to amend a complaint is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see johnson buckley,cir.when reviewing a district court decision for abuse of discretion,w e first look to whether the trial court identified and applied the correct legal rule to the relief requested.second,we look to whether the trial court resolution of the motion resulted from a factual finding that was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.city of los angeles san pedro boat works,cir quoting united states hinkson,cir en banc.
the standard for granting leave to amend is generous.balistreri,at.the court considers five factors in assessing the propriety of leave to amend bad faith,undue delay,prejudice to the opposing party,futility of amendment,and whether the plaintiff has previously amended the complaint.johnson,at.here,there is no evidence of delay,prejudice,bad faith,or previous amendments.therefore,leave to amend turns on whether amendment would be futile.
under futility analysis,d ismissal without leave to amend is improper unless it is clear,upon de novo review,that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment.krainski nevada ex rel.bd.of regents of nv.system of higher,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also lopez smith,cir noting that a court should permit amendment unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts internal quotation marks and citation omitted balistreri,at noting that leave to amend should be granted when a court can conceive of facts that would render the plaintiff claim viable.leave to amend is warranted if the deficiencies can be cured with additional allegations that are consistent with the challenged pleading and that do not contradict the allegations in the original complaint.reddy litton,cir.
here,we can conceive of additional facts that could,if formally alleged,support the claim that corinthian made false statements to the doe.as previously discussed,relators could allege that the corinthian employee performance rating system is merely a proxy for employee recruitment numbers,or that the system is based merely on those basic requirements that any employee would be required to meet.
in addition,relators repeatedly insist in their briefs that,in practice,corinthian recruiters were expected to meet enrollment quotas and understood that this was the basis on which they would receive promotional salary increases.relators could additionally or alternatively allege that,despite the compensation program purported or documented reliance on something other than recruitment numbers,these salary increases are in practice determined on the sole basis of recruitment numbers.it is corinthian implementation of its policy,rather than the written policy itself,that bears scrutiny under the hea,and such allegations would require additional discovery 
thus,to the extent that the complaint insufficiently alleges a false statement,relators could provide additional allegations that would render plausible their claims against corinthian.although the district court correctly identified the permissive standard for granting leave to amend,it dismissed with prejudice the complaint without considering whether additional facts could cure any deficiencies.we conclude that the court abused its discretion and that amendment of the complaint should have been permitted.
defendants alternatively argue that,even if relators did or could allege a false statement,corinthian reliance on the safe harbor provision negates scienter,another element of the fca.the district court agreed 
under rule b,circumstances constituting fraud or mistake must be stated with particularity,but malice,intent,knowledge,and other conditions of a persons mind,including scienter,can be alleged generally.see.b see also zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.under the false claim act scienter requirement,innocent mistakes,mere negligent misrepresentations and differences in interpretations will not suffice to create liability.hendow,at internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.instead,relators must allege that corinthian knew that its statements were false,or that it was deliberately indifferent to or acted with reckless disregard of the truth of the statements.ex rel.hochman nackman,cir absent evidence that the defendants knew that the guidelines on which they relied did not apply,or that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to or recklessly disregardful of the alleged inapplicability of those provisions,no false claims act liability can be found.
in order for relators to sufficiently plead that corinthian acted with fraudulent intent,therefore,they must allege that corinthian knew,or acted with reckless disregard of the fact,that its compensation program did not fall within the doe safe harbor provision when it certified to the united states government that it was compliant with the hea or,alternatively,even if it believed that its written compensation program fell under the safe harbor provision,it knew or acted with reckless disregard of the fact that,in reality,recruiter compensation decisions were made solely on the basis of recruitment numbers.
in the operative complaint,relators allege that corinthian requested federal grant money from the doe although it knew it was not eligible to receive such funds based on its recruiting compensation practices,including awarding bonuses based on the number of students a recruiter signs up.relators also allege,in reciting the fca counts raised in the complaint,that defendants acted knowingly or in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard.the complaint,therefore,does allege that corinthian acted with scienter.it does not,
