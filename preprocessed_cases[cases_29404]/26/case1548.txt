introduction 
in these original proceedings,the defendant in a personal injury action petitions for writ of mandate directing respondent court to vacate its order overruling her demurrer and to enter an order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.petitioner nancy casterson is a public school teacher who contends that real party in interest samuel cardoso,claim that he was injured during a school field trip,as the result of her negligence in chaperoning the trip,is barred by the school field trip immunity set forth in education code section petitioner acknowledges that section,subdivision d expressly includes only school districts and the state of california in its immunity provision.however,petitioner argues that under the principles of statutory interpretation the statute should be construed to include the employees of school districts.otherwise,the legislature intent to provide absolute immunity to school districts for personal injury claims arising from field trips would be undermined by the school district vicarious liability under government code section,subdivision a,for injuries caused by an employee in the course and scope of employment.we agree with petitioner,and for that reason we will issue a peremptory writ of mandate as requested.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the complaint 
real party in interest,plaintiff samuel cardoso,samuel or plaintiff,through his guardian ad litem,samuel cardoso,filed a personal injury action against defendants nancy casterson casterson or defendant and the la quinta inn the complaint identifies casterson as an employee of the pajaro valley unified school district school district who was acting in the course and scope of her employment at all relevant times.samuel was a fourth grade special education student who attended elementary school in the school district at the time of his injury.
according to the complaint,samuel was injured during a school field trip to sacramento.casterson and other school district employees and volunteers were in charge of the field trip,which included an overnight stay at the la quinta inn.prior to the trip,samuel sister advised samuel teacher that samuel could not swim.nevertheless,defendants allowed samuel to enter the pool at the la quinta inn and to be pushed by other students into the deep end,where samuel sank to the bottom and nearly drowned.casterson,who was samuel chaperone,allegedly did not stay at the pool with samuel and the other children under her care.as a consequence of the near drowning,samuel allegedly suffered various physical and mental injuries.
the complaint further asserts that samuel near drowning was caused by the negligence of defendants,and states one cause of action for negligence.plaintiff also alleges that his claim to school district was rejected.however,the complaint does not name school district as a defendant.
b.the demurrer 
defendant casterson responded to the complaint by filing a general demurrer pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.the grounds for the demurrer were that the face of the complaint showed that an affirmative defense barred plaintiff claim against defendant.because the complaint alleged that plaintiff was injured during a field trip as the result of defendant negligence while she was acting in the course and scope of her school district employment,defendant asserted that she was protected by the field trip immunity of section.although defendant acknowledged that section expressly immunizes only school districts and the state of california from personal injury claims arising from school field trips,she argued that school district employees must be included within the scope of section immunity because a school district is vicariously liable for the negligence of its employees and is obligated to pay any judgment against an employee,pursuant to government code sections and.
in support of this argument,defendant cited this court decision in barnhart cabrillo community college th,d barnhart.according to defendant,barnhart makes clear that the statutory field trip immunity applies to school district employees,because this court affirmed summary judgment for both defendant community college district and defendant college coach on the basis of california code of regulations,title,section,which in language identical to section provides field trip immunity expressly to community colleges and the state of california.
opposition to the demurrer 
plaintiff challenged defendant contention that section must be construed to include school district employees within the scope of the field trip immunity.since section refers only to school districts and not to their employees,plaintiff argued that employees are excluded.plaintiff further argued that where the legislature intends to immunize public entity employees it expressly includes them in the immunizing statute,for example,as in section and government code section.thus,plaintiff asserted,where the legislature has not expressly included public employees within the scope of public entity immunity,the employees remain personally liable for their negligence.
additionally,plaintiff distinguished this court decision in barnhart on grounds that the decision concerned community colleges only and did not address the issue of whether a school district employee is protected by the section field trip immunity.
d.the trial court order 
at the time of the hearing,the trial court overruled the demurrer.we are advised that no written order was prepared.in making its ruling,the court explained that the decision in barnhart was not on point because it did not focus on the issue at bar.the court also declined to legislate the meaning of the various conflicting statutes,noting that there might be circumstances under which the employee was liable and the school district was not.
iii.discussion 
availability of writ relief 
an order overruling a demurrer is not directly appealable,but may be reviewed on appeal from the final judgment.san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d.appeal is presumed to be an adequate remedy and writ review is rarely granted unless a significant issue of law is raised,or resolution of the issue would result in a final disposition as to the petitioner.curry superior court th,d.in the present case,writ review is warranted for both reasons.the petition raises the issue of whether a school district employee is protected by the field trip immunity of section where it is alleged that a student was injured during a field trip as a result of the employee negligence in the course and scope of employment.also,resolution of this issue in defendant casterson favor will result in a final disposition as to casterson.
standard of review 
the standard of review for an order overruling a demurrer is de novo.the reviewing court accepts as true all facts properly pleaded in the complaint in order to determine whether the demurrer should be overruled.fed.land bank superior court d.a general demurrer will lie where the complaint has included allegations that clearly disclose some defense or bar to recovery.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,to,italics in original.thus,a demurrer based on an affirmative defense will be sustained only where the face of the complaint discloses that the action is necessarily barred by the defense.crosstalk productions,jacobson th,d.in the present case,we must determine whether the affirmative defense of the section field trip immunity necessarily bars plaintiff personal injury claim against defendant casterson.
section field trip immunity 
in barnhart,supra,th,d,this court addressed field trip immunity in the context of a community college soccer team trip to attend a soccer match.california code of regulations,title,section,provides field trip immunity to community college districts in language identical to the field trip immunity for school districts set forth in section the issue in barnhart was whether california code of regulations,title,section,field trip immunity barred personal injury claims against the community college and its soccer coach by soccer team members who were injured in an auto accident while en route to a match in a college van driven by the coach.this court concluded that the trial court had properly granted summary judgment for both the community college district and the coach,because the plaintiffs were injured during a field trip and therefore all defendants were immunized by the section field trip immunity.barnhart cabrillo community college,supra,th at,d.however,in barnhart,this court did not specifically address the propriety of applying field trip immunity to a community college employee in light of the express extension of field trip immunity only to the community college district and the state of california.it appears that the parties in barnhart did not raise the issue of whether field trip immunity applied to the soccer coach as well as the community college district.
the parties have not cited and our own research has not revealed any reported decisions in which a school district employee was held personally liable for causing injury to a student in the course of a field trip,or which have addressed the issue of whether field trip immunity applies to school district employees who participate in a field trip in the course and scope of their employment.however,review of the statutory scheme for public entity and school district liability,together with application of the principles of statutory interpretation,persuade us that the field trip immunity provided by section should apply to school district employees whose negligence in the course and scope of their employment has caused injuries to a student during a school field trip.
field trip immunity is a relatively new creature of statute.the school code,which preceded the education code,did not provide field trip immunity.in,a school district was held vicariously liable for injuries to students sustained during a field trip when the bus carrying the students was involved in an accident due to the negligent driving of a school district employee.bates escondido school dist.at that time,former school code section expressly provided that school districts were liable for injuries to person or property arising from the negligence of school district employees.ibid.subsequently,this provision was reenacted as education code section.biggers sacramento city unified sch.dist.d.section was repealed concurrently with the enactment of the california tort claims act in.ibid.the provision for vicarious school district liability was subsumed in the statutory provision for general public entity liability set forth in government code section a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative,a.at the same time,the general rule for public employee liability was codified in government code section,subdivision a except as otherwise provided by statute including section,a public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.
in,a provision for field trip immunity was added to the education code for the first time.former section authorized school districts to take students in sixth through eighth grade on a field trip to a foreign country,provided that all persons making such excursion or field trip waive all claims against the district or the state of california for injury or death occurring during or by reason of the excursion or field trip.by,the field trip immunity of section had been broadened to apply to all field trips.see castro los angeles bd.of education d.the court in castro los angeles bd.of education determined that the waiver provision of section operated as a deemed waiver of responsibility by the on a field trip or excursion.d at,italics omitted.the court concluded that s tudents who are off of the school property for required school purposes are entitled to the same safeguards as those who are on school property,within supervisorial limits.students who participate in nonrequired trips or excursions,though possibly in furtherance of their education but not as required attendance,are effectively on their own the voluntary nature of the event absolves the district of liability.ibid.the education code was reorganized in,and at that time section was replaced by section.
section currently provides authority to school districts or a county superintendent of schools to conduct field trips.the provision for field trip immunity is now found in subdivision d all persons making the field trip or excursion shall be deemed to have waived all claims against the district or the state of california for injury,accident,illness,or death occurring during or by reason of the field trip or excursion.since section was enacted,decisions construing that section have focused on issues relating to the application of the field trip immunity to various student activities.in particular,the interaction of the absolute field trip immunity of section and the qualified immunity for school activities of section has been the subject of discussion in several appellate decisions.
section provides in relevant part that no school district shall be responsible or in any way liable for the conduct or safety of any pupil of the public schools at any time when such pupil is not on school property,unless such district has undertaken to provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises,has undertaken a activity off the premises of such school,has otherwise specifically assumed such responsibility or liability or has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.hoyem manhattan beach city sch,supra,cal d.at present,the consensus of opinion appears to be that a field trip is a special type of activity,making section the special statute,should both statutes apply.wolfe dublin unified school dist.th,d school district immune from liability for injury to first grader during field trip to family farm myricks lynwood unified school dist.th,d field trip immunity precluded school district liability for auto accident injuries to high school basketball players on tournament road trip barnhart,supra,th at,d under analogous regulation regs.tit,soccer team travel to a match is a field trip to which immunity applies.
in reaching these conclusions,the appellate courts have agreed with the definitions of field trip and excursion set forth in castro los angeles bd.of education,supra,which are used in applying the field trip immunity of section field trip is defined as a visit made by students and usually a teacher for purposes of first hand observation as to a factory,farm,clinic,museum.excursion means a journey chiefly for recreation,a usual brief pleasure trip,departure from a direct or proper course or deviation from a definite path.d,fn.barnhart,supra,th at,d wolfe dublin unified school,supra,th at,d.in the present case,based on the allegations of the complaint,plaintiff does not dispute that he was in the course of a field trip when he was allegedly injured.
field trip immunity applies to defendant 
plaintiff alleges that he was injured during a field trip due to the negligence of a school district employee,but he has not named school district as a defendant.thus,plaintiff implicitly concedes that school district is immunized from liability for plaintiff injuries by the section field trip immunity.however,plaintiff asserts that he may sue defendant casterson,the school district employee he believes to be responsible for his injuries,because school district employees are not expressly immunized by section.
plaintiff is correct that section does not expressly include employees,while other education code provisions that limit liability for personal injury claims,such as section and section,do expressly include employees.defendant argues that section must be construed to include school district employees within the scope of the field trip immunity,in order to preserve the legislative purpose of immunizing school districts from liability for field trip injuries.plaintiff responds that
