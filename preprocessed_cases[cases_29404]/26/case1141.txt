background 
world wide is an association of residential treatment programs for troubled and teenagers.it does not own or operate schools rather,it markets its members schools to parents who might be interested in them.scheff was one such parent.her daughter attended a world wide member school for nine months before scheff decided to remove her from the program.less than a year later,scheff founded pure.like world wide,pure provides information about programs for families seeking help for their children schools compete with the schools associated with world wide.pure schools pay scheff a substantial sum whenever a child enrolls in its program based on her recommendation.
after the creation of pure,scheff used various fictitious names to post negative messages about schools for teenagers on an internet forum.several of the schools scheff disparaged were schools affiliated with world wide.berryman also posted messages that were critical of world wide schools.unlike scheff,however,berryman never posted messages under a false name,and his career is unrelated to helping troubled teenagers and their families.instead,he is a activist and is simply interested in issues involving troubled teens.
scheff and berryman were also both members of an listserve whose members spread unfavorable information about world wide schools to parents searching for programs for troubled teens.according to the district court,members of the group would alert each other when they became aware of a parent considering a world wide school,and the members would then the parent with negative messages about world wide.
scheff and berryman were not the only critics of world wide programs.around this time,television programs and print articles were describing abuse and neglect at world wide schools.for example,the news magazine hours reported a child allegation that he had been handcuffed for two consecutive days and had his mouth covered in duct tape.the miami herald ran an article describing a mother report that her teenager came home from a world wide school with ringworm scars and chemical burns.forbes magazine reported that children were punched,kicked,thrown,and forced to sit on cement floors for twelve hours at a time.the teenager quoted in the article also claimed that students who tried to flee from such punishment were locked in a small cell for days.

limited purpose public figure 
under utah law,a defamation claim requires the plaintiff to show that defendants published the statements concerning him,that the statements were false,defamatory,and not subject to any privilege,that the statements were published with the requisite degree of fault,and that their publication resulted in damage.west thomson newspapers,utah footnote omitted.but the first amendment circumscribes liability for state defamation.see new york times sullivan,d.specifically,if the plaintiff is a public figure,he must demonstrate by a standard of clear and convincing evidence that the defamatory statement was made with actual malice.see masson new yorker magazine,d.actual malice is defined as knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times,at.
this rigorous standard also applies to a public figure.see anderson liberty lobby,d.in contrast to public figures,who occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they may hold sway on any issue with which they choose to become involved,see wayment clear channel broadcasting,utah quotations omitted,a public figure is only a public figure with respect to a specific issue,see id.at.indeed,the supreme court has described a public figure as one who voluntarily injects himself into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.see liberty lobby,at.quoting gertz robert welch,d.utah employs a test to determine whether the plaintiff is a public figure.first,the court must isolate the specific public controversy related to the defamatory remarks.wayment,at.next,the court should examine the type and extent of the plaintiff participation in that public controversy to determine whether,under gertz,he has thrust himself to the forefront of the controvers y in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.id.
in this case,the district court held that world wide was a limited purpose public figure with respect to the public controversy of how to deal with troubled teens.the court further noted that world wide principals have given dozens of interviews to media including times,hours,new york times,deseret news,denver rocky news,and the miami herald,in support of its programs.the district court also noted that world wide function is to promote the unique use of behavior modification techniques by its affiliated schools.as the marketing arm for the various programs that it promotes,world wide chose to place itself in the national spotlight advocating this method.
the district court determination that world wide is a public figure is a question of law,which we review de novo.see foretich capital,cir see also pipeline lario,cir stating that federal standards of appellate review apply to diversity actions.we agree that world wide is a public figure.to begin,it is clear that there exists a public controversy as to the most effective method of treating teenagers.indeed,the record includes numerous news accounts about the public debate surrounding this question and the use of particular behavior modification programs associated with world wide.second,world wide participation in this public controversy is extensive.as the district court pointed out,world wide mission as a marketing company is to take an active role in this debate by both promoting its members programs and defending those programs that are marred by scandal.but more than merely advocating for its individual members,world wide has injected itself into the debate by promoting itself and all programs associated with it.for example,one article specifically centers on whether world wide programs are effective and quotes the president of world wide as saying,parents are very much in support of world wide programs.michelle ray ortiz,behavior modification salvation or brainwashing programs for troubled teens get mixed reviews,miami herald,june,at.additionally,world wide public comments frequently refer to satisfied parents in response to charges of abuse.accordingly,it is clear that world wide thrust itself to the forefront of this public controvers y in order to in
