between and,nys took out thirteen separate student loans to finance an associate of arts degree in science and drafting technology from the college of the redwoods and a bachelor of arts degree from humboldt state university.in,nys began working at humboldt state university as a drafting technician.she is employed as a drafter ii,the highest drafter position available at humboldt state.in,nys net gross income was.because she pays per month to her retirement plan,her shows an adjusted gross income of.the bankruptcy judge found that this income was about as high as one could reasonably expect in humboldt county given her profession and educational background.the evidence also showed that nys lived in a modest home in fortuna,california,which was in need of extensive repairs.at the time of trial,nys was years old.she plans to retire at age,and at that time her income will drop considerably.
nys borrowed approximately through student loans.at the time of trial,she owed approximately in accumulated principal and interest.nys net monthly income was.she claimed in monthly expenses.
because she was granted deferments,nys made no payments on her student loans until august,when she received a wage garnishment notice from ecmc.to avoid garnishment,nys paid per month on her student loans.she made those payments until may,when ecmc notified her that her monthly payments would increase to.
at that time,nys contacted the william ford loan program ford,see,in an attempt to establish an affordable payment plan.the parties dispute what type of payment plan ford offered nys.nys claims that ford informed her that her monthly payments would still be between and,and that she would need to pay an initial assessment fee of almost.ecmc argues that nys is eligible for an income contingency repayment plan and that under this program her monthly payment would be between and 
during the trial,nys argued that she is still unable to make payments on her student loans,and that because of additional circumstances,her inability to pay will continue into the foreseeable future.her additional circumstances were that she is years old years from legal retirement age,she has maxed out in her career and her income is as high as it is ever going to be,her house is in need of substantial repairs,and she commutes daily at some distance in an old automobile with high mileage that will soon need to be replaced.
the bankruptcy court ruled for ecmc,finding that nys had not proved undue hardship.although it concluded that nys is clearly incapable of repaying more than a portion of her student loans and this situation will almost certainly persist for the foreseeable future,it found no undue hardship because nys ha d demonstrated no additional circumstances beyond the mere inability to pay.the bankruptcy court rejected nys argument that undue hardship exists any time the debtor can not afford to pay the loans now or in the foreseeable future.it found that e xceptional circumstances must be shown to meet the second prong of the brunner test.
the bap reversed the bankruptcy court because it concluded that the bankruptcy court had applied the wrong legal standard when addressing the second prong of the brunner test.as the bap characterized the test,a dditional circumstances are any circumstances,beyond the mere current inability to pay,that show that the inability to pay is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period.nys,at.because the bankruptcy court required the additional circumstances to be exceptional,the bap reversed and remanded for an application of the correct additional circumstances test.
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under b,the bap had jurisdiction under b,and we have jurisdiction under d.we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.rifino united states in re rifino,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and its application of the legal standard is reviewed de novo.id.at.
the issue we must decide is whether undue hardship requires an additional or exceptional circumstance beyond an impervious financial situation that will continue to impede the debtor ability to make payments on her student loans and maintain a minimal standard of living.section a provides that a student loan is not dischargeable unless excepting such debt from discharge would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.a.undue hardship is not defined in the bankruptcy code however,we and a majority of the other circuits have expressly adopted the brunner test.see supra note.
when it adopted the brunner test,the second circuit explicitly incorporated the reasoning of the district court in toto.brunner,at.the district court had thoroughly analyzed the limited legislative history pertaining to the undue hardship requirement,brunner state higher educ.servs.in re brunner,and therefore,because the legislative history was influential in the development of the brunner test,we will discuss it again here.
congress provided little in the way of express legislative intent specifically addressing the undue hardship requirement when it passed the statute.id.at.nonetheless,the phrase undue hardship was lifted verbatim from a bill proposed by the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states commission,and with no clear indication to the contrary,we may impute the commission intent to congress.id.at see also mcclendon door in re wadsworth.components,cir looking to the commission report to interpret congressional intent.the commission recognized that there was a high incidence of students filing for bankruptcy after finishing their education.brunner,at.
this rising incidence contravened the general policy that a loan that enables a person to earn substantially greater income over his working life should not as a matter of policy be dischargeable before he has demonstrated that for any reason he is unable to earn sufficient income to maintain himself and his dependents and to repay the educational debt.

the commission envisioned a determination of whether the amount and reliability of income and other wealth which the debtor could reasonably be expected to receive in the future could maintain the debtor and his or her dependents at a minimal standard of living as well as pay off the student loans.
