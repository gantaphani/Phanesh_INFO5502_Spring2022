appellants appeal from judgments of the district court dismissing their claims on the grounds that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the membership of a rulemaking committee convened pursuant to the no child left behind act,and the act barred judicial review of the committee membership.appellants contend that they have standing to pursue their challenges,and that the act does not bar judicial review of the secretary of education choice of committee members.because we agree with the district court holding that appellants lack standing to pursue their claims,we affirm the judgments of the court.moreover,because this court concludes that it lacks article iii jurisdiction over this case,it does not consider the alternate issue of whether judicial review is barred by the act.
background 
a.the no child left behind act 
on january,the president signed into law the no child left behind act nclba or the act,stat,codified at et.the act requires each state to implement statewide accountability systems for all public schools and their students,to define education standards,and to establish a system of assessments for measuring whether students have met those standards.under the act,a school continued failure to make adequate yearly progress toward meeting proficiency goals will give rise to assistance and intervention,with parents of students in failing schools allowed to transfer their children to better schools.id.at b.
the act authorizes the department of education doe to adopt regulations for the oversight of states design of standards and assessments.in order to ensure that final regulations are issued by the secretary not later than january,id.at b a,congress directed the secretary to utilize a negotiated rulemaking process.id.at b a.
the framework for promulgating and adopting regulations under the act is laid out with specificity.first,the secretary of education is to obtain the advice and recommendations of various interest groups.id.at b.second,the secretary shall establish a negotiated rulemaking process for the purpose of drafting regulations,id.at b a,and select individuals to participate in such process from among individuals or groups that provided advice and recommendations in such numbers as will provide an equitable balance between representatives of parents and students and representatives of educators and education officials id.at b b.finally,s uch process shall be conducted before january.id.at b a.the secretary provides draft regulations to committee members prior to their first meeting.id.at b c.the process shall not be subject to the federal advisory committee act,but shall otherwise follow the provisions of the negotiated rulemaking act of et.id.at b.
this incorporation of the negotiated rulemaking act nra implicates jurisdictional concerns,as the nra bars judicial review of a ny agency action relating to establishing,assisting,or terminating a negotiated rulemaking committee under this subchapter,unless such review is otherwise provided by statute.section b does not explicitly describe selection of committee members as being included in the process subject to the provisions of the nra,but it does not explicitly exclude member selection from the process subject to the nra.
implementation of the act framework contemporaneous lawsuits 
on january,doe published a request for advice and recommendations in the federal register.on february,doe issued an invitation for the submission of possible participants in the negotiated rulemaking.see email from susan neuman,assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education,reprinted in joint appendix at.while the notice did stress that t he nominees should be practitioners,they should be significantly involved with implementing and operating title i programs,it also noted that the negotiated rulemaking was to include representatives of federal,state and local administrators parents teachers and paraprofessionals members of local school boards and other organizations id.
the committee convened by the secretary consisted of members.according to the doe,this body consisted of six representatives of state administrators and state boards of education,four representatives of local administrators and local school boards,four representatives of principals and teachers,seven representatives of students including one teacher,a few administrators,and a representative of a diocese,one representative of business interests,and two representatives of the doe,corrected at.the parties do not specify whether any of the non parent teacher representatives are,themselves,parents or teachers.appellants dispute the nominal makeup of this body.they claim that only one member represented the interests of all public school parents and students,because some representatives actually stood in for multiple perspectives.brief for appellants at.
the february notice gave individuals and groups who felt that his or her interests we re not adequately represented by this group the opportunity to petition at the march meeting,in person,to be seated as a negotiator.plaintiff organization designs for change attempted to petition by phone to be seated claiming that travel was economically infeasible.the doe declined to hear the petition.decl.of weckstein,joint appendix at.appellants assert that center for law and education also petitioned to be seated,brief for appellant at,although no such petition is apparent from the record.likewise,it is not apparent that plaintiff lindsey petitioned to be seated.
appellants filed suit in district court on march.they alleged that the committee did not achieve an equitable balance between representatives of parents and students and representatives of educators and education officials,and sought a preliminary injunction.while the suit was pending,the committee convened,reviewed the secretary draft regulations,and reached consensus on every issue of academic standards and assessments before it.see.may.the secretary received the committee proposed rules,and published them for public notice and comment.id.during the comment period,the doe convened five regional meetings for further comment.id.
in may,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over appellants challenge on two grounds.first,it held that the nra bar precluded judicial review of a challenge to the committee composition prior to promulgation of final rules.ctr.for law and educ.dep t of,d.the court noted the plaintiffs argument that only applies to the process of committee deliberation,as provides that committee members would participate in such process at.but the court ultimately rejected this interpretation of process because of the implications of plaintiffs theory.id.specifically,such interpretation would require doe to segregate the nclba into process and provisions,and apply the nra accordingly the court saw such segregation and selective application to be implausible.id.at.moreover,to allow for lawsuits over selection of committee members would make compliance with the nclba strict time limits infeasible.id.at.
second,the court held that review was unavailable under the administrative procedure act apa,because selection of the committee was not final agency action.id.at.appellants filed an appeal,which later was stayed at appellants request.
in july,the doe published its final rules on state standards and assessments.july,to be codified at pt.the final rules took effect on august.id.
in december,appellants filed a new complaint.they did not challenge the substance of the rules on traditional apa grounds.see.instead,they again focused on the composition of the committee,calling for the rules to be set aside and a new committee formed.on march,the district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction,holding that appellants lacked standing.ctr.for law and educ.dep t of,d.the court held that dfc and cle the organizational plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a procedural injury because the act contains no requirement that advocacy groups be represented on the negotiated rulemaking committee.id.at.the court also rejected the organizations standing on other grounds regarding lack of actual injury,the rules do no more than arguably offend their policy goals,id.at and lack of causation,the alleged injury was not caused by the formation of the committee,but rather,by subsequent choices made by state agencies.id.at.as to the individual plaintiff,rachelle lindsey,the court held that because the act created no enforceable right to have an equitably balanced committee,lindsey suffered no actual injury.the risk that her children would not receive a education was too hypothetical and was dependant on the actions of the states,not the doe.id.at.finally,the court also held that incorporation of the nra included incorporation of its bar on judicial review of the establishment of the negotiated rulemaking committee.id.at.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews de novo a dismissal for lack of standing.wrestling coaches ass dep t of.a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is also reviewed de novo.flynt rumsfeld.in reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss,the court must accept as true all facts alleged by the nonmoving party and must draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.
a.the judicial review bar 
as noted above,doe raises two jurisdictional arguments first,that appellants lack article iii standing and second,that congress deprived this court of jurisdiction to review the composition of the committee.supra pages.because,as we discuss below,we hold that appellants lack article iii standing,we do not consider the question,never before raised in this court,of whether judicial review is barred in this matter.we need not identify every ground for holding that a claim is not justiciable.fourth branch assocs.mechanicville ferc,quoting indep.petroleum ass of america babbitt.w e have no trouble dismissing a claim based on one jurisdictional bar rather than another.id.quoting louisiana envtl.action network browner.see also new jersey television fcc.any statements by this court on the question of the judicial review bar would be unnecessary dicta,which precedent and prudence counsel us to avoid louisiana envtl.action network,at.
this court,like all article iii courts,is one of limited jurisdiction we can not decide cases that we lack constitutional authority to decide.wyoming outdoor council forest service.we are empowered to hear only cases or controversies.const.art.iii.we ascertain whether or not the matter before us is a case or controversy by looking to whether,inter alia,the litigants have standing.wyoming outdoor council,at.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements the plaintiff must have suffered injury in fact,an actual or imminent invasion of a legally protected,concrete and particularized interest there must be a causal connection between the alleged injury and the defendant conduct at issue and it must be likely,not speculative,that the court can redress the injury.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.where plaintiffs allege injury resulting from violation of a procedural right afforded to them by statute and designed to protect their threatened concrete interest,the courts not wholly issues of imminence and redressability,but not the issues of injury in fact or causation.see.audubon soc y bentsen,en banc citing lujan,at nn.at nn.taken together,the plaintiffs have standing only if,inter alia,the government violated their procedural rights designed to protect their threatened concrete interest,and the violation resulted in injury to their concrete,particularized interest.plaintiffs fail to satisfy either of the requirements at issue.
violation of a procedural right designed to protect plaintiffs interests 
appellants fail to show that a procedural right sufficient for standing has been violated.not all violations are sufficient for standing a plaintiff must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.lujan,at.at emphases added.
with respect to the organizational plaintiffs,the procedural rights at issue are clearly insufficient for standing,as the procedures at issue were not designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of the organizations.the no child left behind act required the secretary to select individuals to participate in such process from among individuals or groups that provided advice and recommendations,including representation from all geographic regions of the united states,in such numbers as will provide an equitable balance between representatives of parents and students and representatives of educators and educational officials.b b.nowhere does the act make mention of advocacy organizations interests.the only interests arguably enjoying implicit protection here are those of parents,students,educators and education officials although the advocacy groups may be representatives of parents and students,the interests to be protected are those of the parents and students,not of the organizations.
even in the case of the individual plaintiff,lindsey,it is not at all clear that the act procedures regarding the negotiated rulemaking process were designed to protect the interests of parents and students.the structure of as a whole shows that congress manifestly did not endorse protective litigation regarding the formation of the committee amidst the rulemaking process.the act specifically mandated that s uch rulemaking process shall be conducted in a timely manner to ensure that final regulations are issued by the secretary not later than year after january.b a.and,as noted above,the act created a complex process for crafting federal and state regulations that would affect parents and students interests,including the act provision for the selection of an equitable balance of committee members.these provisions do not offer any promise of purposeful protection of the concrete interests of students and parents.appellants cite the conference report for evidence that congress sought to ensu re that the views of both program beneficiaries and program providers are fairly heard and considered.brief for appellants at quoting conf,at,reprinted in.this is not persuasive evidence of protective design.to the extent that the legislative history is relevant to the question before us,we note that the language of the report does not support appellants position if anything,it weighs against it the conferees do not intend this language to require strict numerical equality or comparability among these representatives.rather,the conferees intend the secretary to have flexibility in selecting the committee members.conf.at,reprinted in.
with respect to the organizational plaintiffs,the nclba clearly did not create procedural rights designed to protect their concrete interests.with respect to lindsey,the nclba did not clearly create such a right but as the next section of this standing analysis makes clear,even if nclba did create such a right,she has not suffered injury sufficient to establish standing.
injury to a concrete,particularized interest 
appellants present a variety of alleged injuries as a result of the secretary selection of committee members.appellants argue that the individual plaintiff,parent rachelle lindsey,has suffered three injuries as a result of the secretary selection of committee members first,she was deprived of her procedural right to help shape the final rules.brief for appellants at.second,the final rules increased the risk that her children will be denied the benefit of the education and those rules were caused by the committee selection.id.at.third,the final rules fail to require states to provide for public participation in the creation of standards and measures under the act,and those final rules were caused by the committee selection.id.
appellants also argue that the organizational plaintiffs have suffered four injuries as a result of the secretary selection of committee members first,the secretary apportionment of committee seats among representatives of various interests reduced their chances of serving on the committee.id.at.second,the selection excluded parent and student advocacy organizations from consideration.id.third,the final rules forced them to address advocacy issues on an expensive basis.id.at.fourth,the final rules failed to require states to provide for public participation.id.
taken together,appellants allege four basic categories of injuries 
injuries to plaintiff lindsey caused by the final rules,following selection of the committee members 
injuries to plaintiff lindsey caused by the secretary abridgment of her procedural rights in the selection of committee members 
injuries to plaintiff organizations caused by the final rules,following selection of the committee members and 
injuries to plaintiff organizations caused by the secretary abridgment of their procedural rights in the selection of committee members.
to organize appellants alleged injuries in this fashion reveals what appellants muddled brief obfuscates appellants allege two classes of injury under a procedural rights theory of standing.appellants allege injuries to appellants procedural rights per se,and they allege injuries to their particularized interests caused by the final rules.we consider these classes of injuries in turn 
injury to their procedural interests 
appellants first allege that they suffered injury,as a result of the secretary failure to abide by the procedures prescribed by the act,to their interest in the government protection of their procedural rights.
as this court sitting en banc described at length in florida audubon society,a plaintiff must demonstrate standing by show ing not only that the defendant acts omitted some procedural requirement,but also that it is substantially probable that the procedural breach will cause the essential injury to the plaintiff own interest.at.in other words,while we relax the imminence and redressability requirements,the plaintiff must still satisfy the general requirements of the constitutional standards of particularized injury and causation.see id.at.although appellants rely heavily on footnote of lujan in arguing procedural standing in this case,even in that case the court required a showing that concrete interests had been invaded.at.
assuming arguendo that a procedural right designed to protect a concrete interest of the appellants has been violated here,appellants fail to demonstrate how they suffer actual injury to a concrete,particularized interest,caused by the challenged conduct.the chain of causation between the alleged procedural violation and the concrete interest is speculative at best.see infra pages.unadorned speculation will not suffice to invoke the judicial power.physicians ed.network dep t of,district court opinion expressly adopted en toto by court quoting simon eastern.welfare rights organization,d.
but even more importantly,appellants appear to misunderstand the difference between the procedural right and the concrete interest in a case.see,brief of appellants at the department denial of this right constitutes sufficient injury to support standing.the two things are not one and the same.appellants must show both that their procedural right has been violated,and that the violation of that right has resulted in an invasion of their concrete and particularized interest.a prospective plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant caused the particularized injury,and not just the alleged procedural violation.audubon soc y,at emphasis added.in lujan the supreme court disclaimed appellants conflation of concrete interest and procedural right in unambiguous language 
if we understand this argument correctly,it means that the government violation of a certain class of procedural duty satisfies the requirement by itself,without any showing that the procedural violation endangers a concrete interest of the plaintiff apart from his interest in having the procedure observed.we can not agree.
at.at.appellants must allege injury beyond mere procedural misstep per se to satisfy standing in a case,and they fail to do so here.
in sum,we hold that appellants have failed to show that the alleged procedural violation caused actual injury to appellants concrete interests such that they satisfy article iii requirement of standing.audubon soc y,at.
injuries to other interests,caused by the final rules 
appellants allege injury not only to their procedural interest,but also to their interests in education,lobbying,and other interests apart from procedural rights per se.even assuming arguendo that their purported interests do constitute particularized,concrete interests sufficient to satisfy lujan,see at.at,appellants fail to demonstrate the necessary causal connection between the challenged agency,the promulgation of final the alleged injury.
to demonstrate standing,appellants must show a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan,at.at quoting simon,at.at.
to show causation and redressability in their case,appellants need not demonstrate that,but for the procedural defect,the final outcome of the rulemaking process would have been different,and that this court ordering the action to remedy the procedural defect will alter the final effect on appellants interests.see lujan,at.at.in short,this court assumes the causal relationship between the procedural defect and the final agency action.nonetheless,appellants must still demonstrate a causal relationship between the final agency action and the alleged injuries 
in the case of lindsey,the agency action and the alleged injury stand at opposite ends of a long chain doe promulgated final rules giving discretion to the states to implement their own rules for the education of children in the state the state of illinois,in its discretion,implemented rules that were permitted but not required by doe those rules increased the risk of improper evaluation of students and schools lindsey daughter school might be improperly classified as a result though it presently receives federal funding under the nclba lindsey daughter might thereby be harmed by improper classification.
having outlined the alleged causal chain,we conclude that the connection between the beginning and end of the purported chain remains so attenuated that we can not hold the alleged injury to be fairly traceable to the final agency rules and not the result of the independent action of the state of illinois.lujan,at.at.where the necessary elements of causation and redressability hinge on the independent choices of the regulated third party,the states,it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury.wrestling coaches ass n,at quoting lujan,at.at internal quotation marks omitted.appellants fall far short of carrying their burden.
moreover,the court is not convinced that the alleged injury to lindsey is concrete and particularized.lujan,at.at.appellants allege direct injury styled as increased risk,in the form of giving the states the opportunity to injure appellants interests.this injury is insufficient for standing.
outside of increased exposure to environmental harms,hypothesized increased risk has never been deemed sufficient injury.and even if risk were sufficient injury for standing in the context,lindsey would have to show that the challenged conduct has created a demonstrably increased risk that actually threatens the plaintiff particular interests.audubon soc y,at emphasis added.here,lindsey has hypothesized that the final agency rules have increased the risk to her interests,but she has offered this court no actual demonstration of increased risk.
indeed,were all purely speculative increased risks deemed injurious,the entire requirement of actual or imminent injury would be rendered moot,because all hypothesized,injuries could be dressed up as increased risk of future injury.
with respect to the organizational plaintiffs,the causal chain between the challenged rules and the alleged injury is not so attenuated the organizations allege that the federal rules force them to change their lobbying strategies,a more costly form of lobbying.but while their causal chain may be more traceable than lindsey,it fails to bind the challenged conduct to actual injury.this court has not found standing when the only injury arises from the effect of the regulations on the organizations lobbying activities as opposed to the effect on activities c onflict between a defendant conduct and an organization mission is alone insufficient to establish article iii standing.frustration of an organization objectives is the type of abstract concern that does not impart standing.employees union united states,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the case before us is easily distinguished from havens realty coleman,d.there,the court held that an organization dedicated to promoting to housing had standing to challenge defendants practice of steering prospective tenants away,because defendants practice perceptibly impaired home ability to provide counseling and referral services for low and id.at.at.here,the only service impaired is pure very type of activity distinguished by havens.see id.at.at distinguishing sierra club morton,d 
in sum,appellants fail to demonstrate standing arising from the effect of the final rules,with respect to either the individual or organizational plaintiffs.
iii.conclusion 
because we hold that appellants lack standing to challenge the secretary selection of committee members,this court and the district court lack jurisdiction to hear appellants claims.and because we have already recognized our lack of jurisdiction,we will not consider whether the no child left behind act incorporates the negotiated rulemaking act bar on judicial review of committee formation.without jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause.jurisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.ex parte mccardle,wall,quoted in steel citizens for a better environment,d.
we affirm the district court judgments of dismissal.
the no child left behind act nclba or act,stat.relevant sections codified at supp.i,was enacted to enhance the educational opportunities of all children and ensure their ability to meet challenging academic standards.the act permits schools to exercise greater decisionmaking authority in exchange for greater responsibility for student performance,as monitored through state testing and accountability systems that comply with specific standards set out in.students in schools that consistently fail to meet target performance levels are entitled to supplemental educational services and the option to transfer to other public schools.id.
the act envisions parents as an integral part of achieving results and provides for parental participation from the inception of the implementing regulations through the development of state plans regarding assessments and accountability systems.see id.to implement the nclba,the secretary of education secretary is required to establish a negotiated rulemaking process on,at a minimum,standards and assessments,id.b a,and select individuals to participate in such process in such numbers as will provide an equitable balance between representatives of parents and students and representatives of educators and education officials,id.b b.
rachelle lindsey is a parent of two children who attend a school that has been identified as a school in need of improvement under the nclba.she alleges that the department of education department failed to observe the equitable balance requirement of of the nclba,in selecting the members to participate in the negotiated rulemaking process.in particular,she contends that this committee did not include an adequate number of representatives of parents and students.she also contends that the implementing regulations,which originated with the committee,have placed at risk her children capacity to obtain the full benefits of the act.
two questions are presented on this appeal.the first question is whether any challenge to the composition of the committee is subject to judicial review.the second question is whether any of the appellants in this case have standing to pursue such a challenge.i believe that the district court erred in holding that judicial review of the committee composition is barred however,on the record at hand,i find that appellants lack standing to bring this case.
i.the secretary selection of participants for the negotiated rulemaking process prescribed by the nclba is clearly subject to judicial review 
the department asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction over appellants claims,because judicial review is barred.in advancing this contention,the department argues that the nclba incorporates of the negotiated rulemaking act,which provides in part 
any agency action relating to establishing,assisting,or terminating a negotiated rulemaking committee under this subchapter shall not be subject to judicial review.nothing in this section shall bar judicial review of a rule if such judicial review is otherwise provided by law.
the department argument is entirely without merit.the nclba does not incorporate of the negotiated rulemaking act.and,even if it did,does not bar review of the present suit.
the nclba plainly does not incorporate the negotiated rulemaking act in its totality.indeed,the nclba mandates a negotiated rulemaking process,see b,while the negotiated rulemaking act leaves the decision whether to engage in such process to the discretion of the agency,see.the nclba also prescribes particular steps for selecting participants in the negotiated rulemaking process,see b,whereas the negotiated rulemaking act has no such prescriptions.the nclba only looks to the negotiated rulemaking act to guide the process of negotiated rulemaking.this is apparent from the language and structure of the relevant provisions of the two acts.
the nclba directs the secretary to establish a negotiated rulemaking process,b a,and to select individuals to participate in such process in such numbers as will provide an equitable balance between representatives of parents and students and representatives of educators and education officials,b b emphasis added.the next paragraph of,titled process,explains that s uch process shall not be subject to the federal advisory committee act,but shall otherwise follow the provisions of the negotiated rulemaking act of.b b.thus,first prescribes that the secretary establish a negotiated rulemaking process and provides instructions for the selection of persons to participate in that process.it then directs that the process of negotiated rulemaking shall follow the prescriptions of the negotiated rulemaking act,such as the consensus requirement contained in.it is therefore clear that,under the nclba,questions concerning the selection of the committee are completely distinct from how the committee members participate in the negotiated rulemaking process.judicial review is foreclosed only with respect to the process of negotiated rulemaking.
furthermore,nothing in the language,structure,or legislative history of the negotiated rulemaking act purports to bar judicial review of procedural requirements imposed by other statutes.in fact,it expressly states the opposite.first,of the negotiated rulemaking act is explicit that a ny agency action relating to establishing a negotiated rulemaking committee under this subchapter shall not be subject to judicial review.emphasis added.the nclba committee is not established under the subchapter in which the negotiated rulemaking act is located.indeed,establishing a negotiated rulemaking committee under that subchapter is a discretionary act,which follows consideration of multiple factors enumerated at a.in contrast,establishing the committee under the nclba is mandatory,and must follow specific steps contained in b.clearly,then,the committee established under b is not a committee established under the negotiated rulemaking act.
second,where,as here,review of an alleged procedural violation in the context of final rule review is permitted by the administrative procedure act apa,the savings clause of explicitly permits such review nothing in this section shal
