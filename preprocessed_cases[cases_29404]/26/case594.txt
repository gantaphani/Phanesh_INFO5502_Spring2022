judy applied for a job at madison area technical college matc in.when she did not receive an interview,much less a job,she sued matc and three employees involved in the hiring process.she alleged that they discriminated against her because of her race and retaliated against her because of her marriage to willie nunnery,a lawyer who had previously been involved in filing a frivolous lawsuit against these same defendants.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,and we affirm.
is an woman who holds a doctorate in education from the university of.she has held a number of management positions in education and in state government,including as vocational education coordinator for the milwaukee public schools,administrator for the department of health and human services,and administrator for the workers compensation division and the division of vocational rehabilitation in the state department of workforce development.she is married to willie nunnery,a lawyer.in,nunnery represented elvira jimenez in a race discrimination suit against matc,carol bassett,jackie thomas and william stryker,who are all defendants in this case as well.the jimenez case ended as badly as a case can end for a lawyer and his client.the court dismissed the jimenez suit as frivolous and found that certain documents produced by jimenez had been fraudulently created.ultimately,nunnery was sanctioned and his law license was suspended for a period of time as a result of his actions in the jimenez case.stryker,thomas and bassett all were questioned at the sanctions hearing.stryker and bassett both testified regarding the harm they suffered as the result of being falsely accused of engaging in racial discrimination.
in,applied for a position with matc as the executive dean of learning.thomas nominated four internal candidates for the position.nothing in the record suggests that thomas had any other involvement in the hiring process for the executive dean position.although passed the initial screening process for applicants,she was not interviewed for the job.as part of the hiring process,matc compiled a list of information about the candidates that specified,among other things,their race.the list for the dean position identified as black.there is no evidence in the record that any of the individual defendants here ever saw that list.
in,applied again for a position at matc,this time for the position of disability resource services administrator hereafter drs administrator.learned of the position from bob wynn,a minority recruiter for matc who contacted her because he thought she would be a good candidate for the job.with wynn encouragement,called eugene fujimoto,matc diversity action officer,to discuss the job further.fujimoto was responsible for monitoring matc hiring process for fairness.he told that her administrative experience would be helpful for this particular position.after discussing the job with wynn and fujimoto,applied.
other persons also applied for the drs administrator position.bassett,an administrator in the human resources department,conducted an initial screening of the applicants to weed out those who did not meet the minimum qualifications.the job posting specified that a minimally qualified applicant would have a master degree and at least hours of administrative experience.the job description set forth the basics of the position 
direct the daily operation,activities and staff of disability resource services across the matc district.plan,develop,implement,monitor and assess programs and services meeting the requirements of section of the rehabilitation act of and the americans with disabilities act for eligible students with disabilities.promote and support the success of students with disabilities emphasizing the development of the whole person with the student learning experience.
the initial screening reduced the applicant pool to candidates.bassett found that met the standards for a minimally qualified applicant and advanced to the next stage of the hiring process.
in order to select the ten most qualified candidates from the pool of to proceed to the interview phase,matc used a selection committee consisting of kevin carini,beth bremer,marilyn fayram,carol and jacquelyn thomas.thomas is a defendant in this case,and of course had been a defendant in the jimenez suit filed by husband many years earlier.thomas served as chair of the selection committee and was to be the direct supervisor of the drs administrator.kristine gebhardt,a matc human resources administrator,led a training session with the committee to establish depth and breadth screening criteria for the drs administrator position.the committee developed a list of five criteria by which to assess the candidates and assigned a maximum number of points to each experience with higher education two points experience with adult persons with disabilities three points knowledge of current and emergent technologies for persons with disabilities point supervisory experience two points and experience with providing reasonable accommodations in an educational setting three points.
after the criteria were established,each committee member independently scored each of the candidates who had been found minimally qualified.the committee then met to discuss each candidate and the rationale for their scores until they reached a consensus on a score for each applicant.thomas recorded the consensus score for each applicant on her copy of the screening form.the committee selected the top ten scoring applicants for interviews and did not make the cut.because the college set certain equal employment opportunity goals,three or more minority candidates were required to be in the interview pool.after selecting the original ten candidates,higgans then retrieved the affirmative action sheet that identified the race of each applicant.on comparing that sheet to the list of ten potential interviewees,the committee learned that the list of ten candidates included only one minority applicant,an woman.the committee then added to the interview pool the next two highest scoring minority applicants,an asian man and a hispanic woman.two of the ten original interviewees removed themselves from consideration and the remaining candidates were interviewed.after the first round of interviews,the pool was reduced to three candidates.none of the minority candidates advanced to the second round of interviews.
at that point,fujimoto became concerned that no minority candidates were advancing to the next round.he approached stryker,the vice president of human resources,and higgans to express his concerns.he asked why had not been given an interview.higgans told him that had scored lower than the interviewed applicants in the categories for higher education and experience with persons with disabilities.stryker then arranged a second meeting to address fujimoto concerns.present at the meeting were stryker,thomas and bassett the individual defendants here as well as higgans and fujimoto.fujimoto told the group that had been specifically recruited for the job,had a high level of administrative experience and also had an excellent background.he felt that her level of relevant experience was not reflected in her application and asked the group to make certain assumptions about her experience from her résumé,asserting that they would learn during the interview process specific qualifications that she possessed that were not apparent on her paperwork.he also questioned the validity of the criteria.higgans responded to these concerns by reiterating that had scored lower than the other applicants in two areas of the criteria.when stryker asked if anyone believed that discrimination had played a part in the interview selection process,no one said it had.stryker decided not to add to the interview list,a decision in which bassett and higgans concurred.fujimoto then sent a letter to,explaining that she had not been selected for an interview because other candidates scored higher than she did in certain categories,including higher education experience and direct experience with persons with disabilities.
after the second round of interviews,matc hired sandra hall,a white woman,for the drs administrator position.hall,who had previously worked for at the division of worker compensation,had thirty years of experience in the disability field,a master degree in rehabilitation counseling,three years of administrative experience at the university of supervising disability services,five years of experience working as a rehabilitation counselor for adults with developmental disabilities or mental illness,and a good working knowledge of assistive technologies,particularly in the setting of students in higher education.
before applied for the drs administrator position,bassett and stryker did not know any nunnerys in madison,wisconsin other than willie nunnery.bassett conducted the initial screening of the applicants and so she was aware that there was a candidate who shared,in part,the same last name as the lawyer who had filed a frivolous suit against her.at some point,possibly during the meeting with fujimoto to discuss application,bassett became aware that is married to willie nunnery.she discussed this realization with thomas and stryker,although the record does not establish a definitive time frame for these discussions.all of the defendants were aware that willie nunnery is.there is no other evidence in the record that anyone knew that is until higgans retrieved the eeo sheet that listed the race of the applicants.
fujimoto,as the college diversity coordinator and affirmative action officer,was responsible for reporting on matc affirmative action hiring and retention efforts.in his research for the report,fujimoto determined that,for the period between and,six to seven percent of the administrators at the college were persons of color.this represented a decrease from the prior period.after conducting a study,fujimoto concluded that race affected the college hiring decisions on a structural level because the system favored insiders in the area of faculty hiring,for example,of positions were filled from the pool of staff.this had a disparate impact on minority candidates because of the faculty was white.
after she was not offered an interview for the drs administrator position,filed a charge of race discrimination in the equal rights division of the wisconsin department of workforce development hereafter erd.after filing her claim,matc discovered that certain documents pertaining to the hiring process for the drs administrator position were missing.of the original applications had been lost,including.thomas screening form,which included the scores for the minimally qualified candidates was also lost.the scoring forms of the other four committee members were found and produced,as was bassett screening form for minimal qualifications.
ultimately,filed suit in federal court against matc,bassett,stryker and thomas.she alleged that the defendants violated title vii and the fourteenth amendment when they precluded her from entering into an employment contract because of her race or because of her association with her husband,that they violated u.and the fourteenth amendment by discriminating against her in the terms and conditions of pursuing the drs administrator job,and that they violated her rights under the first and fourteenth amendments by retaliating against her because of her marital association with willie nunnery.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants because offered no evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that race or marital status motivated the defendants decision not to hire her.she appeals.
on appeal,argues that she is entitled to an inference under the spoliation doctrine that the missing documents would have favored her claims of race discrimination and marital association retaliation.she contends that she produced adequate evidence that the defendants knew her race from the beginning of the hiring process,that they were motivated by race and dislike for her husband in deciding not to interview or hire her,and that the record is replete with evidence that the defendants stated reasons for not hiring her were pretextual.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.gunville walker,cir george walker,cir.
the first issue is whether is entitled to an inference that the missing documents would support her claims for discrimination and marital association retaliation.an employer destruction of or inability to produce a document,standing alone,does not warrant an inference that the document,if produced,would have contained information adverse to the employer case.park city of chicago,cir.in order to draw an inference that the missing documents contained information adverse to the defendants,must demonstrate that the defendants intentionally destroyed the documents in bad faith.faas sears,roebuck,cir park,at.the crucial element in a spoliation claim is not the fact that the documents were destroyed but that they were destroyed for the purpose of hiding adverse information.faas,at motel operating,cir.some courts have found a spoliation sanction to be appropriate only where a party has a duty to preserve evidence because it knew,or should have known,that litigation was imminent,at.see also park,at a violation of a record retention policy creates a rebuttable presumption that the missing record contained evidence adverse to the violator.
fails on every element of the test for the spoliation inference.first,the documents disappeared before filed any claim against matc and the individual defendants.thus,the documents were lost before matc knew or should have known that litigation was imminent.second,has offered no evidence that the defendants lost or destroyed the documents for the purpose of hiding adverse information.between the time applied for the job and the filing of her claim of discrimination,matc moved its human resources department twice due to office remodeling.each time,all of the records in the office were boxed up and moved.at the time applied for the drs administrator position,matc still used paper applications.matc paper filing system left something to be desired.the stack of papers awaiting filing in the human resources office sometimes reached three feet in height.no single individual was responsible for filing various human resources employees filed applications and other paperwork,including student employees.after the moves,matc was unable to locate twentyfive of the original applications,including.although thomas screening form,which contained the consensus scores,was missing,the scoring forms of the other four committee members were located and produced,along with bassett screening for minimal qualifications.matc also located and produced the written applications of candidates,including the application submitted by hall,the person hired for the job.it is unclear from the record whether kept a copy of the application she submitted,but the last person at matc who could account for the whereabouts of application was fujimoto.he had application with him when he met with stryker,bassett and thomas.at the end of that june meeting,he returned application to the human resources department.between june and december,the human resources files were boxed up and moved twice.filed her claim against matc and the individual defendants in april.
as evidence of the defendants bad faith,points out that two witnesses could not recall hiring documents being lost prior to this occasion.she also asserts that matc constantly shifted its story about what happened to the missing documents,first claiming that fujimoto had them,then simply claiming that her application was missing,then claiming to have lost the documents in an office move and then claiming to have lost the documents in two office moves.that documents had not been lost before implies nothing in and of itself.and matc never changed its explanation but simply supplied more information over time.for example,matc never stated that fujimoto had the missing documents.rather,a lawyer for matc stated in a letter 
the complainant application materials were with eugene fujimoto when he investigated her concerns.fujimoto has left the college and her material is not available.
ex.s,at.although one reading of the letter implies that fujimoto took the papers with him when he left the college,each part of the statement is literally true.fujimoto was the last person known to have the papers.although he stated that he returned them to the human resources department,no one has been able to find them since that time.thus,material is not available.stating simply that the documents were missing is also true and implies nothing.because did not file her claims until after the documents had been moved twice in the office remodeling project,and because no one had any reason to look for the documents between the two moves,it is not surprising that the defendants are not able to pinpoint when the documents were lost.in light of the undisputed circumstances of the office moves,there is nothing suspicious about the defendants inability to say when or how the documents disappeared.conclusory statements to the contrary,there is simply no evidence supporting a bad faith motive on the part of the defendants in the disappearance of the documents.
moreover,although the consensus scoring sheet was not found,the scoring sheets of four of the five committee members were located.these documents supplied a good part of the information used in reaching the consensus scores.if the scoring sheets of four out of five committee members do not support claims,it is highly unlikely that the missing fifth document contains information adverse to the defendants.presumably knew what was on her own application and fujimoto also could have testified about the contents of her application as he was the last person in possession of it.has presented no evidence suggesting an intent on the part of the defendants to hide adverse information.because there is no evidence that any of the defendants destroyed the documents in bad faith,is not entitled to a favorable inference under the spoliation doctrine.
the district court found that claims for race and marital association discrimination failed at the outset because she produced no evidence that any of the relevant knew her race or marital status at the time she was eliminated from the pool of candidates to be interviewed.the court also found that failed to demonstrate that the defendants stated reason for not hiring she scored lower than the other candidates in the a pretext.we think the question of whether the defendants knew race or marital association is a closer call than the district court opinion reflects.for example,bassett admits she drew a connection between willie nunnery and at some point and discussed this connection with the other defendants,although the record does not tell us when she made the connection or when she discussed it with the other defendants.thomas chaired the committee and was to be the direct supervisor of the new drs administrator.bassett,thomas and stryker had all been sued by willie nunnery in the jimenez case.a person is unlikely to quickly forget being falsely sued for racial discrimination,and any mention of nunnery fairly unusual name would probably have attracted the attention of these three defendants.on summary judgment,when we must construe the facts in favor of,we are reluctant to find that there is no genuine issue regarding whether and when the defendants were aware of her race and marital association.a reasonable could infer from these highly unusual facts that the defendants knew is and that she is married to willie nunnery.in the end,though,this dispute is irrelevant because can not show that the defendants nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to hire her is pretext.nor can she demonstrate causation on her claim for marital association retaliation.
contends that she has direct evidence of race discrimination and that she can also defeat summary judgment using the mcdonnell douglas analysis.we begin with her direct evidence.contends that fujimoto study of matc hiring practices and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the missing documents both supply direct evidence of discriminatory intent.as we discussed above,there is nothing suspicious about the loss of certain documents in the two office moves that took place between the time the hiring process was underway and the time first complained of discrimination.nor does fujimoto study aid her case.fujimoto study concluded only that matc use of the criteria tended to favor inside candidates,which had the effect of favoring candidates.but must show that it is more likely than not that she was harmed by discriminatory acts.a study showing that certain hiring practices correlated with a negative effect on minority hiring,although relevant,will not by itself meet the more likely than not standard for a claim of discrimination against an individual plaintiff.baylie federal reserve bank of chicago,cir.
statistical analysis is relevant in the technical sense that it has a tendency to make the existence of a material fact more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.but data showing a small increase in the probability of discrimination can not by itself get a plaintiff over the threshold it must be coupled with other evidence,which does most of the work.
baylie,at.see also nichols southern illinois,cir a plaintiff may use pattern evidence of disparate treatment even if that evidence is not rigorously statistical,although,standing alone,it is insufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment barricks eli lilly,cir noting the importance of further analysis and context when relying on raw data in employment discrimination disputes.has no other direct evidence of discrimination.therefore,she must make her claim,if at all,under the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis.see mcdonnell douglas green.
under the burden shifting analysis,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of hiring discrimination by demonstrating 
i that he belongs to a racial minority ii that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants iii that,despite his qualifications,he was rejected and iv that,after his rejection,the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant qualifications.
mcdonnell douglas,at city of new albany,cir senner northcentral technical college,cir.to withstand summary judgment on the prima facie case,the plaintiff need only show that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding these elements,at.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for not hiring the plaintiff.mcdonnell douglas,at,at senner,at.normally,we first determine whether a plaintiff has established a prima facie case before putting the employer to the burden of demonstrating a reason for not hiring the plaintiff and engaging in the pretext analysis.everroad scott truck systems,cir.
in some cases,though,the issue of qualifications for the job and the question of pretext overlap.when the employer asserts as the reason for not hiring the plaintiff that she was not as qualified as other candidates for the position,the credibility of the employer assertion is at issue for both the second and fourth elements of the plaintiff prima facie case and the pretext analysis.everroad,at.there is a good deal of overlap in this case between these key issues and we therefore analyze them together.
there is no dispute that belongs to a racial minority or that she met the minimal qualifications for the job.nor is there any dispute that she was not chosen for the job,and matc then continued to seek applicants from the pool of other qualified candidates.but matc had a large number of minimally qualified candidates and sought to select from that larger pool the candidates who were most qualified for the job to proceed to the next phase of the hiring process.matc has proffered as its legitimate,reason for not interviewing or hiring that she scored lower on the criteria than the applicants who advanced to the interview stage.she also had lower scores than the person ultimately hired for the position.the numerical evaluation system the college developed
