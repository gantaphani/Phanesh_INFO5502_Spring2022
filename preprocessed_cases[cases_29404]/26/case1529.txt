in this,the fourth appeal arising from a serious personal injury action,simi valley unified school district district appeals from a judgment entered against it after the jury found that an open school yard gate,constructed next to a dangerous intersection,constituted a dangerous condition of public property,subd.a.district launches a plethora of unsuccessful claims.we affirm and hopefully put an end to this litigation.
facts and procedural history 
on may,then jennifer joyce was struck in a marked crosswalk at medina and sequoia avenues in the city of simi valley.jennifer was on her way to sequoia junior high school.the crosswalk had no signals and crossed a busy street.it allowed children access to the adjacent school through an open school yard gate.
a motorist,karen smith,struck jennifer in the no.one southbound lane of sequoia avenue.jennifer was thrown feet,resulting in severe head injuries.
after the motorist settled for,jennifer sued district and the city of simi valley city.the first amended complaint alleged that prior accidents and near misses had occurred at the subject crosswalk,that the open school yard gate encouraged students to use the crosswalk,and that district failed to warn about the dangerous intersection or direct students to use the signaled crosswalk near the front of the school.
first appeal the demurrer 
district demurred on the ground that the open gate was not a dangerous condition of public property within the meaning of government code section.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.we held that the open school yard gate could be a dangerous condition if it encouraged students to cross a dangerous intersection next to the school.
first trial jury instruction error 
in the first trial,the trial court instructed that district was not liable unless the crosswalk,which was owned and maintained by city,had a physical defect.the jury found for city and district.we affirmed as to city.we reversed as to district on instructional error because district duty of care did not rise or fall on whether the crosswalk had a physical defect.
second trial attorney misconduct 
the jury in the second trial found district at fault and awarded million damages,resulting in a million judgment against district.district was granted a new trial on the ground of attorney misconduct.we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.
third trial 
at the third trial,the school principal,franklin finch,testified that he ordered a hole cut in the fence shortly after the school opened in.the fence opening was built next to the crosswalk to encourage students to cross at the intersection.finch did not consult an architect,engineer,or traffic safety expert before cutting the hole.
harry krueper,a traffic engineer,testified the opening in the fence was a focal point or funnel point for school children to gain access to the school i t concentrated the pedestrian flow into one area where you were crossing a wide roadway sequoia avenue,a wide,roadway that had,i would call,moderate to high speeds.because the intersection restricted the line of sight of motorists,it had the potential of hiding pedestrians using the crosswalk.as the area grew,sequoia avenue became a secondary highway with a traffic volume of more than vehicles per day.less than percent of the motorists observed the posted speed limit.district expert,weston pringle,agreed that speeders would cause an unreasonable risk of harm for the kids.
before jennifer was struck in the crosswalk,parents and district employees complained about the intersection.joy azzinaro,a school playground aide,heard screeching brakes and saw near misses almost every day.she notified school officials but no corrective action was taken.
joyce smith,a school bus driver,saw motorists speed through the intersection and complained about accidents.smith testified that the crosswalk was hard to see because it was right after the top of the crest,right on top of it.so you do actually see the striping where the actual crosswalk is.
several months before jennifer was injured,city conducted a traffic study and determined that percent of the motorists drove miles per hour on sequoia avenue.the posted speed limit was miles per hour when children were not present and miles per hour when children were present,subd.a b.city raised the speed limit to miles per hour when children were not present.
carol joy,president of the sequoia junior high school booster club,was concerned about the speed increase and conducted meetings on the perceived traffic hazard.finch and other school officials attended the meetings.a traffic safety expert from the police department spoke at one of the meetings and recommended that students cross at the signal near the front of the school.
finch was concerned about speeders and appeared before the city council six or eight times.more than students entered and left the school each day.when finch learned about the proposed speed increase,city told him to direct the students to cross up the street at the traffic light.
finch claimed that his responsibility ended at the fence lines and that i d o not take my direction from the city council.he told the booster club that he was not closing the school yard gate.finch did not discuss the matter with his superiors because w e were not even considering closing it,so why would we discuss it although district stationed personnel at the front of the school to supervise students coming to and leaving school,finch did not request a monitor for the crosswalk.
the jury,by special verdict,found that the open school yard gate was a dangerous condition and that district did not take reasonable action to protect against the risk of injury,subd.a.the jury apportioned percent liability to district,percent liability to jennifer,percent liability to the driver karen smith,and percent liability to city.jennifer was awarded economic damages and noneconomic damages.
district unsuccessfully moved for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the trial court modified the judgment to reflect the settlement with the driver code civ,and denied a motion to deduct collateral source payments.a net judgment in the amount of plus costs was entered against district.
dangerous condition of public property 
district contends that the open school yard gate was not a dangerous condition of public property.the argument is based on the theory that district has immunity as a matter of law because the injury occurred off school property.
government code section,subdivision a provides that a dangerous condition is a condition of property that creates a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used.emphasis added.the california law revision commission comments to section state a public entity may be liable only for dangerous conditions of its own property.but its own property may be considered dangerous if it creates a substantial risk of injury to persons on adjacent property and its own property may be considered dangerous if a condition on the adjacent property exposes those using the public property to a substantial risk of injury.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
pursuant to sections and,a public entity may have a duty to protect against a risk of harm on adjacent property,carson facilities development cal d,sign next to intersection obstructed view.for example,in branzel city of concord d,a city model plane field was found to be a dangerous condition of public property because nearby electrical lines exposed those using the field to a substantial risk of injury.while the city did not maintain or control the power lines,it did maintain the flying field in a location so close to them that in the light of the known use of the field the involvement of the field with the lines could be reasonably anticipated.ibid.
in the first appeal,we said that t here is a difference between failing to take action to influence or affect a danger and encouraging students to expose themselves to a danger.although district did not control the crosswalk,it did control whether an opening in the fence should be made.the open gate was built next to the crosswalk to encourage students to cross at an uncontrolled intersection it diverted children from a safer,intersection less than feet away.we concluded that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the open gate was a dangerous condition that could have been remedied by simply closing the fence opening and directing students to cross at the signal,warden city of los angeles cal d,dangerous condition may result from location submerged sewer pipe.the cases cited by district are not here controlling.they do not involve schools encouraging children to cross a dangerous intersection,lompoc unified school district superior court th,d bicyclist hit by motorist who was distracted by school football game no dangerous condition of public property seaber hotel del coronado th,d no duty to warn of dangerous crosswalk outside hotel owens kings supermarket d.no liability where customer hit in street in front of supermarket.
jennifer case is similar to bonanno central contra costa transit authority cal th,d.there,our supreme court held that a bus stop,owned and maintained by central contra costa transit authority cccta,was a dangerous condition of public property.after residents complained that they were having difficulty crossing an intersection to get to and from the bus stop,county painted a crosswalk.plaintiff,a bus patron,used the crosswalk to get to the bus stop.a motorist stopped to let plaintiff cross and was struck from behind,causing her vehicle to lurch forward and hit plaintiff.
citing warden city of los angeles,supra,cal d,and branzel city of concord,supra,d,our supreme court stated that the location of a public improvement or,more broadly,its relationship to its surroundings,may create dangers to users is by no means a novel idea.bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th at,d.the court rejected the argument that cccta can not be liable for an injury occurring on property the street it neither owned nor controlled.cccta owned and controlled its own bus stop,and a condition of that property,its physical situation,caused users of the bus stop to be at risk from the immediately adjacent property,just as the model airplane flyers were at risk from the adjacent power lines in branzel,supra,d.nor is it determinative that bonanno injury occurred on adjacent county property as she approached the bus stop,rather than while she was awaiting the bus at the stop itself t hat bonanno was injured trying to access cccta property makes her no less a user of it.if a cccta bus stop could be reached only by jumping across an adjacent ditch,cccta would logically bear the same liability to a patron who fell into the ditch attempting to reach the bus stop as to one who fell while waiting at the bus stop,at,d.
here liability is based on district failure to provide adequate safeguards against a known dangerous condition,ducey argo sales cal d.it is not only structural defects that can create a dangerous condition it may consist of a condition of property,the use of which in a manner reasonably foreseeable creates a danger of injury.quelvog city of long beach d.dangerous condition because city encouraged use of autoettes on sidewalk.in constantinescu conejo valley unified school dist.th,d,we held that schools may be held liable for failure to erect barriers or to correct other conditions on their property.
the same principle applies here.district was aware of the dangerous intersection but insisted on keeping the gate open after city increased the speed limit.substantial evidence supported the finding that the open gate was a dangerous condition of public property and that district failed to take reasonable action to protect against a foreseeable and substantial risk of injury,subds.a b.district officials could not complacently declare that they were powerless over a long period of years to take any steps to remedy the dangerous condition warden city of los angeles,supra,cal d at.
education code section 
citing education code section,district argues that it had no duty to supervise students going to and from school liability,however,was not based on lack of school supervision but an open gate that enticed children to cross an adjacent dangerous intersection.in the first appeal this court held that education code section did not provide immunity.although the initial portion of the statute provides that no school district shall be responsible for the conduct or safety of any pupil at any time when such pupil is not on school property,the section goes on explicitly to withdraw this grant of immunity whenever the school district,inter alia,has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.hoyem manhattan beach city sch.dist.cal d.
jury instructions 
district contends that the trial court erred in not instructing on several statutory immunities governing traffic signs and signals baji and.the trial court found that the instructions would confuse and mislead the jury it did not err.jennifer did not claim that district breached a duty to install traffic signs and signals or modify the crosswalk.
district argues that the jury should have been instructed that it had no duty to supervise students going to and from school.special instruction,and.the trial court,however,was not required to give argumentative and conflicting instructions,fibreboard paper products east bay union d.the trial court found that special instruction was overbroad and that special instruction could lend itself to confusion and conflict between the instructions i be giving the jury on the liability of a public entity for dangerous condition for example,the opening phrase informs the jury that there is no responsibility in any way for the safety of a pupil when the pupil is not on school property.well,that seems to at least conflict in a common sense way with the whole hypothesis of a dangerous condition here where children are crossing a crosswalk,getting hit by a car t hat part of a dangerous condition of school property.
special instruction paraphrased vehicle code section and described how a school crosswalk should be painted.special instruction paraphrased vehicle code section concerning traffic control devices.the trial court declined to give the instructions because it was undisputed that district had no duty to maintain the crosswalk or install traffic control devices.the court was not required to instruct on untenable theories or unpled defenses.cain state farm mut.auto.ins.d.harris oaks shopping center th,d irrelevant,confusing,incomplete or misleading instructions need not be given.
special instruction and stated that the jury was not to consider whether jennifer was provided adequate educational instruction.the trial court ruled that the proposed instructions were ambiguous and not supported by the evidence or theories advanced at trial.there was no instructional error.the duty to safeguard against a dangerous condition is not part of a school discretionary immunity in selecting an academic curriculum.see peter san francisco unified sch.dist.d.searcy hemet unified school dist.d.student struck from school no duty to educate on how and where to cross streets.
district argues that the trial court should have instructed that the crosswalk was found not to be a dangerous condition in the second trial.special instruction and.the trial court declined to give the proposed instructions because t hey going to be dealing in terms of unreasonable risks from a totality of circumstances as opposed to a dangerous condition of a particular crosswalk w hether the crosswalk is a dangerous condition as that technical term might be defined is really irrelevant.that been decided previously at a prior trial.as to whether the use of the crosswalk in ordinary care by people presents unreasonable risks of injury is a different consideration and i do want to confuse them.
there was no instructional error.the jury was asked to determine the comparative fault of district,city,jennifer,and the driver.it found city percent at fault.district proposed instructions conflicted with the special verdict form and would have required the jury to find that the crosswalk was not dangerous,byrum brand d.special verdict form may not conflict with instructions.
district requested other instructions that were argumentative and confusing.special instruction,and district right to access public street and sidewalk.rejecting the instructions,the trial court stated the question is whether district allowed a use of its property to become a dangerous use by reason of some of the hazards and risk s on the adjacent property,not whether the district has a right of access to the sidewalk.this is not a real property case.
we agree.the instructions proposed by district would have diverted the jurors from the real issues before them.an instruction correct in the abstract,may not be given where it is not supported by the evidence or is likely to mislead the jury.solgaard guy atkinson cal d.
law of the case 
district contends that the trial court erred in instructing that s chool property a fence opening,that is otherwise,may constitute a dangerous condition if it exposes the users of nearby public property the crosswalk to a substantial risk of injury.the instruction was taken from our unpublished opinion in the second appeal in which we said that the fence opening theoretically created a dangerous condition because it encouraged school children to cross at the uncontrolled intersection.we explained that a dangerous condition of public property includes property which,because of its general use and operation,creates a substantial risk of harm to foreseeable users.rodriguez inglewood unified school dist.d.

in the second appeal,we held that it was error not to give baji on the standard of care in dealing with children.district argues that the instruction,which was given in the third trial,erroneously implied that it had a duty to supervise students in the street 
the jury was correctly instructed,calandri ione unified school dist.d.error not to instruct on standard of care owed by adult to child.because of the special relationship between district and its students,district had a heightened duty to make the school safe citation.the california law revision committee notes that w here it is reasonably foreseeable that persons to whom a lower standard of care is as be exposed to a substantial risk of injury from the property,the public entity should be required to take reasonable precautions to protect such persons from that risk.constantinescu conejo valley unified school,supra,th at,d.
district defended on the theory that jennifer and the motorist were negligent.but concurrent negligence does not defeat its own maintenance of a dangerous condition or the standard of care owed,bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th at,d,transit authority liable for maintaining bus stop next to dangerous intersection motorist percent at fault baldwin state of california cal d,fn,driver negligence did not defeat claim for dangerous condition of public property alexander state of california ex rel of transportation d.same.the trial court correctly noted that students approaching the school,crossing the intersection appropriately and with due care,and also entering in through the gate were confronted with significant risks of injury,and that would qualify as a dangerous condition and the question then might be whether the school district took the appropriate action or not.were they reasonable in the way they behaved these are all jury questions 
construed as a whole,the instructions adequately instructed on the theory of the case and applicable defenses.there is no merit to the argument that the alleged instructional errors,either singly or cumulatively,resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi,soule general motors cal th,d.
motion for new trial 
in the first phase of trial on liability,the jury was bussed to the school to view the intersection and fence opening.during the visit,a truck approached the crosswalk and failed to yield until the bailiff gestured to the driver.jennifer attorney remarked about the incident in final argument.the trial court sustained an objection and directed the jury to ignore counsel remarks the jury was instructed that the statements of counsel were not evidence baji and to decide all questions of fact in this case from the evidence received in this trial and not from any other source.baji.
having reviewed the entire record,we conclude that the admonishment cured any prejudice,clemente state of california cal d.the motion for new trial was properly denied.a trial judge is in a better position than an appellate court to determine whether a verdict resulted wholly,or in part,from the asserted misconduct of counsel and his conclusion in the matter will not be disturbed unless,under all the circumstances,it is plainly wrong.citations.cope davison cal d.
juror misconduct 
in the second phase of trial on damages,a juror submitted a note that stated a few members of the jury and i would like to know if the percentage given to the school district of simi valley,in question of the special verdict on liability,should influence our decision on the award amount given to the plaintiff the trial court instructed that the prior findings on comparative fault had no bearing on damages.the jurors were admonished not to talk about the case until it was submitted to them.
district argues that the admonition was too little and too late and complains that the jury was not admonished each time it recessed.code civ.in the first phase of trial on liability,the jurors were instructed times not to discuss the case or form opinions before the case was submitted to them.in the second phase of trial on damages,the jury was admonished only once.district did not object.b oth an objection and proof of prejudice are required before a failure to readmonish is deemed reversible error.people morales cal d.

medical insurance 
district argues that the trial court erred in not deducting collateral source payments from the judgment,subd.b.as a district employee,jennifer mother received maxicare insurance as part of her union benefits.maxicare paid some but not all of jennifer medical bills.
section requires that a personal injury judgment be reduced by the amount of medical services provided by a public entity defendant.see ceb,cal.tort liability ceb ed.district,however,purchased the medical insurance as an employer.it made no contributions to jennifer care as a tortfeasor,mcquillan southern pacific d.no setoff where defendant paid retirement contributions as an employer.the medical insurance was an employer obligation completely outside the notions of tort liability.ibid.
