sarah ellenberg sued the new mexico military institute and its board of regents nmmi on the ground that in denying her admission,nmmi violated three federal laws protecting persons with disabilities the individuals with disabilities education act idea,section of the rehabilitation act section,and title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.
the district court held ellenberg could not establish a prima facie discrimination claim under section and the ada because she had not offered the required evidence of a disability that substantially limited a major life activity.ellenberg argues the district court erred,and that her eligibility for an individualized education program under the idea means she automatically satisfies the disability requirements of section and the ada.
we conclude the district court correctly found the statutes have different requirements for establishing a disability,and that having an individualized education program under the idea does not automatically establish a disability under section and the ada.exercising jurisdiction under,we accordingly affirm.
background 
we reviewed in detail the facts and procedural history in a prior appeal,ellenberg new mexico military institute,cir,and only briefly summarize them here.
nmmi is a state educational institution in roswell,new mexico,offering college preparatory education in a military setting.in,nmmi denied ellenberg admission,citing behavioral problems manifested in her presence at a residential treatment facility,admitted past drug use,level of medication requirements,and need for continued counseling.at the time nmmi denied ellenberg admission,she was eligible for special education services under the idea and had an individualized education program ellenberg sued,arguing nmmi admissions decision violated the idea,section,and the ada.the district court rejected the idea claim after finding nmmi had satisfied its idea obligations.the court further held that nmmi compliance with the idea meant the section and ada claims necessarily failed as well.
on appeal,we found ellenberg had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and the district court should not have addressed the merits of her idea claim.id.at.we remanded the case with instructions to dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction.id.the section and ada claims were not barred by ellenberg failure to exhaust idea administrative remedies,though,so we remanded for their reconsideration.id.
upon remand,ellenberg filed an amended complaint for damages and declaratory relief,reasserting her claims under section and the ada.the parties filed for summary judgment the district court denied ellenberg motion but granted that of nmmi.the court did so after finding ellenberg had failed to make a prima facie showing she was disabled under section and the ada,vol.i at see also jarvis potter,cir to establish a prima facie section claim,a plaintiff must show he or she is disabled under section davidson am.online,cir to establish a prima facie ada claim,a plaintiff must show he or she is disabled within the meaning of the ada.key to its holding was that ellenberg eligibility for special education services under the idea and her existing individualized education program did not automatically establish a prima facie showing of disability under section and the ada.
ellenberg now appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to nmmi and its denial of her summary judgment.
ii.analysis 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether any genuine issues of material fact are in dispute and,if not,whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.viernow euripides dev,cir.
ellenberg makes three interrelated arguments her eligibility for receipt of special education and having an individualized education program under the idea make her,by definition,a disabled person protected under both section and the ada her disability claims should be decided by a jury because certain disputed issues of fact exist and nmmi facially discriminatory admissions standards violate section and the ada.
as we explain below,ellenberg failure to offer evidence that her disability substantially impairs a major life activity is fatal to her prima facie case under section and the ada.because we can resolve the case on this first issue as a matter of law,we need not address the latter two arguments.
discrimination claims under section 
to establish a prima facie case under section,a plaintiff must first demonstrate he or she is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.see a hollonbeck olympic,cir,cert.denied,d.the issue here is whether ellenberg idea eligibility by itself can satisfy this first element.
as an initial matter,nmmi argues we should not consider ellenberg argument on this point because she failed to present it below.we disagree.ellenberg sufficiently raised the argument in her brief to the district court,and the court addressed the argument in its order.we therefore proceed to our analysis of the statute.
section and its interpretive regulations 
section does not precisely define eligibility under the act.that is done by the regulations implementing section,which describe eligible disabled individuals as qualified handicapped person s.l.relevant to our analysis,a qualified handicapped person is a handicapped person to whom a state is required to provide a free appropriate public education under the idea.l iii in turn,a related provision defines handicapped person as one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities.j m ajor life activities include functions such as caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.j ii.
interpreting this basic regulatory framework,ellenberg contends she fits within the definition of qualified handicapped person.in her view,idea eligible individuals are listed among the qualified handicapped persons in l she is an idea eligible individual therefore she is automatically a qualified handicapped person covered by section.for several reasons,we disagree with this conclusion.
first and crucially,ellenberg interpretation fails to read the term qualified handicapped person from l in light of the nearby definition of handicapped person in j.by focusing on l application of qualified handicapped person,ellenberg skips a very important,determining whether she is a handicapped person in the first place.
in our view,to meet the definition of a qualified handicapped person under l,one must first satisfy the definition of handicapped person under j.in other words,a claimant must demonstrate an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.focusing solely on l,as ellenberg would have us do,would render j superfluous.we can not do this,and instead find that a qualified handicapped person must first demonstrate a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity 
but ellenberg argument is not necessarily lost at this point.if idea eligibility and an individualized education program always and necessarily means a student has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity,ellenberg would automatically satisfy j definition of handicapped person.here,ellenberg could have pointed out but did not that j ii specifically identifies learning as a major life activity.her idea related disability,therefore,might satisfy the major life activity requirement in j definition of a handicapped person.
still,ellenberg would need to demonstrate her disability substantially limits the major life activity of learning.doing so is important because n ot every impairment that affects an individual major life activities is a substantially limiting impairment.reeves johnson controls world,cir quoting knapp nw,cir.indeed,case law indicates claimants must advance individualized evidence that a limitation is substantial in the context of the major life activity as a whole.see,lusk ryder integrated logistics,cir mcguinness of sch.of,cir see also singh george washington.sch.of med.health,waldrip,cir
