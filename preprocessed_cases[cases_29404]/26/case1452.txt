in this case we consider whether the california department of education cde is required to pay for the college education of an extremely gifted student under the age of.we conclude it is not.we shall affirm the judgment of dismissal of plaintiffs action entered following the trial court sustaining of cde demurrer without leave to amend.
factual and procedural background 
on february,leila levi levi filed an original complaint against cde on behalf of herself and as guardian ad litem for her son levi clancy clancy together plaintiffs.after the trial court sustained cde general demurrer with leave to amend,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint.the first amended complaint alleges clancy,born on october,is a highly gifted child required,as a minor under the age of,to attend school under the compulsory education law,et the first amended complaint alleges,clancy can not attend a traditional school because the schools operated by cde,and clancy local district,are and unsuitable for highly gifted children and will actually cause more harm to him than if he simply did not attend.specifically,they can not provide for his specific and academic needs.additionally,he has already completed a standard education within the academic system currently provided for by cde.capitalization changed.
according to the first amended complaint,clancy started attending santa monica college when he was seven,passed the california high school proficiency exam when he was nine,and began attending the university of california at los angeles ucla when he was.levi is a single mother and single income earner in her household who can not afford to continue paying for clancy education at ucla.the first amended complaint alleges cde is constitutionally required to provide clancy with an adequate and suitable free and equal education while he is a minor under the age of.
the complaint alleges three causes of action the first for declaratory relief a writ of mandate,the second for violation of the equal protection clause of california constitution,and the third for damages under the federal civil rights statute.the complaint seeks a writ of mandate compelling cde to provide clancy with a fair,equal,and funded education suited to his personal needs,a declaratory judgment setting forth the rights and obligations of the parties to this case,general damages as well as special damages in the form of payment of the expenses associated with clancy education at santa monica college and ucla,attorney fees,and costs of suit.the trial court sustained cde demurrer to all three causes of action without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal.
on appeal plaintiffs challenge the trial court sustaining of cde demurrer to their first cause of action for declaratory relief a writ of mandate.they also claim public policy supports their position on appeal because they are asking for nothing more than what california already offers to students with special needs.they do not challenge the sustaining of cde demurrer to their second and third causes of action in their brief on appeal,plaintiffs admit they are asking this court to establish an education voucher for clancy college education during his years of mandatory school attendance.we decline to do so.
discussion 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,see blank kirwan cal d.on appeal we review the legal sufficiency of the complaint de novo,we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citation.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.the question before us is whether the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.aubry hospital,supra,at,d.
plaintiffs cause of action for declaratory relief 
while clancy is under the age of and subject to the compulsory education requirements,plaintiffs claim cde legally owes him an adequate,free and equal education providing for his specific individualized needs.if clancy is not provided with the funding necessary to attend a university appropriate to his learning needs,plaintiffs claim they will be forced to violate the compulsory education law.in their first cause of action,plaintiffs allege these circumstances give rise to a justiciable controversy over the parties respective rights and duties entitling them to declaratory relief.plaintiffs primarily rely on section of article ix of the california constitution section.however,they also claim education guarantees under unspecified parts of the united states constitution,the federal no child left behind act of et,and the federal individuals with disability education act idea.et plaintiffs claim there exists a related controversy as to whether clancy was excluded from the class of children protected by california special education law,et.
on appeal,plaintiffs claim the trial court erred in concluding they had not stated a cause of action for declaratory relief because they are entitled to a judicial declaration of the educational rights of an extremely gifted child.
the fundamental basis of declaratory relief is the existence of an actual,present controversy over a proper subject.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,quoting witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.cde contends plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to establish an actual controversy between themselves and cde independent of the current lawsuit.city of cotati cashman,supra,at,d,california of private special education schools department of education th,d brownfield daniel freeman marina hosp.d.we disagree.the first amended complaint alleges sufficient specific facts regarding clancy present educational circumstances to establish an actual,current controversy concerning cde constitutional and statutory obligation to fund an appropriate education,in this case a college education,for clancy.
cde contends plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a cause of action for declaratory relief because there is no right on the part of plaintiffs to or corresponding duty on the part of cde to provide the relief plaintiffs seek.
strictly speaking,a general demurrer is not an appropriate means of testing the merits of the controversy in a declaratory relief action because plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of his rights even if it be adverse.citations.however,where the issue is purely one of law,if the reviewing court agreed with the trial court resolution of the issue it would be an idle act to reverse the judgment of dismissal for a trial on the merits.in such cases the merits of the legal controversy may be considered on an appeal from a judgment of dismissal following an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend and the opinion of the reviewing court will constitute the declaration of the legal rights and duties of the parties concerning the matter in controversy.citations.herzberg county of plumas th,d.the issue here is purely a question of law,which we resolve adversely to plaintiffs.
the california legislature has been constitutionally required to provide for a system of common schools in california since the first state constitution was adopted in cal,art.ix.since the constitution of this constitutional requirement has included a free school guarantee.cal,art.ix,hartzell connell cal d,hartzell.specifically,section provides,the legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year,after the first year in which a school has been established.italics added.
