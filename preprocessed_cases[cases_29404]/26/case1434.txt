this case arises from james conroy decision to donate his body to the medical school at the university of california,irvine uci,upon his death in.his wife,evelyn conroy,appeals the trial court entry of judgment after a sustaining without leave to amend the demurrers of the regents of the university of california regents to her causes of action for breach of contract,breach of special duty,and intentional infliction of emotional distress and b granting summary judgment on her claims of fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and negligence.conroy contends the regents breached contractual and legal duties to her when uci failed to keep track of her husband body,failed to contact her before disposing of her husband remains,and mishandled or otherwise treated her husband body in a disrespectful manner while using it for purposes other than teaching or scientific research.
we conclude the trial court did not err.the only enforceable agreement at issue is the donation form conroy husband executed,which did not require uci to track the body or notify relatives before disposing of the body.moreover,conroy failed to introduce any competent evidence uci mishandled her husband body or used it for purposes other than teaching or research.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in,conroy and her husband read a newspaper article about uci willed body program wbp,headlined uci program in need of a few good bodies.conroy telephoned chris brown,director of the program,asking about the program and what would happen to the donated bodies.according to conroy,brown made several promises in the course of their conversation.brown assured her only uci medical students would use the donated bodies for medical research at the university and promised uci would advise her husband physician of medical findings pertaining to her husband body.he also promised that after use for research,uci would cremate the donated bodies and notify the families so they could take part in a ceremony to scatter the ashes at sea.
in june,conroy husband executed and returned to uci a donation agreement,which provided i here state that it is my wish to donate my body to the department of anatomy and neurobiology,college of medicine,university of california,irvine uci,immediately following my death,for teaching purposes,scientific research,or such purposes as the said university or its authorized representative shall in their sole discretion deem advisable.my body,when delivered to uci,will be unembalmed and in good condition.it is further understood and agreed that final disposition of my body by uci shall be in accordance with the state code.in light of the donation,brown provided conroy a telephone number to call when her husband passed away,so uci could pick up his body.he also sent her an instruction sheet requesting her not to have her husband body embalmed or autopsied,and that she contact uci to pick up the body within hours of death.
on january,james conroy died at home at the age of.conroy discovered his body and called the number brown had given her.that evening,defendant jeffrey frazier and another man picked up the body,assuring conroy they would treat it with respect.this was the last time conroy saw her husband body.
eight months later,in september,conroy read a newspaper article reporting that bodies were missing from uci wbp.she made several calls to uci over a period before peter lawrence responded to her messages.conroy claimed lawrence,who took over the program after brown had been terminated,admitted brown had done a number of disreputable things,including not keeping adequate records.lawrence sent a letter to conroy confirming her husband body had been brought to the medical school,but uci had no record of what happened to it.
conroy sued the regents,brown,and frazier,and alleged that donated bodies had been transported to locations other than uci,used for private tutoring to generate profits,and dismembered so that body parts could be sold.conroy also alleged defendants failed to track the bodies and document their location to ensure proper identification and the return of remains to family members.conroy alleged uci knew of these problems before receiving her husband body,but failed to disclose this information to her.conroy filed a series of complaints,alleging causes of action for breach of implied contract negligence negligent misrepresentation breach of special duty intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraud and intentional deceit.the trial court sustained demurrers to the first,fourth,and fifth causes of action without leave to amend.
the regents moved for summary judgment on the second,third,and sixth causes of action.in opposing the motion,conroy submitted evidence showing brown owned or colluded in several companies that profited from questionable dealings involving wbp cadavers.brown partner in these transactions was frazier,who had picked up james conroy body the night he died.one of the pair companies,replica,offered a gross anatomy class called medbound to students interested in attending medical school.the class was held on uci premises without authorization from uci,using wbp cadavers.in july,a uci medical school professor,robert blanks,walked in on a medbound class supervised by brown.he also discovered photographs of wbp cadavers in replica storefront window,across the street from the medical school.blanks reported his findings to brown supervisor,richard robertson.uci ensured replica removed the photographs from the storefront,but did nothing else.according to conroy,these facts,together with another lawsuit filed in june involving the mishandling of wbp cadavers,put the regents on notice of problems in the wbp which they should have corrected,but failed to do so.
conroy also submitted evidence showing that in june,brown arranged for the removal of seven spines from wbp cadavers,which he and frazier then sold,via another company,university health services,to a doctor conducting research at an arizona hospital.robertson learned of the sale and reported his discovery to the dean of the medical school,who ordered an internal investigation of the wbp.uci auditors discovered that between january,and august,out of bodies donated to uci,there were no records to determine the final disposition of of them by name.finally,conroy declaration stated her husband relied on the oral promises brown made before execution of the donation agreement.
the trial court granted the regents summary judgment motion,and entered judgment.conroy now appeals.
discussiona.the trial court did not err in granting summary.negligence 
conroy argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the regents on her claim uci negligently mishandled her husband remains.conroy phrases the issue this way it is one thing to medically dissect human remains for research purposes.it is quite another to mishandle bodies,sell body parts to others,and conduct unauthorized classes with body parts.we conclude the trial court did not err because conroy presented no evidence uci mishandled james conroy body.
specifically,conroy sought to demonstrate uci had a pattern and practice of mishandling bodies in the wbp.she cited the unauthorized use of program cadavers in the medbound class,replica photographic window display of uci cadavers,brown clandestine reallocation of spines to an arizona doctor in june,the june lawsuit involving similar allegations of cadaver mishandling,and the refusal of mortuaries to cremate cadaver remains from uci wbp because they had not been properly tagged or identified.based on this evidence,conroy argues the inference is that conroy body was mishandled.
the supreme court in christensen superior court cal d,d,christensen,however,rejected an identical argument,ruling that reports of a general pattern of misconduct are not sufficient,in and of themselves,to establish that defendants misconduct included mishandling of the remains of each plaintiff decedent.id.at,d.the court elaborated a generalized concern that the remains of a relative may have been involved,arising out of a media report of a pattern of misconduct,is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that there be a direct connection between a defendant conduct and the injury suffered by the plaintiff.it does not supply a necessary the injury,here emotional distress,be caused by a breach of the defendant duty to the particular plaintiff.id.at,d.to establish the necessary connection,the plaintiff must establish the emotional distress was caused by a substantial certainty that his or her decedent remains were among those reportedly mistreated ibid.true,imposing the burden of proof of wrongdoing on the survivors may appear harsh where,as here,plaintiff claims the defendant lost her decedent body,preventing direct evidence that it was mistreated.but,as the majority in christensen explained,the rule follows from the plaintiff general burden to show the defendant caused his or her injuries.id.at,d.
in dissent,justice kennard observed this burden may preclude all recovery for many plaintiffs who would otherwise qualify.plaintiffs will be forced to rely on defendants records to determine which bodies were mishandled.if those records are inadequate and it seems unlikely the crematory defendants kept records detailing their misdeeds,many plaintiffs will never be able to determine whether the remains of their decedents were mistreated.christensen,supra,cal d at,d,dis.opn.of kennard.to address this problem,justice kennard proposed an alternate procedure that when a plaintiff establishes tortious conduct by a defendant under circumstances making it virtually impossible for the plaintiff to prove causation,the burden shifts to the defendant to establish a lack of causation.citation.id.at,d,dis.opn.of kennard.but the majority rejected that proposal,concluding w ere we to accept the suggestions of justice kennard,a plaintiff could recover damages for emotional distress based on nothing more than a media report of misconduct that may have involved the plaintiff loved one.id.at,d,italics added.
here,conroy provided no evidence uci subjected her husband body to any of the mistreatment she claimed constituted a pattern of misconduct.indeed,her evidence demonstrated the opposite.because james conroy did not pass away until january,his body could not have been involved in the medbound class,nor could it have been one of the bodies in the photographs taken down from replica storefront in july.similarly,the unspecified misconduct alleged in the june lawsuit necessarily predated its filing and therefore could not have involved james conroy body.conroy only specific allegation of mistreatment occurring when uci had possession of her husband body was the claim that in june brown harvested seven spines from wbp cadavers for a doctor in arizona.nonetheless,she did not dispute the regents evidence that the spines were fresh tissue specimens from bodies that would have entered the wbp within a few weeks of the arizona trip,and hence none of the spines could have been from her husband because he died months earlier in january.
the only evidence conroy submitted directly relating to her husband body was that uci could not account for the body specific use and the final disposition.conroy contends uci failure to keep track of her husband body constituted mishandling entitling her to recover for emotional distress.we disagree.
citing christensen,conroy argues uci owed her the same duties as a mortuary or crematory.in christensen,the court concluded that mortuaries and crematoria operators owe a special duty of care to perform th eir services in the dignified and respectful manner the bereaved expect id.at,d.christensen recognized that emotional distress damages for negligence are ordinarily limited to those who witness the negligent act,but expanded the scope of duty in that case to include close family members of the deceased even though they did not witness the defendants mishandling of the body.
the expanded scope of duty in christensen,however,arose not simply because the defendants handled dead bodies,but because the defendants have undertaken to provide a service,the very purpose of which is to alleviate existing and avoid future emotional distress arising from the death the potential plaintiffs are limited to those for whom defendants performed a service.christensen,supra,cal d at,d,italics added.here,uci undertook to perform no service for conroy or other family members of the deceased.true,the wbp,like a mortuary or crematory,disposes of human remains.but the disposal of human remains is merely a necessary incident to the wbp primary mission.as we recognized in melican regents may,th,d,wl uci does not purport to provide services,and is not licensed to do so.f services are principally for the comfort of the living,having as their aim the consolation of the leading mourners.the expectations of the survivors,and essence of the contract for such services is a reasonable expectation of dignity,tranquility,and personal consolation.citation.citation.in contrast,the mission of uci wbp is to obtain cadavers for study and dissection by medical students.in recognition of this distinction,the legislature specifically exempted public institutions,hospitals,and medical schools from the funeral directors and embalmers law.citation.
uci duties to conroy are spelled out in the donation agreement,to wit,that uci will use her husband body for teaching purposes,scientific research,or such purposes as the said university or its authorized representative shall in their sole discretion deem advisable,and to dispose of the remains in accordance with the state code.the donation agreement included no express promise uci would track the body or provide conroy a description of how uci utilized the body.nor do the circumstances suggest an implied promise to do so,given the nature of study and scientific research involving cadavers.this point was recognized in bennett regents of university of california th,d bennett,which held that another university willed body program did not have a duty to track body parts,reassemble disarticulated parts,or cremate the cadaver as a whole.the court explained i t is difficult to imagine how a cadaver that has been segmented and reduced for anatomical study,can be reconstituted at the completion of the study it would be unduly burdensome to require a medical school to label and account for a donor dissected tissue,organs,sinew and bones,and to ensure that all of the components are retrieved and cremated together,assuming that it is even possible to do so.id.at,d.
simply put,during the relevant time period,uci had no legal duty to track bodies donated under the wbp for the benefit of a donor family where the donation agreement did not require uci to return the remains although mortuaries might have been concerned about accepting untagged bodies from uci due to a statute requiring them to perform individual cremations,that provision does not apply to willed body programs.see bennett,supra,th at,d bennett.
we conclude conroy presented no evidence in opposing summary judgment that uci mistreated her husband remains.the purpose of summary judgment law is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.because there is no factual dispute for a jury to resolve concerning whether james conroy body was mistreated,the regents were entitled to judgment on the issue as a matter of law.id.at,d.
conroy reliance on saari jongordon th,d saari is misplaced.there,the defendant had contracted to cremate the decedent body and release his ashes to his partner without performing any religious service.id.at,d.instead of complying with the agreement,the defendant scattered the ashes at sea and performed a christian burial service over them.ibid.the decedent mother,sister,and partner sued the defendant for failing to perform the services as arranged.the mother asserted her emotional distress arose in part when she lay awake at night,wondering what had happened to her son remains.id.at,d.
relying on christensen,the defendant in saari argued the mother uncertainty about the disposition of her
