the university of louisiana at and the board of trustees,university of louisiana system hereinafter collectively ulm appeal the district court denial of their motion for permanent injunction under the relitigation exception to the act claiming that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude dwight vines and van mcgraw age discrimination suit filed in state court.we find that all of the elements of ulm collateral estoppel claim have been satisfied and that the instant case falls within the relitigation exception to the act.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court to enter an injunction preventing vines and mcgraw from proceeding with their state age discrimination claims against ulm.
vines and mcgraw are former administrators and faculty members of ulm.after serving a sufficient number of years to qualify for retirement benefits under the teachers retirement system of louisiana trsl,vines voluntarily elected to retire in and mcgraw elected to retire in.pursuant to the trsl,they each received retirement benefits for life and percent of their average compensation during their previous three years.vines and mcgraw were simultaneously rehired on a basis and each worked for five years,receiving retirement benefits in addition to a salary for work performed.in january,the university of louisiana system adopted a policy prohibiting the of retirees on a regular basis and vines and mcgraw were notified that they would not be rehired for the academic year.
vines and mcgraw filed identical suits in federal and state court,claiming ulm violated the federal age discrimination in employment act adea et.and louisiana employment discrimination law laedl.ann.et by prohibiting of retirees,paying the plaintiffs less than younger professors,and increasing their workloads.ulm removed the state court suit under federal question jurisdiction and the cases were consolidated.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc then instituted a separate action in federal court,naming vines and mcgraw as aggrieved parties,alleging violations of the adea by ulm.the eeoc action was also consolidated with vines and mcgraw cases.
ulm filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all the remaining adea claims based upon kimel florida board of regents,d.the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over vines and mcgraw adea claims,but that the eeoc was not barred from asserting those claims on their behalf.vines and mcgraw state law claims were remanded to state court.the district court then granted ulm motion for summary judgment dismissing the eeoc lawsuit,finding that ulm policy did not violate the adea.the eeoc sought to appeal the judgment,but then voluntarily dismissed the appeal.
ulm filed a peremptory exception of res estoppel in the present case in state court,arguing that vines and mcgraw asserted the same claims and issues previously litigated and decided adversely to them in federal court.the louisiana trial court granted the exception,dismissing the state claims with prejudice after finding that the federal principles of res judicata applied to bar the suit.the court noted that the federal court decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction,the decision was final and on the merits,the eeoc and the plaintiffs were in privity,and the causes of action arose from the same nucleus of operative facts.the second circuit court of appeal in louisiana reversed the trial court judgment,which had granted an exception of res judicata in favor of ulm,and reinstated the state court action,concluding that privity did not exist between vines and mcgraw and the eeoc.vines northeast,so d.cir.ulm request for en banc rehearing in the second circuit and their application for writ to the louisiana supreme court were denied.vines northeast,so d.
ulm filed a motion under the relitigation exception of the act with the western district of louisiana seeking to enjoin vines and mcgraw lawsuit in state court based on the federal court decision in favor of ulm against the eeoc.the district court denied the permanent injunction and ulm appealed to this court.
we generally review a district court denial of a motion for a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.see paul mercury ins.williamson,cir.the application of the relitigation exception to the act,however,is a question of law and therefore we review the district court denial of ulm motion for a permanent injunction de novo.id.
the act generally prohibits federal courts from interfering with proceedings in state court.there are only three specific circumstances in which a federal court can enjoin a state court proceeding,when it is expressly authorized by a federal statute necessary to assert jurisdiction or necessary to protect or effectuate a prior judgment by a federal court.paul mercury ins,at.the third exception is referred to as the relitigation exception.the relitigation exception was designed to permit a federal court to prevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.it is founded in the concepts of res judicata and collateral estoppel.chick kam choo exxon,d.
there are two related doctrines of preclusion claim preclusion,commonly referred to as res judicata,and issue preclusion,known as collateral estoppel.see montana united states,d.in order to determine if the relitigation exception to the act is applicable to preclude litigation of a claim in state court under the doctrine of res judicata,this court applies a test.first,the parties in a later action must be identical to or at least in privity with the parties in a prior action.second,the judgment in the prior action must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.third,the prior action must have concluded with a final judgment on the merits.fourth,the same claim or cause of action must be involved in both suits.life ins.gillispie,cir quoting united states shanbaum,cir.the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to prevent issues of ultimate fact from being relitigated between the same parties in a future lawsuit if those issues have once been determined by a valid and final judgment.ashe swenson,d restatement second of judgments when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment,the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between parties,whether on the same or a different claim.cited in grogan garner,d.while complete identity of all parties is not required,the party against whom the collateral estoppel would be applied generally must either have been a party,or privy to a party,in the prior litigation.see terrell,cir.
vines and mcgraw concede that there was a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in the adea claim brought by the eeoc and that it was a final judgment on the merits.
the issue this court must decide initially is whether,even if the state court mistakenly rejected ulm res judicata claim,a federal court injunction is permitted against enforcement of the state court judgment.the supreme court has stated that o nce the state court has finally rejected a claim of res judicata,then the full faith and credit act becomes applicable and federal courts must turn to state law to determine the preclusive effect of the state court decision.parsons steel,first.bank,d emphasis added.the full faith and credit act requires federal courts as well as state courts to give state judicial proceedings the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states and its territories and possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state,territory or possession from which they are taken.
this court must determine whether the louisiana state court decision,that the prior federal adjudication of the eeoc claims does not bar the state court proceedings,would be given preclusive effect under louisiana law and therefore be entitled to full faith and credit.see migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.under louisiana law,in order for a judgment to be entitled to preclusive effect it must be a final judgment.ann.louisiana law distinguishes between interlocutory judgments and final judgments.a judgment that does not determine the merits but only preliminary matters in the course of an action is an interlocutory judgment.civ.proc.ann.on the other hand,a judgment that determines the merits in whole or in part is a final judgment.id.
the state trial court in this case granted ulm peremptory exception of res judicata,but the louisiana second circuit court of appeal overruled the trial court decision and remanded the case for a trial on the merits.under louisiana law,the overruling of a peremptory exception is an interlocutory judgment and thus not entitled to preclusive effect.see marsh eng g,parker,so d,bellard biddle,so d.cir.the louisiana supreme court denial of ulm writ also did not decide the merits of the res judicata issue,but only allowed the interlocutory ruling to stand pending further review at a later stage of the proceeding.id.therefore,because the state courts rulings on the res judicata issue were interlocutory and not final,a federal court may enjoin vines and mcgraw from relitigating,through a state court action,issues already decided against them in federal court.
the district court concluded that vines and mcgraw could proceed with their louisiana age discrimination suit,holding that they were not bound by the federal court decision because they were not a party in that suit nor was there privity between the eeoc and the individual plaintiffs.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation which accepted the ruling of the louisiana second circuit court of appeals.vines,so d.the louisiana court reasoned that because vines and mcgraw were denied an opportunity to assert their state claims in federal court,they maintained the right to sue under the state statutory scheme since the eeoc had no standing to prosecute such claims under louisiana law.id.at.the opinion also noted that the eeoc action was not prosecuted solely for the individual benefits of vines and mcgraw,but rather for the general public interest.id.finally,the state court held that vines and mcgraw had no control over the conduct of the suit prosecuted by the eeoc.id.
whether the district court may file an injunction under the act hinges on whether the eeoc was in privity with vines and mcgraw.privity is a legal conclusion that the relationship between the one who is a party on the record and the is sufficiently close to afford application of the principle of preclusion.southwest airlines.int l airlines,cir.federal courts have consistently held that a to an action is still bound by and entitled to the benefits of a judgment as though it were a party if it was represented in the original action.see meza battery,cir.it is precedent that a judgment in an action in which a government agency represents private individuals is binding on those individuals.see heckman united states.the eeoc is an agency expressly invested by law with the authority to represent the interests of individuals in civil actions against employers to recover damages for discriminatory practices.we conclude that the eeoc did represent vines and mcgraw for res judicata and collateral estoppel purposes in the federal case brought against ulm.
in jones bell helicopter,this court considered the issue of whether an individual may bring a private title vii action,based on the same claim at issue in an earlier action brought by the eeoc,when the commission action is set aside for failure to comply with the administrative procedure act,cir.this court held that despite the eeoc ineptitude,sloth,and indifference in failing to promptly pursue legal action on his behalf,res judicata barred the individual from pursuing the same claim because privity existed between him and the eeoc.id.at.this decision,however,preceded the supreme court decision in general telephone.of the northwest,eeoc which discussed how the interests of the eeoc and of the individual may be divergent,d see also riddle cerro wire and cable group,cir.also,unlike jones,this is an adea claim and not a title vii case.the distinctive enforcement scheme of the adea terminates the right of an individual to pursue an action once the eeoc commences an action to enforce the employee rights under the statute,whereas the enforcement scheme of title vii does not terminate the rights of the employee once the eeoc brings a suit.c the right of any person to bring such action shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by the eeoc to enforce the right of such employee under the adea.therefore,the eeoc is not always to be considered the representative of individuals on whose behalf it brings an adea action.for example,the eeoc role differs when it seeks to enjoin discrimination against an entire class or attempts to protect a broader interest than simply that of the individual plaintiff.in a situation where there is a clear divergence of interests between the eeoc and the aggrieved individual,we must determine in each case whether privity exists.this is not the situation in the present case and we express no view regarding the question of whether the doctrine of representative claim preclusion would apply in such a case.
in the present case,it is clear that the eeoc interest did not diverge from that of vines and mcgraw.when the eeoc seeks private benefits for individuals under the adea,it takes on representative responsibilities that places it in privity with those individuals.although this court has not addressed this specific issue,several other circuits have reached this conclusion.the third circuit held that the adea distinctive enforcement scheme gives the eeoc representative responsibilities when it seeks private benefits for an individual and that the doctrine of representative claim preclusion must therefore be applied.eeoc steel,cir.in steel the eeoc filed a complaint alleging that the united states steel corporation had violated the adea because employees were required to sign waivers as a condition for obtaining more favorable retirement benefits.several employees had been unsuccessful with their individual suits on the same claim.the district court granted relief in the eeoc case,including a permanent injunction against requiring the release.the district court also determined that the earlier judgments against the individuals did not preclude retroactive relief.the third circuit focused on the distinctive scheme of the adea in reversing the district court,reasoning that the adea intended for the eeoc to act as the representative for individual employees when it sought to recover individual benefits for them,which is demonstrated by the fact that the individual right to sue is cut off once the eeoc begins an action.c.the court viewed the provision of the adea prohibiting private suits once the eeoc files its complaint as essentially a codification of the doctrine of representative claim preclusion with respect to those instances in which the eeoc litigates first litigation by the representative party the eeoc seeking private relief for an individual precludes subsequent litigation of the same claim by an individual for whom the representative sought relief.steel,at.
several other courts have followed the reasoning of the third circuit in steel,recognizing that the adea places the eeoc in privity with individuals for whom it seeks relief such that a lawsuit litigated by either the eeoc or the individual bars subsequent relitigation of the same claims or issues.the seventh circuit held that the eeoc was barred from recovering back pay or liquidated damages on behalf of an individual who had previously litigated the same claim without success,stating that they agree d,generally,with the third circuit position that there is privity between the eeoc and individuals for whom it seeks individual benefits.eeoc harris chernin,cir.the second circuit also concluded that the statutory enforcement mechanism of the adea gives the eeoc representative responsibilities when it seeks private benefits for an individual.eeoc kidder,peabody,cir quoting steel,at,overruled on other grounds,eeoc waffle house,d.several district courts have also considered
