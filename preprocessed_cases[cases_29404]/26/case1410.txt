qui tam plaintiffs dennis dockstader and christopher dockstader challenge the dismissal of their lawsuit following the trial court order sustaining without leave to amend the demurrers of defendants beth hamby,lynn roberts,and julie crum.plaintiffs brought the lawsuit under the california false claims act cfca,et,seeking to recover funds on behalf of the state of california.plaintiffs allege defendants,while acting as employees of the los angeles unified school district lausd,submitted false requests to the state seeking funding for new school construction.plaintiffs acknowledge they may not bring a qui tam suit against lausd directly,but contend the lausd employees involved are fair game.
we conclude the employees of a public agency,acting in the course and scope of their employment,and solely on the agency behalf,are not proper defendants under cfca.in wells learning foundation cal th,d,wells,the supreme court determined the legislature did not intend a public school district to be a person subject to suit under cfca,in part because of the devastating impact these lawsuits would have upon education in the state.because section requires a government agency,on timely request,to defend and indemnify a public employee against claims arising out of an act or omission occurring within the scope of his or her employment,a suit against the defendants is tantamount to a suit against lausd itself.we conclude the legislature did not intend to allow a plaintiff to circumvent its intent to exempt public entities from cfca liability simply through a pleading device.accordingly,the trial court did not err in sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend,and we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs originally sued lausd under cfca as qui tam plaintiffs on behalf of the state of california to recover approximately million that plaintiffs contend lausd wrongfully obtained from the state for new school construction.these funds were available under the green act,et,which permits school districts to submit applications for new facilities based on need and following criteria established by the state allocation board.plaintiffs alleged lausd submitted funding requests that deliberately understated the number of classrooms lausd had available for general student use and overstated the number of students anticipated to attend particular schools.as required under cfca,plaintiffs filed their complaint under seal and sent a copy to the california attorney general office.the attorney general,however,declined to intervene in the action.
after plaintiffs filed their complaint,the california supreme court issued its decision in wells,holding a school district was not a person under cfca,and therefore could not be sued under the act.in response to wells,plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint,which deleted lausd as a defendant and added the current individual defendants.the second amended complaint alleges the defendants knowingly signed fraudulent funding applications in the course and scope of their employment as lausd officials.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to the second amended complaint,concluding cfca did not authorize a lawsuit against defendants for acts taken in their official capacities.the parties stipulated to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint with prejudice.plaintiffs now appeal.
discussion 
the cfca,which is patterned after a similar federal law,was adopted in.citation.it provides that a ny person who,among other things,k nowingly presents or causes to be presented to the state or any political subdivision thereof,a false claim for payment or approval,or k nowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the state or by any political subdivision,or c onspires to defraud the state or any political subdivision by getting a false claim allowed or paid by the state or any political subdivision,or i s a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to the state or a political subdivision,subsequently discovers the falsity of the claim,and fails to disclose the false claim to the state or the political subdivision within a reasonable time after discovery thereof,shall be liable to the state or to the political subdivision for three times the amount of damages the state or political subdivision thereby sustained,as well as for the state or political subdivision costs of suit,and may also be liable for a civil penalty of up to for each false claim.wells,supra,cal th at,d,citing,subd.a.
if the false claim garnered state funds,the state attorney general may sue to recover damages and penalties.a qui tam plaintiff also may initiate a cfca action to recover state funds on behalf of the state,subd.c.a qui tam plaintiff must file the cfca complaint in camera,which remains under seal for up to days.during this time,the plaintiff may not serve the complaint on the defendant,subd.c.the qui tam plaintiff also must immediately notify the attorney general of the suit and disclose all material evidence and information in the plaintiff possession.within the period the complaint is under seal,the attorney general may elect to intervene and proceed with the action.if the attorney general declines to proceed,the qui tam plaintiff may conduct the action,subd.c and,subject to exceptions not relevant here,is entitled to receive an amount that the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages on behalf of the government.the amount shall be not less than percent and not more than percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of these proceeds,subd.g.cfca authorizes a lawsuit against a person who submits a false claim,and entitles a person to act as a qui tam plaintiff.cfca defines person to include any natural person,corporation,firm,association,organization,partnership,limited liability company,business,or trust,subd.b.
in wells,the supreme court considered whether cfca definition of person included public school districts.the court began its analysis with the plain language of the statute,noting the statutory list of persons contains no words or phrases most commonly used to signify public school districts,or,for that matter,any other public entities or governmental agencies.wells,supra,cal th at,d.the court recognized that,in contrast to section,other provisions of cfca made specific reference to government agencies.wells,at,d.in examining other statutory schemes where the legislature intended to exclude public entities from suit,the court found the legislature defined persons in language similar to that in cfca.conversely,when the legislature intended to include public entities,it had done so expressly in the language of the statute.id.at,d,citing et.
the court next turned to cfca legislative history.although the act history provided no explicit discussion regarding the scope of the term persons,an earlier version of the bill that later became cfca included a definition of persons that expressly included the terms district,county,city and county,city,the state,and any of the agencies and political subdivisions of these entitles.wells,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.the court deemed the legislature removal of these terms before cfca enactment a significant indication of the legislature intent to exclude public entities.id.at,d.
the court next noted the traditional rule of statutory construction that,absent express words to the contrary,governmental agencies are not included within the general words of a statute.wells,supra,cal th at,d.the court acknowledged a more recent exception to this rule,that government agencies are excluded from the operation of general statutory provisions,only if their inclusion would result in an infringement upon sovereign governmental powers pursuant to this principle,governmental agencies have been held subject to legislation which,by its terms,applies simply to any person.citations.citations.ibid.the court concluded the exception did not apply to cfca lawsuits for two reasons.first,courts employ the rule and exception as a maxim of s
