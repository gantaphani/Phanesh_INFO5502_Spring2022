does a public high school teacher have a first and fourteenth amendment right to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials yes,says the teacher,shelley.no,says the tipp city board of education.because the right to free speech protected by the first amendment does not extend to the curricular speech of teachers in primary and secondary schools made pursuant to their official duties,garcetti ceballos,we affirm the judgment rejecting this claim as a matter of law.
in,the tipp city board of education hired to teach english and to supervise tippecanoe high school literary magazine,birchbark,for the school year.the board renewed her contract for the school year,when taught english to and grade students and a creative writing course to and grade students.at the beginning of the fall semester,assigned ray bradbury fahrenheit to her graders.to the end of exploring the book theme of government censorship,she distributed a list compiled by the american library association of the most frequently challenged books.students divided into groups,and asked each group to pick a book from the list,to investigate the reasons why the book was challenged and to lead an debate about the book.two groups chose heather has two mommies by lesl√©a newman.
a parent complained about heather has two mommies,and the principal,charles wray,asked to tell the students to choose a different book.she complied,explaining to her class that they were in a unique position to use this experience as source material for their debate because they were in the position of having actually experienced censorship in preparing to debate censorship.at.after the class completed the fahrenheit unit,assigned siddhartha by hermann hesse and used it as the basis for discussions about spirituality,buddhism,romantic relationships,personal growth,and familial relationships.at.
at the october meeting of the school board,or so parents complained about the curricular choices in the schools,including siddhartha and the assignment.the next day,principal wray called a meeting of the english department and told that she was on the hot seat.at.nearly parents,as well as the local news media,attended the board november meeting.for over an hour,parents expressed concerns about books in the curriculum and in the school libraries.while the parents mentioned many books,they raised particular objections to the materials in classroom and her teaching methods.superintendent john zigler explained that the school board had purchased many of the materials,including siddhartha,several years before,making it difficult to criticize for teaching a book the school board had bought.you should be embarrassed,one parent responded,referring to the explicit language and sexual themes in the book.r at.another parent complained that she had asked for an alternative of was given three books,two of which were for a year old.at.i not going to put my daughter through this,the parent added,explaining that she thought was punish ing my daughter.at.a group of parents presented the board with a petition calling for decency and excellence in the classroom.at.
the meeting was not.a member of the parent that the school district policies about potentially objectionable material have to be well thought out because what you might find offensive,i might not.at.another board member reminded the group that,as elected officials,the board must walk the middle of the road to some extent,even if the community might err on the conservative side.at.and a parent who made a formal statement said that he did not condone the behavior of some of the more vocal parents and trusted that school officials want what best for our kids.at.
the matter did not end there.in teaching creative writing,maintained a file of student writing samples that she shared with students who asked for additional guidance on assignments.running low on copies of some of the samples,she sent three of them to support staff to be copied.a member of the copy room staff,apparently not a friend,showed the writing samples to wray,saying he ought to read this.at.after reading the papers,wray called to his office.when she arrived,he waved two of the writing samples in his hand,one a account of a rape,the other a story about a young boy who murdered a priest and desecrated a church.a re you going to use these in class after everything that happened he shouted.at.explained that the writing samples were not intended for distribution and that she would refrain from sharing the papers if he wanted.wray said that he did not like the materials she was using in her classroom or the themes of her discussions and that he intended to rei n it in.at.
the two soon had another argument in the school library about plans to give a final exam involving group discussions and student.asked wray to give her a model exam so she could give him back exactly what he want ed,at,prompting wray to call her a smart a,id.at.the next day,complained to superintendent zigler about wray behavior.zigler told her to meet with wray after the semester break to work things out and offered to speak with wray in the meantime.he also said that she should feel free to file a formal grievance if things had not been worked out by january.
things did not work out by january.wray and talked,but they fell back into the same channels of disagreement.asked whether there was anything aside from her curricular decisions that bothered wray.i see what other issues i can come up with,wray responded,for your evaluation next week.at.wray evaluations criticized attitude and demeanor as well as her u se of material that is pushing the limits of community standards.at.filed written objections to wray evaluations and a grievance with superintendent zigler.
at its march meeting,the school board voted unanimously not to renew contract.she requested an explanation,and the school board sent her a letter on april,saying that her was due to problems with communication and teamwork.at.at request,the board held a formal hearing about the employment decision.principal wray,superintendent zigler and all testified,and the board again voted unanimously not to renew her contract.
the alert reader may notice that some of the factual allegations raised in complaint and addressed in our first decision do not appear here.see bd.of,cir i.the distinction between a civil rule b and a civil rule appeal explains the difference.as is often the case,discovery will confirm the accuracy of some allegations and disprove others.we recount today only the allegations in the complaint backed up by the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits.c.
in march,filed this action against the school board,wray and zigler.she alleged that the school board and other defendants had retaliated against her curricular and pedagogical choices,infringing her first amendment right to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under civil rule b,but the district court held that had sufficiently alleged a first amendment violation.we affirmed.i.
after discovery by both sides,the defendants again moved for summary judgment,arguing that the supreme court intervening decision in garcetti ceballos,and the unrebutted facts gleaned from discovery foreclosed claim.in the alternative,they sought summary judgment on the ground that the school board should prevail under the balancing test announced in pickering board of education,or that there was no causal link between curricular choices and the of her contract.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion.it declined to apply garcetti to the dispute and held that teaching methods and curricular choices survived the pickering balancing test.but it concluded that she had not provided sufficient evidence link ing her teaching methods and curricular choices to the board decision to not renew her contract.at.
this case implicates two competing intuitions.on the one side,does a teacher have the first amendment right to choose her own reading assignments,decide how they should be taught and above all be able to teach a unit on censorship without being censored or otherwise retaliated against on the other side,does a school board have the final say over what is taught,and how,in the public schools for which it is responsible who wins depends on which line of legal authority controls.
in retaliation cases arising in the employment context,we ask three questions was the individual involved in constitutionally protected activity protected by the free speech clause of the first amendment healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle.would the employer conduct discourage individuals of ordinary firmness from continuing to do what they were doing bloch ribar,cir see bart telford,cir.was the employee exercise of constitutionally protected rights a motivating factor behind the employer conduct healthy,at.the claimant must win each point to prevail.
the first question requires some elaboration.three supreme court cases define the contours of the rights of public employees.
the matters of public concern requirement.the first amendment protects the speech of employees only when it involves matters of public concern.connick myers.in connick,an assistant district attorney,after learning that her supervisor planned to transfer her,solicited information from her colleagues about the office transfer policy,about office morale and about whether supervisors had pressured anyone to participate in political campaigning.id.at.when the supervisor fired her for refusing to accept the transfer,she sued,alleging retaliation against protected speech,namely her initiation of the survey.id.in rejecting her claim,the court explained that not all employee speech is protected,only speech that fairly may be considered as relating to issues of political,social,or other concern to the community.id.at.when,by contrast,an employee speech does not relate to a matter of public concern,public officials enjoy wide latitude in responding to it without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment.id.
the balancing requirement.if the employee establishes that her speech touches matters of public concern,a balancing test determines whether the employee or the employer wins.see pickering,at.in pickering,the court considered the claim of a high school teacher whom the principal fired after the teacher wrote a letter to the local newspaper,criticizing the school board budgetary decisions.id.at.in resolving the claim,the court balance d the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern against the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.at.reasoning that there was no relationship between the contents of the letter and the proper performance of the teacher daily duties in the classroom,the court ruled for the teacher,concluding that the school board interests did not outweigh his desire to contribute to public debate like any other citizen.id.at.
the pursuant to requirement.in the last case in the trilogy,a prosecutor reviewed a private complaint that a police officer affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained several misrepresentations.garcetti,at.after confirming that the affidavit contained serious falsehoods,the prosecutor wrote a memo to his superiors about his findings,recommended that the office dismiss the case and eventually testified to the same effect at a hearing to suppress the evidence discovered during the search.id.at.in the aftermath of these and other actions,the prosecutor claimed that the office retaliated against him by transferring him to another courthouse and by denying him a promotion.id.at.in rejecting his claim,the court did not deny that the prosecutor speech related to a matter of public concern under connick,and it did not take on the lower court reasoning that pickering balancing favored the employee.it instead concluded that the first amendment did not apply.the controlling factor,the court reasoned,is that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy,making the relevant speaker the government entity,not the individual.id.at emphasis added.we hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.id.
a first amendment claimant must satisfy each of these requirements the connick matter of public concern requirement,the pickering balancing requirement and the garcetti pursuant to requirement.clears the first two of these hurdles but not the third.
the content of speech relat ed to matter s of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick,at.a teacher curricular speech,we have said on several occasions,ordinarily covers these matters.see i,at cockrel shelby county sch,cir hardy jefferson cmty,cir.t he essence of a teacher role is to prepare students for their place in society as responsible citizens,hardy,at,and the teacher that can do that without covering topics of public concern is rare indeed,perhaps.look no further than the november meeting of the school board to confirm the point.members of the community had a lot to say about the topics discussed in class,and they went to the school board meeting to say it.that large segments of the community disagreed with class assignments and teaching beside the point.the question is whether the topics discussed are of concern to the community,connick,at,not whether the community approved of the teacher position on each topic.on this record,curricular speech passes the connick matter of public concern test,as the district court correctly determined.
also satisfies pickering balancing that her interests as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern through her speech outweighed the school board interest as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.pickering,at.as the district court correctly concluded,a legitimate factual dispute exists over whether interest in teaching siddhartha and in making other curricular choices overshadowed any interest the school board might claim in disciplining her for doing so.although the school board has the ability to select and require adherence to a stated curriculum,at,the court concluded,its interest in enforcing curricular standards is severely undermined if it disciplines a teacher for teaching a book the board had purchased and made available to teachers as an optional text,id.at.and although the court did not find interest in select ing materials to supplement the textbooks and the methods for teaching to be compelling,id.at,that interest outweighed the school interest in disciplining her for teaching a book it had purchased,id.at.we many of the same reasons identified in see at.
after addressing the pickering point,however,the district court concluded that stumbled over causation.the court did not believe that could show that her exercise of free speech rights was a motivating factor behind the school board conduct.see healthy,at.that is a harder point to sell.and a brief accounting of the evidence and the chronology of events shows why.
before any parents complained about her reading assignments and classroom discussions,had never received a negative performance review.dozens of parents flooded the school board november meeting,and many complained about teaching.one parent told the school board that it should be embarrassed about the book she was teaching.at.principal wray thereafter told that she would have to clear any potentially controversial material with him.he later told that he intended to rei n in her classroom discussions.at.in december,complained to superintendent zigler about wray behavior.and when the semester resumed in january,wray told that he would see what he could come up with for her evaluations,at,after which he gave her negative performance reviews for the first time.only a short time later,the board voted not to renew her contract.to deny a causal relationship between speech and the board actions does not come to grips with this sequence of events or with the imperative at this stage of the litigation that we draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party the teacher.satisfies pickering balancing and has shown that her teaching choices caused the school board to fire her.
however,can not overcome garcetti.when government employees speak pursuant to their official duties,garcetti teaches that they are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes.at.any dispute over the board motivations,pickering balancing or the public concerns of her speech under connick is beside the point if,as does not dispute,she made her curricular and pedagogical choices in connection with her official duties as a teacher.
in the light cast by garcetti,it is clear that the first amendment does not generally insulate from employer discipline,garcetti,at,even discipline prompted by her curricular and pedagogical choices and even if it otherwise appears at least on summary judgment that the school administrators treated her shabbily.when a teacher teaches,the school system does not regulate that speech as much as it hires that speech.expression is a teacher stock in trade,the commodity she sells to her employer in exchange for a salary.mayer monroe county cmty.sch,cir.and if it is the school board that hires that speech,it can surely regulate the content of what is or is not expressed,rosenberger rector visitors of the of,what is expressed in other words on its behalf.only the school board has ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the classroom,legitimately giving it a say over what teachers may or may not teach in the classroom.
it is true that teachers,like students,do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch.but that does not transform them into the employee and employer when it comes to deciding what,when and how english is taught to students.consider the difference between the speech of and marvin pickering,teachers both.when pickering sent a letter to the local newspaper criticizing the school board,he said something that any citizen has a right to say,and he did it on his own time and in his own name,not on the school time or in its name.yet when taught grade english,she did something she was hired and paid to do,something she could not have done but for the board decision to hire her as a public school teacher.as with any other individual in the community,she had no more right to dictate the school curriculum than she had to obtain a teaching the first instance for communicating her preferred list of books and teaching methods.n o relevant analogue exists between her curricular speech and speech by private citizens.garcetti,at.
teachers are not everyday citizens,insists,and they have a right to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.but that is not what ohio law provides or the first amendment requires.start with ohio law.under it,t he board of education of each city shall prescribe a curriculum.o.a.state law gives elected school teachers,not the chair of a department,not the principal,not even the superintendent,responsibility over the curriculum.this is an accountability measure,pure and simple,one that ensures the citizens of a community have a say over a matter of considerable importance to many of children giving them control over membership on the board.
the first amendment does not ban this policy choice or this accountability measure.the constitution does not prohibit a state from creating elected school boards and from placing responsibility for the curriculum of each school district in the hands of each board.teachers no doubt are required to speak or write and otherwise express themselves,garcetti,at,but this does not make them sovereign s unto themselves,parate isibor,cir.the curricular choices of the schools should be presumptively their fact that such choices arouse deep feelings argues strongly for democratic means of reaching them.boring buncombe county bd.of,cir en banc wilkinson,concurring.
how at any rate would a contrary approach work if one teacher,has a first amendment right to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom,so presumably do other teachers.may wish to teach siddhartha in the first unit of the school year in a certain way,but the chair of the english department may wish to use the limited time in a school year to teach a tale of two cities at that stage of the year.maybe the head of the upper school has something else in mind.when educators disagree over what should be assigned,as is surely bound to happen if each of them has a first amendment right to influence the curriculum,whose rights win why indeed does the principal,wray,have a right to defend the discharge on the ground that he was merely exercising his first amendment rights in rejecting curricular choices and methods of teaching placing the first amendment stamp of approval on these kinds of debates not only would demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations,garcetti,at,but it also would transform curricular disputes into constitutional stalemates.
that is not the only problem.what employer discipline arising from an employee manner of of books and the methods of teaching not implicate speech could a teacher respond to a principal insistence that she discuss certain materials by claiming that it improperly compels speech.state bd.of educ.barnette.could a teacher continue to assign materials that members of the community perceive as racially insensitive even after the principal tells her not to could a teacher raise a controversial topic say,the virtues of one theory of government over another or the virtues of intelligent design after a principal has told her not to could a teacher introduce mature sexual themes to fifteen year olds when discussing a work of literature after a principal has told her not to and d oes a music teacher retain veto power over that most controversial of school holiday concert i,at sutton,concurring.
because one man vulgarity is another lyric,cohen california,or,as one school board member put the point at the november meeting,what you might find offensive,i might not,at,parents long have demanded that school boards control the curriculum and the ways of teaching it to their impressionable children.permitting federal courts to distinguish classroom vulgarities from lyrics or to pick sides on how to teach siddhartha not only is a recipe for disenfranchising the or so members of the tipp city community but also tests judicial competence.if even the most happily married parents can not agree on what and how their own children should be taught,as we suspect is not infrequently the case,what leads anyone to think the federal judiciary can answer these questions i,at sutton,concurring.
the key insight of garcetti is that the first amendment has nothing to say about these kinds of decisions.an employee does not lose any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen by signing on to work for the government,but by the same token,the government,just like a private employer,retains control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created the employee job.garcetti,at.and that insight has particular resonance in the context of public education.every child in ohio must attend school,see,providing public school teachers with a captive audience for their speech,see mayer,at,and providing a compelling reason for putting curricular choices in the hands of someone they can vote out of office,id.at,or who is otherwise democratically accountable,see elected officials and other community institutions appoint school board members in certain municipal school districts.
in concluding that the first amendment does not protect primary and secondary school teachers curricular speech,we have considerable company.the seventh circuit invoked garcetti in concluding that the curricular and pedagogical choices of primary and secondary school teachers exceed
