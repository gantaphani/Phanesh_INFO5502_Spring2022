the complaint relied upon a theory once suggested by the united states supreme court that when the state creates a danger to an individual,an affirmative duty to protect might arise.noting that this court has never squarely accepted such a theory,not having been presented with facts supporting a claim,the district court held that the facts presented here simply do not give rise to a substantive due process violation.we agree.we also agree that the conduct alleged does not fall within the scope of title ix,which is concerned with actions taken on the basis of sex,see a,and not undifferentiated bullying.we affirm.
we draw the facts from morgan original and amended complaints and the documents incorporated therein.ouch fed.mortg.ass n,cir.where the complaint characterizes a document,we refer to the document.we do not attempt to cover all the facts,only those directly pertinent to the issues.
in the fall of,was a student at a middle school located in lexington,ma.on or about october,several students pulled to the ground and beat him,repeatedly kicking and punching him in the head and stomach.this was captured on a video given to the administration.the school investigated.the next day,the principal,steven flynn,discussed the incident with morgan.he told morgan that the incident involved a group of students,known as the kool aid club,and that had at first agreed to the beating by the students as part of an initiation into their group.he said that was not the aggressor and that was not in trouble but that he was not happy with because he delay ed the investigation.he told morgan that because of conduct during the investigation,would not be allowed to participate in an upcoming school track meet.
on october,one of the students who had been part of the kool aid club incident said to,you dummy,you got us in trouble.was told they would get him back for getting them in trouble.reported the statements to the assistant principal,who told him to stay away from those students.
during the fall of that year,students repeatedly called mandex man,thunder thighs,and hungry hippo.was pushed,tripped,punched or verbally assaulted while walking in school hallways.was also table topped,in which one person gets down on all fours behind the victim to push the victim behind the knees,and then one or two other individuals push the victim so that the victim falls backwards.o n multiple occasions had his pants pulled down in front of other students male and female,while on school grounds on december,was also pushed into a locker,which caused him to break his watch.
on december,morgan emailed principal flynn that did not feel safe at school and was scared to report bullying for fear of retaliation by his peers.she referred to the school policy and the state statute the complaint alleges that principal flynn replied by email that the school could not investigate the allegations unless himself reported the bullying.what principal flynn actually said in the reply email was,is it possible for you to bring in this morning to meet with school administrators to hear from him the concerns this will enable us to take action on the issues.
on december,morgan met with school officials and reported new information that had recently given her.this included general fear of retaliation for having reported some students and specific retaliation from one of the boys who had attacked him.she gave the school sufficient information to start to investigate the allegations.the school official responded that the school would investigate.and at least by january,it did.
on january,again expressed fear that he would be bullied and refused to go to school.when did not show up to school on january,as required by state law,see.laws ch,principal flynn directed at least one officer of the lexington police department to go to house.morgan represented to us that the officer s went to house that day,and that viewed this act to be a threat by defendant principal flynn to intimidate and coerce him to come back to school.on january,again did not show up at school two officers again went to house to talk with his mother,and experience d a panic attack.

in late february,morgan decided to enroll in a private school,where he finished the school year.
morgan reenrolled at the public school at issue here on october.continued to experience anxiety about attending there and as a result missed days of school from october,through the remainder of the school year.
on october,morgan filed a complaint in federal court against the defendants,alleging a violation of substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment pursuant to against all defendants negligence against all defendants intentional infliction of emotional distress against the superintendent and principal negligent infliction of emotional distress against both men negligent hiring,training,and supervision against lexington and lps and violations of the massachusetts civil rights act against all defendants.the relief sought was compensatory as well as multiple punitive damages for the alleged failure of the defendants to respond appropriately to the bullying.the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.see.b.morgan moved to amend her complaint to include a title ix claim.see.a.on september,the district court allowed the defendants motion and denied morgan motion as futile.this appeal followed,in which morgan challenges the dismissal of her substantive due process claim and the denial of her motion to amend with the title ix claim.
