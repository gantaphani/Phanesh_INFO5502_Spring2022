factual and procedural background 
factual.historical context 
the islands of hawaii are geographically isolated in the south pacific ocean and were originally settled sometime between and.the native hawaiians developed a,efficient,and thriving civilization based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language,culture,and religion.the land,abundant in natural resources,allowed the native hawaiians to thrive.office of hawaiian affairs,native hawaiian rights handbook melody kapilialoha mackenzie ed hereinafter rights handbook.
the first western contact with the hawaiian islands occurred in when captain james cook landed on the island of kauai.the immediate result of that first encounter was that native hawaiians were introduced to western goods and western diseases.by,the native hawaiian population had declined from an estimated in to an alarming.but see rice cayetano,d estimating the population in as between and.

the kamehameha schools 
the kamehameha schools were created under a charitable testamentary trust established by the last direct descendent of king kamehameha i,princess bernice pauahi bishop,who left her property in trust for a school dedicated to the education and upbringing of native hawaiians.burgert lokelani bernice pauahi bishop trust,cir.princess bernice pauahi bishop will provided for the erection and maintenance of schools in the hawaiian islands,called the kamehameha schools,on the hawaiian monarchy ancestral lands,with the purpose of providing a good education in the common english branches,and also instruction in morals and in such useful knowledge as may tend to make good and industrious men and women.will of bernice pauahi bishop,reprinted in wills and deeds of trust ed hereinafter pauahi bishop will.the pauahi bishop will also bestowed on the trustees full power to make all such rules and regulations as they may deem necessary for the government of said schools and to regulate the admission of pupils.id.at.
under the direction of the original trustees,chaired by pauahi bishop widower,charles reed bishop,the kamehameha schools opened in the late nineteenth century during a speech on the schools first founder day,in december,charles reed bishop stated that princess bernice pauahi bishop had created the kamehameha schools,in which hawaiians have the preference,so that her own people could once again thrive.charles bishop,the purpose of the schools,handicraft,at.
in,not long after the death of princess bernice pauahi bishop and the creation of the kamehameha schools,the question arose as to who should be admitted to the schools.cobey black kathleen mellen,princess pauahi bishop and her legacy the kamehameha schools press.charles bishop wrote to the trustees bishop intended that,in the advantages of her beneficence,those of her race should have preference.id.accordingly,he concluded that the principal of the schools was justified in refusing to admit a student who had no native hawaiian ancestry.id.bishop went on to convey that only if native hawaiians failed to apply to the schools,or if conditions changed fundamentally,should admissions be opened to other ethnicities it was wise to prepare for and to admit natives only and i do not think the time has come to depart from that rule.id.
today,the kamehameha schools operate three campuses kapalama on the island of oahu,pukalani on the island of maui,and keaau on the island of hawaii.there are about children in hawaii who meet the schools definition of native hawaiian,but the schools total enrollment is only about students.the kamehameha schools subsidize much of the tuition cost for all students,requiring payment of only per year,whereas the cost of educating a student amounts to about annually.percent of those enrolled receive some form of financial aid to help them pay even that heavily subsidized,modest tuition.
part of the kamehameha schools stated admissions policy is to give preference to students of native hawaiian ancestry,defined to include any person descended from the aboriginal people who exercised sovereignty in the hawaiian islands prior to.practically,the policy operates to admit students without any hawaiian ancestry only after all qualified applicants with such ancestry have been admitted.because there are many more qualified students of hawaiian ancestry than there are available places at the schools,it is very rare that a student with no hawaiian ancestry is admitted to the campus programs.but the admissions policy is not an absolute bar to hawaiians instead,it is intended to last only for so long as native hawaiians suffer educational disadvantages.
we pause to note that the schools policy contains no requirement for a minimum blood quantum of hawaiian ancestry.the only requirement is that a student have at least one native hawaiian ancestor.most students have mixed ancestry.more than different racial and ethnic groups have been represented in the student body,and for the academic year,students reported belonging to different racial and ethnic groups.accordingly,an observer visiting the schools would see visible diversity notwithstanding the students commonality of having at least one native hawaiian ancestor.
the kamehameha schools follow a leadership model of education.this curriculum is meant to foster the and of students as individuals of native hawaiian descent by teaching native hawaiian culture,heritage,language,and tradition,in addition to general courses.
kamehameha schools also operate a number of other educational programs,including,enrichment programs,and summer school programs.in those programs,the admission of hawaiians occurs more often.for example,for the school year,children with no native hawaiian ancestry were admitted to kamehameha program two of the children declined admission the following school year hawaiian children were admitted to the and the year after school students without native hawaiian ancestry were admitted.and,in the summer of,for instance,hawaiians were enrolled in several of the enrichment programs run by the kamehameha schools of students in the performing arts academy of students in explorations of students in culinary arts and of students in hoolauna keauhou.
current conditions in the educational status of native hawaiians 
although the kamehameha schools are partly responsible for the native hawaiian community ability to maintain its distinct character as an aboriginal,native people,native hawaiians,nonetheless,continue to face economic deprivation,low educational attainment,poor health status,substandard housing and social dislocation.from mauka to makai at.in particular,native hawaiians have traditionally performed much below national averages in the educational arena.
in,congress instructed the office of education to submit to congress a comprehensive report on native hawaiian education.the report,entitled the native hawaiian educational assessment project,was released in and documented that native hawaiians scored below parity with regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests,were disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs,and had educational needs that were related to their unique cultural situation,such as different learning styles and low.
that trend continues today.in,congress recognized that native hawaiians are severely disadvantaged in education.it found that 
a educational risk factors continue to start even before birth from many native hawaiian children 
b native hawaiian students continue to begin their school experience lagging behind other students in terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores 
c native hawaiian students continue to score below national norms on standardized education achievement tests at all grade levels 
d both public and private schools continue to show a pattern of lower percentages of native hawaiian students in the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented programs 
e native hawaiian students continue to be among students qualifying for special education programs provided to students with learning disabilities,mild mental retardation,emotional impairment,and other such disabilities 
f native hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in institutions of higher education and among adults who have completed four or more years of college 
g native hawaiians continue to be disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs 
h native hawaiians now comprise over percent of the students served by the state of hawaii department of education,and there are and will continue to be geographically rural,isolated areas with a high native hawaiian population density.
in addition,the most recent native hawaiian educational assessment,published in september,concluded that,o n the whole,native hawaiian children in the public school system perform poorly in school compared with their peers.ka huakai,native hawaiian educational assessment,available at c nhea l en hereinafter ka huakai.that most recent report found that of public schools with a predominantly native hawaiian student body did not meet the state adequate yearly progress standards,but that number dropped to less than for schools without a majority of native hawaiians,a difference of more than.id.at.also,native hawaiian students in elementary and secondary public schools ranked the lowest of all major ethnic groups throughout the state in reading and math,falling between and percentiles behind the state average.id.at.in addition,only of native hawaiian students graduated from high school in,compared to a state average of overall.id.at 
procedural history 
plaintiff applied for admission to the kamehameha schools.he has no hawaiian ancestry.although the school deemed him a competitive applicant and put him on the waiting list,he was repeatedly denied admission.the kamehameha schools concede that plaintiff likely would have been admitted had he possessed hawaiian ancestry.
plaintiff filed an action under,challenging the kamehameha schools admissions policy.he sought both damages and injunctive relief the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the kamehameha schools,holding that the policy satisfied a variation of the standard used to evaluate affirmative action plans challenged under title vii of the civil rights act of,
the court finds the plan has a legitimate justification and serves a legitimate remedial purpose by addressing the socioeconomic and educational disadvantages facing native hawaiians,producing native hawaiian leadership for community involvement,and revitalizing native hawaiian culture,thereby remedying current manifest imbalances resulting from the influx of western civilization.

plaintiff argues that the schools policy should be evaluated under the strict scrutiny standard that applies to governmental action involving preferences.the schools counter that we should employ the more deferential title vii test for evaluating affirmative action plans,with variations appropriate to the educational context.for the reasons that we detail below,we agree with the schools.
discussion 
history of,runyon,and mcdonald 
title provides,in pertinent part,that a ll persons shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.the genesis of the current statute was the civil rights act of,ch,stat.hereinafter act,which congress enacted pursuant to the thirteenth amendment under its authority to enact laws to abolish the badges and incidents of slavery,united states stanley civil rights cases,congress intended for the act to counter the explicit discrimination faced by the recently freed slaves.see.contractors ass pennsylvania,d congress instead acted to protect the freedmen from intentional discrimination by those whose object was to make their former slaves dependent serfs,victims of unjust laws,and debarred from all progress and elevation by organized social prejudices.internal quotation marks omitted.
after the passage of the fourteenth amendment,congress reenacted,with minor changes,the text of the act in section of the enforcement act of,ch,stat.hereinafter act see runyon mccrary,d describing the history of and noting that section of the act was merely a,with some small changes,of the act.accordingly,has roots in both the thirteenth and the fourteenth amendments.contractors,at.but the events and passions of the time in which the law was forged make clear that the purpose of was to destroy the societal influences that were intended to keep former slaves from achieving parity with former masters.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
section largely lay dormant for nearly a century when,in,the supreme court reinvigorated the statute in runyon.in runyon,the supreme court faced the question whether prevents private,commercially operated,nonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective students because they are negroes,at,and held that it does,id.at.the parents of children had sought to enter into contractual relationships with the schools.under those contractual relationships,the schools would have received payments for services rendered,and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments.id.at.the schools refusal to admit them therefore amount ed to a classic violation of.id.the court noted that congress had the right to reach private acts of discrimination in the private school setting because of its power under the thirteenth amendment to enact legislation to combat racial discrimination.id.at.runyon,then,involved a straightforward case of discrimination,not a remedial policy.
on the same day as it issued runyon,the court decided that,notwithstanding its text,prohibits discrimination against white people,as well as against.mcdonald santa fe trail transp,d.
in neither case did the court have occasion to consider whether and under what terms,under what standard of scrutiny a private remedial racial preference would be permissible in the educational context under,nor has it since.but in considering the reach of,the supreme court has looked,in different ways,to both the fourteenth amendment and title vii for guidance.
application of title vii standards to claims 
in general building contractors,the court limited to cover only acts involving intentional discrimination,excluding from the statute reach actions that merely have a disparate effect.at.in so doing,the court relied on the fact that traces its history,in part,to the fourteenth amendment and,accordingly,to the equal protection clause.id.at.even though the supreme court imported the purposeful discrimination element of its equal protection jurisprudence to,later supreme court precedent regarding and title vii suggests that the strict scrutiny standard of equal protection does not apply to a wholly private school remedial admissions plan.
in patterson mclean credit union,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in estate of reynolds martin,cir,the supreme court signaled its intention to apply the title vii analysis to claims brought against a private employer.in patterson,the plaintiff brought a suit against her former employer,alleging that the employer had harassed her,failed to promote her,and fired her on account of her race.at.the court analyzed the ways in which and title vii overlap,as well as the statutes differences,and concluded that the title vii system of proof established in texas department of community affairs burdine,d,and mcdonnell douglas green,d,applied to the case at hand.patterson,at.that is,the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by coming forward with evidence that an employer considered race in its employment decisions.johnson transp.agency,d.after a prima facie case is established,the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate,reason for the decision.patterson,at.the existence of an affirmative action plan provides such a rationale.johnson,at.if a relevant affirmative action plan exists,then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the justification provided was pretextual and that the plan is invalid.id.
several courts expressly have applied title vii substantive standards when examining challenges to private affirmative action plans.the leading case,on which all the others rely,is setser novack investment,cir en banc.in setser,the plaintiff,a white man,sued novack under claiming that he had been refused employment on account of his race because of an affirmative action plan.setser novack inv,cir,opinion vacated in part on reh g by setser,at.the setser court addressed two issues that are relevant here whether section prohibits all affirmative action and whether the standards for reviewing affirmative action under t itle vii govern the review of such plans under section.at.
the eighth circuit first concluded that does not bar affirmative action programs,even in light of mcdonald,at,which held that affords protection to white people.in so holding,the setser court looked to the supreme court decision in united steelworkers of am.weber,d,which held that title vii does not bar all preferential treatment on the basis of race,and applied the same rationale to 
it would indeed be ironic if the civil rights act of was used now to prohibit the only effective remedy for past discriminatory employment practices against blacks and other minorities,when the act was virtually useless to prevent the occurrence of such discrimination for more than a century we conclude that the supreme court,by approving affirmative action by employers in weber,implicitly approved the use of plans to remedy past discrimination under section.to open the door for such plans under t itle vii and close it under section would make little sense.the prohibition under section of affirmative action plans permissible under t itle vii would bar a remedy congress left within the discretion of private employers when it passed t itle vii.
setser,at emphasis added.
having determined that affirmative action plans were permissible,the setser court expressly equat ed the affirmative action standards of t itle vii with those of section.id.at.the court did so in view of the general principle that,i n fashioning a substantive body of law under section the courts should,in an effort to avoid undesirable substantive law conflicts,look to the principles of law created under t itle vii for direction.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this principle of consistency was especially important to the setser court because it found untenable the prospect that an employer could be ordered,under title vii,to implement an affirmative action plan,but simultaneously barred from implementing that same plan under,if the two statutes were interpreted differently.id.at.
the third circuit in a recent decision,as well as other courts,have followed setser in using title vii standards to evaluate private affirmative action plans challenged under.see,schurr resorts int l hotel,cir edmonson steel,cir per curiam frost chrysler motor,stock universal foods,see also johnson transp.agency,cir noting,with approval,the setser analysis,aff,d.
the supreme court recent university of michigan bollinger,d,and gratz bollinger,d do not counsel a different result.in those cases,the supreme court strictly scrutinized the admissions policies of a public university,the university of michigan law school and its undergraduate counterpart.see grutter,at.law school gratz,at.undergraduate institution.plaintiff places great stock in the fact that in both cases,the supreme court mentioned in conjunction with the plaintiff equal protection clause claim.see grutter,at.noting that,because the law school admissions policy satisfied strict scrutiny review under the equal protection clause,it also satisfied gratz,at.noting that,because the university undergraduate admissions program failed strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause,it also violated.
to support both of its holdings,the court cited general building contractors for the proposition that discrimination that violates the equal protection clause also violates.see grutter,at.noting that the prohibition against discrimination in is with the equal protection clause gratz,at.p urposeful discrimination that violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment will also violate.as explained earlier,in general building contractors,the court held that,like the equal protection clause,prohibits only purposeful discrimination and therefore does not permit claims of disparate impact.at.read in context,we believe that the supreme court citation to general building contractors in the university of michigan cases was meant to signal only the fact that both and the fourteenth amendment require intentional discrimination.whether strict scrutiny applies to claims was not at issue.in grutter and gratz,cases involving state action,the schools perforce did not argue that their programs satisfied.the court in grutter and gratz simply did not consider the question.
in view of the precedents that we have just discussed,we conclude that title vii principles apply here.defendant is a purely private entity that receives no federal funds.the supreme court has never applied strict scrutiny to the actions of a purely private entity.the question remains how best to adapt the title vii employment framework to an educational context and to the unique historical circumstances of this case.
applying a modified title vii standard in the educational context under 
only step three of the traditional title vii analysis,patterson,at.johnson,at,is at issue here.at step one,plaintiff established a prima facie case by showing as the schools concede that the kamehameha schools consider applicants hawaiian ancestry,or lack thereof,in making admissions decisions.at step two,the kamehameha schools have specified their remedial admissions policy as the rationale for their decisions.see johnson,at.holding that an affirmative action plan provides a legitimate reason for a hiring decision that considers race or ethnicity.the validity of this policy is the focus of the parties attentions in this case.that is,at step three,plaintiff asserts that the schools justification is pretextual and the admissions plan is invalid.id.the burden of proof at this step lies with plaintiff.id.at.
the supreme court has outlined the appropriate title vii inquiry in the context of private employment.in weber,the court held for the first time that title vii does not prevent private employers from implementing voluntary,remedial affirmative action plans.at.weber involved an employer that had established a training program and reserved of the program openings for black employees until the percentage of black workers in its plant reached the percentage of black workers in the local labor force.id.at.in concluding that the plan was permissible under title vii,the court noted that the plan did not unnecessarily trammel the interests of the white employees or create an absolute bar to the ir advancement.id.at.the court based its decision in part on the fact that the plan was a temporary measure preferential selection will end as soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the gramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.id.at.the court declined to define in detail the line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans.id.at.see also johnson,at noting that the supreme court had not establish ed a rigid formula for testing the validity of an affirmative action plan,aff,at.
eight years later,in johnson,the court concluded that a employer did not violate title vii by taking into consideration the sex of a female employee in deciding to promote her instead of a male employee.the promotional policy,which took into consideration the sex and race of an applicant,was valid because it attempted to eliminate a manifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job categor y.johnson,at.internal quotation marks omitted.like weber,johnson also considered whether the plan unnecessarily trammeled the rights of the class,in this case men,or created an absolute bar to their advancement.id.at.finally,the court considered whether the plan was temporary,designed to attain a balanced work force,not to maintain one.id.at.
we recently distilled the court analysis this way private employers affirmative action plans must respond to a manifest imbalance in the work force must not unnecessarily trammel the rights of members of the class or create an absolute bar to their advancement and must do no more than is necessary to attain a balance.rudebusch hughes,cir.in rudebusch,we found that the pay equity plan at issue was not wholly analogous to the hiring and promotional plans at issue in weber and johnson because of some significant conceptual differences between the types of plans.id.at.we nevertheless applied the three johnson factors,taking account of the context of our case.id.at.similarly,we hold today that the johnson factors,modified to fit the context of our case,provide the appropriate framework for determining whether a wholly private educational institution remedial admissions policy is valid.
we note that,when assessing the validity of affirmative action plans,the supreme court has consistently recognized the importance of deferring to the judgment and expertise of the relevant decisionmakers.see grutter,at.deferring to education officials in admissions decisions weber,at.giving deference to employers in hiring decisions.in the employment context,the supreme court held that,in enacting title vii,congress wished to preserve,to the maximum extent possible,the freedom and discretion traditionally afforded to private businesses.weber,at.in the educational context,the court has underscored that complex educational judgments should be left largely to schools.grutter,at.see also regents of of ewing,d noting that a cademic freedom thrives on autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself citations omitted.the importance of educational autonomy at least in the rooted in the first amendment.see grutter,at.g iven the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment,universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.regents of of cal.bakke,d opinion of powell,academic freedom long has been viewed as a special concern of the first amendment.consequently,we must accord deference to private educational decisionmakers just as we do to private business decisionmakers and public educational decisionmakers.
more importantly,schools perform a significantly broader function than do employers.the supreme court has long recognized that schools do more than simply teach our nation children the three r.schools play a special role in the development of young citizens.see grutter,at.we have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship,describing education as pivotal to sustaining our political and cultural heritage with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society.internal quotation marks omitted brown bd.of.e ducation is the very foundation of good citizenship.educational opportunity is crucial to the development of tomorrow leaders.see grutter,at.in order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry,it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.
primary and secondary school education is the gateway to higher education and is of paramount importance for the training of our nation workforce.see plyler doe,d e ducation provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all.city of cincinnati discovery network,d blackmun,concurring our cases have consistently recognized the importance of education to the professional and personal development of the individual.perhaps more relevant here,increased primary and secondary school educational achievement by minority groups can obviate the downstream need for affirmative action programs by employers and institutions of higher learning.see johnson,at.noting that very limited numbers of women and minorities possess the specialized training and experience required for many categories of jobs grutter,at.ginsburg,concurring noting that the need for affirmative action programs in higher education will decrease a s lower school education in minority communities improves.
in sum,schools educate students for their future endeavors in society as a whole.while private employers strive primarily to make money,and public employers such as police and fire departments perform a specific public function,schools pursue a much broader mission the development of all children to become citizens,leaders,and workers.
the title vii cases,in the employment context,recognize the laudable goal of achieving diversity and proportional representation in the workplace this goal necessarily focuses internally and is limited to the employer work force.johnson,at.by contrast,ensuring that significantly underachieving minority groups are included fully as tomorrow citizens,leaders,and workers necessarily focuses externally.considering this important difference,we conclude that we should use a standard for evaluating remedial racial preferences by wholly private primary and secondary schools that is akin to that used in title vii employment cases,but that takes into account the inherently broad and societal focus of the educational endeavor.
adjusting the first johnson factor to account for this external focus,we hold that,to justify a remedial racial preference,a private school must demonstrate that specific,significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the target population.the external focus of the educational mission renders unnecessary the requirement of proof of a manifest imbalance within a particular school the relevant population is the community as a whole.at the same time,the strict focus on present,demonstrable disparities in educational achievement limits the types of permissible programs and distinguishes a more amorphous program that relies solely on general past societal discrimination.see city of richmond croson,d.
relatedly,the second johnson factor must be modified to account for the relevant scope of inquiry.just as imbalance should be viewed in the relevant community,rather than in a single school,so should the respective rights of members of the group.therefore,within the community as a whole,an admissions policy must not unnecessarily trammel the rights of students in the class or create an absolute bar to their advancement.the third johnson factor is similarly modified an admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to remedy the imbalance in the community as a whole,that we identified at the first step.these three factors best harmonize the relevant statutes and supreme court cases.
judge bybee reliance on runyon in attacking our conclusion is particularly misplaced.as his dissent quotes several times,diss.at,the supreme court in runyon held that private primary schools in virginia that categorically denied admission to applicants represented a classic violation of.runyon,at.nothing in the modified johnson framework that we adopt today,or indeed anywhere in this opinion,is to the contrary.quite simply,runyon is inapposite the program at issue in runyon would certainly fail the first step of our analysis because specific,significant imbalances did not exist favoring.to the contrary,specific,significant imbalances did exist disfavoring.the civil rights act was passed specifically with the plight of in mind.it is therefore unsurprising that the court labeled a admissions policy a classic violation of.
by contrast,the very nature of affirmative action plans is that historically disfavored and underachieving minorities may be given preferential treatment in certain narrowly defined,limited programs.it is the contours of such a private school voluntary remedial admissions we explore today.we turn now to applying the three modified johnson factors to the kamehameha schools admissions policy.
respond to a manifest imbalance 
to meet the first modified johnson factor,a private school must demonstrate that,in the relevant community,specific,significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the group favored by its admissions policy.the relevant community in this case is the state of hawaii,because the schools serve students from all of hawaii islands.we therefore consider whether a manifest imbalance in current educational achievement exists between native hawaiians and other ethnic groups in hawaii.
native hawaiian students are systemically disadvantaged in the classroom.as we described earlier,there is a substantial disparity in performance between native hawaiian students and other ethnic groups.briefly,native hawaiian students score lower on standardized tests than all other ethnic groups in the state,ka huakai at,are more likely to be in special education classes,id.at,are more likely to be absent from school,id.at,and are more likely to attend schools,id.at.native hawaiians are the least likely of the state major ethnic groups to graduate from high school,id.at,and they are less likely than their counterparts to attend college,id.at.congress has expressly recognized the educational disadvantages suffered by native hawaiians and their marginalized status.
in view of those facts and congressional findings,it is clear that a manifest imbalance exists in the educational arena in the state of hawaii,with native hawaiians falling at the bottom of the spectrum in almost all areas of educational progress and success.
furthermore,it is precisely this manifest imbalance that the kamehameha schools admissions policy seeks to address.the goal is to bring native hawaiian students into educational parity with other ethnic groups in hawaii.the stated purpose of kamehameha schools is to create educational opportunities to improve the capability and of native hawaiians and to cultivate,nurture,and perpetuate hawaiian culture,values,history,and language.
to that end,the schools advance a curriculum specially tailored to students of native hawaiian descent.the schools have pinpointed areas in which native hawaiians,in particular,are severely disadvantaged and have developed a curriculum to attend to those needs.the schools have instituted a leadership model of education,meant to restore,integrate native hawaiian culture,heritage,language,and traditions into the educational process,and provide a educational experience for native hawaiians.the schools efforts are aimed at increasing scores on standardized tests,increasing the number of native hawaiians attending colleges and graduate schools,improving native hawaiian representation in professional,academic,and managerial positions,and developing community leaders who are committed to improving the lives of all native hawaiians.
in addition,the kamehameha schools recognized,early on,a critical need to help perpetuate native hawaiian culture.as a result,in the,the schools instituted a formal hawaiian cultural program that continues today.courses on hawaiian history and culture are required before a student may graduate.
the kamehameha schools have shown that specific,significant imbalances in educational achievement currently affect native hawaiians in hawaii and that the schools aim to remedy that imbalance.accordingly,they have satisfied the manifest imbalance criterion.
do not unnecessarily trammel the rights of members of the class or create an absolute bar to their advancement 
under the second prong of the modified title vii analysis,we ask whether,within the relevant community of hawaii,the kamehameha schools admissions policy unnecessarily trammels the rights of members of the class,that is,students with no hawaiian ancestry,or creates an absolute bar to their advancement.
the kamehameha schools allow all students to apply for admission.but once the applications are received,the schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with native hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.because the pool of qualified potential students with native hawaiian blood greatly outnumbers the available slots at the schools,hawaiians generally are not admitted for the reasons that follow,however,the schools admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.
we begin by noting that nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in hawaii are deficient for students,like plaintiff,who lack any native hawaiian ancestry.to the contrary,the same statistical data that portray the difficulties of native hawaiian children generally portray much greater educational achievement,in both public and private primary and secondary schools,for children of all other racial and ethnic groups in hawaii.those students denied admission by kamehameha schools have ample and adequate alternative educational options.the ability of hawaiians to attain educational achievement in hawaii notwithstanding the kamehameha schools longstanding admissions policy demonstrates that the policy neither unnecessarily trammels the rights of hawaiians nor absolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.
our inquiry does not stop there,however.the history of native hawaiians and of the kamehameha schools has certain unique features that congress has acknowledged.in,congress admitted that the united states was responsible,in part,for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy.apology resolution,stat.later,when it enacted legislation in,and then reenacted that legislation in,congress made findings regarding the disadvantages faced by native hawaiian students in the public school system in hawaii.as part of the reenactment,a congressional committee even urged the bishop trust,which operates the kamehameha schools,to redouble its efforts to educate native hawaiian children.i,at emphasis added.
congressional recognition of the challenges faced by native hawaiians in the educational arena supports our conclusion that the schools policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of hawaiians.to the contrary,as congress has recognized,in the unique context of native hawaiian history,affirmative measures are needed to address present,severe inequalities in educational achievement.
finally,we examine the expectations of those who lack native hawaiian ancestry.the supreme court observed in johnson that the denial of the promotion at issue unsettled no legitimate,firmly rooted expectation on the part of petitioner.at.similarly,here,we must ask whether plaintiff had a legitimate,firmly rooted expectation of admission to the schools.the answer is no.
no applicant to the kamehameha schools is guaranteed admission.just as the applicant in johnson had no absolute entitlement to the promotion from his employer,plaintiff here likewise had no absolute entitlement to admission to the schools.id.
furthermore,the kamehameha schools were established when hawaii was a sovereign nation,and they were built on the hawaiian monarchy land.when the schools began,a hawaiian had no expectation of admission to the schools,except when native hawaiians failed to fill all the available slots,or until native hawaiians achieved educational parity with others.see supra.in the intervening years,the schools admissions policy,and therefore the expectations of the hawaiians,has remained constant.thus,denial of plaintiff application for admission unsettled no legitimate,firmly rooted expectation.johnson,at.
for the foregoing reasons,the kamehameha schools admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.
do no more than is necessary 
finally,the schools admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered by students of native hawaiian ancestry.this factor requires that an affirmative action plan be temporary.johnson,at.weber,at.
the kamehameha schools decision to give preference to students with native hawaiian ancestry is limited in duration in two distinct ways.first,if qualified students with native hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the schools in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available,as happened in one recent year,see supra note,the schools policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate.second,preference will be given to students with native hawaiian ancestry only for so long as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects of past,private and discrimination and of social and economic deprivation.these dual aspects of the kamehameha schools policy constitute an e xpress assurance that a program is only temporary.johnson,at.an explicit or immediately foreseeable end date has never been required for an affirmative action plan to be valid.see,id.at.finding the lack of an explicit end date unsurprising and upholding an employer affirmative action plan even though only gradual improvements were anticipated see also grutter,at.adopting justice powell reasoning in the bakke decision,which upheld affirmative action programs in higher education,and expecting that in more years,these programs will no longer be necessary a span of years.
because the admissions policy is not fixed,but changes as the capacity of the schools programs increases and as the of the native hawaiian community rises,the policy does no more than is necessary in light of the significant educational imbalances that native hawaiians continue to face.
accordingly,the kamehameha schools admissions policy satisfies the three johnson a manifest imbalance,do not unnecessarily trammel others rights or create an absolute bar,and do no more than is modified for the private primary and secondary school context.the schools have shown that the admissions policy,favoring students of native hawaiian descent,is legitimate and valid.
judge bybee dissent contends that we should hew more closely to a traditional title vii analysis and that,under such an analysis,the schools preferential admissions policy is not valid.bybee,diss.at.for the reasons that we have detailed,we believe that the dissent focus is too narrow for the private school context and that kamehameha schools remedial admissions policy is legitimate in the face of the serious and systemic disadvantages faced by native hawaiian students in hawaii today.see johnson,at.in evaluating the compliance of an affirmative action plan with title vii prohibition on discrimination,we must be mindful of this court and congress consistent emphasis on the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of the law.internal quotation marks omitted see also rudebusch,at revising the third johnson factor to analyze quantitative rather than temporal limitations because of the context.
even if we were to try to shove a square peg into a round hole by strictly applying the test developed in employment cases to the kamehameha schools admissions policy,that policy would still be valid.as the supreme court has cautioned,i t is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute,because not within its spirit nor within the intention of its makers.weber,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the kamehameha schools admissions policy holds true to the spirit of by supporting native hawaiian students so that they may attain parity with their hawaiian peers.see.contractors,at.
alternatively,and in addition,congress specifically intended to allow the kamehameha schools to operate when,in,it.
plaintiff brought suit under.he has brought no constitutional claims.thus,we are charged only with determining congress intent.
congress originally enacted what later became in.at that time,the statute did not apply in hawaii because it was an independent,sovereign kingdom.congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how the statute would apply in hawaii,because it did not apply at all.when hawaii became a territory in,applied,as it continued to do when hawaii became a state in,see hawaiian statehood act,stat,but it was not until that congress again addressed and amended,see civil rights act of,stat.the amendments are the most recent,and indeed the only,time since hawaii became a territory that congress has reenacted.
therefore,we must determine what congress intended,with regard to native hawaiians,when it reenacted in.because w e assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,miles apex marine,d,we must consider congress long history of providing for native hawaiians through legislation.see goodyear atomic miller,d noting that courts generally presume that congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts.by construing in the context of past congressional action that recognizes and provides for native hawaiians,we preserve the sense and purpose of all relevant statutes.see watt alaska,d noting that it is the duty of the courts to give effect to differing and conflicting statutes so as to preserve their sense and purpose.importantly,the supreme court has expressly considered contemporaneous legislation when interpreting the scope of.in runyon,for instance,the court relied on congress enactment of the civil rights act of and other civil rights legislation in concluding that congress must have intended to reach private acts of discrimination.at.see also weber,at.noting that the application of title vii to remedial affirmative action plans must be read in light of its legislative history and the historical context from which the act arose.
accordingly,we look to legislation that congress has passed specifically affecting native hawaiians both before and after.as we have explained,we consider the statutory landscape because it informs us about what congress had in mind when it reenacted.we consider the statutes to the extent that they demonstrate congress own understanding of.that is,we presume that congress acts consistently with the extant body of law statutes enacted after,therefore,must be read consistently with the revised version of.see cannon of,d concluding that elected officials are presumed to know the law,and that statutes should be read consistently with each other.
beginning as early as,congress recognized that a special relationship existed between the united states and hawaii.see hawaiian homes commission act,stat.designating approximately acres of ceded public lands to native hawaiians for homesteading.over the years,congress has reaffirmed the unique relationship that the united states has with hawaii,as a result of the american involvement in the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy.see,native hawaiian education act,native hawaiian health care act of.
congress has relied on the special relationship that the united states has with native hawaiians to provide specifically for their welfare in a number of different contexts.for example,in,congress amended the native american programs act of,stat,to provide federal funds for a state agency or native hawaiian organization to make loans to native hawaiian organizations and to individual native hawaiians for the purpose of promoting economic development in the state of hawaii.a year later,congress enacted the native hawaiian health care act of,a,stat,for the purpose of providing comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services as well as primary health services to native hawaiians.
most importantly for our purposes today,congress also has focused its attention on the educational disparities faced by native hawaiian students.in,just three years before reenacting,congress passed the augustus stafford elementary and secondary school improvement amendments of.repealed hereinafter amendments.congress made extensive findings,similar to the findings that it later made in,see supra,about the educational needs of native hawaiians and recognized the necessity for special efforts in education recognizing the unique cultural and historical circumstances of native hawaiians.repealed.for instance,congress concluded that it has the power to specially legislate for the benefit of native hawaiians,encouraged native hawaiians to play an active role in planning and managing native hawaiian educational programs,and noted that native hawaiians disproportionally fell below their peers in terms of educational achievement and progress.id.repealed.congress then went on to affirm specifically the mission of kamehameha schools and the schools model elementary curriculum,approving by name the schools continued research and assessment activities.id.a repealed.similarly,congress directed the secretary of education to make grants to the schools for a demonstration program to provide higher education fellowship assistance to native hawaiian students.id.a repealed.the sole recipients of that assistance were to be native hawaiians,a term that was defined in the statute,as it is by kamehameha schools,as a descendant of the aboriginal people,who prior to,occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the state of hawaii.id.c repealed.
the amendments were repealed in.repealed.but for two reasons that fact does not alter the landscape of native congressional enactments against which must be read.first,when congress reenacted in,the amendments were still in effect.second,congress has continued thereafter to emphasize the need for special educational opportunities for native hawaiian students.see concurrence.
after reenacting,congress passed the native hawaiian education act of,and then reenacted that statute in,hereinafter nhea.like the amendments,the nhea recognized the special needs of native hawaiian students and the great disadvantages that they still face in hawaii.id.as part of the no child left behind act of,a congressional committee favorably mentioned the bishop trust and exhorted the schools to redouble their efforts to provide for native hawaiians.i,at.
these steadfast congressional policies favoring remedial measures for native specifically remedial educational measures,some of them even mentioning the schools and the bishop trust approvingly by our analysis of the validity of the kamehameha schools admissions policy under.it would be incongruous to conclude that while congress was repeatedly enacting remedial measures aimed exclusively at native hawaiians,at the same time congress would reject such native hawaiian preferences through.moreover,by reenacting in the midst of passing other legislation to provide specifically and particularly for the education of native hawaiians,congress signaled its clear support for the kamehameha schools and for the validity of the schools admissions policy.
accordingly,the most plausible reading of,in light of the amendments and the nhea,is that congress intended that a preference for native hawaiians,in hawaii,by a native hawaiian organization,located on the hawaiian monarchy ancestral lands,be upheld because it furthers the urgent need for better education of native hawaiians,which congress has repeatedly identified as necessary.
conclusion 
king kamehameha i,on his death bed,is reported to have said,tell my people i have planted in the soil of our land the roots of a plan for their happiness.princess pauahi bishop and her legacy at.his great granddaughter,princess bernice pauahi bishop,echoed that sentiment when she established,through her will,the kamehameha schools.because the schools are a wholly private educational establishment,whose preferential admissions policy is designed to counteract the significant,current educational deficits of native hawaiian children in hawaii,and because in congress clearly intended to exist in harmony with its other legislation providing specially for the education of native hawaiians,we must conclude that the admissions policy is valid under.
i fully concur with judge graber majority opinion.however,i write separately because there is an easier and narrower ground for upholding kamehameha schools admissions policy.
the question in this case is whether forbids kamehameha schools from giving native hawaiian applicants a conclusive preference for admission into its programs.in answering this question,the majority opinion assumes that native hawaiian is a racial classification.op.at.based on this assumption,it holds that permits private schools,in certain circumstances,to prefer disadvantaged minority limited to native on race.but the case before us does not involve an admissions policy generally favoring disadvantaged minorities,or favoring specific racial or ethnic groups such as or hispanics.it involves only an admissions policy favoring native hawaiians,defined as persons descended from the aboriginal people who exercised sovereignty in the hawaiian islands prior to.op.at.
a narrower ground for sustaining kamehameha schools admissions policy is that native hawaiian is not merely a racial classification.it is also a political classification.i would divide the question in this case into two.first,can congress constitutionally provide special benefits,including educational benefits,to descendants of native hawaiians because native hawaiian is a political classification second,if the answer to this question is yes,has congress done so in 
constitutionality of preference for native hawaiians 
because of their history,ably recounted in the majority opinion,native hawaiians constitute a unique population that has a special trust relationship with the united states.congress has repeatedly affirmed,acknowledged,reaffirmed,and recognized that relationship.see,see also joint res,stat.apology resolution.based on this historical and unique legal relationship,congress has enacted more than laws that extend to the hawaiian people the same rights and privileges accorded to american indian,alaska native,eskimo,and aleut communities.see rice cayetano,d stevens,dissenting see also jon van dyke,the political status of the native hawaiian people,yale pol y,listing a sampling of statutes that provide separate benefit programs for native hawaiians or include them in benefit programs that assist other native people.
congress has stated in support of such statutes that the political status of native hawaiians is comparable to that of american indians and alaska natives,d,and that t he authority of congress under the united states constitution to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or indigenous peoples of the united states includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the native peoples of alaska and hawaii.congress has emphasized that it does not extend services to native hawaiians because of their race,but because of their unique status as indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the united states has established a trust relationship.b.
in morton mancari,d,employees of the bureau of indian affairs challenged a hiring preference for american indians as invidious racial discrimination in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the court held that the tribal indian classification is political rather than racial in nature.id.at.benefits were granted to indians not as a discrete racial group,but,rather,as members of tribal entities.id.at.citing the special relationship doctrine,the court held that the tribal indian classification did not trigger strict scrutiny.
the special relationship doctrine is based on an acknowledgment that the united states overcame the indians and took possession of their lands,sometimes by force,leaving them an uneducated,helpless and dependent people.id.at.quoting bd.of county comm rs seber.see also united states kagama.from their very weakness and helplessness,so largely due to the course of dealing of the federal government with them,and the treaties in which it has been promised,there arises the duty of protection,and with it the power.the court in mancari noted that i t is in this historical and legal context that the constitutional validity of the indian preference is to be determined.at.since the preference can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of congress unique obligation toward the indians,the court held that it does not violate the equal protection component of the due process clause.id.at.
in other contexts,the supreme court has not insisted on continuous tribal membership,or tribal membership at all,as a justification for special treatment of indians.in united states john,d,decided after mancari,the court held that indian country,as used in,included the choctaw indian reservation in mississippi.the court noted that for many years the choctaw lands in mississippi had not been reservation lands,and that some choctaws may have been considered to be reservation indians based on their having or more indian blood rather than on any tribal membership.id.at.the court concluded,neither the fact that the choctaws in mississippi are merely a remnant of a larger group of indians,long ago removed from mississippi,nor the fact that federal supervision over them has not been continuous,destroys the federal power to deal with them.id.at.in delaware tribal business committee weeks,d,also decided after mancari,the court upheld against a due process challenge a distribution of funds to both tribal and indians as special treatment that can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of congress unique obligation toward the indians.id.at.quoting mancari,at.
for its part,congress has repeatedly provided special treatment,including distribution of funds,based on broad definitions of the terms indian,native,native american,and tribal organization that encompass indians who are not members of federally recognized tribes.see,defining indian to include persons of or more indian blood who are not also tribal members id.defining natives of alaska as native indians,eskimos,and aleuts of whole or part blood inhabiting alaska at the time of the treaty of cession of alaska to the united states and their descendants of whole or part blood id.c defining indian to include any individual who,irrespective of whether he or she lives on or near a reservation,is a member of a tribe,band,or other organized group of indians,including those tribes,bands,or groups terminated since and those recognized now or in the future by the state in which they reside,or who is a descendant,in the first or second degree,of any such member,or is an eskimo or aleut or other alaska native,or is considered by the secretary of the interior to be an indian for any purpose id.b defining eligible indians to include members of recognized tribes so long as the person can demonstrate descent from an indian resident in california as of id.defining native american as an indian,native hawaiian,or native american pacific islander defining tribal organization to include the department of hawaiian homelands,in the case of native hawaiians,and such other organizations as the secretary may prescribe defining native american as a member of an indian tribe or a native hawaiian b defining native as a person of degree or more alaska indian including tsimshian indians not enrolled in the metlaktla indian community eskimo,or aleut blood,or combination thereof.
we observe the presumption that the passage of the many federal statutes benefitting native hawaiians,alaska natives,and american indians is a constitutional exercise of legislative power.reno condon,d quoting close glenwood cemetery.the basis for this exercise of power is congress conclusion that native hawaiian,like alaska native and indian,is a political classification subject to the special relationship doctrine.unless we were to hold that congress can not legislate for the special benefit of native hawaiians,thereby striking down the enormous swaths of the united states code enacted pursuant to the special relationship doctrine,we must conclude that the doctrine permits congress to provide special benefits to native hawaiians.
i recognize that the court has struck down a statute granting preferential voting rights to native hawaiians,but voting rights are sui generis.in rice cayetano,d,the supreme court addressed a provision of the hawaiian constitution limiting to hawaiians the right to vote in a certain statewide election.the term hawaiians was generally defined as descendants of people inhabiting the hawaiian islands in.id.at.the court held that under the fifteenth amendment congress may not authorize a state to create a voting scheme of this sort.id.at.in so holding,the court assumed authority in congress,delegated to the state,to treat hawaiians or native hawaiians as tribes,but it refused to extend the special relationship doctrine to the new and larger dimension of voting restrictions in state elections.id.at.
the court in rice was careful to confine its analysis to voting rights under the fifteenth amendment.it cautioned that t he validity of the voting restriction is the only question before us.id.at.emphasizing the importance and unique character of voting rights under the fifteenth amendment,the court wrote,the amendment is cast in fundamental terms,terms transcending the particular controversy which was the immediate impetus for its enactment.id.at.further,use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal order democratic elections seek to preserve.id.at.see also shaw reno,d racial classifications with respect to voting carry particular dangers.
unlike rice,the case before us does not involve preferential voting rights subject to challenge under the fifteenth amendment.rather,it involves the preferential provision of educational benefits.to the extent that the federal constitution is implicated at all,the relevant text is the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the court in rice never questioned the validity of the special relationship doctrine under the fourteenth amendment,and never even hinted that its fifteenth amendment analysis would apply to the many benefit programs enacted by congress for native hawaiians,alaska natives,and american indians.
i therefore conclude that congress may,if it wishes,permit kamehameha schools to give preferential admissions treatment to native hawaiians.the remaining question is whether congress has in fact done so under.
ii.section 
when congress enacted in the civil rights act of,act of,ch,stat,and reenacted it four years later in the enforcement act of,act of may,ch,stat,the hawaiian islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose people were not within the jurisdiction of the united states.as stated by congress,from until,the united states recognized the independence of the kingdom of hawaii,extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the hawaiian government,and entered into treaties and conventions with the hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in,and.apology resolution,stat.at.
for many years after the hawaiian kingdom was in,and even after the state of hawaii was admitted to the union in,posed no threat to kamehameha schools preferential admissions policy.but in the supreme court held that reaches both admissions programs at private schools that categorically exclude,runyon mccrary,d,and racial discrimination in private employment against whites as well as nonwhites,mcdonald santa fe trail transp,d.together,these cases intimated that might prohibit private school admissions policies that exclude whites.
in,congress revised and reenacted.see civil rights act of,stat.by this time,congress had enacted numerous statutes that provided exclusive benefit programs for native hawaiians or included them in benefit programs for other native peoples.indeed,just a few years before reenacting,congress passed many laws that gave exclusive contractual or grant benefits to native hawaiians and native hawaiian organizations congress proclaimed that its native hawaiian benefit programs are consistent with the historical and unique legal relationship of the united states with the government that represented the indigenous native people of hawaii,native hawaiian health care act of,stat.at codified as amended at,and that this relationship gives congress the power to specially legislate for the benefit of native hawaiians.amendments,tit.iv,stat.at formerly codified at repealed.
when congress reenacted,two recently passed laws directed kamehameha provide educational benefits to native hawaiians,and only native hawaiians.the amendments,passed in,instructed the secretary of education to make grants to the kamehameha pauahi bishop estate for a demonstration program to provide higher education fellowship assistance to native hawaiian students.id.a,stat.at.one year before reenacting,congress amended the public health service act to direct the secretary to provide funds to kamehameha estate for the purpose of providing scholarship assistance to eligible native hawaiian students.act of,stat,codified as amended at.these federal statutes specifically directed kamehameha schools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this case say is forbidden by.
it was not until the amendments to that congress specified that it intends courts to apply the statute to substantive discrimination by private actors.see c the rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of state law.in order to hold for plaintiff in this case,we would have to conclude that congress intended this provision to invalidate,sub silentio,the recently enacted legislation that provided loans and scholarships exclusively to native hawaiians at kamehameha schools.but this conclusion would require us to turn our back on the supreme court analysis in mancari,where it rejected the challenge of plaintiffs to indian employment preferences as inconsistent with the federal equal employment opportunity act of.
the mancari plaintiffs argued that 
since the equal employment opportunity act of proscribed racial discrimination in government employment,the act necessarily,albeit sub silentio,repealed the provision of the indian reorganization act of that called for the preference in the bureau of indian affairs of one racial group,indians,over.
mancari,at.the act,upon which the mancari plaintiffs relied,amended title vii of the civil rights act of.id.at.whereas the civil rights act had expressly exempted certain indian preferences,neither the text nor the legislative history of the amending act made any reference to such preferences.id.given that the act was specifically modeled on the act,the omission of an exemption for indian preferences was especially glaring,and the plaintiffs argument for sub silentio repeal especially strong.
nevertheless,the supreme court unanimously and emphatically rejected the argument for sub silentio repeal by the amendment 
it would be anomalous to conclude that congress intended to eliminate the longstanding statutory preferences in bia employment,as being racially discriminatory,at the very same time it was reaffirming the right of tribal and private employers to provide indian preference.appellees assertion that congress implicitly repealed the preference as racially discriminatory,while retaining the preferences,attributes to congress irrationality and arbitrariness,an attribution we do not share.
three months after congress passed the amendments,it enacted two new indian preference laws it is improbable,to say the least,that the same congress which affirmatively approved and enacted these additional and similar indian preferences was,at the same time,condemning the bia preference as racially discriminatory.in the total absence of any manifestation of supportive intent,we are loathe to imply this improbable result.
this is a prototypical case where an adjudication of repeal by implication is not appropriate.the preference is a longstanding,important component of the government indian program.the provision,aimed at alleviating minority discrimination in employment,obviously is designed to deal with an entirely different and,indeed,opposite problem.any perceived conflict is thus more apparent than real.
a provision aimed at furthering indian by according an employment preference within the bia for qualified members of the governed group can readily with a general rule prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race.any other conclusion can be reached only by formalistic reasoning that ignores both the history and purposes of the preference and the unique legal relationship between the federal government and tribal indians.
furthermore,the indian preference statute is a specific provision applying to a very specific situation.the act,on the other hand,is of general application.where there is no clear intention otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one,regardless of the priority of enactment.
the courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.
id.at.emphasis added citations omitted.
the principal dissent insists that the failure of to include in its text an explicit exception for native hawaiians is fatal to kamehameha schools admissions policy.but of all the federal statutes to which strict rules of statutory construction might be applied,is a particularly inappropriate candidate.the text of only guarantees the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.a.it does not guarantee the right of white persons or citizens to enjoy the same contractual rights as.therefore,according to the dissent interpretive method,should not be read to protect whites against private racial discrimination.but we know that,despite the clear text of,this conclusion would be wrong,for the supreme court held in that whites as well as are protected under.mcdonald,at.
congress provision of educational benefits to native hawaiians continues to this day.congress repealed the native hawaiian provisions of the amendments only to replace them with the more comprehensive native hawaiian education act nhea,et,stat.formerly codified at et repealed,which congress later reenacted in the no child left behind act of.et.as part of the no child left behind act of,a congressional committee exhorted the bishop trust,which finances kamehameha schools,to redouble its efforts to educate native hawaiian children.i,at.
the nhea continues to allocate money to private organizations to provide programs for the exclusive benefit of native hawaiians.see.kamehameha schools definition of native hawaiian is virtually identical to that used in the nhea.see b defining native hawaiian as a descendant of the aboriginal people who,prior to,occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the state of hawaii.the nhea expressly declares that congress does not extend services to native hawaiians because of their race,but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the united states has established a trust relationship.b.
through the nhea and the myriad other federal statutes that confer benefits on native hawaiians,congress has made manifest its intent to apply some form of the special relationship doctrine to native hawaiians.the well established general rule is that scrutiny applies to private discrimination than to discrimination.it would be deeply ironic for us to hold that forbids private institutions from giving native hawaiians educational benefits when,at the same time,congress itself provides such benefits and provides public funds for private organizations to do the same.
conclusion 
congress has invariably treated native hawaiian as a political classification for purposes of providing exclusive educational and other benefits.under the special relationship doctrine,congress has the power to do so.i see nothing in to indicate that congress intended to impose upon private institutions a more restrictive standard for the provision of benefits to native hawaiians than it has imposed upon itself.
this case involves the application of one of the republic oldest and most enduring civil rights statutes.that enacted as section sixteen of the civil rights act of in pertinent part that,all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.a.enacted soon after the passage of the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments,perhaps more of the reconstruction era civil rights enactments was intended to ensure that a dollar in the hands of any citizen will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man.jones alfred mayer,d.applying that principle in runyon mccrary,d,the supreme court held that prohibits private,commercially operated,schools from denying admission to prospective students because they are not members of a favored racial group.indeed,as runyon makes clear,discriminating against a private school applicant solely on the basis of that applicant race amounts to a classic violation of.id.at.
despite that principle,the majority today stands runyon on its head and holds that a private school may deny admission to a prospective student solely because he or she is not a member of a particular race.though i agree with the majority that native hawaiians suffer from severe disadvantages and believe that kamehameha schools kamehameha should be commended for attempting to remedy those hardships,i can not concur with the majority dramatic departure from runyon.
in my view,the majority has made a number of crucial mistakes.thus,as set out below in part i,even though i agree with the majority that title vii and not strict scrutiny provides the standard of review in this case,i disagree with the majority sweeping modification of the title vii standard.moreover,even if i agreed with the majority departure from that standard,i could not subscribe to the majority decision to sanction an absolute racial bar.likewise,as set out in part ii,i can not accept as a matter of faithful statutory construction the majority view that congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for native hawaiians from by passing even since.indeed,i believe the majority novel approach to statutory interpretation is readily manipulable and would enable courts to rewrite statutes whenever they want to save a particular program,contract,or enactment.finally,as set out in part iii,because native hawaiians do not constitute a federally recognized tribe and kamehameha is a private party,i also disagree with judge fletcher suggestion that the special relationship doctrine of morton mancari,d,can save kamehameha racially exclusive admissions policy.
as much as i may believe that kamehameha should be applauded for providing its students an exceptional education and for attempting to remedy the socioeconomic disadvantages facing native hawaiians,i can not turn a blind eye to a classic violation of.noble as kamehameha goals may be,good intentions are not license to violate our civil rights laws.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
review of under title vii standards 
the john doe plaintiff contends that kamehameha admissions bars the admission of any hawaiian student,see op.at because,as runyon mccrary,d,makes clear,discriminating against a private school applicant solely on the basis of that applicant race amounts to a classic violation of.id.at.despite the inherent logic of plaintiff argument,the majority avoids reaching a similar conclusion by holding q uite simply,runyon is inapposite,op.at,and grafting a modified title vii standard onto.
to create that new standard,the majority dismisses runyon as irrelevant because t he program at issue in runyon would certainly fail the majority analysis.id.in so holding,however,the majority ignores the critical fact that the admissions programs involved in kamehameha violated because they used race as the determinative admissions factor.instead,the majority converts runyon into a case about a admissions program that is inapposite to kamehameha native admissions policy.id.i find the majority decision to dismiss runyon in order to approve a policy that bars african american and any other children who lack native hawaiian ancestry to be unfortunate and wrong.
putting those concerns aside for the moment,and turning to the next step in the majority analysis,the majority holds that title vii scrutiny,and not strict scrutiny,applies to alleged violations.op.at.that second step in the majority analysis is sound.like the majority,i agree that title vii standards and not strict scrutiny must apply to actions because to hold otherwise would effectively render the title vii provisions that expressly contemplate affirmative action plans nonsensical.op.at see also schurr resorts int l hotel,cir edmonson united states steel,cir per curiam setser novack inv,cir en banc.
applying the title vii approach,the majority also correctly holds that the burden shifting analysis of mcdonnell douglas green,d,applies to plaintiff claim.see op.at.under that test,t he complainant in a title vii trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.where an explicit policy exists,proof of that fact alone is sufficient to establish a prima facie case.if the plaintiff proves his prima facie case,a rebuttable presumption of intentional discrimination arises,see.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d,and the burden of production shift s to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the conduct at issue.mcdonnell douglas,at.the existence of an affirmative action plan provides such a rationale.johnson transp.agency,d.if such a plan is articulated as the basis for the employer decision,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the plan is invalid.id.
as kamehameha concedes that it employs a preference that favors native hawaiian applicants,plaintiff has met his burden to show a prima facie case of racial discrimination.op.at.kamehameha argues,however,that its conduct is permissible because its admissions policy was executed pursuant to an affirmative action plan,thereby rebutting the presumption of illegality.thus,as the majority concludes,this case hinges entirely on the third step of the mcdonnell douglas,whether kamehameha plan is invalid.see op.at.
it is at this point,when the majority entirely reworks the standards for determining whether an affirmative action plan is valid,that the majority analysis goes astray.under united steelworkers of america weber,d,and johnson transportation agency,d,an affirmative action program must satisfy the following factors to be considered valid it must be justified by the existence of a manifest imbalance in the employer workforce that is reflective of traditionally segregated job categories it may not unnecessarily trammel the rights of other employees or create an absolute bar to their advancement and it must be designed to do no more than attain a balance.rudebusch hughes,cir first and third alteration in original quoting johnson,at.
reasoning that primary and secondary educational contracts are different,however,the majority alters all three factors and holds that a private school may discriminate on the basis of race whenever significant imbalances in educational achievement in the community as a whole presently affect the target population the discriminatory policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of students in the racial group as a whole or create an absolute bar to their advancement and the discriminatory policy does no more than is necessary to correct the imbalance identified at the first step.op.at.
though i recognize that the title vii standard was forged in the employment discrimination context and that some modification may be necessary to adapt it to other settings,i disagree,as explained below,with the majority general justification for departing from precedent and with each specific alteration it makes to the title vii standard.furthermore,i also disagree with the majority application of its own standard.
a.the majority modification of the title vii standard 
the majority creates a standard that,by its own terms,applies only to primary and secondary schools.it grounds that decision entirely on its finding that the ordinary title vii standard,which was developed in the employment setting,can not apply to primary and secondary educational contracts.but,there is absolutely nothing in text to suggest that contracts made with private employers that strive primarily to make money and public employers that perform a specific public function should be subject to a different standard than primary and secondary schools that have a much broader external mission.op.at.indeed,the majority neglects the fact that guarantees to a ll persons the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.a emphasis added.given plain text,then,it is not surprising that the majority can not cite a single case to support the novel proposition that primary and secondary educational contracts are different from other contracts and are entitled to special treatment under.
in fact,the supreme court has rejected that very argument.for instance,far from finding that a school much broader mission or external focus made a difference,involved a racially exclusive primary and secondary private school admissions 
it is apparent that the racial exclusion practiced by the school and bobbe private school amounts to a classic violation of.the parents sought to enter into contractual relationships with the schools for educational services under those contractual relationships,the schools would have received payments for services rendered,and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments n either school offered services on equal basis to white and nonwhite students plaintiffs were denied admission to the schools because of their race.the conclusion that was thereby violated follows inexorably from the language of that statute,as construed in prior supreme court case law.
at.quotation and citation omitted footnote omitted.thus,the majority argument that primary and secondary private school educational contracts should be treated differently from other contracts under was squarely rejected in runyon,and i would adhere to that precedent.
similarly,the majority rationale does not find any support in title vii jurisprudence.indeed,under title vii the supreme court has uniformly measured affirmative action programs against the standard established in weber as explained above.for example,johnson employed weber to determine the validity of a county transportation agency affirmative action program under title vii.at.see also id.at.w e must first examine whether the employment decision was made pursuant to a plan prompted by concerns similar to those of the employer in weber.next,we must determine whether the effect of the plan on the race is comparable to the effect of the plan in that case.id.at.the assessment of the legality of the agency plan must be guided by our decision in weber.footnote omitted.
our own jurisprudence has closely followed the supreme court lead in this area,and,as the majority candidly concedes,under title vii,we have always applied the same standard,even when the program at issue was not wholly analogous to the hiring and promotional plans at issue in weber and johnson because of some significant conceptual differences between the types of plans,op.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted our sister circuits have done the same,even when the case involved primary and secondary schools that have a much broader external mission.see,taxman bd.of educ.of twp.of piscataway,cir en banc evaluating a plan for the hiring and firing of primary and secondary school teachers under the weber standard,cert.granted,d,cert.dismissed,d cunico pueblo sch.dist,cir evaluating a race conscious plan for primary and secondary school personnel under the weber standard.
the majority fails to explain why we must create a special standard for primary and secondary educational contract cases if anything,as highlighted above,runyon compels the conclusion that a primary and secondary educational any other discriminates solely on the basis of race violates.see at.as noted above,i also disagree with the majority adaption of all three of the supreme court factors for determining the validity of an affirmative action program,to which i now turn.
manifest imbalance reflecting traditional segregation 
the majority has substantially modified the court first factor.under the first weber and johnson factor,the supreme court has required that a title vii affirmative action program be justified by the existence of a manifest imbalance that reflected underrepresentation of the favored group in traditionally segregated job categories.johnson,at.internal quotation marks omitted accord weber,at.id.at.blackmun,concurring.our cases have consistently and faithfully applied this requirement.see,officers for justice civil serv.comm n,cir under title vii analysis,voluntary adoption of a remedy may be justified by a showing that a manifest imbalance exists,reflecting underrepresentation of the favored group in traditionally segregated job categories.internal quotations omitted davis city county of,cir same higgins city of vallejo,cir same la riviere eeoc,cir applying the same standard to a affirmative action plan.
likewise,we have consistently applied the supreme court holding that i n determining whether an imbalance exists that would justify taking race into account,a comparison of the percentage of minorities in the employer work force with the percentage in the area labor market is appropriate johnson,at.emphasis added accord weber,at.davis,at to determine whether such an imbalance has occurred,the court may compare the percentage of minorities or women in the employer work force with the percentage in the area labor market or general population.emphasis added higgins,at similar.
in other words,until today,two findings were required to satisfy this first factor the present existence of a manifest imbalance in a particular job category in the employer workforce and that this imbalance stems from historical segregation in that job category.those separate requirements guaranteed two critical things first,with respect to the scope of the program,they guaranteed that there was a particular goal in,representation of the historically disadvantaged group in the employer workforce in proportion to its representation in the relevant labor pool.johnson,at.weber,at.by requiring a goal based on the employer own practices,weber and johnson were willing to permit affirmative action programs without giving all employers license to discriminate in favor of any group that currently finds itself disadvantaged anywhere in the labor market.second,those requirements ensured that there was a temporal constraint,a point after which the preference program would no longer be is,once the manifest imbalance in the employer workforce had been corrected.johnson,at.the requirement that the manifest imbalance relate to a traditionally segregated job category provides assurance both that sex or race will be taken into account in a manner consistent with title vii purpose of eliminating the effects of employment discrimination,and that the interests of those employees not benefiting from the plan will not be unduly infringed.weber,at.t he plan is a temporary measure it is not intended to maintain racial balance,but simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance.preferential selection of craft trainees at the gramercy plant will end as soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the gramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.moreover,an affirmative action program that correlates to an employer own internal practices is necessarily limited in scope and time,because correcting the manifest imbalance is reasonably within the employer control.
in contrast to weber and johnson,the majority test merely requires a private school to demonstrate that specific,significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the target population in the relevant community op.at.thus,by completely eliminating any analysis and jettisoning any historical inquiry the majority rejects the constraint developed in the title vii context that affirmative action programs must be limited in scope and duration.indeed,the majority effectively discrimination so long as the identified group currently suffers from significant imbalances in educational achievement.id.at.because such a broad and perpetual license conflicts with the supreme court consistent emphasis on the limited and temporary nature of permissible affirmative action plans,see,sheet metal workers int l ass eeoc,d,i can not endorse the majority new standard.see also,grutter bollinger,d the requirement that all admissions programs have a termination point assure s all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter,a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.quoting richmond croson,d plurality opinion weber,at.noting the affirmative action plan in that case was a temporary measure states paving.state dep t of,cir a narrowly tailored remedial program must also include adequate durational limitations.smith of,cir r admissions programs must be limited in time.
unnecessary trammeling the rights of the group 
the majority alteration of weber and johnson second factor is similarly problematic.under the second factor,an affirmative action plan must not unnecessarily trammel the rights of members of the disfavored group or create an absolute bar to their advancement.johnson,at.accord weber,at.the majority echoes this test,op.at,but it makes two important modifications.
first,under the majority test,whether a discriminatory policy creates an absolute bar or unnecessarily trammels the rights of the disfavored race is determined by reference to the respective rights of members of the group viewed in the relevant community,rather than in a single school.op.at.thus,under the majority new standard,we must not consider the rights of a individual at the institution in question but in the larger context of his ability to access quality education.see id.at.again,as indicated above,that standard conflicts with the established principle that we look at the particular institution adopting the affirmative action program to determine whether the rights of a member of the disfavored group have been trammeled.see,johnson,at.w hile petitioner in this case was denied a promotion,he retained his employment with the agency,at the same salary and with the same seniority,and remained eligible for other promotions.id.at.of the new skilled craft jobs at the agency during the relevant period,or almost,went to men.id.at.the decision to hire joyce instead of the plaintiff was made pursuant to an affirmative action plan that represents a moderate,flexible,approach to effecting a gradual improvement in the representation of minorities and women in the agency work force.emphasis added weber,at.the plan does not require the discharge of white workers and their replacement with new black hirees.nor does the plan create an absolute bar to the advancement of white employees half of those trained in the program will be white.citation omitted.
indeed,it is contrary to the,i had always assumed,based on the cases cited above,the the civil rights laws to explain to a worker who has been discriminated against that the situation is not so bad because there are lots of other jobs available.yet that is the essence of the majority new standard if the majority thinks there are adequate educational alternatives for the disfavored race,then the fact that the institution in question has discriminated against that race is of no concern.context alone can not explain why,under the majority view,racial discrimination in some communities would be wrong and actionable,but in other communities,it would be acceptable and praiseworthy.i can not join the majority analysis.
the majority makes a second important modification and announces that in determining whether an affirmative action plan trammels rights or creates an absolute bar,we do not look at whether an individual has been denied an opportunity,but whether the individual racial group within the community as a whole has been denied an opportunity.see op.at holding that because nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in hawaii are deficient for students,like plaintiff,who lack any native hawaiian ancestry,kamehameha admissions policy neither unnecessarily trammels the rights of hawaiians nor absolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.emphasis added id.at holding that because hawaiian students denied admission by kamehameha schools,as statistical data demonstrates,have ample and adequate alternative educational options,kamehameha admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel rights or create an absolute bar emphasis added.that standard,however,conflicts with both the plain meaning of and the basic premise that civil rights laws are design ed to protect individuals of all races,mcdonald santa fe trail transp,d emphasis added,and not merely a group of individuals,or a body of persons according to their numbers,mitchell united states.since,by its own terms,explicitly applies to all persons and not simply groups of individuals,mcdonald,at.quoting a,the majority holding that protects groups instead of all persons contradicts the statute plain meaning indeed,as the supreme court has made clear,at a minimum,reaches discrimination against an individual because he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and physiognomically distinctive of homo sapiens,saint francis coll,d emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted,and not simply,as the majority holds,racial groups qua racial groups.see brown henderson,cir holding that under title vii the ultimate issue is the reason for the individual plaintiff treatment,not the relative treatment of different groups within the workplace accord connecticut teal,d title vii principal focus is the protection of the individual employee,rather than the protection of the minority group as a whole.furnco constr.waters,d stating that an employer must provide an equal opportunity for each applicant regardless of race,without regard to whether member of the applicant race are already proportionately represented in the workforce.
this bedrock principle has its origins in the history of the fourteenth amendment,from which derives.the equal protection clause provides in pertinent part that,no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv,emphasis added.just as courts have read title vii now to protect individual rights,courts have consistently held that the equal protection clause protect s persons,not groups.adarand constructors,pena,d.accordingly,the supreme court has required that group classification s be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.accord mitchell,at.it is the individual who is entitled to the equal protection of the merely a group of individuals shelley kraemer.the rights established by the fourteenth amendment are personal rights.missouri ex rel.gaines canada.similar mccabe atchison,topeka,sante fe ry.similar alabama,d kennedy,concurring in judgment the neutral phrasing of the equal protection clause,extending its guarantee to any person,reveals its concern with rights of individuals,not groups though group disabilities are sometimes the mechanism by which the state violates the individual right in question.
this principle is manifest in one of the cornerstones of our modern civil rights laws,shelley kraemer.in shelley,the supreme court rejected the argument that because courts could enforce racially restrictive covenants equally against both whites and african americans,enforcing a racially restrictive covenant against african americans in that case did not violate the equal protection clause.id.at.in so holding,shelley reasoned that because t he rights created by the first section of the fourteenth amendment are,by its terms,guaranteed to the individual i t is no answer to say that the courts may also be induced to deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy on grounds of race or color.id.at.indeed,e qual protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.id.contrary to shelley,the majority holds that equality can be achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.id 
as there is no reason to depart from the plain meaning of or the framework espoused in shelley,i would follow supreme court precedent by considering the rights of individuals,not of groups.consequently,i can not concur in the majority modification of the second weber and johnson factor.
attaining a balance 
finally,the majority reworks the third weber and johnson factor,which requires that an affirmative action plan be intended to attain a balanced work force,not to maintain one.johnson,at.accord weber,at.holding an affirmative action plan should be a temporary measure,not intended to maintain racial balance,but simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance.though the supreme court has not required that all affirmative action programs contain an explicit end date,johnson also holds that,express assurance that a program is only temporary may be necessary if the program actually sets aside positions according to specific numbers.at.indeed,in such cases,a sunset provision is necessary both to minimize the effect of the program on other employees,and to ensure that the plan goals are not being used simply to achieve and maintain balance.id.at.quoting sheet metal workers,at.accord taxman bd.of educ.of twp.of piscataway,cir en banc b oth weber and johnson unequivocally provide that valid affirmative action plans are temporary measures that seek to attain,not maintain a permanent racial balance.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.granted,d,cert.dismissed,d.
under the third factor,the majority properly recognizes that an affirmative action admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to correct a racial imbalance and must be temporary.op.at accord id.at.proclaiming that a n explicit or immediately foreseeable end date has never been required for an affirmative action plan to be valid,op.at,however,the majority completely ignores johnson suggestion that even a partial preference should be checked by an explicit sunset provision,by holding that kamehameha absolute preference need not contain a sunset provision at all,see op.at holding that kamehameha may use race as an exclusive admissions factor so long as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects of past,private,and discrimination and of social and economic deprivation id.at the goal of kamehameha admissions policy is to bring native hawaiian students into educational parity with other ethnic groups in hawaii.see also id.at noting that in the last years,the schools admissions policy has remained constant.the majority thus not only rejects johnson but also the court admonishment that admissions policies however compelling their goals,are potentially so dangerous that they must have reasonable durational limits.grutter,at.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted accord id.the requirement that all admissions programs have a termination point assure s all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter,a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.internal quotation marks omitted.
far from placing a durational limit on kamehameha use of race as a dispositive admissions factor,the majority actually sanctions the use of race in perpetuity.for example,since few,if any,private parties will be able to correct significant imbalances in educational achievement in the entire target population through their own individual action,the majority standard effectively issues private schools a license to engage in perpetual racial discrimination.because such a limitless use of race in determining admissions contravenes precedent,the majority retooling of johnson and weber third factor is also unsound.
applying the majority standard to kamehameha 
even if i were to agree with the majority modifications to the supreme court title vii standard,i could not agree with its application of that standard in this case.
a manifest imbalance presently affecting the target population 
under the majority modified first factor,to justify a remedial racial preference,a private school must demonstrate that specific,significant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect the target population in the relevant community.i have explained above in part.why the majority test is fundamentally flawed and conflicts with precedent.the majority any focus on the schools own population and any reliance on historical kamehameha of the burden of demonstrating its policy is limited in scope and duration.for the reasons i explain in the next two sections,kamehameha affirmative action program fails both inquiries.nevertheless,under the majority modest thesis,kamehameha admissions policy arguably survives the first revised factor because it is clear that native hawaiians suffer from significant imbalances in educational achievement relative to most other ethnic groups in hawaii.
unnecessarily trammel the rights of the racial group 
under the majority second prong,we ask whether,within the relevant community of hawaii,the kamehameha schools admissions policy unnecessarily trammels the rights of the class,that is,students with no hawaiian ancestry or creates an absolute bar to their advancement.op.at.the majority holds that kamehameha does not run afoul of this prong because t he history of native hawaiians and of kamehameha schools has certain unique features that congress has acknowledged nothing in the record suggests that educational opportunities in hawaii are deficient for hawaiian students hawaiians have no legitimate,firmly rooted expectation of admission to the schools and kamehameha allows all students to apply for admission,though once the applications are received,the schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with native hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.op.at.none of these explanations is sufficient to justify kamehameha admissions policy even under the revised standard.
for example,the majority first finding is irrelevant.the mere fact that congress admitted that the united states was responsible,in part,for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy and that congress has recognized the challenge faced by native hawaiians in the educational arena and has urged kamehameha to redouble its efforts to educate native hawaiian children,op.at quoting i,at,says absolutely nothing about whether kamehameha policy unnecessarily trammels rights or creates an absolute bar.moreover,the statements the majority relies on also say nothing about whether congress has ever been aware of kamehameha no hawaiians policy,let alone endorsed it.indeed,it is unreasonable to conclude,as the majority does,that by briefly endorsing the schools larger educational goals in a committee report that does not even accompany a piece of legislation,congress intended to sanction the requirements of an otherwise infirm affirmative action plan 
the majority second hawaiians have other educational fails to justify the majority holding that kamehameha admissions policy does not create an absolute bar or trammel the rights of the race.in fact,as i have previously discussed,at,supra,i believe that considering hawaiians alternatives in this way is unsound under prevailing civil rights case law.but even neglecting that fact,such reliance is particularly problematic here.kamehameha has an illustrious network of alumni and a record of success that exceeds that of any other school in hawaii.the tremendous trust corpus of the bishop foundation enables kamehameha to offer this excellent education at a severely discounted price as the majority notes,the cost of educating each student approaches annually,but tuition at kamehameha is less than of this figure,and most students receive financial aid.see op.at.no other school in hawaii offers the same benefits at such low cost.thus,the majority second justification flies in the face of logic and can not justify the majority holding.
i find the majority next because for the last years,the schools admissions policy has remained constant,hawaiians have no legitimate,firmly rooted expectation of admission to the schools,op.at citation omitted to be unavailing in other words,according to the majority,because hawaiians have been discriminated against on the basis of their race for a long time,they have no cause of action under.this view is contrary to history and logic.perhaps more than any other enactments in our history,the fourteenth amendment and the civil rights acts unsettled the expectations of an entire nation accustomed to judging people by their race.surely the schools in runyon would have found no defense by arguing that their exclusionary policies were open and notorious and that students had no expectation of admission to the schools.op.at.advising hawaiians that they have no possibility of admission to kamehameha may settle their expectations,but it does that the policy lawful.
lastly,the majority final justification for holding that kamehameha admissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel rights or create an absolute bar is absolutely wrong.the majority begins by noting that t he kamehameha schools allow all students to apply for admission.but once the applications are received,the schools consider the ethnic background of the students and admit qualified children with native hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no such ancestry.op.at accord id.at noting,if qualified students with native hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the school in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available,as happened in one recent year,the schools policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate.footnote omitted emphasis added.the majority then notes,in a bit of an understatement,that,b ecause the pool of qualified potential students with native hawaiian blood greatly outnumbers the available slots at the schools,hawaiians generally are not admitted.id.at.highlighting the understated nature of its conclusion,the majority then proceeds to drop a footnote explaining that its euphemistic phrase generally are not admitted means that,from until,kamehameha admitted exactly one student who was not of native hawaiian descent.id.at.
proceeding as if its statement that kamehameha generally does not admit hawaiians proves that kamehameha policy is not an absolute bar,the majority entirely neglects to mention the circumstances surrounding the admission of that lone hawaiian student.because those circumstances speak volumes about kamehameha policy,however,they deserve an extended discussion.
in,kamehameha reversed its previous policy of allowing the children of faculty members to attend.thereafter,the school did not admit a single hawaiian student until,when it admitted one hawaiian student to its maui campus.in response to a firestorm of protests following that decision,kamehameha trustees repeatedly apologized to the native hawaiian community,stated that the situation had brought the problems with the admissions process into sharp focus,members of trs.of kamehameha,kamehameha policy will remain,honolulu advertiser,july,and acknowledged that they had screwed up major,rick daysog,angry ohana grills trustees,honolulu,july.as a result,the trustees pledged to carefully review kamehameha admissions process,members of bd.of trs.of kamehameha,supra,presumably to prevent such a situation from happening again.
far from an empty promise,kamehameha promptly made several significant changes to its admission practices.first,it created the hawaiian data center to develop a native hawaiian registry and certify the hawaiian ancestry of the schools applicants to be considered under the school preference policy,an applicant ancestry must now be verified by the data center second,kamehameha temporarily waived application fees for its maui and big island campuses in order to induce more native hawaiians to apply for admission.third,kamehameha further increased the number of native hawaiians applying to its big island campus by allowing certain students,who had previously only been eligible for admission to its main campus in,to apply for admission at the big island campus fourth,kamehameha also ceased its preliminary screening for and big island applicants.
and fifth,kamehameha ceased using a minimum scoring threshold to evaluate applicants.since,kamehameha had required applicants to achieve a minimum composite score on an admissions test in order to be deemed qualified applicants.vicki viotti,kamehameha standards debated,honolulu advertiser,at.though that test was hardly an impediment to the school preference marked the first time in four decades that the school had space to admit a hawaiian did at least provide an objective way to measure the number of qualified native hawaiian applicants.by eliminating that test,however,kamehameha did away with that objective measure,while leaving in place kamehameha schools admissions policy to give preference to applicants of hawaiian ancestry to the extent permitted by law.kamehameha schools admissions office,main page,last visited.thus,because that policy provides no objective guidance whatsoever,kamehameha decision leaves it free to restrict admission solely to native hawaiian children,and as the trustees promised,kamehameha need never admit a hawaiian applicant again.this description is not meant to criticize kamehameha noble mission to help native hawaiians receive a quality education,but only to demonstrate that its current to the majority creative pose an absolute bar to the admittance of any hawaiian students.and,such bar violates section.
do no more than is necessary to correct a manifest imbalance 
similarly,i must dissent from the majority analysis under its third prong.under that prong,as modified by the majority,kamehameha admissions policy must do no more than is necessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered by students of native hawaiian ancestry.op.at.to hold that kamehameha admissions policy survives this factor,the majority asserts that kamehameha policy is both flexible and limited.id.at.as for the former,the majority finds that kamehameha admissions policy does not do more than is necessary because that policy is not fixed but changes as the capacity of the schools programs increases and as the of the native hawaiian community rises.op.at.the majority fails to provide any support for that conclusion,and that lack of support is far from surprising given that,as demonstrated above,kamehameha has only made its race based admissions program more rigid,see supra at.
the majority also finds that kamehameha admissions policy is limited in duration by the fact that if qualified students with native hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the school in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available,as happened in one recent year,the schools policy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate and the admissions policy will end when the current educational effects of past,private and discrimination and of social and economic deprivation end.op.at footnote omitted.because,as the majority candidly concedes,there are many more qualified students of hawaiian ancestry than there are available places at the schools,id.at,and kamehemeha altered its admissions criteria in response to what happened in one recent year,id.at,it is unclear whether kamehameha will ever admit another hawaiian student,let alone end its racially exclusive admissions policy.i can not understand how kamehameha policy can reasonably be described as limited in duration.
as kamehameha own trustees put it,our policy must remain in place until hawaiians are leading in scholastic achievement,until they are underrepresented in prisons and homeless shelters,until their is restored.trs.of kamehameha,kamehameha schools policy advocates social justice,honolulu advertiser.and,according to its website,kamehameha schools mission is to fulfill pauahi desire to create educational opportunities in perpetuity to improve the capability and of people of hawaiian ancestry.see kamehameha schools admissions office,main page,last visited.because such a perpetual use of race in admissions has no limit,i can not join the majority in holding that kamehameha admissions policy does no more than is necessary and therefore survives the modified third factor.
the supreme court has long warned that c lassifications of persons solely on the basis of race threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.shaw reno,d citations omitted.and as we have stated,programs must be designed to not upon nonculpable third parties.coral constr.king county,cir.nothing in the majority opinion reassures me that kamehameha has made that effort,and i must dissent from the majority analysis.
ii.congressional exemption of kamehameha from 
as an additional justification for its decision,the majority asserts that kamehameha policy does not violate because congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for native hawaiians from coverage.the majority,joined to some extent by judge fletcher concurrence,accomplishes this with three premises first,the majority reasons that because was enacted in,prior to the acquisition of hawaii,congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how would apply in hawaii.op.at.second,congress reenacted in.id.at.third,congress has passed legislation specifically affecting native hawaiians both before and after,and to read these acts consistently with the revised version of,we must read an exemption for native hawaiians into.id.at.indeed,according to the majority,this is the most plausible reading of.id.at.
each of the majority premises is either demonstrably wrong or utterly irrelevant.first,the majority claim that congress could not have had any conscious intention as to how would apply in hawaii is just plain wrong.op.at.as the majority observes,when congress first enacted as part of the civil rights act of,the hawaiian islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose people remained outside the jurisdiction of the united states.the united states did not annex hawaii until the.see op.at.it is clear,then,that congress could not have initially intended either to cover or to exempt native hawaiians from provisions.but nothing more can be gleaned from this fact.the majority reads a different point into this history that we do not know how congress intended to apply in hawaii.this is nonsensical and flies in the face of,among other things,itself,the hawaiian statehood act,the equal footing doctrine,and the supremacy clause.
hawaii and its citizens have been subject to since hawaii became a territory because applies to a ll persons within the jurisdiction of the united states,including every state and territory.a.congress reaffirmed this when hawaii became a state in and joined the union with all of the privileges and duties of all of the other states,that is,on an equal footing,as if it had joined the union at its founding.see alaska united states,d united states texas.as a new state,hawaii and its citizens became subject to all laws of the united states,including.see const.art.vi,cl.the constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby.this was made express in the hawaiian statehood act,which provided that the laws of the united states shall have the same force and effect within hawaii as elsewhere within the united states,stat.see also calkin cocke,how.benner porter,how.in other words,has long applied in hawaii and on exactly the same terms as it applies elsewhere within the united states.
second,building from its first faulty premise,the majority insists that was reenacted in.see op.at the amendments are the only time since hawaii became a state that congress has reenacted.emphasis added id.at congress reenacted in.id.at the statutory landscape informs us about what congress had in mind when it reenacted id.at congress reenacted in.see also conc.op.at in,congress revised and reenacted id.at when congress reenacted.it was.rather,was amended in by adding two provisions not one word of original text was touched by those amendments.indeed,every word that congress wrote in and that was codified in was there in when hawaii was annexed and in when hawaii became a still there.
in,congress amended in two respects it codified the court holding in runyon that applies to discrimination by private actors,see c,and it statutorily overruled the court holding in patterson mclean credit union,d,that does not extend to conduct,such as the imposition of discriminatory working conditions,see b see also jones donnelley sons,d in,congress responded to patterson by adding a new subsection to that defines the term make and enforce contracts to include the termination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship,pt.ii,at,code cong,subsection b overrules patterson by adding a new subsection to section subsection c is intended to codify runyon mccrary.the majority does not argue that either of those amendments exempted native hawaiians,and the amendments did not alter subsection a except to add the a and the heading,which continues to state that the protections of apply to a ll persons within the jurisdiction of the united states.there is absolutely no indication in the amendments or their legislative history that congress intended to exempt racial preferences for native hawaiians from broad coverage 
third,the majority points to a variety of other statutes that congress passed before and after which favor native hawaiians.see op.at see also conc.op.at.it is beyond dispute that congress has enacted numerous statutes providing separate benefit programs for native hawaiians,but nothing in those acts says anything about,much less exempts native hawaiians from its coverage.see,hawaiian homes commission act et,stat.setting aside approximately acres and establishing a program of loans and leases for the benefit of native hawaiians department of defense appropriations act,stat,in entering into contracts with private entities to carry out environmental restoration and remediation of island the secretary of the navy shall give especial preference to businesses owned by native hawaiians native hawaiian education act,et establishing programs to facilitate the education of native hawaiians and asserting a political relationship between the united states and the native hawaiian people native american graves protection and repatriation act,et extending protection to american indian and native hawaiian burial sites native hawaiian health care improvement act of,et creating a number of programs aimed at improving health care for native hawaiians and stating,t he authority of the congress under the united states constitution to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or indigenous peoples of the united states includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the native peoples of alaska and hawaii hawaiian homelands homeownership act of,stat,providing governmental loan guarantees to native hawaiian families who otherwise could not acquire housing financing national historic preservation act,stating that its purpose was to provide leadership in the preservation of the prehistoric and historic resources of the united states and of the international community of nations and in the administration of the national preservation program in partnership with states,indian tribes,native hawaiians,and local governments national museum of the american indian act,providing for the return of native hawaiian human remains and funerary objects as well as the creation of a museum exclusively for the preservation and study of the history and artifacts of native americans drug abuse prevention,treatment and rehabilitation act,d involving grant applications aimed at combating drug abuse and providing the secretary shall encourage the submission of and give special consideration to applications under this section to programs and projects aimed at underserved populations such as racial and ethnic minorities,native americans including native hawaiians and native american pacific islanders,youth,the elderly,women,handicapped individuals,and families of drug abusers.native american languages act,including native hawaiian languages in the ambit of native american languages accorded statutory protection workforce investment act of,a the purpose of this section is to support employment and training activities for indian,alaska native,and native hawaiian individuals american indian religious freedom act,i t shall be the policy of the united states to protect and preserve for american indians their inherent right of freedom to believe,express,and exercise the traditional religions of the american indian,eskimo,aleut,and native hawaiians,including but not limited to access to sites,use and possession of sacred objects,and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites.native american programs act of,including native hawaiians in a variety of native american financial and cultural benefit programs the purpose of this subchapter is to promote the goal of economic and social for american indians,native hawaiians,other native american pacific islanders including american samoan natives,and alaska natives.comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention,treatment,and rehabilitation act,c giving preference to grant applications aimed at combating drug abuse the secretary shall encourage the submission of and give special consideration to applications under this section for programs and projects aimed at underserved populations such as racial and ethnic minorities,native americans including native hawaiians and native american pacific islanders,youth,the elderly,women,handicapped individuals,public inebriates,and families of alcoholics.providing funding for native hawaiian and alaska native arts and cultural development older americans act of,et,establishing a program to meet the unique needs and circumstances of older hawaiian natives.
the scope of those enactments further underscores the fact that they could not have created a native hawaiian exemption from.take,for example,the amendments which both the majority and the concurrence point to as evidence that congress approved and exempted kamehameha admissions policy.op.at conc.op.at.those amendments direct the secretary of health and human services to make grants to the kamehameha pauahi bishop estate for a demonstration program to provide higher education fellowship assistance to native hawaiian students,tit.iv,a,stat.a directive to give kamehameha a grant for a demonstration program does not create an exemption from generally applicable civil rights laws furthermore,nothing in would be inconsistent with enforcement of in this case.in fact,it could not be since congress repealed the demonstration grant program before the sunset provision took effect,tit.iii,stat,and a current version of the act only mentions kamehameha in the findings of fact.
judge fletcher goes a step farther than the majority,arguing that the amendments and the public health service act specifically directed kamehameha schools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this case say is forbidden by.conc.op.at.i can not see how mak ing grants to kamehameha for a demonstration program to provide higher education fellowship assistance to native hawaiian students or provid ing funds to kamehameha for the purpose of providing scholarship assistance to eligible native hawaiian students constitutes a specific instruction from congress to kamehameha to apply a racially exclusive admissions policy.see conc.op.at quoting,tit.iv,a,stat.at formerly codified at a repealed and citing act of,stat,codified as amended at judge fletcher conclusion is especially baffling because congress never even mentioned kamehameha admissions policy in either piece of legislation,including the legislative history in fact,there is nothing in the congressional materials to even suggest that congress knew that kamehameha admissions policy was racially exclusive,let alone that congress endorsed it 
additionally,the majority points to a house committee report that favorably mentioned the bishop trust and exhorted the schools to redouble their efforts to provide for native hawaiians.op.at quoting i,at.a committee report,however,says nothing about how congress as a whole views kamehameha admission policy.this particular report is of no legislative value whatsoever because it does not even accompany an act in other words,the committee resolution does not even aspire to be legislative history.furthermore,a committee mere exhortation that kamehameha should redouble its efforts to provide for native hawaiians,does not,as the majority reasoning would have it,equal legislation,duly enacted,that kamehameha may continue to provide for native hawaiians,in violation of existing civil rights laws,if necessary.in fact,there is absolutely no evidence that either house of congress,or even any subset of its membership,knew alone approved absolute ban on hawaiian students.thus,the amendments and the house committee report do not operate as some kind of estoppel against applying generally applicable civil rights laws to native hawaiians generally or to kamehameha in particular.
finally,from this thin record,the majority concludes that the most plausible way to harmonize these acts with the reenactment of is to infer that congress intended that a preference for native hawaiians,in hawaii,by a native hawaiian organization,located on the hawaiian monarchy ancestral lands,be upheld.op.at.mere recitation of the conclusion should remind us of justice jackson restricted railroad ticket,good for this day and train only.smith allwright.jackson,dissenting.in any event,there is no need to harmonize these statutes because there is no inconsistency.a straightforward reading of does not render any other legislation,void,or superfluous.the fact that congress has passed some measures promoting native hawaiian education says nothing about whether congress intended to exempt native hawaiian schools from there is no legislative conflict to reconcile see morton mancari,d the courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.
unfortunately,the majority reasoning reaches far beyond kamehameha,and in finding that native hawaiian preferences are exempt from,the majority holds that by amending that statute in,congress narrowed the scope of one of our oldest and most enduring civil rights statutes.see op.at using the enactments outlined above to interpret the scope of.moreover,the majority focus on what congress may have been thinking ignores what congress actually did it passed,a law of general applicability.section,on its face,clearly does not create any exemptions for native hawaiians thus,whether or not congress meant to create such an again,there is absolutely no indication that it intended to do certainly did not create such an exception.williams babbitt,cir congress may well have thought that,by passing the reindeer industry act,it was effectively precluding anyone other than natives from entering the reindeer business.nevertheless,nothing in the act actually prohibits from entering the reindeer business.
to my mind,the disparate statutes favoring native hawaiians that the majority relies on demonstrate a different point altogether that when congress wishes to give native hawaiians special treatment,it knows how to do it is not shy about it.malabed slope borough,cir the existence of express preference programs created by congress supports our conclusion t hey show that when congress wants to authorize or require native american hiring preferences,it knows how to do so.dawavendewa salt river project agric.improvement power,cir the fact that congress now requires a narrowly defined set of contracts to honor local tribal preference policies not only fails to support the argument that it intended to accomplish that same objective in when passing title vii,but it suggests quite the opposite proposition.it shows us that when congress wishes to allow tribal preferences,it adopts an appropriate amendment to the applicable statute.williams,at t he total and perpetual exclusion of a majority of the population from a particular enterprise is the kind of significant feature we would normally expect congress to spell out if that were its intent.nothing in the statutory language or legislative history of even hints that congress wanted to exempt native hawaiian preferences from its provisions.finding an exemption here is beyond any accepted method of statutory interpretation 
if congress wishes to exempt preferences for native hawaiians from,it may do so.until then,however,we ought to apply the law as written.and as written,clearly encompasses kamehameha racially exclusive admissions policy.
iii.native hawaiians,mancari,and the special relationship doctrine 
judge fletcher raises an interesting variation on the last argument.like the majority,the concurrence concludes that racial preferences on behalf of native hawaiians are exempt from.however,judge fletcher arrives at this result via a slightly different route first,he reasons that native hawaiian status is both a political and a racial classification.conc.op.at.he then suggests that,under the special relationship doctrine,congress has given native hawaiians special benefits based on their political status.id.at.from that,judge fletcher then postulates that because congress has given native hawaiians special benefits,it could not have intended to prohibit private parties from doing the exact same thing.id.at.thus,according to the concurrence,which prohibits racial preferences in private contracts,must be read to exempt preferences on behalf of native hawaiians.id.at.
to establish his beginning premises,judge fletcher must rely on morton mancari,d,which created the special relationship doctrine.in mancari,the supreme court held that the bureau of indian affairs bia hiring preference for native americans did not constitute racial discrimination.at.instead,the court wrote that the preference was not directed towards a racial group consisting of indians instead,it applies only to members of federally recognized tribes.id.at.the court concluded that this preference was therefore not a racial preference at all,but instead a political preference,and applied rational basis scrutiny.id.judge fletcher would conclude that,under mancari,congress has the power to exempt private parties racial preferences in favor of native hawaiians from the purview of.conc.op.at.
before discussing the merits of the concurrence reasoning,i note that kamehameha did not make this argument on appeal,and it was not briefed by either party.kamehameha did argue,as the majority concludes,that preferences in favor of native hawaiians are exempt from however,it did not base its argument on the special trust doctrine espoused in mancari.in fact,kamehameha brief does not even cite mancari because arguments not made in a party appellate brief are waived,see blanford sacramento county,cir paladin.power,cir,it is improper for the court to even consider the argument raised by judge fletcher.
nonetheless,turning to the merits,judge fletcher argument puts more weight on mancari than it can bear.as i explain in greater detail below,the exception in mancari is an exceedingly narrow one,limited to preferences that are political not racial.second,mancari special relationship works only in those cases where congress has formally recognized the sovereignty of native american tribes.despite opportunity to do so,congress has never formally recognized the sovereignty of native hawaiians.third,even if congress had recognized native hawaiians as a sovereign body,the special relationship doctrine applies only to preferences by the federal government or by the tribes themselves.it does not apply to private parties discriminating on the basis of tribal status indeed,we have been quite clear that such private racial discrimination remains illegal.
first,judge fletcher agrees with the majority that native hawaiians is a racial classification.conc.op.at see op.at.but judge fletcher goes one step further,suggesting that native hawaiians is not merely a racial classification,but also a political classification.id.at.if judge fletcher is correct,this case,from the outset,does not come within the special relationship doctrine of morton mancari because mancari denied the very premise from which the concurring opinion proceeds.for instance,mancari held that the bia native american hiring preference does not constitute racial discrimination.at.indeed,it is not even a racial preference.id.as the court explained 
the preference,as applied,is granted to indians not as a discrete racial group,but,rather,as members of tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the bia in a unique fashion.in the sense that there is no other group of people favored in this manner,the legal status of the bia is truly sui generis.
at.citation omitted.moreover,in concluding that the preference was political and not racial,the court relied on the fact that the beneficiaries were members of federally recognized tribes 
the preference is not directed towards a racial group consisting of indians instead,it applies only to members of federally recognized tribes.this operates to exclude many individuals who are racially to be classified as indians.in this sense,the preference is political rather than racial in nature.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court explained in rice cayetano,a lthough the classification in mancari had a racial component,the court found it important that the preference was not directed towards a racial group consisting of indians,but rather only to members of federally recognized tribes.in this sense,the court held,the preference was political rather than racial in nature,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
here,judge fletcher agrees that,whatever else kamehameha admissions policy may be,it is a racial classification.this fact places kamehameha policy outside the scope of mancari holding.the distinction is critical,because if a preference for native hawaiians were only political and not racial,then,by its own terms,would not apply.no exemption from would be necessary.see sagana tenorio,cir t he guarantee that all persons may enjoy the same rights that white citizens enjoy does not protect against discrimination on the basis of political affiliation.keating carey,cir in light of the court interpretation,the legislative history,and the express language of the statute,we hold that,however generously construed,does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of political affiliation.
further,mancari was premised on actual federal recognition of native american tribes.see,at.emphasizing the bia control over the lives and destinies of the federally recognized indian tribes emphasis added id.at.resolution of the instant issue turns on the unique legal status of indian tribes under federal law and upon the plenary power of congress,based on a history of treaties and the assumption of a status,to legislate on behalf of federally recognized indian tribes.emphasis added id.at.the preference is not directed towards a racial group consisting of indians instead,it applies only to members of federally recognized tribes.emphasis added see also rice,at.
native hawaiians have never been accorded formal recognition as a native american tribe and while the special trust relationship between congress and native hawaiians bears many similarities to the relationship between congress and native american tribes,the two relationships are not identical.and,as we recently acknowledged,absent federal recognition,tribes do not enjoy the same status,rights,and privileges accorded federally recognized tribes.kahawaiolaa norton,cir.in fact,congress has passed many statutes benefitting native american tribes that do not include native hawaiians,or which distinguish them from native american tribes.see,indian and education assistance act,et defining an indian as a person who is a member of a federally recognized indian tribe,defining native american as of,or relating to,a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous to the united states and native hawaiian,by contrast,as any individual who is a descendant of the aboriginal people who,prior to,occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now constitutes the state of hawaii.see also kahawaiolaa,at f ederal benefits and entitlements for native hawaiians are different from those afforded federally recognized indian tribes id.congress,because of the unique history of hawaii,has excluded native hawaiians from some statutes id.m any statutes distinguish between native hawaiians and members of indian tribes.
we can not usurp congress power to grant or not grant formal recognition to native hawaiians by simply declaring that the comparable status of native hawaiians,d,gives them tribal status.congress has created a discrete process for recognizing indian tribes as tribes.see indian reorganization act,et see also et.department of interior regulations.formal recognition as a tribe comes with a bundle of privileges,including,tribal courts,control of indian lands,and the power to tax.see,merrion jicarilla apache tribe,d montana united states,d santa clara pueblo martinez,d.none of these privileges have yet been afforded to native hawaiians,a judgment we recently upheld in kahawaiolaa norton.as we concluded there,in the end,we must commit this question to congress to apply its wisdom in deciding whether or not native hawaiians should be included among those eligible to apply for federal tribal recognition.at 
finally,even if congress had formally recognized native hawaiians,mancari special status doctrine would still not benefit kamehameha because that doctrine does not apply to private parties.mancari approved a native american hiring preference adopted by the bia because of the tribes capacity as s.mancari,at.see also iowa mut.ins.laplante,d fisher dist,d.the special relationship recognized in mancari was a relationship that congress has the power to regulate by virtue of the indian commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,and the treaty clause,id.art.ii,cl,which has often been the source of the government power to deal with the indian tribes.mancari,at.see also united states lara,d.thus,private parties may not seek refuge in mancari special relationship doctrine.the strong loyalty of native a private school established by a private trust,and not a recognized means of native hawaiian.
judge fletcher concurrence misses this point entirely when it asserts that congress may,if it wishes,permit kamehameha schools to give preferential admission treatment to native hawaiians.conc.op.at judge fletcher does not cite a single case where a court has upheld a private preference for native american tribal members under the special relationship doctrine.in fact,we have soundly rejected exactly that argument.in dawavendewa salt river project agricultural improvement and power district,cir,pursuant to an agreement with the navajo tribe,an arizona corporation sought to discriminate in employment by favoring members of the navajo tribe.dawavendewa,a member of the hopi tribe,filed a title vii claim alleging national origin discrimination.the defendants argued that,based on mancari,preferences based on tribal affiliation are based on political affiliation rather than national origin and are thus outside the realm of title vii.id.at.citing the unique interest the bia had in employing native americans,that had led the court to recognize a limited exception for congress,we held that the plaintiff had alleged a violation of title vii.id.at.
we have even rejected attempts to extend mancari exception to other governmental entities.in malabed north slope borough,cir,a local government adopted an ordinance that gave an employment preference to native americans,defined as members of federally recognized indian tribes.plaintiffs challenged the ordinance under the equal protection guarantee of the alaska constitution.the borough attempted to justify its ordinance by relying on mancari.citing rice,we limited mancari political exception to congress dealings with federally recognized native american tribes and invalidated the ordinance.see id.at mancari held only that when congress acts to fulfill its unique trust responsibilities toward indian tribes,such legislation is not based on a suspect classification.emphasis added.other courts have taken a similar approach.see,tafoya city of albuquerque,as the supreme court so clearly stated in morton,congress obligations to indians are constitutionally based and unique.the city of albuquerque does not have comparable power to treat members of federally recognized indian tribes or pueblos or members of the navajo nation differently than other groups of indians or.id.at the albuquerque city council has considerably less power than the united states congress to pass law discriminating in favor of members of federally recognized indian tribes and pueblos.in this respect,the rationale in morton is inapplicable to this case.see also rice,at.refusing to extend mancari to state elections privileging native hawaiians the elections for oha trustee are elections of the state,not a separate quasi sovereign.
mancari may not even extend to native american preferences in hiring by other federal agencies.the court holding in mancari relied on the fact that the preference applies only to employment in the indian service,an agency that the court described as sui generis.at.the court specifically did not consider the obviously more difficult question that would be presented by a blanket exemption for indians from all civil service examinations.see also rice,at.noting that mancari was confined to the authority of the bia,an agency described as sui generis dawavendewa,at similar.we have previously limited the scope of mancari in this fashion.in williams babbitt,cir,for example,we considered whether the reindeer industry act limited ownership of reindeer to native alaskans and whether such a limitation would be constitutional.the act defenders attempted to justify it under the court holding in mancari.we rejected this argument,holding that the power granted congress under mancari exception was of a far narrower scope.see id.at the preference at issue in mancari only applied to the bia,an agency created for the purpose of serving indians.id.at w e can discern mancari scope by looking to the cases it cited as examples of permissible special treatment for indians.each case dealt with life in the immediate vicinity of indian land.citations omitted id.at while mancari is not necessarily limited to statutes that give special treatment to indians on indian land,we do read it as shielding only those statutes that affect uniquely indian interests.id.w e seriously doubt that congress could give indians a complete monopoly on the casino industry or on space shuttle contracts.
in sum,mancari does not support judge fletcher claim that kamehameha admissions policy is justified because it is both a racial and political classification.judge fletcher rationale would render mancari unrecognizable.indeed,as with the exclusive native hawaiian voting scheme rejected by the supreme court in rice,if kamehameha racially exclusive admissions policy were to be sustained under mancari we would be required to accept some beginning premises not yet established in our case law these propositions would raise questions of considerable moment and difficulty.at.
iv.conclusion 
as noble as kamehameha goals may be,i can not reconcile its admissions racially exclusive policy that operates as a complete bar to all applicants who are not of the preferred the supreme court requirements for a valid affirmative action plan.i can not reconcile kamehameha admissions policy with the plain commands of,nor can i find any evidence whatsoever that congress exempted kamehameha from altogether.the majority exempts an organization with noble goals that seeks to remedy a significant problem in a community that is in great need,but it can do so only because the majority departs from clear principles and established precedent.
i respectfully dissent.
this is altogether infelicitous.
on the one hand,the kamehameha schools is a,private school,established before hawaii became a state,whose primary mission has been to educate native hawaiian students in a culturally sensitive,challenging way.it receives no federal funds and does not operate for profit.its purpose of providing meaningful access to educational opportunity is intuitively salutary.on the other hand,the admissions policy of the kamehameha schools prefers students of native hawaiian ancestry in such a way that,as a practical matter,hawaiian students are precluded.
the question is whether kamehameha admissions policy violates.section was originally enacted as part of the civil rights act,and confers on a ll persons the same right in every state to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens 
we do not write on a clean slate,otherwise i would question how a statute that accords to all persons the same right to contract as is enjoyed by white citizens can mean the same right to contract as is enjoyed by native hawaiians.yet it was held long ago that applies to persons of any race,mcdonald santa fe trail transp,d,and more recently,that native hawaiian ancestry can be a proxy for race,rice cayetano,d likewise,i would have difficulty understanding how applies to a purely private,educational institution.however,it was also held long ago that applies to private transactions,tillman recreation,d,including to contracts for educational services runyon mccrary,d but see jones alfred mayer,d harlan,dissenting from application of the to private discrimination in the sale or rental of property runyon,at.white,dissenting.finally,because education is the greatest inheritance of all,i have difficulty understanding what business it is of the federal government to tell a native hawaiian that she ca choose to help other native hawaiians whom she believes particularly need it.
this said,i am not persuaded that precedent allows the kamehameha schools to justify its preferential admissions policy on the footing that the policy redresses past societal discrimination against native hawaiians.the majority and dissenting opinions agree that we are guided by title vii standards i agree with judge bybee that when,as here,a voluntary,private,affirmative action plan is at issue,the test is whether it eliminates a manifest racial imbalance,does not unnecessarily trammel the rights of groups or create an absolute bar to their advancement,and makes adjustments that do no more than necessary to obtain a racial balance.united steelworkers of america weber,d see rudebusch hughes,cir breaking the weber standard into these three factors.
obviously,the kamehameha schools itself has never discriminated against native hawaiians it is dedicated to serving them.thus,the articulated justification for its admissions policy is to remedy external discrimination,not internal imbalance.even if a private educational enterprise has more wiggle room in defining its core mission in a way than a private employer,to legitimate a racebased policy solely on account of discrimination by others is to put no bounds on it at all.to do so would render meaningless the factors that influenced the supreme court in weber to approve a voluntary,private,affirmative action plan.at.a private entity progress toward achieving balance can not realistically be assessed if measured against society as a whole rather than its own work force or its own student body.but,even if a private party should be able to assume a public responsibility for remediation of past societal discrimination,the acceptable goal of a admissions policy for a public educational institution is to achieve a diverse student body.grutter,at.endorsing the view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in public university admissions.the purpose of kamehameha schools and its admissions policy is,of course,just the opposite.that,in a nutshell,is why i feel bound to reverse.
beyond this,i agree with judge bybee that congressional applause for programs that benefit native hawaiians neither connotes approval of an exclusionary admissions policy based on racial preference,nor grafts an exception onto.i also agree that morton mancari,d,does not save the kamehameha policy.mancari involved a federal employment preference for persons of tribal ancestry that the court upheld against a fifth amendment challenge because tribes,which are,are a political,rather than a racial,classification.at.however,the court has since declined to extend mancari to an hawaii statutory scheme that restricted voting for certain state officials to those of native hawaiian ancestry.rice,at.
as no other basis appears for affirming,i would reverse.
i agree in large part with judge bybee dissent and join in parts ii and iii.his analysis of the majority and concurring opinions is in my view correct.
i write separately because i do not agree with judge bybee view that title vii provides the standard of review in this case.title vii prohibits discrimination in employment this case does not involve employment.title vii has nothing to do with exclusion of students from schools because of race.nor is there a need to mine title vii for some sort of analogy 
the recent supreme court decisions about affirmative action,and gratz also have nothing to do with this case.those cases involved whether racial discrimination by public schools under affirmative action plans violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.this case does not involve a public school or state action,so grutter,gratz,and the equal protection clause do not come into the analysis.
we are not free to treat hawaiian ancestry as a political rather than racial designation under morton because the supreme court held in rice cayetano that hawaiian ancestry is a racial classification.if congress chooses to define persons of native hawaiian ancestry as indians under or some other provision,perhaps it can but it has not.
this case is considerably simpler.in practice,kamehameha schools excludes students who do not have native hawaiian ancestry.the kamehameha schools are admirable in many ways,and there are good historical and social reasons why reasonable people might want to follow just such a policy.but we are not free to make a social judgment about what is best for hawaiians.we are stuck with a case that is before us in our capacity as judges and we have to follow the law.
the law we have to follow was laid down by the supreme court in runyon mccrary runyon holds that the civil rights act of,prohibits a private school from denying admission to prospective students because of their race it might have been thought that runyon prohibited discrimination only against black people,but we are not free to interpret it that way.in mcdonald santa fe trail transportation,the supreme court decided that the statute construed in runyon,protects whites as well as from discrimination a fortiori it protects all the ethnic groups in hawaii blacks,american samoans,and all the others,regardless of their ancestry.
in my view,that is the end of the analysis.i might have preferred to avoid deciding this case,if some jurisdictional defect existed.but we do have jurisdiction.employment law,indian law,our admiration for kamehameha schools,and our sentiments about public policy are irrelevant.
i respectfully dissent.
i join all three of my dissenting colleagues.judges rymer,kleinfeld and bybee have catalogued eloquently the many reasons why neither the majority nor the concurrence reflects what the law is,or should be,and there nothing i can add on that score.
i write only to point out that the issue we are called on to decide may be a problem of the schools own making.runyon mccrary,d,and mcdonald santa fe trail transportation,d,prohibit private racial discrimination in the making and enforcing of contracts.the provision is implicated here because the schools charge tuition and must therefore enter into a contractual relationship with each student.i do believe section would apply at all if the schools were run entirely as a philanthropic enterprise and allowed students to attend for free.in runyon,the racial exclusion practiced by the schools amount ed to a classic violation of,because t he parents sought to enter into contractual relationships with the schools for educational services.at.the court emphasized the commercial nature of the relationship under those contractual relationships,the schools would have received payments for services rendered,and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments.id.i have found no case where section has been applied to a charity.were the schools to forego charging tuition,their relationship to their students would probably not be deemed contractual as that term is used in section and runyon.
being able to charge tuition is,of course,not inconsequential.for most private schools it is a proposition.but it may not be so for the kamehameha schools,which were set up primarily as eleemosynary institutions.the tuition they charge reflects only a small fraction of their operating costs and,even then,most students pay a reduced tuition,or no tuition at all.see op.at.the schools substantial endowment may enable them to continue operating without charging any tuition for a very long indefinitely.
given the scores of pages we have written on both sides of this issue,it should be clear that the question is close and ours may not be the last word.given the passions this case has aroused,see op.at,it worth noting that what really at stake may not be the operation of the kamehameha schools along their traditional preferential model,but merely a few million dollars a year the schools now get from their own students.
doe kamehameha sch.bernice pauahi bishop estate,cir,reh g en banc granted,cir.
this general information simply sets the stage for our more particular consideration of the educational status of native hawaiian children.

the kamehameha schools are,rather than commercial.but,because the schools charge tuition albeit at a rate that represents only a fraction of the cost to educate students,the exchange of payments for instruction exists here,as it did in runyon.we need not and do not decide whether would apply if the schools charged no tuition at all,but simply donated education to native hawaiian addition,for the purposes of our decision,we accept that native hawaiian like negro is a racial classification.see rice cayetano,d so holding in the context of a voting rights case.

rudebusch did not include the requirement that the manifest imbalance be present in a job category that was traditionally segregated in its statement of the title vii test.see at.however,all of the cases we cited in rudebusch to support the manifest imbalance factor included the traditional segregated job category requirement in their statement of the test.see johnson,at.weber,at.higgins city of vallejo,cir.rudebusch gives no indication that it intentionally excluded this aspect of the requirement,and the defendant did not argue that this requirement had not been met.thus,i do not believe that rudebusch loosened the requirement that a job category must be traditionally segregated before an affirmative action plan is permissible.
we have considered the validity of affirmative action plans in a wide variety of contexts,and we have always applied the same title vii standard.see,officers for justice civil serv.comm n,cir evaluating a police examination scoring regime designed to promote a higher percentage of minority officers under an unmodified title vii standard higgins city of vallejo,cir evaluating a fire department affirmative action program under an unmodified title vii standard la riviere eeoc,cir holding that affirmative action plans by public employers should be subjected to an unmodified title vii standard,and evaluating a california highway patrol affirmative action program under that standard see also gilligan dep t of labor,cir discussing an affirmative action program at the department of labor and stating that the test of its validity is an unmodified title vii standard.indeed,we have also ruled in multiple title vii cases involving affirmative action practices at educational institutions,and we have never even suggested that conduct by such institutions might be subjected to a different standard.see,rudebusch,considering a university equity pay adjustment under title vii standards for affirmative action programs cerrato cmty.coll,cir affirming a district court judgment dismissing a claim,brought by a professor who was passed over for the position of dean,that challenged the district affirmative action policy under an unmodified title vii standard.
the majority reference to the first amendment roots of educational autonomy,see op.at,is misleading since the supreme court has consistently rejected first amendment interests as a justification for racial discrimination.see,runyon,at.holding that while,it may be assumed that parents have a first amendment right to send their children to educational institutions that promote racial discrimination,it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities from such institutions is also protected by the same principle norwood harrison,d holding,i nvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising freedom of association protected by the first amendment,but it has never been accorded affirmative constitutional protections see also hishon king spalding,d noting that under the first amendment,t here is no constitutional right,for example,to discriminate in the selection of who may attend a private school or join a labor union.
it is not entirely clear what constitutes the relevant community under the majority new test,but it appears the majority means the state where the affirmative action program has been adopted.see op.at.for instance,in announcing its new test,the majority maintains that the relevant population is the community as a whole,but when the majority applies that test,it appears that,t he relevant community in this case is the state of hawaii,id.at.
whereas the majority justifies neither purge,the second modification is particularly puzzling given the majority re
