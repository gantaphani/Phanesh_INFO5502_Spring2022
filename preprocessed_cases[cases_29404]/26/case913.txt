are high school diploma programs for adults who never graduated from high school a form of public education a b i.we conclude that they are.accordingly,we hold that a hawaii statute establishing an age limit on public education violates federal law,and reverse in part the district court entry of judgment in favor of the defendant appellee.
background 
in,the hawaii state legislature enacted a law,dubbed act,barring students from attending public school after the last day of the school year in which they turned 
no person who is twenty years of age or over on the first instructional day of the school year shall be eligible to attend a public school.if a person reaches twenty years of age after the first instructional day of the school year,the person shall be eligible to attend public school for the full school year.
c.the law applies to both students and students who receive specialeducation services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.
the state of hawaii department of education doe administers public education in the state.in addition to conventional public high schools,the agency operates a network of schools called the community schools for adults.doe materials explain that the community schools for adults offer adult secondary education in the form of opportunities for adults and youth to earn a high school diploma.the doe offers two diploma programs the general education development ged program and the competency based program cb.
the ged program prepares students to take the ged test,a national standardized high school equivalency exam.students who achieve adequate scores on the ged test qualify for a high school diploma if they have also completed at least one semester of high school work at either an accredited high school in hawaii or a community school for adults.a high school diploma earned via the ged program permits students to seek admission to the university of hawaii system.
the cb program is a program designed to help students become functionally literate adults productive and contributing members effective family members and productive workers.the program emphasizes skills like household finance,civic participation,and health maintenance.to obtain a high school diploma in the cb program,students must complete all five cb courses,earn adequate scores on the various cb exams,and complete at least one career goal,such as finding a job or completing one credit of work at an accredited postsecondary institution.
the community schools for adults are exempt from the strictures of act.both the ged and cb programs are open to any student or older who lacks a high school diploma 
these adult education programs have sparked litigation because they do not offer idea services to disabled students.students who require services to participate in the classroom can not pursue diplomas in the community schools for adults after aging out of public education under act.but students without special needs can and do transition directly from hawaii public high schools to the community schools for adults 
soon after act became law,four disabled students and their parents,together with the hawaii disability rights center,filed a complaint in federal district court.the complaint asserted claims under the idea,the americans with disabilities act ada,and the rehabilitation act,as well as an estoppel claim.the idea claim alleged that act violated federal law by denying public education to students aged to while offering it,in the form of the community schools for adults,to students without special needs.the claims under the ada and rehabilitation act alleged that the doe exclusion of disabled students from adult education constituted disability discrimination under those statutes.the estoppel claim is not at issue in this appeal.
the district court certified a class consisting of all hawaiian students entitled to services but made ineligible for public education by act.the plaintiffs and the doe filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the doe on the estoppel claim,but denied summary judgment to both parties on the remaining claims.
the parties then tried the case in a bench trial.after trial,the district court ruled for the doe on all three claims at issue.on the idea claim,the court held that act was consistent with federal law because the community schools for adults did not provide the equivalent of a secondary school education to general education students,and because the doe had no systemic practice of offering the same or equivalent education to general education students who have aged out while eliminating education services for special education students.on the ada and rehabilitation act claims,the court held that the plaintiffs had made a prima facie case of disability discrimination,but did not meet their burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow disabled students to benefit meaningfully from the adult schools.the timely appealed.
idea claim.
we first must decide whether act runs afoul of the idea,which restricts the power of states to establish age limits on eligibility in certain circumstances.we hold that it does.
the idea requires states to provide a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities residing in the state between the ages of and,inclusive.a a.as a result,a student eligibility for idea services ordinarily ends on his birthday.see unified sch.dist.garcia,cir.the statute creates an exception to the age limit,however.a state duty to provide special education to children with disabilities does not extend to children aged through or through to the extent that the duty application to those children would be inconsistent with state law or practice,or the order of any court,respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges.a b i.
we have never interpreted this exception to the idea default age limit,and the text is not completely pellucid.what does it mean for the idea application to students aged to to be inconsistent with state law or practice respecting the provision of public education in a state id.the corresponding federal regulations are little help,as they simply reiterate the statutory language in nearly identical terms 
the obligation to make a free and appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to c hildren aged,or in a state to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with state law or practice respecting the provision of public education to children of those ages.
happily,the idea legislative history sheds some light on the exception meaning.see jonah carmona,cir if the statute terms are ambiguous,we may use canons of construction,legislative history,and the statute overall purpose to illuminate congress intent.the senate report accompanying the that created the exception explains that states are free to elect not to provide special education to disabled students between and,but only if they also elect not to provide free public education to nondisabled students 
this exception with respect to handicapped children aged three to five and aged eighteen to,inclusive in a b i is intended to exempt states from the provisions of this act establishing a timetable for providing a free appropriate public education in these age groups in the following circumstances 
where a state does not in fact provide or assure the provision of free public education to handicapped children in these age groups 
this exception shall not apply in the following circumstances 
where a state does now in fact provide or assure the provision of free public education to children in these age groups 
in light of this legislative history,we interpret a b i to mean that hawaii can not deny special education to disabled students aged through if it in fact provides free public education to nondisabled students in that range of ages.
the fate of act comes down to whether the diploma programs offered by the community schools for adults constitute free public education.act makes some year old and all year old students ineligible for public education in hawaii.for disabled students,the act functions as an age limit on eligibility for idea services.argues that by providing the ged and cb programs to nondisabled and year olds,hawaii offers public education on unequal terms.the doe rejoins that the ged and cb programs are not free public education as the idea uses that term,so making them available to nondisabled and year olds does not beget a concomitant obligation to publicly educate disabled students of the same ages.
to determine whether the programs are free public education,we naturally begin with the text of the idea.see dzyuba mukasey,cir w e construe the meaning of a given word by reference to the context of a particular statutory regime.see also brown gardner,d t here is a presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute.the idea does not offer a statutory definition of free public education,but it does explicitly define the closely related phrase free appropriate public education as special education and related services that 
a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge 
b meet the standards of the state educational agency 
c include an appropriate preschool,elementary school,or secondary school education in the state involved and 
d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section d of this title.
once we strip out those aspects of this definition that clearly relate to the education appropriateness,as opposed to its free and public character,we are left with a reliable index of what free public education means in a b i.the second and fourth criteria seem to delineate an education appropriateness.surely an education can be both free and public even if it is inappropriate because it fails to meet state standards or to conform with an individualized education program.we are left with a bipartite definition a free public education is one that is provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge and involves preschool,elementary,or secondary education.
the first prong of this definition is consistent with the plain meaning of free public education.a public institution is one that is accessible to all members of the community and which provid es services to the people under some degree of civic or state control.webster third new international dictionary.free means without charge.id.at.the second prong of the definition that free public education means preschool,elementary,or secondary education is not apparent from the plain meaning of the phrase,but is derived from the idea limited scope.because the idea applies only to preschool,elementary,or secondary education,see,we do not think a b i refers to public education outside those same categories.
the ged and cb programs clearly satisfy the first prong of the definition.the district court found,and neither party disputes,that the community schools for adults are provided at public expense and are free to students.nor does the doe deny that the schools operate under its supervision and direction as a public agency.
the ged and cb programs also satisfy the second prong because they are programs of secondary school education.the doe own officers acknowledge that the ged and cb high school diploma programs are designed to ensure that the graduates are prepared for transitions to post secondary education.if students are only able to pursue postsecondary education after they earn a high school diploma in the ged or cb programs,it stands to reason that those programs constitute secondary education.the record is replete with additional evidence that the doe considers the ged and cb programs to offer a secondary education for adults.a section of the doe website,titled what are community schools for adults,enumerates the wide variety of courses offered by the adult schools.the second item reads secondary education courses to complete your high school graduation requirements.the doe characterization of the adult school programs comports with the view that high school diploma programs are quintessentially secondary education,whether they are offered to teenagers or adults,describing the purpose of the adult education and family literacy act of as assist ing adults in the completion of a secondary school education see also id.a noting that an institution of higher education is one that provide s a program of education beyond secondary education and only accepts students with diplomas.
our conclusion that the ged and cb programs are a form of public secondary education is buttressed by the fact that the community schools for adults meet the idea definition of secondary school.the idea defines secondary school as a 
nonprofit institutional day or residential school,including a public secondary charter school,that provides secondary education,as determined under state law,except that it does not include any education beyond grade.
id.the record establishes that the community schools for adults are nonprofit day schools that do not educate students beyond grade only students who never graduated from twelfth grade can pursue a ged or cb diploma.and to the extent that hawaii law substantively defines secondary education at all,the ged and cb programs seem to qualify.the state statute defining the scope of adult and community education programs offered in hawaii states that instructional programs shall be initiated in various fields,including a program of secondary education for those adults who,in youth,left school or for some reason had their education curtailed and who now desire to continue their education.the ged and cb programs obviously fulfill this legislative mandate 
we are therefore persuaded that the community schools for adults offer secondary education and hence that the state offers free public education to nondisabled students over and under.
the doe makes three arguments that,in spite of the statutory text,the community schools for adults do not in fact offer free public education.first,the doe urges us to distinguish conventional or traditional secondary education offered in hawaiian high schools from the less demanding ged and cb programs.to earn an ordinary high school diploma,the doe points out,students must accumulate credit hours in various academic subjects.the ged and cb diploma programs are structured differently.the ged program consists of a series of targeted preparatory courses in the ged examination subjects,and the cb program is largely nonacademic,focusing instead on personal and vocational skill development.the differences extend to postsecondary opportunities.both the university of hawaii system and the military,for instance,favor students with conventional high school diplomas over students with the ged diploma.
the doe urges that the differences between conventional high schools in hawaii and the community schools for adults are so substantial that both school systems can not offer secondary education.the district court made much the same argument when it entered judgment in the doe favor the district court held that the ged and cb programs do not provide the equivalent of a secondary school education because the educational curriculum,requirements,and experience of the adult programs are dramatically different from those of a traditional public high school.
nothing in the idea,however,supports the proposition that a program constitutes secondary education or free public education only if it is structurally identical to the ordinary public high school curriculum offered to nondisabled students.the doe brief cites no cases or statute in support of the interpretation it proposes.instead,the doe asks us to contrive an atextual distinction between authentic and ersatz secondary education and impose it on the statutory text.it is particularly unlikely that the idea definitions incorporate such a distinction because,as we have noted,the statute construes education broadly.see the term special education means specially designed instruction,at no cost to parents,to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,including instruction conducted in t
