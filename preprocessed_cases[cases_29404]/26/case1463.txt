plaintiffs,the california association of private special education schools the association and the poseidon school the school,appeal from a judgment of dismissal after the demurrers of defendants,the california department of education the department and superintendent of public instruction jack,were sustained without leave to amend.plaintiffs contend the superintendent of public instruction the superintendent may not suspend or revoke the certification of a nonpublic,nonsectarian school providing educational services to disabled children without providing a hearing with proper notice before any adverse administrative action is taken.we hold education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section on their face do not violate plaintiffs due process rights.further,the second amended complaint does not sufficiently specifically allege the existence of an actual present controversy to permit resolution of an as applied challenge to education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section.finally,we conclude the foregoing statute and regulation are not subject to the requirements for emergency administrative decisions specified in government code section et.
ii.procedural background 
the initial complaint was filed on may.the department and various defendants,which included the former superintendent of public instruction,delaine eastin,answered the original complaint on september.superintendent was not named in the initial complaint.on april,various defendants,including the department and former superintendent eastin,moved for judgment on the pleadings as to the fourth,seventh,and eighth causes of action.before the trial court ruled on the judgment on the pleadings motion,the parties settled the seventh and eighth causes of action.as to the fourth cause of action,the judgment on the pleadings motion was granted with days leave to amend.
on july,the first amended complaint was filed.various defendant were named,including the department and superintendent.however,on august,plaintiffs filed a dismissal request as to all of the defendants,except for the department and superintendent.also,plaintiffs dismissed the second,third,seventh,and eighth causes of action.on august,defendants demurred to the first amended complaint.on september,the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.on october,plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint.on november,defendants demurred to the second amended complaint.also,defendants moved to strike portions of the second amended complaint.on december,the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend and the motion to strike was placed off calendar.on january,a judgment of dismissal was entered.on march,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.
iii.second amended complaint allegations 
the second amended complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief.the association is a nonprofit corporation that represents schools which have been certified by the department.member schools have had their certifications suspended or revoked without prior notice or hearing.the school was certified by the department as a nonpublic,nonsectarian school and is an association member.the school certification was scheduled to expire in december.the school provides education for average to above average students who have problems in other learning environments.the school has to students most of whom are seriously emotionally disturbed or present misbehavior problems.the school has been successful and its innovative programs have been widely adopted in both public and private schools.according to the second amended complaint,the school is adversely affected by the department practices.the school had problems with the department in connection with certification issues in the past.the department had changed the school certification in the past without prior notice or an opportunity for hearing.but the second amended complaint alleged that the school was uncertain of its rights in the event certification issues arose in the future.
the second amended complaint alleged that in education code sections,subdivision e and,subdivision m were adopted and required that the department promulgate regulations concerning certification of nonpublic,nonsectarian schools.the department adopted regulations,which were filed with the secretary of state on september.nonpublic,nonsectarian schools are statutorily recognized in education code section as one component in the continuum of educational services that must be made available to disabled children.education code section,subdivision a authorizes public education agencies to contract with nonpublic,nonsectarian schools to provide special education facilities and instruction to children with exceptional needs.this may be done when no appropriate public education program is available and the nonpublic,nonsectarian school is certified by the department.pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c,there are three classes of certification of nonpublic,nonsectarian schools certified conditionally certified or suspended.section,subdivision e provides that conditional certification is available when an application for certification is initially acted upon by the department.also,a nonpublic,nonsectarian school may be conditionally certified when the department fails to act on a certification application within days of its filing,subd.f.
once a nonpublic,nonsectarian school is certified,it may lose its certification only in the case of good cause as specified in education code section.if the superintendent suspends the certification,the school may continue to operate but may not accept new students.by contrast,a revocation order prevents nonpublic,nonsectarian schools from entering into contracts with public agencies bars the acceptance of new students and precludes the nonpublic,nonsectarian school from continuing to serve children placed by public agencies.
education code section provides that a petition to review the superintendent decision may be filed within working days following a nonpublic,nonsectarian school receipt of a suspension or revocation notice.california code of regulations,title,section states the office of administrative hearings of the department of general services provides three possible types of review of a suspension or revocation order a written review of documents provided by the nonpublic,nonsectarian school and the department a written review with oral argument or an oral hearing with testimony and of witnesses.within days after the submission of all materials,the office of administrative hearings issues a final administrative decision.
according to the second amended complaint,the policy of the department and the superintendent is as follows defendants have implemented and applied the statutory and regulatory scheme to provide that the superintendent decision is immediately effective and that the notice and an opportunity for a hearing occurs only thereafter.therefore,in suspending or revoking certifications,the department and superintendent do not provide notice and an opportunity for hearing prior to the effective date of the suspension or revocation.instead,they provide notice that a suspension or revocation has already been implemented and they provide the nonpublic school with the opportunity to request a or hearing.as a result of these practices,nonpublic schools have no opportunity to contest the factual or legal basis for a suspension or revocation prior to the suspension or revocation taking effect.
plaintiffs allege that the department and superintendent are not statutorily authorized to enter suspension or revocation orders without providing a or revocation administrative action hearing.government code section et authorizes state agencies to adopt emergency decision procedures.however,the allegedly unlawful practice of suspending or revoking nonpublic school certification does not comply with government code section et requirements for emergency decision procedures by state agencies.further,plaintiffs allege that the foregoing procedures violated their united states fourteenth amendment and california constitution article i,section,subdivision a due process rights because nonpublic schools have a liberty interest in the department certifications the department and superintendent regularly suspend and revoke the certification status of nonpublic schools without providing notice or an opportunity for a hearing and the post revocation or suspension hearing is inadequate to protect against serious economic damage occurring during the hearing process.further,according to plaintiffs,most suspensions last for only days.by the time the hearing process is finished,the suspension will already have been completed with resultant economic loss.in the case of a revocation,by the time the hearing was completed,immediate closure would occur,staff would be terminated,and the nonpublic school business would be destroyed.as a result,in the fourth cause of action,plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief which would bar the department and superintendent from suspending or revoking certifications without a hearing.plaintiffs also sought an award of attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
iv.discussion 
standard of review 
this is an appeal from a dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend.our supreme court has set forth the standard of review we must apply as follows on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.citation.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,accord,zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.
b.the or revocation procedure which involves the safety and well being of disabled children does not violate state or federal due process principles 
the method by which a nonpublic,nonsectarian school is certified and the certification is suspended or revoked.
plaintiffs argue a nonpublic,nonsectarian school may not have its certification suspended or revoked by the superintendent without a prior hearing and notice of the basis of the potential adverse administrative action.this contention is commonly referred to as the claim that an aggrieved license,permit,or other property interest holder is entitled to predeprivation notice and a hearing before an adverse administrative action is taken.see gilbert city of sunnyvale th,d sahlolbei providence healthcare,th,d.at issue in this case is the manner in which certification of a nonpublic,nonsectarian school is suspended or revoked.both federal and state law guarantee all disabled children a free,appropriate public education that is designed to meet their unique needs,subd.a.as part of this guarantee of a free,appropriate public education for disabled children,a nonpublic,nonsectarian school provides special education services under a master contract with a local educational agency.among other things,the master contract must contain provisions for the administration of the contract,including student to pupil ratios,transportation,and recordkeeping and documentation,subds.a,b an individual services agreement which will insure compliance with each student individualized education plan,subd.a a methods for evaluating student progress including determining whether to return the child to public schools,subd.a b provisions for payment of warrants,subd.c,and various provisions insuring compliance with other state laws including documentation of attendance,subd.a c.unless the nonpublic,nonsectarian school has been certified as meeting those standards relating to the required special education and specified related services and facilities for individuals with exceptional needs,no master contract may be negotiated by the local educational agency.no master contract may be exceed months in duration,subd.d.as noted,education code section,subdivision d refers to children with exceptional needs.under california law,a youngster with an individualized education program is also referred to as a child with exceptional needs,subd.a.for ease of reference,we will refer to an exceptional needs child as one who is disabled the term used under federal law.
a nonpublic,nonsectarian school is certified by the superintendent.the lengthy certification process is detailed in education code section.included in the certification process are preparation of an application which includes an under oath showing that the facility complies with all relevant state and federal laws,subd.a proof of notification of the application to the local educational agency evidence the representatives of the local educational agency have had the opportunity to review the application,subd.b onsite review of the facility by the superintendent,subd.e and time frames for completing the certification process,subd.f.in order to secure certification,all staff must be properly credentialed or otherwise possess appropriate certificates or permits,subd.n.each school must also provide written assurances that the facility complies with all applicable health and safety laws,subd.o.the superintendent is required to annually review the certification of each nonpublic,nonsectarian school,subd.h.further,the superintendent is required to conduct monitoring of certified facilities on a cycle,subd.j.the superintendent is granted the authority under specified circumstances to conduct unannounced onsite inspections of nonpublic,nonsectarian schools which have received certification,subd.i.once certified,the nonpublic,nonsectarian school is entitled to receive federal funds.
at issue are the provisions of education code section,subdivisions a and b which state within working days following the nonpublic,nonsectarian school or agency receipt of the notice of denial,revocation,or suspension of certification,the nonpublic,nonsectarian school or agency may file a written petition to request a review of the decision by the superintendent.the petition may include written arguments or a request to present an oral argument.b within working days after the receipt of the written petition,the superintendent or a designee shall review the decision and the applicant petition and render a written,reasoned decision that shall be the final administrative decision.the designee of the superintendent shall be impartial,unbiased,and shall not have participated in the department decision to deny,revoke,or suspend the nonpublic,nonsectarian school or agency certification.
the regulations promulgated to implement the post suspension and revocation hearing process provide that the office of administrative hearings handles appeals only after the superintendent issues a suspension or revocation.the hearing procedure is specified in california code of regulations,title,section which states in part a within twenty working days of receipt of notice,nonpublic schools or nonpublic agencies appellant may file a written petition appeal,on forms provided by the superintendent,to request a review of the decision to deny,suspend or revoke certification pursuant to education code section.b all appeals shall be mailed to the office of administrative hearings,department of general services.c there shall be three options for appealing the denial,suspension or revocation of certification.the nonpublic school or nonpublic agency may request a written review of the decision to deny,suspend or revoke certification.the office of administrative hearings shall analyze the documentation provided by the appellant and materials provided by the department and render a decision a written review with an oral argument.the office of administrative hearings shall analyze the documentation provided by the appellant and materials provided by the department.the appellant shall also appear before a hearing officer,on a date scheduled by the office of administrative hearings,to provide oral testimony in support of the appeal.the department shall also attend the hearing and present testimony to support the decision to deny,suspend or revoke certification.the hearing officer may ask questions of either party.all testimony shall be or an oral hearing.the appellant shall appear before a hearing officer,on a date scheduled by the office of administrative hearings,to provide oral testimony in support of the appeal.the department shall also attend the hearing and present testimony to support the decision to deny,suspend or revoke certification.the hearing officer shall provide the opportunity for both parties to review evidence,call witnesses and witnesses.if the appellant fails to appear at the hearing,the petitioner waives the right to a future hearing,unless the hearing officer agrees to reschedule the hearing because of extenuating circumstances.d the office of administrative hearings shall issue the decision,in writing,simultaneously to the appellant and to the department within thirty working days after receipt of all materials and evidence.this shall be the final administrative decision.
plaintiffs argue that education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section permit us to construe the statutory and regulatory provisions to require a hearing.plaintiffs rely on the following analysis in ratliff lampton cal d,a driver license revocation case,we should not imply legislative intent to deprive a person of his license without a prior opportunity to be heard unless compelled to do so by the plain language of the statute,regardless of whether there is a right to an administrative review after revocation.in this case,the plain language of education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section specify the hearing is to occur after the superintendent suspends or revokes the certification.the presumption articulated in ratliff does not warrant us holding that a nonpublic,nonsectarian school is entitled to a or revocation hearing.
plaintiffs facial challenge to the statute and the regulation 
plaintiffs assert a facial challenge to education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section.the supreme court explained a facial challenge thusly a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.dillon municipal court cal d.to support a determination of facial unconstitutionality,voiding the statute as a whole,petitioners can not prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute rather,petitioners must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.arcadia unified school dist.state of education cal th,d,quoting pacific legal foundation brown cal d.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.later,the supreme court qualified its analysis in tobe as follows a lthough we may not invalidate a statute simply because in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may arise tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at,d,neither may we ignore the actual standards contained in a procedural scheme and uphold the law simply because in some hypothetical situation it might lead to a permissible result.see california teachers ass state of california cal th,d.plaintiffs have a heavy burden of demonstrating that education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section are unconstitutional on their face.professional engineers department of transportation cal th,d,pacific legal foundation brown,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs argue education code section,subdivisions a and b and california code of regulations,title,section are violative of the fourteenth amendment due process clause the controlling test for evaluating the scope of a federal due process hearing right in an administrative context is specified in mathews eldridge,d i dentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.see coleman department of personnel administration cal d.in cafeteria workers mcelroy,d,the supreme court explained the very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation c onsideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the governmental function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.accord,oberholzer commission on judicial performance cal th,d.
the united states supreme court has spoken directly,in the fourteenth amendment due process context,to a government entity right to take adverse regulatory action and only provide notice and the option of a hearing after the suspension or revocation of a protectable interest.in mathews eldridge,supra,at pages,the supreme court applied the foregoing due process analysis and upheld an administrative procedure for terminating social security disability payments.that administrative procedure permitted a state agency to utilize a team consisting of a physician and a disability evaluator to review a social security aid recipient mental or physical impairment.id.at.once the local agency team concluded that the recipient had recovered,a recommendation was made to the social security administration bureau of disability to terminate payments.federal social security officials would then review the state team disability benefits termination decision recommendation.the state team termination decision was usually upheld by the social security officials.two months later,payment of the recipient social security disability benefits would terminate.the recipient could pursue a series of administrative reviews.but prior to the decision to terminate disability payments,there was no right to an administrative hearing.the supreme court held,we conclude that an evidentiary hearing is not required prior to the termination of disability benefits and that the present administrative procedures fully comport with due process.id.at.see mcclelland massinga cir.
the united states supreme court applied the eldridge test in five other cases involving challenges to hearing procedures which were provided only after the government agencies took adverse administrative actions.in dixon love,d,the supreme court upheld a state statute that suspended a driver license when the driver incurred a specified number of convictions but offered not right to a hearing.of consequence to the supreme court was the state interest in safety on the roads and highways,and in the prompt removal of a safety hazard,which warranted only a post suspension opportunity for a hearing.see bradshaw park th,d.in mackey montrym,d,the supreme court upheld a state procedure permitting the summary revocation of the license of a driver who refused to take a alcohol test.the supreme court held the failure to provide a hearing was justified in part by governmental interest in protecting the public.in federal deposit ins.mallen,d,the supreme court examined a statute which allowed the federal deposit insurance corporation to suspend an indicted
