pursuant to section of the school code ilcs c west,defendant howard ohlhausen ohlhausen petitioned the state superintendent of education to detach his parcel of vacant farmland property from the existing school districts associated with rich township and annex it to adjoining school districts associated with the village of frankfort.the issue before us is whether ohlhausen petitions comply with section,and,if so,whether section constitutes unconstitutional special legislation in violation of article iv,section,of the illinois constitution of.const,art.iv.the circuit court of cook county found that the petition did not comply with section and additionally found that section constituted special legislation.for the reasons which follow,we reverse.
background 
ohlhausen,as successor trustee of the else emoff living trust,owned a parcel of land on the southwest edge of cook county,illinois hereinafter,the property.the record reveals that the property is acres of vacant farmland,and had been located in an unincorporated area in rich township,cook county.it is surrounded on the north,east,and south by similarly vacant farmland properties.the nearest development to the north and east in the towns of matteson and richton park,illinois,is several miles away.however,the west side of the property is bounded by harlem avenue,and immediately across harlem avenue is the village of frankfort,in will county.residential subdivisions known as southwick and prestwick border harlem avenue in frankfort,and thus adjoin the property.a petition for annexation of the property was filed and pending with the village of frankfort as of august.
the property is located within matteson elementary school district and rich township high school district.students residing in frankfort do not attend the matteson and richton park schools.instead,frankfort public high school students attend lincoln way community high school district,while frankfort elementary students attend either frankfort school district,or another district serving frankfort children.
the record contains a december,letter which demonstrates ohlhausen plans as to the property.in the letter,ohlhausen states to a representative of district 
central to our planning and the success of the project is that the parcel be annexed to frankfort school district whose excellent reputation would help support the sale of the upscale community envisaged for the parcel.the village administrator of frankfort conveyed support for our project,and expressed his opinions that a the property was in the buffer zone between frankfort and richton park,b that it was very close to the frankfort schools,c and that it might already be within both the frankfort library district and the frankfort fire district.we believe the property currently falls within the richton park school district,and that the development of such a community so far from their schools,would materially limit its success and set it apart as an island community.
section was offered by senator petka as an amendment to house bill.according to the may,senate debates,along with another matter dealing with the annexation of school districts,the bill provides a mechanism for a small portion of vacant land to be annexed to a neighboring municipality takes care of a local concern in will county,senate proceedings,may,at statements of senator petka.the bill was to solve a couple of school district issues also for a school district in will county,senate proceedings,may,at statements of senator petka.on may,the legislature passed house bill as public act,which became effective on august.
accordingly,the act provides,in pertinent part 
notwithstanding any other provision of this code,any contiguous portion of an elementary school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining elementary school district,and any contiguous portion of a high school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining high school district,upon a petition or petitions filed under this section,when all of the following conditions are met with respect to each petition so filed 
the portion of the district to be so detached and annexed to an adjoining elementary or high school district consists of not more than acres of vacant land that is located in an unincorporated area of a county of or more inhabitants and,on the effective date of this amendatory act of,is contiguous to one municipality that is i wholly outside the elementary or high school district from which the vacant land is to be detached and ii located entirely within the territorial boundaries of the adjoining elementary or high school district to which the vacant land is to be annexed.
the equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property located in the portion of the district that is to be so detached and annexed to the adjoining elementary or high school district constitutes less than of the equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property of the district from which it is to be detached.
the portion of the district to be so detached and annexed to the adjoining elementary or high school district is annexed to the contiguous municipality pursuant to a petition for annexation filed and pending with the annexing municipality upon the effective date of this amendatory act.ilcs c west.
the property was annexed to the village of frankfort on december.thereafter,on june,ohlhausen petitioned the state superintendent of education,pursuant to section,to detach the property from the cook county elementary and high school districts,and to annex the property to the adjacent will county school districts.ohlhausen filed two petitions one for the elementary school districts,and one for the high school districts.
the superintendent,through his hearing officer,convened an administrative hearing on the ohlhausen petitions on september.much of the evidence relating to the specific requirements of section was stipulated.
as to section of the act,the evidence demonstrated that the property is vacant and less than acres.on august,the effective date of the act,the property was located in an unincorporated area in a county of million or more inhabitants.on the date the petition was filed,june,the property had been incorporated into the village of frankfort.the property was contiguous to a municipality frankfort located entirely outside the school districts from which it was to be detached.the village of frankfort was entirely within the high school district to which it was to be annexed,namely,high school district.frankfort,however,is not entirely within elementary school district.
as to section of the act,the evidence demonstrated that the equalized assessed valuation of the property was less than of the equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property of districts and.district financial loss if the property were transferred to the frankfort school districts would be less than of its tax base,while district loss would be less than of its tax base.
as to section of the act,the evidence demonstrated that the property was annexed to frankfort,a municipality contiguous to the property,pursuant to an annexation petition filed and pending on the effective date of the act.
the hearing officer found that there was no question that ohlhausen complied with each and every criteria established under the act.he rejected district and district argument that section required that the property be in unincorporated territory on the date the school petition was filed with the superintendent.he also rejected their argument that frankfort must be located entirely within both high school district and elementary school district as a misreading of section c ii.moreover,the hearing officer found,applying the community of interest standard for annexation and detachment cases see board of education of golf school regional board of school trustees,that the property future is tied to frankfort.he observed that the subject property is physically isolated from any developed section of the village of richton park.the only developed land near the subject property is the prestwick and southwick subdivisions in the village of frankfort.he observed that all municipal services for the site will be provided by the village of frankfort,and also library service was already provided by frankfort prior to the annexation.he found that the village of frankfort,district and district are the natural community for any possible future inhabitants of the subject property.accordingly,the hearing officer recommended that the superintendent grant ohlhausen petitions.
the hearing officer additionally noted that he believed section was unconstitutional special legislation,but lacked jurisdiction to make such a holding.the hearing officer concluded that the petitioner satisfied all the conditions for transfer of the property established under section of the school code.he recommended that the state superintendent grant the petitions and order the property be detached from school district and annexed to school district.he further recommended that the property be detached from district and annexed to lincoln way community high school district.the state superintendent adopted the findings of the hearing officer,and ordered the property detached from the existing elementary and high school districts and annexed to the adjoining elementary and high school districts associated with the village of frankfort.
elementary school district rich township high school district,frankfort community consolidated school district,lincoln way community high school district and sonya norwood,a resident of the matteson and rich districts,filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county against howard ohlhausen and robert schiller,superintendent of education.the first count sought administrative review,alleging that the hearing officer decision and superintendent schiller adoption of the decision were arbitrary,capricious and legally erroneous.plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief,arguing that section of the school code was unconstitutional special legislation count ii,violated title vi of the civil rights act count iii,and violated the equal protection clause of the united states constitution count iv.
the circuit court first discussed the elementary school petition compliance with section.he rejected plaintiffs argument that the act,section,required that the property be in unincorporated territory on the date the school petition was filed with the superintendent.the circuit court next considered whether the act required that the village of frankfort be located entirely within school district.it found that the first paragraph of section contemplated 
and,not mix and match.the repeated or in does not suggest that if the requirements are met as to one situation,they may then be ignored as to the other.rather,the or,like the beginning of as a whole,simply recognizes that two situations exist,each having parallel requirements.thus,the clear and sensible reading of is that the subject property in an elementary school petition must be contiguous to a municipality that is i wholly outside the elementary school district from which the land is to be detached and ii wholly within the territorial boundaries of the adjoiningelementary school district to which the land is to be annexed.it is undisputed that the village of frankfort was not located entirely within the adjoining elementary school district.the requirements of were not met.emphases in original.
the circuit court therefore found that the superintendent ruling was clearly erroneous because the village of frankfort was not entirely located within elementary school district.
the circuit court then addressed the special legislation claim.it first found that sonya norwood and the receiving school districts,frankfort and,did not suffer any cognizable injury,and therefore did not have standing.because no fundamental right or suspect classification was raised,the court applied the rational basis test,citing school district du page regional board of school trustees,d,under the rational basis test,a statute is constitutional if the legislative classification is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose,and if any set of facts can be reasonably conceived to justify the classification.as to the limit,the court stated,a rational legislature might conclude,however,that detaching territory larger than acres would be too disrupting to students or school districts.the limit to vacant and unincorporated land was rational because it could have been added to ensure that the detachment does not instantly cripple the resources of the district from which the land is to be detached.as to the million or more inhabitants requirement,which applies to only cook county,the circuit court found that the argument failed because plaintiffs have neither made nor offered any showing that other counties are somehow injured by their omission from criteria.
the circuit court found,however,that section was unconstitutional due to the effective date limitation found therein.the court stated 
as plaintiffs forcefully point out,by its own terms see,actually became obsolete on its own effective date.that simultaneous birth and death of the section,so to whenever the governor signed it,a matter of timing the general assembly could neither predict nor control,and which could have been a single day after passage.and as soon as the effective date had arrived,no one could use the section who did not already have an annexation petition filed and pending a limitation which,together with the section other restrictive criteria,was manifestly calculated to fit ohlhausen and no one else.thus,plaintiffs argue,was obviously,and impermissibly,designed to flicker in and out of existence for ohlhausen sole benefit.emphasis in original.
the court continued 
ohlhausen responds that the legislature really created a window between the passage of the act may,and its actual effective date august,thus enabling interested landowners to file petitions for municipal annexation during that time period.it is true that the legislature can grant a privilege for a limited period of time.citation.but that is not this case.here the legislature did not provide for a,or indeed for any,window.the governor could have signed the act adding the day after its passage,thus visibly and irrefragably limiting it to ohlhausen acres.it was pure happenstance that the governor did not sign the act until august.this court can not conceive of any rational basis on which the legislature could thus leave the statute entire effective life to sheer chance,except for the inevitable conclusion that was enacted for ohlhausen and no one else.emphasis in original.
therefore,the court reversed superintendent schiller order and set aside both ohlhausen elementary school petition and ohlhausen high school petition.the circuit court dismissed counts iii and iv as well,neither of which are at issue in this appeal.because the judgment declared a statute of this state constitutionally invalid,appeal was taken directly to this court pursuant to supreme court rule a a.
compliance with section 
the first issue here is whether the superintendent correctly determined that ohlhausen elementary school petition complied with section.the state superintendent decision is subject to review under the administrative review law.ilcs c west ilcs et west.
the administrative review law provides that judicial review of an administrative agency decision shall extend to all questions of law and fact presented by the entire record before the court.ilcs west.the standard of review,which determines the degree of deference given to the agency decision,turns on whether the issue presented is a question of fact,a question of law,or a mixed question of law and fact.comprehensive community solutions,rockford school district,quoting afm messenger service,department of employment security.an agency conclusion on a question of law is reviewed de novo.comprehensive community solutions,at.a reviewing court is not bound by an agency interpretation of a statute,but the agency interpretation remains relevant where there is a reasonable debate about the meaning of the statute.comprehensive community solutions,at.
a mixed question of law and fact asks the legal effect of a given set of facts.comprehensive community solutions,at.that is,in resolving a mixed question of law and fact,a reviewing court must determine whether established facts satisfy applicable legal rules.comprehensive community solutions,at,afm messenger,at,quoting swint,d.an agency conclusion on a mixed question of law and fact is reviewed for clear error.comprehensive community solutions,at,city of belvidere illinois state labor relations board.such review is significantly deferential to an agency experience in construing and applying the statutes that it administers.comprehensive community solutions,at,afm messenger,at.thus,when the decision of an administrative agency presents a mixed question of law and fact,the agency decision will be deemed clearly erroneous only where the reviewing court,on the entire record,is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.comprehensive community solutions,at,quoting afm messenger,at.
the central issue here involves the superintendent decision to uphold the hearing officer decision to grant ohlhausen elementary school petition in reviewing the hearing officer decision to grant the petition,the superintendent must determine,in part,whether the proposal was in compliance with the act,including the requirements listed in section.there is no dispute as to the basic facts rather,the parties dispute the interpretation of the statutory provision that the village of frankfort be located entirely within the territorial boundaries of the adjoining elementary or high school district to which the vacant land is to be annexed.ilcs c ii west.before we can decide whether the superintendent decision that ohlhausen petition satisfied this requirement was clearly erroneous,we must first decide the plain meaning of section.on this question,our standard of review is de novo.
the fundamental rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature intent.comprehensive community solutions,at.the plain language of a statute remains the best indication of this intent.comprehensive community solutions,at.where the language of a statute is clear,we may not read into it exceptions that the legislature did not express,and we will give it effect as written.comprehensive community solutions,at.we also will give undefined statutory terms their ordinary meanings.comprehensive community solutions,at.the parties agree that the plain language of section of the school code is unambiguous,but they offer different readings of the section.
ohlhausen argues that the circuit court erred in reversing the superintendent ruling that ohlhausen complied with the requirements of section ii.the village of frankfort is located entirely within at least one district to which the property was to be annexed,namely,the high school district,district.the act is not split into subparts which require the application of each subpart to separate petitions.section ii is phrased in the disjunctive.it plainly provides for a single requirement that the municipality to which the subject property is annexed be located within the boundaries of the adjoining elementary or high school district.the word or means that a petition must satisfy at least one of two conditions,but not necessarily both.frankfort is located entirely within the high school district.thus,the superintendent properly found that ohlhausen satisfied the requirements of section ii.
plaintiffs arguments echo the ruling of the circuit court.they emphasize that the act as a whole contains a parallel construction in that the village of frankfort must be entirely within the boundaries of district.the first paragraph of section contemplates separate elementary petitions and high school petitions,and the legislature intended for this parallel construction to remain throughout the act.thus,plaintiffs argue,the superintendent misread the phrase in section ii that the territorial boundaries of the adjoining elementary or high school district to which the vacant land is to be annexed by claiming that the word or actually means either or so that the municipality can be within either an elementary school or a high school district.thus,ohlhausen elementary petition did not meet the requirements of section ii.we agree with ohlhausen.
the word or is disjunctive.as used in its ordinary sense,the word or marks an alternative indicating the various parts of the sentence which it connects are to be taken separately.people frieberg.in other words,or means or.people herron,citing webster third new international dictionary.disjunctive therefore connotes two different alternatives.with this in mind,we set out again the disputed statutory section,
notwithstanding any other provision of this code,any contiguous portion of an elementary school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining elementary school district,and any contiguous portion of a high school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining high school district,upon a petition or petitions filed under this section,when all of the following conditions are met with respect to each petition so filed 
the portion of the district to be so detached and annexed to an adjoining elementary or high school district consists of not more than acres of vacant land that is located in an unincorporated area of a county of or more inhabitants and,on the effective date of this amendatory act of,is contiguous to one municipality that is i wholly outside the elementary or high school district from which the vacant land is to be detached and ii located entirely within the territorial boundaries of the adjoining elementary or high school district to which the vacant land is to be annexed.ilcs c west.
accordingly,we consider whether ohlhausen elementary petition fulfilled the conditions provided by the plain meaning of the act.
the first paragraph of section begins by stating that districts,both elementary and high school,may be changed upon a petition or petitions.next,the paragraph requires that all of the following conditions are met with respect to each petition.emphasis added.ilcs c west.thus,the first paragraph creates a distinction between the petitions and the conditions.stated another way,the act requires that each petition,whether elementary or high school,meet the all of the following conditions of the remainder of section.thus,while there may be separate petitions,there is nothing within the plain meaning of the first paragraph of the act requiring the elementary and high school petitions meet separate conditions.because plaintiffs parallel construction would require elementary and high school petitions to meet separate,rather than all of the following conditions,it contravenes the plain meaning of the act.accordingly,we reject plaintiffs argument that the first paragraph of the act sets forth a parallel construction,requiring separate conditions to be met for elementary and high school petitions.
we next examine whether the elementary petition has met those following conditions according to the alternatives further provided.we separate the statutory provision at hand into two sentences according to the alternatives presented by the disputed condition provided in section ii.therefore,deleting reference to high school petitions and focusing on subsection ii,the two alternatives are contained in the following two paragraphs.
first,any contiguous portion of an elementary school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining elementary school district upon a petition or petitions filed under this section,when all of the following conditions are met with respect to each petition so filed t he portion of the district to be so detached and annexed to an adjoining elementary district is contiguous to one municipality that is ii located entirely within the territorial boundaries of the adjoining elementary district to which the vacant land is to be annexed.ilcs c west.the elementary petition clearly fails under this first alternative because the village of frankfort is not entirely within the boundaries of district.
second,any contiguous portion of an elementary school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining elementary school district upon a petition or petitions filed under this section,when all of the following conditions are met with respect to each petition so filed t he portion of the district to be so detached and annexed to an adjoining elementary district ii is contiguous to one municipality that is located entirely within the adjoining high school district to which the vacant land is to be annexed.ilcs c west.the village of frankfort is entirely within lincoln way high school district.therefore,the elementary petition satisfies the second alternative because it meets the disputed condition in section ii.
to read the act otherwise would negate the disjunctive meaning of the word or in the condition provided in section ii,and thus require the municipality to be within both the elementary district and the high school district.because the word or is ordinarily used in the disjunctive sense,each petition had to only meet one of the alternatives in section ii,namely,the village had to be located entirely within the elementary school district or the high school district.
there is no further dispute that the village of frankfort was located entirely within high school district.we find that the superintendent correctly interpreted the act and found that the petition met the requirements of the act.we therefore hold that the superintendent decision was not clearly erroneous.accordingly,we reverse the circuit court on this issue.
ii.special legislation challenge 
we next turn to the argument that section constitutes special legislation.in general,statutes carry a strong presumption of constitutionality.crusius illinois gaming board,in re petition of the village of vernon hills.this presumption requires that plaintiffs,as the parties challenging the statute in this case,bear the burden of establishing the statute constitutional infirmity.big sky excavating,illinois bell telephone,village of vernon hills,at.this court has a duty to uphold the constitutionality of a statute if it is reasonably possible to do so.big sky,at.we review de novo the circuit court determination of section constitutionality,and its consequent order reversing and setting aside superintendent schiller order.big sky,at.
section of article iv of the illinois constitution provides 
the general assembly shall pass no special or local law when a general law is or can be made applicable.whether a general law is or can be made applicable shall be a matter for judicial determination.const,art.iv.
the special legislation clause prohibits the general assembly from conferring a special benefit or privilege upon one person or group and excluding others that are similarly situated.big sky,at,village of vernon hills,at.while the legislature has broad discretion to make statutory classifications,the special legislation clause prevents it from making classifications that arbitrarily discriminate in favor of a select group without a sound and reasonable basis.big sky,at,village of vernon hills,at.our inquiry into special legislation issues is twofold.we must determine whether the statutory classification at issue discriminates in favor of a select group and,if so,whether the classification is arbitrary.big sky,at.
plaintiffs argue here that section can not pass special legislation scrutiny because the narrow window created by the effective date makes ohlhausen the only beneficiary of the provision.ohlhausen responds that the clear flaw in plaintiffs case and the circuit court judgment is that there was no similarly situated group who sought detachment or annexation of some other piece of property but was prevented from doing so by the language of section.
we first determine if section conferred a special benefit or privilege upon one person or group and excluded others that are similarly situated.we agree with the circuit court that there is significant evidence in the record that this piece of legislation was solely intended to benefit ohlhausen.especially with regard to the portion requiring a petition to annex to be filed on the effective date of the act,it is reasonable to assume that ohlhausen is the only one who has benefitted from this provision.
however,legislation is not constitutionally infirm under the special legislation clause merely because of its unique application to the property at issue.the mere fact that a law may affect only a single entity does not render the law invalid under the special legislation clause.see,big sky,statute affecting only illinois bell upheld against special legislation challenge crusius,statute affecting single riverboat gambling licensee upheld against special legislation challenge chicago national league ball club,thompson,rejecting constitutional challenge to validity of laws that affected only wrigley field.for instance,in crusius illinois gaming board,the plaintiff sued the state of illinois and the illinois gaming board challenging as unconstitutional section a of the riverboat gambling act ilcs a west.that provision provided that a gambling licensee not conducting riverboat gambling on january,could apply to the board for a license renewal and could secure approval to relocate the business upon receiving approval from the new municipality in which the licensee sought to relocate.crusius,at.we found it clear not only that the challenged provision discriminated in favor of a select group,but that the statute was intended to benefit one specific gambling licensee,emerald casino.crusius,at.nevertheless,we rejected the special legislation challenge because the classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
to contravene article iv,section,of our constitution,the statute must confer on a person,entity,or class of persons or entities a special benefit or exclusive privilege that is denied to others who are similarly situated.thus,under the first part of the inquiry,we determine if another entity similarly situated to ohlhausen was denied a privilege.this burden has been met in previous cases through evidence of other entities that would have been able to benefit from the legislative privilege,but for some limiting exclusionary provision.for instance,in in re petition of the village of vernon hills,the legislature created a mechanism whereby a municipality with more than one fire protection district may transfer territory served by one district into another district.the village of vernon hills petitioned to transfer territory to the countryside fire protection district.the vernon fire protection district filed an objection to the petition stating that the law was special legislation in that it was restricted to municipalities in a county with a population between and.lake county was the only illinois county at the time with this population.we noted,t hrough all the exhibits,vernon fire showed that municipalities located in du page county are similarly situated to the village,but can not utilize the mechanism because du page county has a population of over persons.village of vernon hills,at.this court struck down the legislation as there was no rational basis to distinguish between the different districts based on the population requirement.village of vernon hills,at.
conversely,in big sky excavating,illinois bell telephone,the legislative section at issue ilcs west terminated administrative proceedings against illinois bell and declared that certain of its services would be classified as competitive,enabling illinois bell to increase rates for its services.the section also required illinois bell to expend million in refunds and other payments.this court found,
t he advantages received by illinois bell were not denied to others who were similarly situated.they could not have been,for there were no other telecommunications carriers whose situation was similar to illinois bell.
if any telecommunications carrier believed that section afforded illinois bell an advantage it was denied,there is no evidence of it in the record before us.big sky,at.
we stated that because no other carrier was shown to be similarly situated to illinois bell,section can not be said to ha
