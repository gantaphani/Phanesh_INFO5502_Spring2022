like many state universities,indiana university charges nonresident students higher tuition than their indiana resident counterparts.christopher porco was born and raised in michigan,but he attended law school in indiana.shortly after he finished his first year at indiana university school of law,porco petitioned for reclassification as an indiana resident for purposes of tuition.the university denied porco petition,and he thereafter filed suit against the trustees of indiana university,the standing committee on residence,the chair of the standing committee on residence,and the associate registrar collectively,the university,all in their official capacities.porco alleged that the university system for classifying resident and nonresident students violated the privileges and immunities,equal protection,and due process clauses of the united states constitution.he demanded a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from collecting nonresident tuition from him under the university classification system,which he sought to have declared unconstitutional.the defendants moved to dismiss porco suit for lack of standing,and moved in the alternative for summary judgment.the district court dismissed the suit in part and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to the remainder.porco appeals,but we dismiss his appeal as moot for the reasons stated herein.
porco was born in michigan and attended school in dewitt,michigan,until his graduation from high school in.after graduation,he remained in michigan,where he attended college at alma college in alma,michigan.after graduating from college,porco applied to law schools in indiana,illinois,and california.he accepted an offer of admission from the university of indiana school of law and moved from michigan to indianapolis,indiana,in august.later that same month,he began attending indiana university as a law student.
the university maintains a set of rules determining resident and nonresident status for indiana university fee purposes residency rules setting forth the policy under which a student is classified as either a resident or nonresident for purposes.under those rules,a student is considered a resident student if he or she has,for reasons other than attending school,continuously resided in indiana for at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes of the semester.if not subject to certain exceptions irrelevant here,the student is classified as a nonresident,and must pay a nonresident fee as long as he remains continuously enrolled in the university.although it is not entirely clear from the record what the nonresident fee was at the time porco filed suit,the current nonresident fee for graduate level courses is an additional per credit hour.
porco paid the higher nonresident tuition for his first and second semesters of law school.upon finishing his second semester,porco applied to be classified as an indiana resident.on may,he submitted the university application for classification as a resident student at indiana university for purposes.in it,he set forth the steps he had taken that he maintained evidenced his status as an indiana resident.specifically,porco had registered to vote in indiana,had obtained an indiana driver license,had registered his car in indiana,and had opened an indiana bank account.he had secured employment in indiana during his second semester of law school and also had a summer job at a law firm in indiana.porco also submitted a personal statement,in which he professed his intention to reside in indiana for the rest of his life and raise a family there.for example,he explained his rejection of an offer of admission from the university of san diego as follows i turned down this california dream because i knew it was where i belong in indiana.he concluded with the observation that,i may not be a hoosier by birth but i am one by choice.
thomas may,the associate registrar,denied porco request.may explained that porco was ineligible for reclassification under residency rules and.rule provides that an individual who moves to indiana from another state does not acquire residency for purposes until he resides in the state for at least twelve consecutive months,and rule explains that time spent in indiana for the predominant purpose of attending a college,university,or other institution of higher education does not count toward the requirement.at the time he applied for reclassification,porco had been in indiana just over nine months,and had been attending law school for almost that entire time.thus,may explained,he did not meet the criteria for reclassification under rule and.
porco appealed may decision to the standing committee on residence and was granted a hearing on his appeal on june.at the hearing,porco again represented that he intended to make indiana his permanent home,and reiterated the things he had done to that end,such as obtaining an indiana driver license and staying in indiana to work for the summer.approximately one month after the hearing,jo anne bowen,chair of the standing committee on residence,wrote porco to inform him that the committee had denied his appeal.bowen explained that the committee had considered porco reasons for coming to indiana and his reasons for staying,but concluded that his predominant purpose in coming was to attend school,and that his purpose had not changed.porco thus paid the nonresident fee for fall semester and spring semester.
at the beginning of what would be his final semester,fall,porco sued jo anne bowen,thomas may,the standing committee on residence,and the trustees of indiana university.he alleged that the university residency rules,both facially and as applied to him,violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the due process clause of the fifth amendment,and the privileges and immunities clause of the fourteenth amendment.in his complaint,porco requested,among other things,a preliminary injunction ordering the university to reclassify him as a resident student so that he could pay the lower rate of tuition and continue with his classes while the case was pending.before the court ruled on porco request for injunctive relief,the parties reached an agreement.in lieu of litigating porco request for injunctive relief under the time pressures created by the semester,they agreed that porco would tender the difference between that semester resident and nonresident tuition the clerk of the court to be disbursed in accordance with the court final judgment.
the university then moved to dismiss porco suit,or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.it argued that porco lacked standing to challenge the residency rules because he had never truly intended to live permanently in indiana,as evidenced by the fact that he had returned to michigan after graduating from law school.alternatively,it argued that porco challenges failed on the merits because the residency rules were constitutional under vlandis kline,d,and other supreme court precedent allowing state schools to establish bona fide residency criteria for students.porco also moved for summary judgment.
the district court entered judgment for the defendants.it broke down porco challenges to the residency rules into two parts challenges to the durational requirement in rule,and challenges to the predominant purpose test in rule.the court agreed with the defendants that porco lacked standing to challenge the residency requirement in.the court concluded that the defendants had ultimately denied porco application under rule the predominant purpose provision,and thus none of porco alleged injury was traceable to rule.the court then determined that porco had standing to challenge the predominant purpose test in rule,but that his challenge failed on the merits because the rule was rationally related to indiana legitimate interest in ensuring that only bona fide residents received the tuition rate.it thus granted the defendants motion to dismiss as it related to porco challenge to the durational portion of the residency rules,and granted summary judgment to the defendants on porco remaining claims.
