mel velarde,who was convicted of sexually abusing a minor within indian country,has filed a motion for a new trial under rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure.he claims that the government violated his rights under brady maryland,d,by suppressing evidence that,the minor victim,falsely accused her school teacher and vice principal of inappropriate touching.velarde argues that had the government disclosed this evidence,he could have impeached at trial,and the result of his trial would have been different.
the district court initially scheduled an evidentiary hearing at which velarde would have been able to subpoena certain otherwise uncooperative witnesses and determine the nature of false accusations,if that is what they were,and establish whether the government was aware of them.later,however,the court sua sponte cancelled the evidentiary hearing and denied velarde motion for a new trial on the ground that he had failed to introduce admissible evidence in support of his brady claim.we hold that the district court erred by denying velarde motion without granting an opportunity for discovery.we therefore vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and procedural history 
the jury trials and rule motion 
in march,mel velarde was convicted by a jury of sexually abusing a minor within indian country in violation of,c,a,the alleged minor victim,is the daughter of the woman velarde was dating at that time.no one else saw the alleged crime,and there was no corroborating medical evidence,so velarde was convicted almost entirely on testimony.velarde appealed his conviction and this court reversed,holding that the district court erroneously admitted expert testimony concerning propensity for truthtelling.united states velarde,cir.
the government elected to retry velarde.during his second trial,which occurred in september,testified that velarde took her from the top bunk of her brothers bed her younger brother was also sleeping in the top bunk,and her older brother was sleeping in the lower bunk into the hallway and held her mouth shut while he tried to stick his private part in her private part.vol.iii,at.velarde theory of the case was that fabricated those allegations to get back at him because when he spent the night at her mother house he displaced from her mother bed,usual sleeping place.this second trial resulted in another conviction,which this court affirmed.united states velarde.cir.
in september,three years after his second trial,velarde filed a motion under rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure seeking a new trial.he alleged that the government violated his brady rights by failing to disclose before his second trial evidence that was favorable to him and material.specifically,velarde claimed that in the days immediately preceding his second trial,falsely accused her school teacher and the school vice principal of inappropriately touching her.he asserted that,because the case hinged largely on whether testimony was credible,evidence that falsely accused other men of inappropriate touching could have impeached and led to a different result.
velarde learned of apparently false accusations from phil gallegos,another teacher at school who was teacher union representative.gallegos testified in an affidavit that he told fbi agent frank chimits about false accusations before velarde second trial began.he also testified that he reminded agent chimit s of his legal obligation to fully disclose this type of evidence.vol.i,doc,ex,at.the government countered with agent chimits affidavit testimony that he did not at any time have a conversation with gallegos of the nature described in defendant velarde motion,nor did he know of second accusations from any other source prior to the second trial.vol.i,doc,ex,at.
the district court response to velarde brady motion 
faced with the contradictory gallegos and chimits affidavits,the district court set an evidentiary hearing.vol.i,doc.the order stated that t he court initial task is to determine whether a conversation with the content described in the gallegos affidavit,did or did not occur.id.at.the court ordered the parties to be prepared to present substantive evidence as to the specific content of a conversation between gallegos and chimits.id.at.the court also ordered velarde to present at the hearing the substantive,strong,exculpatory,admissible evidence that he intends to present at trial,the new evidence on which he has based his motion.id.at.
soon after the district court issued this order,velarde moved the court to issue subpoenas under.b to compel the attendance of gallegos,and principal,vice principal,and teacher.vol.i,doc,at.these witnesses were to be the source of the substantive,strong,exculpatory,admissible new evidence that the court ordered him to introduce.velarde contended that because the allegations implicated the school officials fitness for continued employment,subpoena power was necessary to compel their cooperation.
approximately one week after velarde sought these subpoenas,and before the court took any action on his motion,the district court sua sponte vacated the evidentiary hearing.vol.i,doc,at.the court stated that r ather than proceed with a costly and evidentiary hearing,as well as potentially with at least a portion of a new trial,the court determines that it is prudent,at this juncture,to determine the ultimate admissibility of such evidence,if established.id.at.the court ordered the parties to brief whether the evidence would be admissible under.and to appear for legal arguments,id.at,at a strictly legal hearing after the briefing was complete,id.at.
the parties submitted briefs as directed and appeared for the strictly legal hearing at the appointed time.but when the hearing began,the district judge immediately asked defense counsel to give a statement of exactly what the new evidence is that the defendant wishes to or claims to have found that justifies a new trial.vol.vi,at.defense counsel offered what the district court later characterized as a proffer,vol.i,doc,at,based on conversations a paid defense investigator had with teacher and vice principal.
according to defense counsel,teacher told the investigator that he was summoned to the principal office in the week after september,where and her mother were present.he was asked,what did you do to,if you touched her inappropriately.vol.vi,at.he denied the charge.the principal then asked why she did not bring the incident to the attention of the vice principal.responded that she did not like the vice principal because he touches me funny too.id.at.her teacher was told to leave the office,and he never knew what happened afterwards.id.at.
the investigator conversations with the vice principal largely concerned the school investigation into charges.the investigation involved the vice principal,a school counselor,and others.id.at.initially,the vice principal discussed the school investigation with the defense investigator.id.at.he told the investigator that nothing came of it,and that they did think was telling the truth.id.at.later,however,he clammed up,stating that he could recall.id.at.he provided no further information to the investigator.and the school counselor who the vice principal stated would have handled this told the defense investigator that she had no recall of the investigation.id.at.
the defense subpoenaed the school records,but according to defense counsel,there is sic no records to be had because they are purged on an annual basis.id.at.
defense counsel informed the district court that the defense wished to present the testimony of teacher and the defense investigator,and wished to subpoena the vice principal and the principal,bill reese.he explained to the court that the underlying allegations of inappropriate touching are admissible,as well as gallegos testimony that he,in fact,informed agent chimits about the allegations.id.at.in further discussion with the district court,defense counsel stated that the admissible evidence the defense would present relates to the teacher comments,reese discussion with the mother,and the victim,and the vice principal,as well as the investigation,if any,that was done by the vice principal.id.at.
the district court attempted to pin down the defense regarding the exact nature of allegations against her teacher 
lowry teacher and this is in the investigator that when the principal,bill reese,asked her,she responded the teacher recalls lv saying,because he scares me,referring to the vice principal.
and then,when reese asked,why does he scare you,she added,he touches me.
the court well,the first time you stated that you said,he touches me funny.
lowry well,i apologize.this is what i have in actual quotes from 
the court he touches me.
lowry he touches me.
the court and you do know where 
lowry no,your honor.but this was explanation to the principal about why she was afraid to go to the to report the allegations against her teacher.
the court what is teacher testimony going to be and that what you have to tell me.and what you told me,the way i understand it,was that it was inappropriate touching.
lowry the teacher was privy to the conversation that took place in the principal office before he arrived.what the teacher knows was that he was summoned into that office.
the court well,who is going to testify what kind of touching it was,and what will that testimony be what i understood from that what i asked you what i have understood from you is that teacher touched her inappropriately.
lowry and i think that we have to make that assumption,given what we know.and i think,if we want a more particularized description,it would take 
the court if you going to give me any more particular a description,it got to be now.this case was filed in,and it now,and i going to get rid of this case one way or the other,okay so you have to tell me exactly the touching was described,and who is going to say that.
defense counsel explained to the district court why it was necessary to subpoena witnesses in order to obtain the details regarding accusation 
lowry i want to step back for just a second and address the underlying allegations,and you wanted more specificity,and i wholeheartedly understand why.but i want to address the context within which we talking talking about school officials,teachers,in an environment that they deal directly on a basis with children.and these individuals,to say that they are concerned is understated.but an allegation of sexual touching is sort of a death knell to a career for a teacher 
the court i understand that.
lowry or a school official.at the onset,we dealing with a huge psychological barrier for people to even discuss with us the nature of touching,as it were.so i trying to be fully candid with your honor,but i also want the court to be well aware of the circumstance that we dealing with.and it makes it exceedingly difficult to get,you know,highly descriptive,especially descriptions of touching.so i just wanted to place that in context for the court.
following the hearing,the district court issued a written order denying velarde rule motion on the ground that the defendant newly discovered evidence is not admissible.vol.i,doc,at.first,the district court concluded that the gallegos affidavit did not contain reliable or admissible evidence,largely because it was based on hearsay.id.nor did the proffer by defense counsel at the march hearing provide any admissible evidence that had falsely accused her teacher and vice principal of inappropriate touching.id.the court explained 
there is no proof before the court as to whether indeed accused her teacher of an inappropriate touching.what is in the record is that her teacher denied touching her inappropriately.while there is evidence that states that her vice principal touches me,there is no evidence that the accusation is false.further,there is no proof before the court as to whether or not accused her teacher her vice principal of inappropriate touching of a sexual nature.
second,the district court concluded that e ven if defendant evidence were more complete and stronger,it lacked probative value for velarde defense because the circumstances of the two incidents differ so substantially.id.at.not only did the alleged incident at school occur two to three years after the incident charged in the indictment,but these alleged accusations against teacher and vice principal involved unspecified types of touching that have yet to be described to the court.there is certainly no proof that these other alleged incidents were of a sexual nature.id.the court observed that t he alleged principal incidents could have consisted of a touching such as shove or other minor assault.id.at.
the court then analyzed the proffered evidence under federal rules of evidence b and and the confrontation clause.extrinsic evidence was not admissible under rule b,according to the court,because it involved a collateral matter the lack of similarity of the events surrounding the prior and present allegations,and the slight degree of probative value of the proffered evidence on issues that are not collateral,such as credibility,bias,interest and motives,prompt the court to exercise its discretion under rule b and find the proffered evidence is inadmissible.id.at.the court also found that the relevance and probative value of this evidence is extremely slight and the danger of confusion and prejudice is great,leading the court to exclude it under rule.id.at.finally,the court rejected the defendant argument that he has a right to admission of this evidence under the confrontation clause on the ground that it is too attenuated in terms of what type of touching and in terms of time,to be probative,and because there is no proof before the court that the statement he touches me is false.id.at.the court concluded 
defendant evidence falls far short of showing a scheme of fabrication by certainly this evidence is not relevant to show false accusations of a similar nature,with the same intent,motivation and plan or to establish possible biases,prejudices,or ulterior motive of,which are always relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of her testimony.davis alaska,d.
id.at alteration in original.
velarde now appeals from that order.
discussion 
a defendant who seeks a new trial under rule based on an alleged brady violation must show that the prosecution suppressed evidence,the evidence was favorable to the defendant,and the evidence was material.united states quintanilla,cir.the government has not contested that velarde would satisfy the second element,so we limit our inquiry to the first and third elements.we review de novo the district court ruling on velarde rule motion because it alleges a brady violation.united states pearl,cir.
a.did the prosecution suppress potentially exculpatory evidence 
due process mandates disclosure by the prosecution of all evidence that favors the defendant and is material either to guilt or punishment.robinson,at quoting brady,at.this duty to disclose extends to prosecutors,police,and other government investigators.kyles whitley,d.accordingly,a defendant may base a brady claim on a government investigator failure to disclose evidence material to guilt or punishment,even when the prosecutor personally did not know of that evidence.see id.
gallegos and agent chimits presented conflicting evidence to the district court regarding whether the prosecution suppressed potentially material evidence.the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve this conflict,but instead ruled that even if the government suppressed the information,velarde is not entitled to a new trial because the suppressed evidence would not have been admissible.for purposes of this appeal,therefore,we will assume as the district court apparently did that the defendant is correct that gallegos informed the government regarding supposed false accusations and that the government failed to provide this information to the defense.this suppression actually,of course,open on remand.if,on remand,the district court concludes after an evidentiary hearing that gallegos did not make the alleged statement to chimits,there is no need for further proceedings to determine the materiality of the evide
