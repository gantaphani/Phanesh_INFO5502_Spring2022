the las virgenes unified school district the district,the board of education of the las virgenes unified school district the board,michael botsford,and robert clark appeal from the preliminary injunction entered in this action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by the las virgenes educators association and ferris.appellants contend that the trial court erred in interpreting section of the education code to apply to citizenship marks.the statute requires that a pupil receive the grade determined by the teacher of the course in the absence of clerical or mechanical mistake,fraud,bad faith,or incompetency,subd.a.appellants also urge that respondents exclusive remedy,if any,lay in a writ of administrative mandamus and that respondents failed to join indispensable parties,the parents of the students whose citizenship marks are at issue.we affirm.
the students whose grades are in issue,josh bernstein,pieter broodryk,and miles simon,attended ferris music class at the middle school during the fall semester of.they were in sixth grade at the time.the classes were discovery units of five weeks duration.bernstein and broodryk attended ferris music class from october,to november.in december,ferris sent progress reports to bernstein and broodryk parents informing them of their sons disruptive behavior.simon attended the class from november,to january.his misbehavior began during the last nine days of class,and ferris did not send a progress report home for that reason.grades for the courses were issued and mailed to the parents in february.all three students received a or b academically,but n needs improvement or u unsatisfactory for conduct.
the middle school faculty handbook encourages teachers to seek cooperation regarding classroom behavior by communicating directly with parents.teachers are instructed that they may not give an f to a student unless prior contact has been made to the student home in accordance with section,which requires the governing board of each school district to prescribe regulations requiring a conference or written report to the parent of each student in danger of failing a course.teachers at the middle school are required to give a mark for citizenship.if they fail to designate a grade,an s for satisfactory is recorded.
the parents of the three students contacted ferris in february.because of their poor conduct grades,the children were ineligible for the school honor society and were at risk of not being allowed to attend a school field trip.in each case,the parents also complained to the principal,botsford.in february,botsford changed the citizenship marks to s satisfactory,enabling the students to be eligible for honor society and to attend the class trip.
ferris filed a level i complaint with botsford,his immediate supervisor,concerning what ferris interpreted to be the improper changing of a grade.in march,botsford denied the complaint on the ground that the citizenship marks were the product of clerical or mechanical mistake pursuant to section because the parents of the children had not been contacted prior to the issuance of the grades.
ferris filed a level ii complaint.clark,the assistant superintendent for education,was named as hearing officer.according to clark,ferris met with clark and presented his case on april.clark ruled that botsford decision to change the grade on the grounds of mechanical mistake in failing to give the students parents prior notification was proper under section.

writ of administrative mandamus 
appellants contend that respondents request for injunctive and declaratory relief should have been rejected because a decision to change a grade may only be challenged by petition for a writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.section review lies when the decision challenged was the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal,board,or officer code,subd.a.
section sets forth the hearing procedures for a parent challenging the contents of a pupil record.the statute cites section,which prohibits the superintendent or school board from ordering a grade change unless the teacher who determined such grade is included in the procedure.section provides for a written request for correction before the district superintendent,a hearing before the superintendent,and,if the superintendent refuses the correction,an appeal to the governing board of the school district.review of a decision where a hearing has been held in accordance with those statutes is properly conducted pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.eureka teachers board of education d.
in the present case,the administrative proceeding was brought by the teacher who gave the original grade rather than by a parent.although section therefore does not apply,the procedure followed was at least as formal.the district provided a procedure pursuant to section of the district policy and procedures manual.that procedure includes a hearing before a hearing officer appointed by the superintendent of education,and the taking of evidence.review is by the board,and its decision is final.a hearing is not necessary to satisfy the hearing requirement of section of the code of civil procedure,so long as the agency is required to accept and consider evidence before making its decision.friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection th,d.judicial review of the board decision is proper pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.
relying upon topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles cal d,respondents urge that the board findings were insufficient to provide a basis for administrative mandamus review.we disagree.topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles,supra,holds that implicit in section is a requirement that the agency which renders the challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.id.at.the findings,however,need not be stated with the formality required in judicial proceedings.id.at,fn.the board written findings,concluding that the citizenship marks were the result of a mechanical mistake because ferris failed to provide the parents prior notification of their sons unsatisfactory behavior is sufficient to bridge the analytic gap.
