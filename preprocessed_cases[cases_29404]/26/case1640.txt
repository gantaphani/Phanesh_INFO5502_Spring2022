in this case we consider whether a plaintiff who,on appeal,loses a plea to the jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity is entitled to a remand for an opportunity to cure the jurisdictional pleading defect.we conclude that when a pleading can not be cured of its jurisdictional defect,a plaintiff is not entitled to amend.additionally,we must interpret section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code to determine whether appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider a government official appeal of a trial court denial of a plea to the jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity.we conclude that section a vests appellate courts with such jurisdiction.

background 
in,while still employed by texas a m,koseoglu began moonlighting for a private business enterprise he partially owned.in early,soon after mclellan became koseoglu supervisor,koseoglu requested permission to continue his outside employment.mclellan denied koseoglu request.koseoglu nevertheless continued the outside employment and,in october,mclellan informed koseoglu that his employment would be terminated at the end of the following month.seeking to negotiate the terms of his dismissal,koseoglu sent a letter to the general counsel of the texas a m university system on december.in the letter,koseoglu proposed that he be permitted to remain in his position until august and receive certain other financial and benefits.the letter included a blank signature line,under the word agreed,which was then signed by an attorney in the texas a m general counsel office.on january,koseoglu counsel sent a proposed draft of the final agreement to the texas a m general counsel office.the final agreement was never signed.koseoglu counsel later wrote to the texas a m general counsel office that,by refusing to execute the january settlement documents,the texas a m university system was in breach of the december agreement.
in april,koseoglu sued mclellan and texas a m for breach of contract,asserting they breached the alleged december agreement between koseoglu and texas a texas a m and mclellan each pled the affirmative defense of sovereign immunity and filed pleas to the jurisdiction.koseoglu filed a motion for summary judgment,contending in part that texas a m and mclellan sovereign immunity had been waived for his breach of contract action because it had been waived for an underlying action under in which koseoglu asserted a denial of due process with respect to his employment contract with texas a four months after texas a m and mclellan filed their pleas to the jurisdiction,the trial court denied them.before the trial court ruled on koseoglu motion for summary judgment,texas a m and mclellan each filed an interlocutory appeal.the court of appeals reversed the trial court denial of texas a m plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed mclellan interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction.at.the court of appeals concluded that governmental entities do not waive their immunity from suit in texas by accepting benefits under a contract,and that koseoglu pleadings against texas a m did not fit the narrow exception suggested by the plurality in texas a m lawson,because koseoglu underlying section claim was not one for which sovereign immunity had been waived.at.thus,the court of appeals held koseoglu breach of contract claim was barred by texas a m sovereign immunity from suit and remanded the case to the trial court,suggesting it might be possible for koseoglu to state some entirely different claim for which sovereign immunity might have been waived with respect to the termination of the relationship.id.at.with respect to mclellan appeal,the court of appeals held that,while section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code vested it with interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over a jurisdictional plea filed by state officials whose positions are derived from the texas constitution,the statute did not give it authority to review interlocutory orders on jurisdictional pleas filed by all other state officials,such as mclellan.id.at.both texas a m and mclellan then timely appealed the court of appeals decision to this court.
texas a m and mclellan argue the court of appeals erred on dual grounds.first,they contend the court of appeals erred in concluding it was without interlocutory appellate jurisdiction to review the jurisdictional plea filed by mclellan,a state official acting in his official capacity.second,they argue the court of appeals should have dismissed koseoglu breach of contract claim after it concluded it was barred by sovereign immunity,rather than remand it to the trial court.we first consider texas a m and mclellan second issue.
ii.koseoglu suit against texas a m 
koseoglu argues texas a m waived its sovereign immunity from suit on his section due process claims and therefore,under lawson,at,texas a m immunity has been waived in this breach of contract case as well.in lawson,a plurality of this court held a plaintiff claim for breach of an agreement settling his underlying whistleblower act claim was encompassed within the legislature decision to waive immunity for whistleblower act claims.id.at.but the court of appeals correctly held that the state and its officials sued in their official capacities are immune from money damages sought in a section claim unless they waive their immunity.at citing will.dep t of police,d.it is up to the legislature to institute such a waiver,and to date it has not seen fit to do so.see.natural res.conservation comm.thus,as the court of appeals held,koseoglu never had an actionable section claim against texas a m and,therefore,his pleadings are deficient in the sense that lawson is not implicated.
however,rather than dismiss koseoglu lawsuit against texas a m,the court of appeals reversed the trial court denial of texas a m plea to the jurisdiction and remanded the cause to the trial court so that koseoglu could amend his pleadings.at.it is true that a plaintiff deserves a reasonable opportunity to amend unless the pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction.harris county sykes.dep t of parks and wildlife miranda,county of cameron brown.thus,the issue is whether koseoglu has already been afforded that opportunity.if not,we agree that he deserves the opportunity if his pleadings can be cured.
koseoglu argues a plaintiff is not required to amend his pleadings until they are determined by a court to be deficient.thus,he contends he should now be provided an opportunity to amend.texas a m,on the other hand,argues the plaintiff opportunity to amend should come after the governmental entity files its plea to the jurisdiction,which puts the plaintiff on notice of alleged defects in his pleadings,but before the trial court takes any definitive action.accordingly,texas a m contends,because koseoglu had four months to amend his pleadings after it filed its jurisdictional plea,no further opportunity is warranted.otherwise,texas a m argues,suits against governmental entities could be appealed at least twice before final to obtain a reversal and remand,and a second time after the remand is ordered.
the court of appeals sided with koseoglu,concluding a plaintiff may stand on his pleadings in the face of a plea to the jurisdiction unless and until a court determines that the plea is meritorious.at citing county of cameron,at.thereafter,the court of appeals held,the plaintiff must be given a reasonable opportunity to amend his pleadings to attempt to cure the jurisdictional defects found unless the pleadings are incurably defective.id.citing sykes,at.dep t of transp.ramirez.thus,the court of appeals concluded,koseoglu has not been given a reasonable opportunity to amend his pleadings because the trial court never found merit in texas a m jurisdictional plea.id.
on this point,we generally agree with the court of appeals.texas a m proposed rule would essentially allow governmental entities the unjust advantage of being not only a litigant,but also the judge of the plaintiff pleadings.we decline to adopt such a rule.thus,we agree that koseoglu deserves the opportunity to amend his pleadings if the defects can be cured.
but koseoglu pleading defects can not be cured,and he has made no suggestion as to how to cure the jurisdictional defect.as is the case with special exceptions,a pleader must be given an opportunity to amend in response to a plea to the jurisdiction only if it is possible to cure the pleading defect.see baylor sonnichsen,generally,when the trial court sustains special exceptions,it must give the pleader an opportunity to amend the pleading,unless the pleading defect is of a type that amendment can not cure.remanding this case would serve no legitimate purpose because koseoglu underlying claim is a breach of contract claim.merely pleading more facts in support of the breach of contract claim will not overcome texas a m immunity from suit.koseoglu advances a argument,that texas a m waived its immunity from suit by accepting benefits under its alleged contract with koseoglu,but we have consistently rejected that position and held that the state does not waive its immunity from a action by accepting the benefits of a contract.servs.comm insulation,see,catalina dev.county of el paso,travis county pelzel,at federal sign.and absent special statutory permission,a party can not pursue a breach of contract action against the state without first obtaining consent from the legislature under chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code,at concluding that there is but one route to the courthouse for claims against the state,and that route is through the legislature.accordingly,the court of appeals erred when it concluded koseoglu,who has not obtained legislative consent to sue,may be able to state a cause of action for which sovereign immunity has been waived and remanded the cause to give koseoglu an opportunity to amend.see miranda,at instructing that a plaintiff suit should be dismissed when either the pleadings alone or the jurisdictional evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff suit incurably falls outside any waiver of sovereign immunity.
iii.appellate jurisdiction over mclellan interlocutory appeal 
absent the state consent to suit,a trial court has no jurisdiction over claims against the state.dep t of transp.jones.appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider immediate appeals of interlocutory orders only if a statute explicitly provides such jurisdiction.stary debord.in this case,the court of appeals held it was without jurisdiction to hear mclellan appeal pursuant to section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code.at.this question of jurisdiction is a question of law,which we review de novo.state holland.
our sole objective in construing section a is to give effect to the legislature intent.monsanto cornerstones mun.util.in determining the legislature intent,we begin by looking to the plain meaning of the statute words.liberty mut.ins.garrison contractors.section a contains two provisions that could arguably be relevant to interlocutory appeals of jurisdictional decisions relating to sovereign immunity 
a person may appeal from an interlocutory order of a district court,county court at law,or county court that 
denies a motion for summary judgment that is based on an assertion of immunity by an individual who is an officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision of the state 
grants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit as that term is defined in section 
section of the civil practice and remedies code defines governmental unit as 
a this state and all the several agencies of government that collectively constitute the government of this state,including other agencies bearing different designations,and all departments,bureaus,boards,commissions,offices,agencies,councils,and courts 
b a political subdivision of this state,including any city,county,school district,junior college district,levee improvement district,drainage district,irrigation district,water improvement district,water control and improvement district,water control and preservation district,freshwater supply district,navigation district,conservation and reclamation district,soil conservation district,communication district,public health district,and river authority 
c an emergency service organization and 
d any other institution,agency,or organ of government the status and authority of which are derived from the constitution of texas or from laws passed by the legislature under the constitution.
we strictly construe section a as a narrow exception to the general rule that only final judgments are appealable.bally total fitness jackson.
had mclellan filed a motion for summary judgment based on an assertion of official immunity,he clearly would be permitted under section a to appeal an interlocutory denial of his motion for summary judgment.but mclellan did not file such a motion in the trial court and instead asserts a right under section a to appeal the trial court interlocutory denial of his plea to the jurisdiction.while it is clear that the legislature intended only a few and distinct classes of persons to be permitted to bring interlocutory appeals in only a few narrowly drawn situations,there is considerable conflict among the courts of appeals about when state officials qualify to do so.some courts of appeals have concluded interlocutory review of a plea to the jurisdiction is not available under section a when state officials are sued in their official capacities because a state official is an individual rather than a governmental unit.see,castleberry indep.sch.dist.doe,worth,pet.dism dallas county cmty.coll.dist.bolton,no pet.of houston elthon,dist,pet.dism.a second group has held all state officials are entitled under section a to appeal a trial court interlocutory ruling on a jurisdictional plea because a state official qualifies as a governmental unit in the sense that he stands in the shoes of the state.see,de mino sheridan,dist,no pet.smith lutz,no pet.potter county attorney office stars stripes sweepstakes,no pet.nueces county ferguson,christi,no pet.straddling that split is the court of appeals in this case,which held some state officials,such as a county sheriff,are entitled to appeal a trial court interlocutory order on a plea to the jurisdiction because their positions are governmental units by virtue of the fact that they are derived from the texas constitution.at citing.const.art.v.gov t code d.those officials who are not so situated must rely instead,under the court holding,on a motion for summary judgment under section a because they are considered individuals rather than governmental units.id.
