plaintiff and appellant,a minor,by and through her guardian ad litem maria,appeals from an order dismissing her complaint with prejudice following the trial court order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend filed by defendant and respondent los angeles unified school district district.the trial court found that complaint was barred by her failure to present a claim or seek to present a late claim within the time limits specified by government code sections and,respectively.though we are dismayed by the result that has no immediate recourse against the district for its own and its employee abhorrent conduct,we must affirm the judgment.neither presented a claim within six months of the accrual of her cause of action,nor sought leave to present a late claim within one year of accrual.moreover,there is no basis for her to amend her complaint to allege that her cause of action did not accrue by reason of either delayed discovery or equitable estoppel.
factual and procedural background 
on appeal from a judgment of dismissal following a demurrer sustained without leave to amend,we assume the truth of all facts,as well as those that are judicially noticeable howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th,d,blank kirwan cal d.
according to the complaint,middle school teacher ignacio castro repeatedly sexually molested between and,when she was ages to.judicially noticed documents showed that for much of that period mother was aware that had been ditching her classes and spending the time in castro classroom.she had and castro sign a form stating that they would not have contact with each other.she also discussed the matter with an assistant school principal,telling him that she does not want inside castro classroom because she suspected for a long time that something was going on between and castro.the assistant principal responded that he could not do anything if,herself,was not alleging any misconduct on castro part.finally,in july,mother expressed her concerns about castro to the district in writing,indicating that he had no business being near her daughter and that she was worried about her daughter safety.castro was arrested on august,and subsequently convicted and imprisoned for his sexual abuse of 
on september,presented her claim for damages against the district.the district rejected it as untimely on september.on october,applied for permission to present a late claim,which the district likewise rejected as untimely.
in december,by and through her guardian ad litem,filed her complaint against the district and castro,as well as a separate action seeking relief from the claim presentation requirement.she alleged causes of action for as five separate causes of action for negligent hiring,retention and supervision negligence in the failure to take reasonable protective measures negligence in the breach of duties arising from a special relationship negligent breach of fiduciary duty and a negligent violation of statutory well as causes of action for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,sexual assault and sexual battery.in january,the trial court granted petition,thereby relieving her from the claim requirement and permitting her to proceed on her complaint.
the district demurred,primarily on the ground that failed to comply with the tort claims act in that she neither presented a written claim within six months of the accrual of her cause of action,nor applied for leave to file a late claim within one year of accrual,in her opposition to the demurrer,argued that code of civil procedure section section,which permits an individual to commence a cause of action alleging childhood sexual abuse up to eight years after the individual attains the age of majority,must be construed to provide that her cause of action would the reached the age of majority.in view of this statute,she argued that she was not required to present a claim at this time because her cause of action had not yet accrued.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that causes of action against the los angeles unified school district are barred as a matter of law because plaintiff failed to timely comply with the requirements of the california tort claims act and t he timeliness of a claim against a public entity for childhood sexual abuse is governed by government code section,not code of civil procedure section.the trial court ordered that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice.this appeal followed.
discussion 
contends that the trial court erred in sustaining the district demurrer and dismissing her case,for two independent reasons.first,she contends that the limitations period for filing her complaint is governed solely by section and that legislative history shows she is entitled to rely on that provision without regard to the claims filing requirement.she asserts that her claim was timely given the accrual date of her cause of action dictated by section.second,she contends that the doctrines of delayed discovery and equitable estoppel mandated delaying the accrual of her cause of action and that she should have been permitted leave to amend to allege facts supporting the application of those doctrines.

having independently reviewed the complaint and the documents which requested that we judicially notice,we conclude that the trial court properly sustained the district demurrer without leave to amend.we find that a timely government claim is a prerequisite to maintaining this action against the district,notwithstanding the provisions of section.the record shows that neither presented a written claim within six months of when her cause of action accrued nor applied for leave to file a late claim within one year of accrual.moreover,we find no abuse of discretion in denying leave to amend,as the record shows that complaint could not be amended to allege facts supporting either delayed discovery or equitable estoppel.
i.the tort claims act.
according to government code section,subdivision a,all governmental liability is governed by statute,subd.a creason department of health services cal th,d,the california tort claims act provides that a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute.as explained in curtis county of los angeles th,d curtis,governmental entities are immune from being sued unless the legislature has specifically provided otherwise.the tort claims act sets forth the limited circumstances under which the state and other political subdivisions may be sued and the applicable procedural requirements.
government code section et,part of the tort claims act,prescribes the manner in which public entities may be sued.chalmers county of los angeles d.government code section provides that no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented in accordance with government code section until a written claim therefore has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the public entity board,or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board stockett association of cal.water agencies joint powers ins.authority cal th,d,stockett.the purposes of the claim filing requirement are to give notice to the public entity so it will have a timely opportunity to investigate the claim and determine the facts and to give the public entity an opportunity to settle meritorious claims thereby avoiding unnecessary lawsuits.san diego unified port dist.superior court d.accord stockett,supra,at,d.
government code section requires that personal injury claims against a public entity be filed not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.alternatively,a late claim may be presented within a reasonable time after accrual,not to exceed one year.if the application to file a late claim is denied,a plaintiff may petition the court for an order relieving her from the claims presentation requirement.no action for money damages may be brought against a public entity unless a written claim has been presented to the entity and acted upon,or relief is granted from the claims requirements.
the date of accrual of a cause of action marks the starting point for calculating the claims presentation period,mosesian county of fresno d.the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises.citation.in other words,it sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements citations the elements being generically referred to by sets of terms such as wrongdoing or wrongful conduct,cause or causation,and harm or injury citations.norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart see also mosesian county of fresno,supra,at.a cause of action normally accrues when under the substantive law the wrongful act is done and the liability or obligation arises,that is,when action may be brought.a cause of action accrues for purposes of the filing requirements of the tort claims act on the same date a similar action against a nonpublic entity would be deemed to accrue for purposes of applying the relevant statute of limitations.john oakland unified school dist.cal d,fn,john accord santee santa clara county office of education d.
as explained in john,the time of accrual is particularly significant in the context of the claims statutes.john,supra,cal d at.this is because contrary to the general rule that the time during which the individual who sustained injury is a minor is not part of the time limited for commencement of the action code civ,subd.a,the time of minority is counted in determining whether a claim was timely presented following accrual of a minor cause of action against a public entity.code civ,subd.b,subd.c john,supra,at,fn,curtis,supra,th at,d.
ii.failure to comply with the tort claims act bars her complaint.
the trial court sustained the district demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that failure to timely comply with the requirements of the tort claims act barred her action.it further determined that t he timeliness of a claim against a public entity for childhood sexual abuse is governed by government code section,not code of civil procedure section.on appeal,renews the argument rejected by the trial court that section sets the date of accrual of her cause of action at or beyond the age of majority,thereby rendering her claim timely.we agree with the trial court.
in pertinent part,section provides a in an action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse,the time for commencement of the action shall be within eight years of the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority or within three years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse,whichever period expires later,for any of the following actions an action for liability against any person or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff,where a wrongful or negligent act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse which resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.code civ,subd.a.contends that the plain language of this provision shows that her cause of action had not yet accrued,and would accrue,at the earliest,when she reached the age of majority.see,estate of griswold cal th,d,if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,the plain meaning of the language governs.
in making this argument,confounds the principles of limitations periods and accrual dates.fox ethicon,cal th,d,clarified the distinction between and purposes of the two concepts statute of limitations is the collective term applied to acts or parts of acts that prescribe the periods beyond which a plaintiff may not bring a cause of action.citations.there are several policies underlying such statutes.one purpose is to give defendants reasonable repose,thereby protecting parties from defending stale claims,where factual obscurity through the loss of time,memory or supporting documentation may present unfair handicaps.citations.a statute of limitations also stimulates plaintiffs to pursue their claims diligently.citations.a countervailing factor,of course,is the policy favoring disposition of cases on the merits rather than on procedural grounds.citations.a plaintiff must bring a claim within the limitations period after accrual of the cause of action.code civ,civil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title,after the cause of action shall have accrued norgart,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,statutes of limitation do not begin to run until a cause of action accrues.romano rockwell,cal th,d.generally speaking,a cause of action accrues at the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements.citations.
keeping these principles in mind,we conclude that while section extends the time during which an individual may commence a cause of action alleging childhood sexual abuse,it does not extend the time for accrual of that cause of action.rather,as cases decided both before and after the enactment of section have confirmed,a civil cause of action for child molestation generally accrues at the time of the molestation.doe bakersfield city school dist.th,fn,d accord,john,supra,cal d at,ortega pajaro valley unified school dist.th,d christopher mojave unified school dist.th,d christopher.where the molestation is continuous,accrual is measured from the date of the last molestation.ortega pajaro valley unified school,supra,at,d.applied here,the outside date of accrual is august,when castro was arrested.presented her claim for damages and applied for permission to file a late claim on september and october,well beyond the and time limits afforded by government code sections and.
we are not persuaded by argument that the legislature expansion of section over time,coupled with the statute current application to any person or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff,demands that we construe it to apply to the district notwithstanding the requirements of the tort claims act.see code civ,subd.a,italics added.rather,we agree with the reasoning in county of los angeles superior court th,d,where the court rejected a substantially similar argument that the time period set forth in section trumped the time period in government code section,which requires that an action against a public entity be filed within six months after denial of a claim.see curran mount diablo council of the boy scouts cal th,d,court is properly guided by principles set forth in prior california decisions construing statute at issue.there,one and years after her claim had been denied,the plaintiff filed an action against the county of los angeles county alleging that she had been sexually assaulted while housed in a juvenile facility,supra,at,d.in denying the county summary judgment motion,the trial court adopted the position advances it found that the timeliness of this action was governed by the statute of limitations set forth in section rather than section and observed that section is more specific and expressly states that its special limitations period applies to actions against an entity,supra,at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.it briefly traced the evolution of section,acknowledging that the statute had been expanded in to permit its liberalized limitations period to apply to persons and entities other than the actual abuser,supra,th at,d.but the court found that despite this expansion,nothing in that statute or the legislative history of the amendment to that statute reflects an intent on the part of the legislature to excuse victims of childhood sexual abuse from complying with the tort claims act when the defendant is a public entity or public employee,supra,at,d.the court deemed the legislature to be aware of code of civil procedure section,which it did when section was a n action against a public entity upon a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented must be commenced within the time provided in section of the government code.code civ,supra,at,d.the court found it significant that the legislature failed to provide an express exemption from the government code provision in amending section if the legislature had intended to relieve victims of childhood sexual abuse of the need to comply with the act when suing a public entity,as opposed to a private entity,it would have said so.its failure to do so evinces its intent that victims of childhood sexual abuse comply with the act as a precursor to suing a public entity or public employee,supra,at,d.
by analogy,we must presume that the legislature was aware of both government code claims provisions and judicial decisions concerning the accrual date for civil actions involving the sexual abuse of a minor at the time it amended section to apply to any entity owing a duty of care,viola department of managed health care th,d it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that t he legislature is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof.accordingly,if the legislature had intended for section either to override the claims requirement or to alter the accrual date for actions by minors alleging sexual abuse,it would have said so.see castro sacramento county fire protection dist.th,d court declined to construe noncontroversial amendments to code of civil procedure section to create a means by which a plaintiff may escape the government code limitations period,as the legislature would have expressed such a radical change in legal procedure in unambiguous language.indeed,the legislature has previously employed unambiguous language to evidence its intent to carve out an exception to the claims requirements.see,subd.c in computing period for the time within which to file an application to present a late claim,time is not counted during which the person is detained or adjudged to be a dependent child of the juvenile court.
also points to language in section,subdivision c that the statute applies n otwithstanding any other provision of law as a clear indication of legislative intent to avoid the claims requirement.section,subdivision c,however,has limited application to the revival of certain actions that were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations before the amendments to section became effective.it provides in full notwithstanding any other provision of law,any claim for damages described in paragraph or of subdivision a that is permitted to be filed pursuant to paragraph of subdivision b that would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired,is revived,and,in that case,a cause of action may be commenced within one year of january.nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of january.code civ,subd.c.because claim could not have been barred as of january,since it did not accrue until the last molestation in august,section,subdivision c has no application to this action.
finally,contends that the express reference to a school district in the legislative history of the amendments to section unequivocally shows that the district should be subject to an action alleging sexual abuse,regardless of the provisions of the tort claims act.again,we disagree.at the time of the amendments,section required that an action for childhood sexual abuse brought against the abuser be commenced within eight years of the date the plaintiff attained the age of majority or within three years of the date the plaintiff discovered or reasonably should have discovered that the psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by sexual abuse,whichever occurred later.stats,ch,bill.it further provided that actions against third parties who were not the actual abuser could not be commenced after the plaintiff reached age.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.
senate bill created an exception to the restriction on actions and provided that a plaintiff may commence such an action beyond age,within three years of discovery of the injury or illness caused by the abuse,when the third party knew or had reason to know of complaints against an employee or agent for unlawful sexual conduct and failed to take reasonable steps to avoid similar unlawful conduct by that employee or agent in the future.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.the bill also revived causes of action solely for those claims for a period of one year,under certain circumstances.ibid.in discussing why the limitations period should be extended for actions against persons and entities who knew of prior claims of abuse but failed to take steps to prevent future abuse,the senate judiciary report stated general theories of negligence impose a duty of care where a third person or entity has assumed some responsibility,through a relationship or otherwise,for a person conduct or a person safety.an employer thus bears a duty of care to third parties for the conduct of an employee engaging in acts related to his employment,but not for acts unrelated to that employment.similarly,a school district,church,or other organization engaging in the care and custody of a child owes a duty of care to that child to reasonably ensure its safety.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.
contends that this discussion demonstrates that the legislature intended for school districts to be subject an elongated limitations periods for actions alleging sexual abuse and argues that imposing a claim requirement would unreasonably thwart the legislature expressed goal see,hutnick united states fidelity guaranty cal d,fn,committee reports are a valid source for determining legislative intent.but in extending the time for commencement of certain actions against third parties beyond the time when the plaintiff reached age,the legislature admittedly addressed only those actions that were subject to delayed discovery by the plaintiff.as explained in the senate judiciary committee report this bill would provide that the absolute age of limitation for actions against a third party section b does not apply,and the broader within three years of discovery statute of limitations in subdivision a applies,in claims against third parties com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.the effect of delayed discovery,however,is to delay accrual of the cause of action.curtis,supra,th at,d see also section,post.thus,where a cause of action for sexual abuse has not yet accrued because of delayed discovery,the date of accrual and,in turn,the time for both presenting a claim and commencing the cause of action is extended.see curtis,supra,d reversing a demurrer sustained without leave to amend to permit minor plaintiff to allege facts sufficient to invoke the equitable delayed discovery rule of accrual,under which plaintiff claim would be deemed
