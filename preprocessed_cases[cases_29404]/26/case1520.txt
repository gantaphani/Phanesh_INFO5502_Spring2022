how to properly educate our children in the public schools is a complex question with no simple answer.ultimately,the resolution of this question is for the parents of those children,their teachers,their school boards,and the legislature,not the courts.see peter san francisco unified sch.dist.d.peter.
one way our legislature has chosen to address concerns over the public education of our children is to enact the charter schools act of et the charter schools act allows teachers,parents,pupils,and community members to establish and maintain schools that operate independently from the existing school district structure.by enacting this statute,the legislature hoped to improve pupil learning,increase learning opportunities,encourage innovation in our public schools,create professional opportunities for teachers,provide expanded choices of educational opportunities,hold schools accountable for their performance,and p rovide vigorous competition within the public school system.
in this opinion,we hold charter school students and their parents may not sue their public charter schools for violation of business and professions code section et,misrepresentation,or breach of contract based on allegations that their charter schools failed to deliver a proper public education.
the charter schools act,however,is not a license for a charter school to fraudulently obtain state funds free from judicial review.thus,we conclude the plaintiffs here have stated a cause of action under the california false claims act against several charter schools and their chartering school districts based on the allegation those schools request ed funding from the state of california,knowing that their ada average daily attendance records did not accurately reflect the students enrolled in and receiving instruction,educational materials,or services from their schools.
accordingly,we shall reverse the judgment in favor of defendants and remand the matter for further proceedings on the false claims act cause of action.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff joey wells and the other child plaintiffs enrolled in three different california charter summit academy,mattole valley charter school,and the camptonville academy collectively the charter schools.the charters for these schools were approved,respectively,by defendants sierra plumas joint unified school district sierra plumas jusd,mattole unified school district mattole usd and camptonville unified elementary school district camptonville uesd.plaintiffs allege the charter schools are under the control of defendants learning foundation and its alleged alter ego charter school resource alliance.
the plaintiff school children and their parents collectively wells sued the charter schools,the operators of these schools,and the school districts that authorized their charters.wells sought damages,equitable relief,and declaratory relief,asserting causes of action for violation of the false claims act violation of business and professions code section et intentional misrepresentation negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract wells also alleged this was a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all similarly situated students and parents.
at the core of this lawsuit,wells alleges defendants engage in a practice of defrauding parents,school districts,and the state by collecting more than million annually in educational funds to run charter schools without providing instruction and educational materials for which the funds were intended,and by overcharging for its services.
more specifically,wells alleges defendant and charter school resource alliance operate the charter schools as distance learning schools.in a distance learning school,the students study at home and lessons are typically completed by computer and sent to the school via the internet.students are also tested in this manner.wells alleges the charter schools method of providing education includes providing students with a computer,educational software,textbooks,and reimbursement for money spent on educational materials.charter school funding is based upon the average daily attendance or ada of the pupils who attend the schools.the manner in which it is calculated is provided for in sections and.charter schools receive their funding from the state based upon their ada.
wells alleges the charter schools use educational facilitators who may or may not be credentialed teachers to administer their programs.wells alleges the charter schools and the educational facilitators made a number of promises to the children and their parents about delivering education to their children but failed to provide instructors,computers,and educational materials.
for example,plaintiff joey wells enrolled at sierra summit academy from october to june.joey wells educational facilitator promised him and his parents a computer,textbooks,tests,reimbursement for sports team involvement,and instruction.according to wells,sierra summit academy never delivered a computer or textbooks.the only thing the educational facilitator did for him was to provide computer software that was available free on the internet and to come by regularly to obtain wells parents signatures on school attendance records.wells alleges his father provided all of joey wells education at his own expense.although joey wells had not received a computer,textbooks,software,instruction and his father spent the year home schooling his son,sierra summit academy collected the state money for his schooling.
plaintiffs katie,karen,and joey pell also enrolled at sierra summit academy from june to september.plaintiff merlyn adams enrolled in the mattole valley charter school from august to october.plaintiffs chris,audrey,and david crescenti enrolled in the camptonville academy from august through december.their stories were similar to that of joey wells.
wells alleges the school districts turn a blind eye to the charter schools abuses of the system because they are poor rural districts that need the money.wells alleges the school districts receive significantly more of the state ada payment for the students than the charter school act allows.wells alleges the school district defendants have failed to properly monitor the charter schools.
pursuant to the requirements of the false claims act,wells filed the complaint under seal.upon the attorney general request,the complaint was unsealed.several of the defendants filed three separate demurrers to the first amended complaint.
after hearing,the trial court concluded the charter schools were public entities.the trial court further concluded the gravamen of each of the causes of action at issue here was a challenge to the quality of the education the plaintiff children received from these public schools.based upon the rule that bars claims for educational malfeasance against public schools peter,supra,d,the court concluded each of wells causes of action at issue here was barred and sustained defendants demurrers to these causes of action without leave to amend.the trial court also sustained defendants demurrers to these causes of action without leave to amend based on other theories and with leave to amend based upon the failure of wells to properly plead compliance with the california tort claims act wells appeals 
discussion 
istandard of review 
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint,and the granting of leave to amend involves the trial court discretion.therefore,an appellate court employs two separate standards of review on appeal.citations.first,the complaint is reviewed de novo to determine whether it contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action.citation.in doing so,we accept as true the properly pleaded material factual allegations of the complaint,together with facts that may be properly judicially noticed.reversible error exists only if facts were alleged showing entitlement to relief under any possible legal theory.citations.hernandez city of pomona th,d.
second,where the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,reviewing courts determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in doing so.citations.on review of the trial court refusal to grant leave to amend,we will only reverse for abuse of discretion if we determine there is a reasonable possibility the pleading can be cured by amendment.otherwise,the trial court decision will be affirmed for lack of abuse.hernandez city of pomona,supra,th at,d.
business and professions code section et unfair competition law ucl 
wells argues the trial court erred in dismissing his cause of action under the ucl.we disagree.
the ucl does not apply to public entities 
the trial court sustained defendants demurrers to wells ucl cause of action based on the conclusion defendants were all public entities and thus exempt from the ucl.we conclude the trial court did not err.
business and professions code section provides that a ny person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.civil penalties may also be imposed on a ny person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition.bus.

in community memorial hospital county of ventura th,d,division six of the second district court of appeal concluded a county was not a person within this definition and thus the ucl did not apply to the county.the court started with the proposition that the term county was not listed within the express words of the statute.id.at,d.further,the court noted a county is neither a person,nor a corporation,nor a municipal corporation it is a subdivision of the state.ibid.the court explained,i n the absence of express words to the contrary,neither the state nor its subdivisions are included within the general words of a statute.citations.but this rule excludes governmental agencies from the operation of general statutory provisions only if their inclusion would result in an infringement upon sovereign governmental powers.where no impairment of sovereign powers would result,the reason underlying this rule of construction ceases to exist and the legislature may properly be held to have intended that the statute apply to governmental bodies even though it used general statutory language only.citations.citations.id.at,d.the court concluded,there can be no dispute that guarding the public health is within the county sovereign powers.the operation of a public hospital,even one that accepts paying patients,is simply a means of implementing that power.thus,inclusion of the county in the ucl as it relates to the operation of its hospital would result in an infringement on its sovereign powers.ibid.
in trinkle california state lottery th,d,we concluded the state lottery commission was not a person for purposes of the ucl.we noted,nowhere in the ucl is there a provision imposing governmental liability for violations of the act.because there is no statute making public entities liable under the ucl,the general rule of governmental immunity must prevail.id.at,d.
other courts have similarly concluded public entities are not persons for purposes of the ucl.california medical regents of university of california th,d university of california at los angeles janis california state lottery com.th,d state lottery commission santa monica rent control bd.bluvshtein d.rent control board.
in light of the purposes underlying the ucl,we conclude these courts correctly decided governmental agencies are not subject to that statutory scheme.the ucl is designed to preserve fair competition among business competitors and protect the public from nefarious and unscrupulous business practices.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.the government is not in business.thus,logically,it is not a person for purposes of the ucl.
the rationale of these cases applies to causes of action against our public schools.schools and school districts are not listed in the ucl list of entities that are persons and subject to that statutory scheme.just as guarding the public health is an inherent part of the sovereign power community memorial hospital county of ventura,supra,th at,d,so too is providing for the education of our children.kirchmann lake elsinore unified school dist.th,d.thus,public schools and public school districts are exempt from the ucl.
the defendants are public entities 
the conclusion that public schools and public school districts are not persons for purposes of the ucl takes us to the next question.are charter schools and their operators public entities and,therefore,likewise not persons under the ucl like the trial court,we conclude they are.
charter schools are grounded in concepts such as improvement,employee empowerment and customer focus.but they remain very much a creature,with requirements of accountability and equity.simple in theory,complex in practice,charter schools promise academic results in return for freedom from bureaucracy.wilson state bd.of education th,d wilson.
the enabling legislation for charter schools evidences the legislature intent that charter schools are part of the public school system,and hence public entities.in its list of the goals for the charter school system,the legislature stated charter schools would p rovide vigorous competition within the public school system to stimulate continual improvements in all public schools,subd.g,italics added.
moreover,from cradle to grave,charter schools derive their existence,operating restrictions,and funding from the public entities charged with the education of our children.initially,charter schools are formed by the approval of a petition submitted to the governing board of the local school district,a county board of education,or the state board of education.these authorities may grant the school an initial charter for a period of not more than five years.further,these public entities may renew the charter for additional periods.
as far as their daily operations are concerned,charter schools may elect to operate as,or be operated by,a nonprofit public benefit corporation,formed and organized pursuant to the nonprofit public benefit corporation law,subd.a.for any charter school that elects to operate in this manner,the governing board of a school district that grants a charter shall be entitled to a single representative on the board of directors of the nonprofit public benefit corporation,subd.b.
we reject wells contention that charter schools are not public entities because they are not subject to public oversight or accountable to the public school boards or the state department of education.once a charter is granted,it may be revoked by the authorizing agency or the state board of education for a number of reasons,including a violations of the conditions,standards,or procedures in the charter b failure to meet or pursue any of the pupil outcomes in the charter c failure to meet generally accepted accounting principles d fiscal mismanagement or e violation of any provision of law,which obviously includes all of the provisions of the charter schools act.
importantly,charter schools are required to promptly respond to all reasonable inquiries of their chartering authority,the county office of education,or the state superintendent of public instruction and to consult with them concerning these inquiries.charter schools are specifically required to respond to inquiries from these public entities regarding their financial records.ibid.upon the written complaints of parents,or other information that justifies an investigation,the county superintendent of schools may investigate a charter school.
to effectuate the public funding for charter schools,the legislature provided,a charter school shall be deemed to be under the exclusive control of the officers of the public schools for purposes of section of article ix of the california constitution,with regard to the appropriation of public moneys to be apportioned to any charter school,including,but not limited to,appropriations made for the purposes of this chapter,subd.a.further,the legislature declared,a charter school shall be deemed to be a school district for purposes of article commencing with section of chapter of part,section,section,article commencing with section of chapter of part,section,and sections and of article xvi of the california constitution,subd.c.
if the public attributes of their funding and oversight were not enough,the legislature explicitly stated,charter schools are part of the public school system,as defined in article ix of the california constitution.charter schools are under the jurisdiction of the public school system and the exclusive control of the officers of the public schools,as provided in this part,subd.a.
these statutory provisions establish the legislature created a public entity educational alternative to the existing public schools.
wilson,supra,th,d,further supports this conclusion.in a facial challenge to the charter schools act,the plaintiffs argued the charter schools act spun off a separate system of charter public schools that has administrative and operational independence from the existing school district structure.id.at,d.they also argued the charter schools act violated the constitutional provisions calling for public schools to be under the exclusive control of officers of the public school system,as well as under the jurisdiction of that system.id.at,d.
division four of the first district court of appeal rejected these challenges and concluded charter schools are part of the public school system under that school system jurisdiction.wilson,supra,th at,d.in holding the charter schools were part of the system of common schools provided for in the california constitution,the appellate court drew on the statutory language we have cited above which designates that charter schools are part of the public school system,under its jurisdiction,and entitled to full public funding.id.at,d.the court also concluded charter schools are part of this single public school system because they are free,nonsectarian,open to all students,and may not discriminate based on ethnicity,national origin,gender,or disability.ibid.while free of some of the bureaucratic apron strings of other public schools,charter schools must meet statewide standards and conduct pupil assessments applicable to pupils in public schools,must hire credentialed teachers,and are subject to state and local supervision and inspection.id.at,d.the court concluded that charter schools are public schools because,as explained above,charter schools are part of the public school system.id.at,d.
we find further support for the conclusion charter schools and their operators are public entities in the tort claims act definition of public entities.under government code section,public entities are defined to include the state,the regents of the university of california,a county,city,district,public authority,public agency,and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the state.school districts are public entities under this definition.wright compton unified sch.dist.d.obviously,the school district defendants plumas jusd,mattole usd,and camptonville school districts and therefore public entities under the explicit language of this section.similarly,charter schools are also defined as school districts,subd.c.thus,these defendants and the nonprofit public benefit corporations that run them are also public entities for purposes of the ucl.
finally,we reject wells claim the charter schools are not public entities because they are not listed on the roster of public agencies kept by the secretary of state office.while they are independently operated,we conclude the charter schools are subdivisions of their chartering authorities both because their existence and funding derives from those entities,and because they must answer to those entities to remain in existence.a subdivision of another public agency is not separately required to register with the secretary of state.hovd hayward unified sch.dist.d.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude all of the charter schools,their operators,and their chartering school public entities.consequently,they are not subject to the reach of the ucl.the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to this cause of action without leave to amend.
peter and the bar of educational malfeasance 
we next turn to plaintiffs causes of action for breach of contract and misrepresentation.we conclude these causes of action are barred by the doctrine of educational malfeasance.
the starting point is the seminal case of peter,supra,d,and its conclusion that educational malfeasance is not actionable.in peter,the plaintiff was a high school graduate of the san francisco unified school district.id.at.he sued the district claiming he was inadequately educated and graduated from school with only a reading ability.ibid.he alleged the district violated its mandatory duty to educate him.id.at.
because the defendant was a public entity,the court started with the premise that a public entity may be held vicariously liable for the conduct of its employee,under government code section,subdivision a only if it is established that the employee would be personally liable for the conduct upon some acceptable theory of liability.citation.peter,supra,d at.the court rejected the plaintiff claims he had stated a duty of care under the theory that the assumption of the function of education imposed the duty to exercise reasonable diligence in its discharge.id.at.further,the court rejected the plaintiff special relationship theory of liability,and his theory that educational institutions have a duty to exercise reasonable care in the supervision of children under their care.id.at.
the court turned to the factors of rowland christian cal d,to determine whether schools had a legally enforceable duty of care to the plaintiff.peter,supra,d at.the court stated,on occasions when the supreme court has opened or sanctioned new areas of tort liability,it has noted that the wrongs and injuries involved were both comprehensible and assessable within the existing judicial framework.citations.this is simply not true of wrongful conduct and injuries allegedly involved in educational malfeasance.unlike the activity of the highway or the marketplace,classroom methodology affords no readily acceptable standards of care,or cause,or injury.the science of pedagogy itself is fraught with different and conflicting theories of how or what a child should be taught,and any layman commonly his own emphatic views on the subject.the injury claimed here is plaintiff inability to read and write.substantial professional authority attests that the achievement of literacy in the schools,or its failure,are influenced by a host of factors which affect the pupil subjectively,from outside the formal teaching process,and beyond the control of its ministers.they may be physical,neurological,emotional,cultural,environmental they may be present but not perceived,recognized but not identified.id.at.the court continued,w e find in this situation no conceivable workability of a rule of care against which defendants alleged conduct may be measured citation,no reasonable degree of certainty that plaintiff suffered injury within the meaning of the law of negligence citation,and no such perceptible connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,as alleged,which would establish a causal link between them within the same meaning.id.at.
thus,the court concluded,t hese recognized policy considerations alone negate an actionable duty of care in persons and agencies who administer the academic phases of the public educational process to hold them to an actionable duty of care,in the discharge of their academic functions,would expose them to the tort or disaffected students and parents in countless numbers.they are already beset by social and financial problems which have gone to major litigation,but for which no permanent solution has yet appeared.citations.the ultimate consequences,in terms of public time and money,would burden calculation.peter,supra,d at.the court found the school district had no duty of care toward its students.ibid.the court also concluded the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for negligence.ibid.
for these same policy reasons,the court also rejected the plaintiff cause of action for negligent misrepresentation based upon the plaintiff allegations the school district falsely and fraudulently represented to plaintiff mother and natural guardian that plaintiff was performing at or near grade level in basic academic skills such as reading and writing.peter,supra,d at.the peter court concluded the plaintiff intentional misrepresentation claim was barred by government code section and also because of additional pleading deficiencies.ibid.
the courts have uniformly applied the logic and bar of peter to cases where plaintiffs have sued their public schools for educational malfeasance.see,brown compton unified school dist.th,d chevlin los angeles community college dist.d.chevlin tirpak los angeles unified school dist.d.tirpak.
in tirpak,the court extended the holding of peter to the complete withholding of any educational services when a child was allegedly unlawfully suspended from school.tirpak,supra,d at.the court held the wrongful total deprivation of education was not actionable because the court could find no principled distinction between a bad education and no education at all under the rule announced in peter id.at.
in chevlin,the plaintiff attempted an end run around the holding of peter by alleging a breach of contract in her claim against a community college when she was terminated from its nuclear medicine training program.chevlin,supra,d at.in concluding her contract cause of action was barred under the educational malfeasance doctrine,the court stated,we think it obvious that to permit chevlin to recover under a breach of contract theory based on educational nonfeasance would be tantamount to permitting her to sue for negligence which is precluded under the peter decision.whether framed as a negligence or breach of contract theory the harm which chevlin seeks to redress is the same.id.at.the chevlin court also concluded the plaintiff misrepresentation claim under government code section was barred.ibid.
we draw two lessons from these cases.first,a public school student may not sue a public school because that school failed to properly teach that student.ultimately,the students,parents,teachers,school boards,and the legislature must work together in the political and social arenas to resolve the problems within the educational system arising from the quality and manner in which education is delivered to our children.while that avenue of redress may have some potholes or closed for repair signs as suggested by wells,it is the basis for our democracy and the appropriate place for the resolution of these issues.
the second lesson we draw from these cases is no matter what the cause of action,if a plaintiff is suing a public school for damages based upon the quality of education or lack of education,that cause of action is barred.
breach of contract 
wells argues the trial court erred in dismissing the breach of contract cause of action.we disagree.
wells asserted breach of contract causes of action against the charter schools,but not the school district defendants.the complaint alleges the charters,oral representations,and individual agreements signed by each of the child and parent plaintiffs with these charter schools form a contract between them.the charters are attached as exhibits to the complaint and generally discuss the governance structure of the charter schools,their education philosophy,the method of education the schools would provide,the objectives for the students,the method by which students would be evaluated,and the areas of study.the individual agreements consist of enrollment application documents welcoming the children to the schools,describing the enrollment process,the strengths of the education process,and the expectations for the parents and for the schools.the individual agreements also contain courses of study,percentages of involvement for students,teachers and parents,and learning goals generally.wells alleges the charter schools made additional oral promises to provide computers,software,internet access,textbooks,curriculum,a learning plan,assessment,instruction,testing and evaluation,and reimbursement for educational expenses.wells alleges the charter schools breached these agreements by failing to fulfill these promises.
as should be evident from our discussion of peter,supra,d.and chevlin,supra,d at pages,a claim for educational malfeasance that is pled in the form of a breach of contract claim is barred by the educational malfeasance doctrine.here,the gravamen of wells breach of contract claim is that the charter schools failed to provide plaintiffs with an education.for this breach of contract,plaintiffs seek monetary damages.
whether this claim is phrased as a partial failure or a complete failure to educate these children,we conclude this claim is barred by the doctrine of educational malfeasance.it calls into play all of the issues identified by peter that led the court to refuse to allow a plaintiff to allege a cause of action for damages against his school for failing to teach him the lack of readily acceptable standards of care,causation,or injury.peter,supra,d at.it challenges the propriety of the educational method and raises the other unknowable factors that might have interfered with each of these children ability to learn.id.at.it raises the issue of the inability to place a measure of damages on these claims for lost learning or to even determine whether the educational method was the basis for any hypothetical educational injury.id.at.as a result,we conclude wells cause of action is barred.
even if we were persuaded wells breach of contract cause of action did not state a claim for educational malfeasance,we would not allow this cause of action to go forward.it is axiomatic that in order to plead a cause of action for breach of contract,there must be a contract between the parties.smith city and county of san francisco d.
i t bears underscoring that charter schools are strictly creatures of statute.from how charter schools come into being,to who attends and who can teach,to how they are governed and structured,to funding,accountability and legislature has plotted all aspects of their existence.wilson,supra,th at,d.the requirements for the petition for a charter and the requirement that the schools have and follow their charter are dictated by sections and.moreover,the particular individual agreements between the students and the schools concerning their independent study programs are also creatures of statute,tit.
as defendants point out,these agreements are fundamentally different from ordinary contracts because charter schools could not sue their students for breach of contract for failing to do their homework.likewise,charter school students can not sue their schools for doing a bad job in educating them.wells breach of contract cause of action fails.
intentional and negligent misrepresentation 
wells also repackaged the barred educational malfeasance claim as intentional and negligent misrepresentation causes of action.these claims also fail under the peter analysis.
wells complaint alleges the charter school defendants made promises to wells with the intent to induce wells to enroll in their educational programs.at the time defendants made these representations,they knew they were false,or they acted in reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of these statements.as a result of wells actual and reasonable reliance on these promises,wells has been damaged.wells damages include the parents expenses for educating their children,loss of educational experiences for the children,lost opportunity costs,and emotional distress.
these allegations are no more than a claim for monetary damages based on the contention the charter schools failed to provide the educational experience these children and their parents wanted.a misrepresentation claim is implicit in peter analysis of the duty of public schools.it is expected that charter schools will provide books,teachers,and a quality education to the children they enroll.the charter schools failure to provide these things constitutes educational malfeasance whether the expectations were raised explicitly or implicitly.whether in tort,contract,or fraud,this claim is barred by the doctrine of educational malfeasance.brown compton unified school,supra,th,d chevlin supra,d.tirpak,supra,d.peter,supra,d.the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to this cause of action.
false claims act 
wells contends the trial court also erred in concluding peter barred wells cause of action under the false claims act.accepting as true wells allegation the charter schools and school districts submitted ada funding requests to the state of california knowing they did not accurately reflect the students enrolled in and receiving instruction,educational materials,or services from these schools,we conclude wells false claim act cause of action is not for educational malfeasance and the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend as to this claim.
the false claims act provides for civil penalties against anyone who k nowingly presents or causes to be presented to an officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof,a false claim for payment or approval,subd.a.a private citizen may pursue a false claims act cause of action on behalf of the state or a political subdivision a person may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and either for the state of california in the name of the state,if any state funds are involved,or for a political subdivision in the name of the political subdivision,if political subdivision funds are exclusively involved.the person bringing the action shall be referred to as the qui tam plaintiff,subd.c.these lawsuits are commonly referred to as qui tam actions.the false claims act is designed to protect the public fisc from those who would defraud the government.levine weis th,d levine i.the false claims act must be construed broadly so as to give the widest possible coverage and effect to the prohibitions and remedies it provides in government code section.id.at,d.
in levine i,supra,the plaintiff brought an action for wrongful discharge against the ventura county superintendent of schools.th at,d.the plaintiff was a teacher at juvenile hall responsible for four locked classrooms covering between and students.id.at,d.in his complaint,the plaintiff alleged he had been discharged in violation of government code section of the false claims act because he had complained that the school district had failed to adequately staff the classrooms for which it was receiving state educational money.id.at,d.
the ventura county superintendent of schools claimed the false claims act did not apply to it because it was a governmental entity and not a person as defined under the false claims act,citing cases that conclude public entities are not persons under similar definitions.levine i,supra,th at,d.under the false claims act,a person includes any natural person,corporation,firm,association,organization,partnership,business,or trust,subd.e.
the court held the ventura county superintendent of schools could fall within the definition of a person as an association or organization.levine i,supra,th,at,d.the definition of person must be read in light of the context and purpose of the statute.there is no reason to conclude the legislature intended that the protection afforded to the public treasury by the false claims act be denied merely because the entity raiding the treasury is a governmental entity.id.at,d.
the levine i court distinguished community memorial hospital county of ventura,supra,th,d,which as we have already stated,concluded the ucl does not apply to a county hospital.the levine i court concluded,a county may have the sovereign power to fulfill its duty to guard the public health free from regulations that govern ordinary business.but no governmental agency has the power,sovereign or otherwise,knowingly to present a false claim.the very notion is repugnant to how government should operate by and for the people.levine i,supra,th at,d.thus,the appellate court held the false claims act applies to public entities.we agree 
defendants urge this court to conclude levine i is not instructive here because it was a wrongful termination action,and had nothing to do with educational malfeasance.we reject this argument.it is true levine i concerned the wrongful termination of an employee who reported false claims.th,d.but the court relied on the purpose behind the the public conclude the false claims act applied to public entities.id.at,d.that purpose distinguishes a false claims act cause of action where public entities are included from the ucl cause of action where public entities are excluded.moreover,the reasons for applying the logic of levine i to the facts of this case are even more compelling.here,wells seeks reimbursement for the state not for wells,thus fulfilling the fundamental purposes of the false claims act of protecting the public fisc.
we must now turn to the substance of the claims pled by wells to determine whether they constitute claims for educational malfeasance,claims for damages for the failure of the schools to educate them.wells false claims act cause of action asserts two bases for ada funds to which the charter schools were not entitled and specific violations of section.
receipt of funds to which they are not entitled 
we first turn to wells allegation the charter schools violated the false claims act because they request ed funding from school district defendants the state of california,knowing that their ada records did not accurately reflect the students enrolled in and receiving instruction,educational materials,or services from their schools,the actual cost of the materials and services to defendants,or the amounts that defendants were actually paying to or third parties to reimburse for their educational expenses.wells further claims the school district defendants claimed funds from the state of california on behalf of the charter schools.wells pled the school districts knew or deliberately or recklessly disregarded whether the public funds were being used for wrongful purposes.further,wells alleged the school districts wrongfully claimed funds in excess of what they were entitled under the charter schools act.
defendants attempt to characterize these allegations as challenging the adequacy of the educational experience received by the students and argue they raise only a claim of educational malfeasance that is barred by peter w.we disagree.we conclude these allegations are susceptible to the interpretation that these defendants have made false statements to the state to obtain state ada funds.
as we noted above,claims for educational malfeasance are barred because the wrongs and injuries are not comprehensible and assessable within our existing judicial framework.peter,supra,d at.classroom methodology poses no readily acceptable standards of care,or for causation,or for injury.ibid.other unrelated and unquantifiable factors may interfere with learning.ibid.reasonable people can and do disagree on the proper methods for education.for these reasons,the courts have declined to allow students and teachers to burden the school system with expensive and litigation.
here,none of these policy considerations enter the calculus of resolving wells false claims act cause of action.by this first theory,wells has simply alleged defendants have submitted false claims for ada funds for children to whom they have provided nothing more than the service of the timely collection of attendance sheet signatures.a charter school that seeks money from the state of california for doing nothing more than collecting attendance sheets from children has submitted a false claim to the state when it asserts it has provided those children with education.the gravamen of the wrong and injury alleged here is straightforward and defrauding of the state.the duty is to submit honest claims.the breach is submitting a false claim.the measure of the injury to the state is the funds the defendants obtained based upon their fraud.these are issues of the judicial system which are litigated on a daily b
