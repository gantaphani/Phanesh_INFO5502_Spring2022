background 
philip stotter,had been a tenured professor in the department of chemistry at utsa since.utsa provided him with a lab and an office to perform research,teach students,meet with colleagues,and otherwise perform the normal functions of being a faculty member.
in december of and january of,utsa inspected several labs in the chemistry department due to reports of potential health and safety hazards and,according to stotter,the possibility of activity associated with the lab of a colleague,budalur thayagarajan.richard garza,a utsa employee,informed weldon hammond,the director of earth and physical sciences and supervisor of the department of chemistry,that the labs of thayagarajan and stotter needed immediate attention.thayagarajan lab was in need of an emergency eye wash station and proper storage containers and two refrigerators required cleaning.stotter lab lacked personal protective equipment and proper storage containers and one refrigerator required cleaning.according to utsa,stotter was verbally notified that these deficiencies needed to be corrected.
on february,according to stotter,utsa determined that thayagarajan lab had big problems.several unidentified chemicals required special handling,some of which were toxic,and two refrigerators were in need of decontamination.in may and june of,according to stotter,utsa determined that the lab might also contain tnt and old ethers and that a bomb squad might have to remove these hazards.utsa eventually contracted with a company to clean the lab.
in december of,utsa conducted routine inspections of the faculty offices and determined that stotter office was an extreme fire hazard due to papers,trash,and boxes.stotter alleges that he was not present for this inspection,did not receive a copy of the report,and was not requested to take any action.according to utsa,he was verbally notified to clean his office.
in march of,utsa again inspected stotter lab and determined that some problems still needed attention.stotter alleges that he was not present for this inspection and did not receive a copy of the report until october or november of.it was later discovered that the report was emailed to stotter,but he was not using the utsa email system at the time.
in the summer of,stotter accepted a summer appointment at los alamos national laboratory in new mexico.during that time,he closed his lab.on august,while in new mexico,stotter sent a memo to utsa officials and members of the faculty addressing an ongoing dispute regarding his medical leave during and through.at one point in his memo,he referred to an administrative misuse of his benefits at utsa.
in october of,utsa again inspected stotter office and determined that problems still existed.hammond sent stotter an email requesting that he correct the situation as soon as possible.due to health issues,stotter was given until november,to clean his office.on october,utsa also advised stotter that he needed to address the issues regarding his lab to avoid closure.plans to clean his office subsequently fell through.on december,utsa conducted additional inspections of the labs and found that several labs,including stotter,still had problems.stotter alleges he did not receive this report until january.
on january,hammond sent stotter two letters indicating that he had violated utsa health and safety regulations,that he had been notified several times about these violations,and that utsa intended to remedy the situation with his office on january.the second letter indicated that provost guy bailey had been notified and was now involved.stotter responded with a letter to hammond,bailey,and utsa president ricardo romo,detailing his efforts to address these problems.he indicated that he had met with a safety officer about removing the chemicals from his lab and that several colleagues and students were going to help him clean his office sometime in the first week of january.by the end of the first week of january,however,the office had not yet been cleaned,and on january,utsa proceeded with its plans to clean it.stotter tried to halt the cleanup effort and caused such a disturbance that utsa police handcuffed him,took him to his car,and advised him to leave the premises.
on january,romo sent a letter to stotter informing him that he was being suspended with pay pending an investigation regarding the complaints about his lab and office,his unwillingness to remedy the situation,and the incident with utsa police on february,bailey interviewed stotter.during the interview,according to bailey,stotter admitted that the lab had safety issues but stated that it was not his fault because several faculty members were using the lab for storage.he indicated that a student was going to help him clean it at some uncertain future date.with respect to his office,he indicated that he used it for storage and that his attempts to clean it had fallen through.bailey also inquired about stotter prior email regarding medical leave.he advised stotter that utsa officials thought the matter was resolved back in.after the meeting,bailey concluded that he could not rely on stotter to clean his lab.
on february,bailey sent a certified letter to stotter informing him that utsa closed his lab and that utsa would clean it on february.the letter instructed stotter to contact hammond prior to february,to arrange for a police escort if he had any personal items to pick up.notice of the letter did not reach stotter until february,two days after the clean up had already occurred.on march,utsa permitted stotter to enter his lab.according to stotter,utsa discarded all of his personal property that was stored in his lab.
on april,bailey recommended to romo that stotter contract be terminated for good cause.on may,romo sent a letter to stotter extending him an opportunity to meet and discuss the matter.they met on may.after reviewing the allegations,romo agreed to terminate stotter contract for good cause.
on the same day,stotter filed suit in state court against utsa,bailey,and utsa associate vice president of academic affairs david alleging a procedural due process claim and seeking a temporary restraining order,a preliminary injunction,and declaratory relief.a temporary restraining order issued and the case was subsequently removed to federal court.on august,a motion for a preliminary injunction was denied.
meanwhile,stotter invoked the grievance procedures at utsa.according to those procedures,a panel of utsa tenured professors hear the grievance in the first instance and make a recommendation to the board of regents,which then approves,rejects,or amends the hearing panel findings.the board of regents is also required to state in writing the reason for its decision and send a notice of the decision to the accused faculty member.
after a hearing,the grievance panel reached an unanimous decision that there was no good cause to terminate stotter contract.nonetheless,on february,the board of regents,with the exception of one abstaining regent,voted to terminate stotter contract.on february,the board of regents sent a certified letter to stotter explaining that although it accepted the findings of fact of the grievance panel,it rejected the conclusion that no good cause existed for termination.
stotter proceeded with his procedural due process claim in federal court.he also filed a separate lawsuit against utsa,the board of regents,bailey,and romo alleging equal protection and first amendment violations arising out of his termination.the district court consolidated the two suits.on november,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,filing a revised order on december,granting the same.on february,stotter filed an untimely notice of appeal,along with a timely motion to extend the time to file a notice of appeal.finding good cause,the district court granted the motion.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court summary judgment ruling de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.wyatt hunt plywood,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.on a motion for summary judgment,this court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see hockman westward commc ns,cir.in reviewing the evidence,this court must therefore refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.turner baylor richardson med,cir.
iii.analysis 
timeliness of notice of appeal 
utsa argues that the district court erred in granting stotter motion to file an untimely notice of appeal.we disagree.the district court entered its amended order of summary judgment on december.thus,any notice of appeal was due on january.see fed.a a.however,rule a a permits the district court to extend that time if the party so moves no later than days after the time prescribed by rule a expires and the party shows excusable neglect or good cause.on february,stotter filed a timely motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.the district court granted the motion on the ground that stotter established excusable neglect based on the fact that his counsel accidentally entered the incorrect year into her new calendar.
this court reviews a district court ruling on a rule a motion based on a determination of excusable neglect for an abuse of discretion.united states clark,cir.however,this court gives more leeway to a district court determination of excusable neglect when the district court grants the motion for an extension of time.midwest employers cas.williams,cir.
when evaluating excusable neglect under rule a,this court relies on the following standard 
the determination is at bottom an equitable one,taking account all of the relevant circumstances surrounding the party omission.these include the danger of prejudice,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.
id.quoting pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d.given the leeway granted to district courts under this standard,the minimal delay and prejudice involved,and the excuse provided by stotter,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.
section due process claim 
stotter filed his procedural due process claim pursuant to title of the united states code,section.section provides a private right of action for damages to individuals who are deprived of any rights,privileges,or immunities protected by the constitution or federal law by any person acting under the color of state law.the supreme court has held that neither a state or persons acting in their official capacities are persons under,though state officials in their official capacities,when sued for injunctive relief,are persons under.will michigan state dep t of police,d see also lapides bd.of regents of the.of georgia,d.this court has also recognized that state universities as arms of the state are not persons under.laxey louisiana bd.of trustees,texas walker,cir noting specifically that university of texas health science center and regents of the university of texas are arms of the state see also gaby bd.of,cir.thus,stotter claim,with respect to utsa,is invalid.
stotter argues that bailey violated his procedural due process rights by discarding his personal property without giving him sufficient opportunity to retrieve it.the district court conceded that the february,notice letter was insufficient to give stotter sufficient time to remove any personal items from his lab prior to the february,cleanup.we agree.in fact,stotter did not even receive the notice letter until after his lab was cleaned and his personal property allegedly discarded.nonetheless,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants on two grounds.first,the district court held that because an adequate remedy was available,a state conversion claim,stotter could not establish a procedural due process violation.stotter counters that there is no adequate remedy available in this case because the defendants are immune from suit under the texas tort claims act.see.civ.prac.stotter is correct that under texas law,conversion is considered an intentional tort for which the texas tort claims act preserves immunity.see.river barges city of san antonio.however,we need not address the issue of whether a defendant entitlement to immunity renders a remedy unavailable because stotter is not required to establish the unavailability of remedies in this case.
under the doctrine an unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available.hudson palmer,d see also parratt taylor,d,overruled in part on other grounds by daniels williams,d.the key word is unauthorized.the supreme court later clarified that if the deprivation was authorized by the state and the state had an opportunity to provide some type of remedy,failure to do so implicates the due process clause.zinermon burch,d.in applying zinermon,this circuit has held that a action for deprivation of procedural due process is barred if a state has adequate remedies and the following conditions exist the deprivation must truly have been unpredictable or unforeseeable process would have been impossible or impotent to counter the state actors particular conduct and the conduct must have been unauthorized in the sense that it was not within the officials express or implied authority.caine hardy,cir en banc.otherwise,a action for deprivation of procedural due process is not barred under the doctrine.
here,the deprivation was both predictable and foreseeable.in fact,not only was it possible for bailey to provide a remedy in this case,he attempted to do so by sending stotter a letter giving him an opportunity to remove any personal items from his lab.moreover,utsa and bailey specifically authorized the deprivation.see,allen thomas,cir holding that because personal property was confiscated under authority of prison administrative directive,it was not random or unauthorized brooks george county,cir holding that actions according to official policy can not be considered random or unauthorized.in short,because the alleged deprivation was authorized,the deprivation was foreseeable,bailey had an opportunity to provide a remedy,and he failed to give stotter sufficient time to collect his personal items prior to allegedly discarding them,the district court erred in dismissing stotter procedural due process claim on the basis of the availability of an adequate remedy.
the second reason the district court dismissed stotter procedural due process claim was because,according to the district court,stotter failed to identify any particular item that was removed from his lab in which he had a sufficient property interest.we disagree.property interests protected by the procedural due process clause include,at the very least,ownership of real estate,chattels,and money.bd.of regents roth,d mahone addicks util,cir.in concluding that stotter did not have a property interest in any of the materials in his lab,the district court failed to construe the evidence in a light most favorable to him.after reviewing the record,there appears to be no evidence or inventory of what was actually removed from the lab.in his affidavit,however,stotter states that when he began his employment at utsa,he brought with him book cases,storage cabinets,a chemical library,personal journals,notebooks,documentation that reflected research and work generated during his tenure at utsa,and many chemicals and related materials not purchased by utsa or with any funds belonging to utsa.he also alleges that bailey discarded these items.construing this evidence in a light most favorable to stotter,a reasonable juror could conclude that he had a property interest in the aforementioned items and bailey violated his procedural due process rights by discarding them without giving stotter sufficient opportunity to retrieve them.in fact,by giving stotter an opportunity to retrieve any personal items,bailey effectively conceded that at least as of february,stotter had not waived any personal property interest in the items he placed in his lab.based on the foregoing,we conclude that the district court erred in not finding a procedural due process violation in this case.
because we hold that stotter has set forth sufficient evidence to establish a constitutional violation,we must next address whether bailey is entitled to qualified immunity.indeed,notwithstanding the broad language of,state officials performing discretionary functions are often protected from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity,which shields such officials from suit insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.to determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity from a suit alleging a constitutional violation,we conduct a familiar inquiry.first,we must ask whether the plaintiff has alleged facts to establish that the official violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.hope pelzer,d saucier katz,d a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.if the facts do not establish that the official violated the plaintiff constitutional rights,we need not inquire further.see saucier,at.if they do,the official is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity unless the court finds that the official conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the state actions at issue.see mcclendon,at.to be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.johnson johnson,cir quoting anderson creighton,d.
here,the supreme court has recognized that the due process clause protects a person property interests in personal property such as real estate,chattels,and money.roth,at.in zinermon,the supreme court reiterated that some type of notice is required prior to the authorized deprivation of one property.at.however,as the district court correctly concluded,the notice bailey gave stotter was insufficient to satisfy due process because stotter did not receive the notice until after his personal property was allegedly discarded.based on these precedents,a reasonable state official would understand that discarding stotter personal property in this manner violated his procedural due process rights and that such conduct is objectively unreasonable.thus,we agree that bailey is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to stotter procedural due process claim.
equal protection claims 
stotter next argues that the defendants treated him differently than others similarly situated in violation of his equal protection rights.in village of willowbrook olech,d,the supreme court recognized an equal protection claim based on a class of one.to establish such a claim,the plaintiff must show that he or she was treated differently from others similarly situated and there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment.id.at.we agree that stotter has not established that he was treated differently than others similarly situated or that any differential treatment was irrational.
the district court concluded that despite the dearth of evidence regarding the conditions of thayagarajan lab,the two labs had similar hazards and thus,stotter and thayagarajan were similarly situated.however,thayagarajan initially took responsibility for the deficiencies of his lab and when his health problems prohibited him from cleaning it,he turned his lab over to utsa and retired shortly thereafter.stotter has not offered any evidence to dispute these facts.in fact,when asked if he knew that thayagarajan cooperated with utsa to clean his lab,stotter responded at deposition,i do know that.in contrast,stotter made several unfulfilled promises to clean his lab.indeed,even under his version of the facts,he was given notice on october,to clean his lab and by the end of february,still had not done so.also,unlike thayagarajan,stotter allowed deficiencies to exist in his office,in addition to his lab,and when utsa attempted to remedy the situation,stotter created such a scene that he was escorted to his car by utsa police and advised to leave the premises.there is no evidence that thayagarajan ever physically resisted efforts to clean his lab.thus,the two situations are hardly similar and the confrontation with campus police alone presents,at the very least,a rational basis for treating stotter differently.accordingly,we conclude that stotter equal protection claim lacks merit.
stotter also raises an equal protection claim with respect to his salary.he argues that the district court ignored this claim.however,a review of the record reveals that the district court did address this claim.according to the district court,any differential in salary was the result of stotter own failure to submit annual reports required for a salary adjustment.the district court also noted that all of the correspondence from stotter superiors indicates a willingness to rectify any legitimate shortfall in his salary.stotter does not offer any evidence to the contrary.moreover,an independent review of the record also reveals that stotter has not offered any evidence comparing his salary to any other individual,let alone an individual similarly situated.even if he had,the failure to file the requisite paperwork for a salary adjustment would certainly provide a rational basis for any alleged salary differential.accordingly,we conclude that this equal protection claim also lacks merit.
first amendment retaliation claim 
stotter argues that the defendants terminated his employment contract in retaliation for his speech involving matters of public concern in violation of the first amendment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the ground that stotter was unable to establish that the speech at issue was a matter of public concern.we agree.
in order to succeed on a first amendment retaliation claim,stotter must show that he suffered an adverse employment decision his speech involved a matter of public concern his interest in commenting on matters of public concern outweighs his employer interest in promoting efficiency and his speech motivated the adverse employment decision.whiting v.the of,cir beattie madison county sch,cir harris victoria indep.sch,cir.the district court held that stotter was unable to establish the second elem
