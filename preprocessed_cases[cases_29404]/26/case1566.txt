whitmore union elementary school district whitmore appeals from the summary judgment granted defendants in an action to recover money whitmore lost as a result of an alleged improper pooled money investment by defendant treasurer of shasta county the treasurer.
the summary judgment rests on the theory the action is barred by the discretionary immunity granted the treasurer by government code section a provision of the tort claims act the theory is based on the view a county treasurer has unfettered discretion under section to invest money on deposit in the county treasury in any of the financial instruments listed in the statute.the defendants reason that,because school district money must be deposited in the county treasury the treasurer may invest it without the consent of the district,regardless whether the money is required to meet the district immediate financial needs.we disagree.
the treasurer discretionary authority under section is limited by its terms to surplus not required for the immediate needs of the by the requirements of sections,and education code section that the governing board of the district delegate to the treasurer the authority to invest its surplus money.
the treasurer did not determine whether whitmore money was surplus nor did it secure whitmore delegation of authority to invest the money.accordingly,the treasurer lacked discretion to invest the money and the investment is not subject to the discretionary immunity provided by the tort claims act.
we will reverse the summary judgment.
facts and procedural background 
whitmore is an elementary school district located in shasta county.under the education code it is required to deposit the money it receives,including state apportionments and tax revenues,in the shasta county treasury.
the treasurer characterizes money deposited with his office by the county,school and special districts as a pooled treasury the county investment pool.
in december and march,the treasurer used funds deposited by whitmore and other school districts together with other funds in the treasury to purchase notes issued by the student loan marketing association.according to its counsel the treasurer was not required by section to and did not determine whether whitmore funds were surplus funds not required for its immediate use nor did it seek whitmore consent to invest them.the shasta county treasurer does not make such a determination.
the notes bore a maturity date of november,and an ostensible,aggregate face value of.however,unbeknownst to the treasurer,the amount due under the notes was variable and dependent upon the exchange rate between the dollar and the japanese yen.at maturity the amount paid under the notes was.the notes are ostensibly within the list of financial instruments issued by a federal agency or united states enterprise set forth in the identical provisions of subdivision e of sections and.
whitmore sued shasta county,the treasurer,and the shasta county superintendent of schools.whitmore first amended complaint alleges the treasurer,in breach of his contractual duties,negligently caused several million dollars in pooled funds to be invested in certain speculative securities whitmore seeks an accounting and a declaration that it is entitled to recovery of the deposited funds and any loss occasioned by the investment in the notes.
shasta county and the treasurer moved for summary judgment contending that a cause of action for losses occasioned by the investment is barred by the tort claims act.the trial court granted the motion and a judgment was entered declaring that all of whitmore claims are barred.
this appeal ensued.
discussion 
at issue is the treasurer authority under section to invest whitmore funds on deposit in the county treasury in any of the financial instruments listed therein.
the defendants rely on the following excerpted provision of section.
a ll money belonging to,or in the custody of,a local agency,shall be deposited for safekeeping in secure banking institutions selected by the treasurer or,unless otherwise directed by the legislative body pursuant to section,may be invested in the investments specified in the statute.emphasis added.
the defendants assume the italicized language delegates discretionary authority to the treasurer to invest money in the custody of the county in any of the financial instruments listed in section.unlike other local agencies,which have discretion whether to deposit their surplus funds in the county treasury for investment by the treasurer most school district funds must be deposited in the county treasury the treasurer seizes upon this fact as justification for its unfettered discretion to invest whitmore money under section and as grounds for immunity from an action challenging an abuse of that discretion under section 
the central difficulty with this view is that it cedes to the treasurer complete authority to invest school district funds on deposit in the county treasury,regardless whether they are surplus to the immediate needs of the district and regardless whether the district has authorized their investment.this is inconsistent both with common sense and the statutes which uniformly limit the money which a local agency,including a school district,may invest to surplus funds,funds not required for the immediate needs of the district and which assign the governing board of a school district the responsibility to account for and to authorize the investment of its funds 
consistent with the uniform policy of these statutes,only the school district is in a position to determine its financial needs and only the school district has the political and statutory responsibility to decide whether it has surplus funds which should be invested.
the control of school district funds 
the education code locates the authority for the control,investment of,and accounting for school district funds in the governing board of the district and in the superintendent of public schools 
the governing board must adopt an annual budget which shall show a complete plan and itemized statement of all proposed expenditures of the school district and of all estimated revenues for the ensuing fiscal year investment strategy is an integral part of the budgetary process.steiner superior court th,d,fn.omitted.the enforcement of the budget and the control of the financial affairs of a school district are accomplished by means of the california school accounting manual accounting manual,approved by the state board of education 
the accounting manual,as applicable mandates that a district keep a detailed chart of accounts with categories appropriate to three kinds of funds,governmental funds,proprietary funds and fiduciary funds within the category of governmental funds are the general fund and the county school service fund,used to account for the ordinary operations of the district,special revenue funds,used to account for the proceeds from specific revenue sources,which by law are restricted to the financing of particular activities,and capital project funds,used to account for financial resources to be used for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities 
the operative term is fund.it is a fiscal and accounting entity by which the district accounts for the expenditure of its money.it fulfills a specific legal function.a fund is established to carry on specific activities or to attain certain objectives of an lea local education agency in accordance with special regulations,restrictions,or limitations.leas may establish and maintain only those funds authorized by law.
the importance of a fund is recognized in the statutes which require the placement of school money in the county treasury.education code sections and generally provide that all money received by or apportioned to a school district shall be paid into the county treasury to be placed to the credit of the proper fund of the district.emphasis added.the general fund is the recipient of money received from state apportionments,county,district or municipal taxes,other than moneys required to be placed in a separate fund of the school district the general fund and the county school service fund are used to account for the ordinary operations of a governmental unit.all transactions,except those required by law to be in another fund,are accounted for in these funds.this is the fund in the county treasury from which the treasurer presumably appropriated whitmore money for investment under the claimed authority of section.
given the role of the accounting system in the control of school district funds we look to the accounting manual for guidance as to the manner in which they may be invested.that is to be found in the section on school district assets.the accounting manual sets out a chart of accounts which contains a balance sheet by which to define and list assets,which include inter alia as an asset cash in county treasury,fixed assets and investments.
there is only one category for investments,those made pursuant to education code section 
education code section 
section is contained in the article of the education code on accounting regulations,budget controls and audits,of which the provision for an accounting manual is a part it also is a part of the chapter on state management and control of school finance,which contains the provisions for the mandatory deposit of school money in the county treasury.
education code section provides in full 
the governing board of any school district or any county office of education which has funds in a special reserve fund of the district or county office of education or any surplus moneys not required for the immediate necessities of the district or county office of education,is hereby authorized to invest all or any part of the funds in any of the investments specified in section or of the government code.
section is an authorizing statute.it vests the governing board of a school district with the authority to invest the surplus money of the district in the investments listed in sections and it does not address the means by which an investment is to be accomplished.that is governed by other provisions of the education and government codes.a direct investment by the governing board is authorized by section of the education code as will be shown,a governing board may delegate this discretion to the county treasurer pursuant to section.
the defendants reason that a school district may withdraw its money in the county treasury to invest it within its authority under education code section,but if the district declines to do so,the school district funds remain in the county treasury for investment under government code section.the defendants assume that money in the custody of the county is within the treasurer discretion to invest.
the logical consequence of the defendants reasoning is that,while the governing board of a school district may invest only its surplus money,the county treasurer,in its discretion,may invest school district money in its custody,regardless whether it is surplus.there is no support for this reading in the language or history of the statutes which govern the investment of public money.
to show this requires a traverse of several interrelated statutes.
government code section 
education code section,as noted,provides that the governing board of a school district may invest its surplus money in any of the investments specified in section of the government code.
section provides,in pertinent part 
the legislative body of a local agency having surplus money in its treasury not required for the immediate needs of the local agency may invest any portion of the money that it deems wise or expedient in specified financial instruments.
the reference to section derives from a enactment,by which the list of investments in education code section was replaced with the list in section the same enactment added school district to the definition of local entity in section,which governs its use in section it also deleted from education code section the limitation that t his section shall not be construed as in any way limiting or modifying the application of any other law providing for or authorizing the investment of any funds of a school district.
three consequences flow from the enactment.first,section is a duplicate source of school district authority to invest its surplus money,identical with the authority granted in education code section second,it is implied,by deletion of the language of limitation,that section is intended to limit other laws which apply to the investment of school district funds.third,under section,the governing board of a school district,as the l egislative body of a local entity,is authorized to delegate its investment authority under section to the treasurer of the district.in the absence of such a delegation the treasurer has no discretion.
this last point requires elaboration.
government code section 
section,as applicable,provided 
the authority of the legislative body to invest or to reinvest funds of a local agency may be delegated by the legislative body to the treasurer of the local agency,who shall thereafter assume full responsibility for such transactions until such time as the delegation of authority is revoked,and shall make a monthly report of such transactions to the legislative body.stats,ch.
section bars the treasurer of a local agency from making an investment,otherwise provided in section,without an affirmative act of delegation by the legislative body of a local agency.the latter term includes a county and a school district,as defined by section.thus,as will be seen,section necessarily constrains the exercise of the treasurer authority under section.
with limited exceptions a school district has no independent treasury.its treasury is the county treasury into which,by direction of education code sections and,the money belonging to the district must be placed in the custody of a local agency,the county.as a consequence the county treasurer is the de facto school district treasurer.pomona city school dist.payne d,certainly the county treasurer,as custodian of school funds,represents,exercises power derived from another citation the school district whose funds are in his care,and acts as its agent,and is treasurer for the school district.see also metropolitan water dist.adams cal d,when an entity funds are in the custody of the county treasurer the county treasurer is in effect the treasurer for the entity board of law library trustees lowery d.this was made explicit in section,enacted following the pomona decision.money so deposited in the county treasury under section is deemed to be in the treasury of the local agency.
pomona interpreted an early version of the depositary act from which section derives the depositary act,stemming from the authority of the state constitution requires that specified local entities place their money in banks where it could earn interest.at issue in pomona was whether the interest on school district funds on deposit in the county treasury belonged to the county or the agency to which the principal belonged.pomona held that school district funds deposited in the county treasury remain the property of the school district,and the interest earned thereon belongs to the district 
the holding necessarily was dependent upon inclusion of a school district within the act.pomona held that a school district was a public corporation,as used in the act.in this term was moved to section,subdivision a,as part of the definition of l ocal agency,as that term is now used in section 
with this lengthy preface we turn back to section.
section limits the treasurer investment discretion 
section in pertinent part provides 
as far as possible,all money belonging to,or in the custody of,a local agency,including money paid to the treasurer or other official to pay the principal,interest,or penalties of bonds,shall be deposited for safekeeping in state or national banks,savings associations or federal associations,credit unions,or federally insured industrial loan companies in this state selected by the treasurer or other official having the legal custody of the money or,unless otherwise directed by the legislative body pursuant to section,may be invested in the investments set forth below.
the defendants reason that,since the county is a local agency section applies to any money in its custody in the county treasury.they assume that if the money is in the custody of the county it also is in the custody of the treasurer and,accordingly,the italicized language gives the treasurer discretion to invest the money in the investments set forth below.the defendants misread the language and context from which its meaning is derived.
section distinguishes between money deposited in secure banking institutions and money invested in specified financial instruments.it directed,as applicable,that,as far as possible,all money in the custody of the local agency shall be deposited for safekeeping in secure banking institutions selected by the treasurer stats,ch.as noted,this language comes from the early depositary act it then provides,in a clause separated from that language by a semicolon or,unless otherwise directed by the legislative body pursuant to section,may be invested in the following specified investments.ibid.
the treasurer would extend the authority granted the county treasurer to select a banking depository to the selection of the investments identified in section.that is not the case for several reasons.
first,the legislature took grammatical pains to separate the investment authority from the depositary authority.the clause granting the authority to select a bank depositary is separated from the clause concerning the investment authority by a semicolon,signaling a difference in the treasurer authority the phrase may be invested,in that clause,does not say under whose authority the investment is to be made.moreover,it is subject to the condition unless otherwise directed by the legislative body pursuant to section 
the significance of the directive is fourfold.first,as noted,section lists the investments which the governing board of a school district is permitted to make and provides a duplicate authority to that granted under education code section.second,the authority granted by section,as with education code section,must be exercised by the governing board of the legislative body unless delegated to its treasurer pursuant to section.third,the investments in section,like those in education code section,are limited to surplus moneys fourth,the list of investments in section is,in all material respects,identical to the list of investments in section 
these sections are manifestly in pari materia.that is shown not only by the cross references but by the parallel enactments of,and amendments to,sections and.as noted,the investments set forth in section are,in all material respects,identical to those contained in section,including the investment at issue both are limited to surplus funds.both were jointly enacted and amended over the years to maintain their congruence.
this conclusion is fortified by examination of the specific investments contained in sections and.each list contains identical limitations on the money that may be used for specific investments which are expressly tied to the agency surplus funds for example,subdivisions f of both sections provide,with respect to an investment in bills of exchange,that no more than percent of the agency surplus funds may be invested in the bankers acceptances of any one commercial bank pursuant to this section.emphasis added.analogous limitations,tied to the agency surplus funds,are contained in subdivisions g,h,j,k b and respectively n or m of each section.the unmistakable inference to be drawn is the investments permitted by both sections are limited to the surplus funds of the agency to which the funds belong and the definition of surplus funds in section is the definition applicable to that term in section,funds not required for the immediate needs of the local agency 
there are several further gems to be mined from this comparison.first,the references in both sections and are to the agency surplus funds see,subd.f emphasis added.in section this must refer to the funds belonging to the local agency which are on deposit with the treasurer.since the phrase surplus funds is defined in section and,as well as not required for the immediate needs of the local agency,needs here refer to the ongoing financial requirements of the agency to which the funds belong,the money needed to fund its ongoing operations.
lastly,since,apart from the issue of delegation,it is only surplus money on deposit with the treasurer that the county treasurer may invest in the instruments designated in section,it must first be determined that the funds to be invested are surplus.to do so the treasurer must obtain relevant cash flow information from the affected local agency that would aid in the determination of the immediate financial needs of the agency.
it is but a short,logical step to the implied requirement that the local agency consent to the investment of its surplus funds by the delegation of its investment authority pursuant to section.a local agency having funds on deposit in the county treasury would not go to the effort of providing cash flow information to the county treasurer,which would aid the treasurer in the determination of the agency funds which are surplus,unless it wished to have them invested by the treasurer.
thus,section implicitly advances the same policy made explicit in sections and and education code section,and implicit in the accounting manual,that the exercise of the treasurer discretion to invest requires a delegation of the authority of the governing board of the local agency pursuant to section.
lastly,as noted,section is not limited to a county or a county treasurer.the section applies to any local agency,as defined in section,subdivision a,including a city,and a school district.hence,any reading which applies to the county and its treasurer must also apply to other local agencies when acting with respect to money not deposited in the county treasury.since each of these agencies is subject to the limitations of sections and,section must also be subject to their limitations.to conclude otherwise would put section in conflict with these sections,a construction we can not adopt.
the county of shasta has petitioned for a rehearing.the petition is based in part in two misinterpretations of the opinion.
the first misinterpretation is the belief that,in delegating investment authority to the treasurer pursuant to section,each school district is empowered to direct the placement of individual investments.that is not the case.
section permits the legislative body of a local agency,including the governing board of a school district,to delegate to the treasurer the agency authority to invest or reinvest its funds for a period of one year,subject to annual renewal.section describes the authority as discretion to invest in the listed financial instruments as the agency deems wise or expedient when that authority is delegated,the treasurer assumes the agency discretion.
the second misinterpretation is that in recognizing that a district must provide the treasurer with cash flow information,which would aid in determining how much of the funds on deposit are surplus,the district must so label the funds.that also is not the case.section defines surplus funds as money not required for the immediate needs of the agency because the funds in a pooled money investment are an aggregate of the surplus funds of each of the participating entities,an estimate of the cash flow needs of each of the participants will aid in determining the aggregate.it is the treasurer,to whom the investment discretion is delegated,which must make a reasonable determination of the cash flow needs.that may be done based upon historical data,accounting information in the treasurer possession,and cash flow projections provided to the treasurer by the agency or the body responsible for compiling the information for each district.
disposition
