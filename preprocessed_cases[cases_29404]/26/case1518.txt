on may,respondent atwater elementary school district district gave appellant albert truitt,a credentialed teacher,notice of the district intention to dismiss him from his position.the charges alleged that appellant had engaged in sexual misconduct with five separate students during the period between and.a commission on professional competence cpc convened to hear the charges,and before the hearing began,truitt filed two motions in limine which sought,respectively,an order precluding the district from offering any evidence relating to events that had occurred more than four years before the date the notice of intention to dismiss was filed and an order striking from the charges and the notice those allegations which described incidents that had occurred more than four years before the date the notice was filed.the motions were based upon section,subdivision a 
the administrative hearing officer granted both motions.the district took the case to the superior court by way of a petition for writ of mandate.the trial court,after a contested hearing,granted the district petition and ordered the hearing officer to vacate both in limine orders and enter new orders denying truitt motions.
truitt remains suspended from his position,without pay,pending resolution of the charges.
we reverse.we hold that the prohibitions in section are absolute and can not be extended by the application of equitable doctrines such as delayed discovery,fraudulent concealment,equitable estoppel,and continuing course of conduct.
discussion 
the education code includes a broad legislative scheme that controls,to the exclusion of any local legislation,the matter of teacher discipline.see california teachers state of california cal th,d.the scheme incorporates two separate but interrelated means of disciplining a credentialed teacher for misconduct or professional incompetence.the first is found in section,which authorizes the local school governing board,on a variety of grounds,to suspend or dismiss a teacher from the position he or she holds.see,subd.a.the second is found in section,which authorizes the commission on teacher credentialing,on a variety of grounds,to privately admonish or publicly reprove a teacher or suspend or revoke a teacher credential.the procedural mechanism for a dismissal or suspension is described in section.the procedural mechanism for an admonishment,reproval,suspension or revocation is described in section.
in this dismissal proceeding under section truitt contends the trial court sanctioned a violation of section by authorizing the district to introduce at the hearing evidence of misconduct that occurred more than four years before the notice of intention to dismiss was filed.according to truitt,section is not a statute of limitations subject to the equitable tolling exceptions relied upon by the district but instead is an evidentiary and a substantive bar that can not be lifted by equitable considerations.
we agree with truitt that the trial court should have denied the district petition.section,subdivision a is in the nature of an evidentiary bar or a condition on a substantive right rather than a true statute of limitations.los angeles lincoln place investors,city of los angeles th,d issues of statutory interpretation are subject to de novo appellate review.the last paragraph of section,subdivision a is not ambiguous.it states unequivocally that no testimony shall be given or evidence introduced relating to matters which occurred more than four years prior to the date of the filing of the notice to dismiss and that n o decision relating to the dismissal of any employee shall be made based on charges or evidence of any nature relating to the matters occurring more than four years prior to the filing of the notice.emphasis added.these words place restrictions upon the age of the information that may support a dismissal they do not place any limits upon the time within which a section dismissal proceeding may be brought.see dodds commission on judicial performance cal th,d.
section,subdivision a is similar to former subdivision c of article vi,section,of the california constitution,which dealt with judicial censure and which stated that the supreme court may censure or remove a judge for action occurring not more than years prior to the commencement of the judge current term in dodds commission on judicial performance,supra,cal th,d,the court held that the section precluded the imposition of discipline based on a remark made by the judge more than six years before commencement of the judge current term.the court did not view the provision as a classic statute of does not place a limit on when an action or proceeding may be commenced.rather,it places a limit on the total time that may elapse from occurrence of an incident to imposition of discipline based on that incident.it thus combines the functions of a statute of limitations and a rule limiting the time proceedings may remain pending.id.at,d.
the district says that,under the traditional delayed discovery,fraudulent concealment,equitable estoppel,and continuing course of conduct exceptions to statutes of limitations,it should be allowed to introduce acts of misconduct more than four years old.but if the district were permitted to do so,evidence that the legislature in section has expressly said can not be introduced or relied upon at a dismissal hearing could be introduced and relied upon at a dismissal hearing,flaunting the direct statutory command.see people ex rel.department of corporations speedee oil change systems,th,d equitable principles did not apply to toll certain corporations code statutes of limitation where the relevant code language disclosed a legislative intent not to permit any extension of the stated limitations periods.as truitt has pointed out,even if such equitable doctrines were applied to admit evidence about events older than four years,the patent statutory language still would prohibit any decision from being based on charges or evidence of any nature older than four years,subd.a.
section,subdivision a is ambiguous only if the premise is accepted that it is unwise as a matter of policy to exclude from the evidence presented at a dismissal hearing any proof of sexual misconduct,regardless of its age.however,and even though the allegations against truitt may furnish a temptation to find some colorable ground to avoid the plain meaning of the statute,we can not ignore the obvious expression of the legislature intent,whatever we or the district may think about the wisdom of the provision.superior court county of mendocino cal th,d,the courts may not undertake to evaluate the wisdom of the policies embodied in legislation absent a constitutional prohibition,the choice among competing policy considerations in enacting laws is a legislative function county of fresno shelton th,d when the language of a statute is clear,the court should apply its plain meaning.
according to the district,a july,legislative staff memorandum concerning proposed amendments to assembly bill proves that the subject language in section was intended to create a true statute of limitations.the memorandum in pertinent part states that,because there should be some statute of limitations for teachers,the time period in the earlier version of section was being changed to four years by assembly bill since the evaluations are made every other year.
as we see it,the link in the memo between the new time period and biannual teacher evaluations does not focus on the,what might be a fair time for purposes of notice,preservation of evidence,extension of risk,finality and the considered in selecting an appropriate period of limitations within which a particular action or proceeding may be initiated.see,jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,mills forestex th,d.rather,the reference focuses upon the time when a deficient performance by the teacher would likely be raised between the teacher and the district and perhaps corrected,factors that suggest that the purpose of the provision was to prohibit dismissal based upon stale events.
there is nothing in the rest of the extant history of section to
