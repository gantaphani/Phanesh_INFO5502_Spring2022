in response to the allegation,williams conducted an investigation.she asked lowell williamson,the principal of pierce county high school at the time,and don spence,the superintendent at the time,whether they knew any relevant information concerning blythe.williamson explained he had received a complaint in october about a potentially inappropriate relationship between blythe and a student named brandon davis.williamson investigated the allegation at that time.he spoke with davis mother,who complained blythe had been removing davis from some of his classes.williamson interviewed davis,who vehemently denied having any inappropriate relationship with blythe.williamson also interviewed blythe,who similarly denied the allegation.williamson found their denials credible,and he did not uncover any evidence supporting the validity of the allegation he warned blythe to always keep her conduct with students beyond reproach and to avoid any situation that could be viewed as inappropriate.after interviewing davis and blythe,williamson informed superintendent spence of the allegation and the results of his investigation.during his discussion with williams in the spring of,williamson indicated he had not observed any inappropriate conduct by blythe,and he had not received any other accusations against her.he provided williams with a copy of his notes from the investigation.
