petitioner bo hae lee seeks judicial review to determine whether an agency statutory construction of one of its operating statutes is legally permissible.lee is a citizen of south korea.she came to the united states as a in with her parents on a nonimmigrant visitor visa.she subsequently applied for and received a change in visa status to the nonimmigrant student category,allowing her to attend a private school approved by the attorney general of the united states.
the last approved private school lee attended was riverview christian academy in colorado.after her sophomore year,when lee was sixteen,the school ceased operations.the school closure required lee to seek an alternative for schooling.riverview christian academy attempted to assist lee in applying to another private school,but the other private schools were too far from her residence,and lee understood it would be difficult for her to achieve admittance.therefore,lee attended a local public high school,graduating in may.
in september of,a few months after lee private school closed,she filed for a status adjustment,which was denied.the following year,on july,the immigration and naturalization service issued a notice to appear charging lee with being subject to removal because of her remaining in the united states longer than permitted and being in violation of her nonimmigrant status.lee again asked for a status adjustment,but the government attorney argued against the adjustment.he explained lee could not obtain a status adjustment because she could not meet her burden of showing admissibility due to her no longer attending the private school for which she had been approved and attending a public school without reimbursing it for her education.
even though the immigration judge stated that m aybe lee was not at fault for terminating her studies at the school,and i do think she ended her studies there because she had to,he ultimately refused to adjust lee status from nonimmigrant to permanent resident because he found lee had not met her burden of proving she was admissible.at.his findings and legal conclusions included determining lee was a student visa abuser under m for terminating her course of study at her private school and undertaking a course of study at a public school.in a cursory decision,the board of immigration appeals affirmed the ij findings on the merits,without reviewing an untimely brief filed by lee attorney on her behalf.
we review de novo questions of law raised upon petition for review,and we review the agency findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard.see elzour ashcroft,cir ins,cir see also a d.
the crux of this appeal is a question of law whether the ij statutory construction of m is correct in concluding lee actions constituted a termination of her course of study.lee argues that the ij statutory construction of m and the bia upholding of that construction are impermissible under the plain language of the statute we agree.
according to a,an alien may receive an status adjustment from nonimmigrant to permanent resident if the alien meets the three requirements listed therein.to meet the second requirement,an alien must prove she is admissible.in lee case,the ij found she had not met that burden because she was inadmissible under a g as a student visa abuser.the ij determined lee abused her student visa status because she violated a term or condition of her status under m by terminating her attendance at riverview christian academy,even though he acknowledged that termination may not have been her fault.
section m provides 
an alien who obtains the status of a nonimmigrant under clause i or iii of section a f of this title in order to pursue a course of study at a private elementary or secondary school or in a language training program that is not publicly funded shall be considered to have violated such status,and the alien visa under section a f of this title shall be void,if the alien terminates or abandons such course of study at such a school and undertakes a course of study at a public elementary school,in a publicly funded adult education program,in a publicly funded adult education language training program,or at a public secondary school unless the requirements of paragraph b are met.
m emphasis added.thus,in order to violate her status,lee had to terminate or abandon her studies at such a school.
the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.we begin by analyzing the plain language employed by congress,and we must give words their ordinary or natural meaning.leocal ashcroft,d internal quotation marks omitted am.tobacco patterson,d.importantly,we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.am.tobacco,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it must first answer whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if congressional intent is clear from the statutory language,the inquiry is over,and both the court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.see id.at.however,

ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d second alteration in original explaining the court would not construe the statute in that case to implicitly abrogate or repeal the operation of many mandatory agency directives and thereby create differing mandates.
we discuss first the school to which the statute refers.in the plain language of the statute,the antecedent of the term such a school is a private secondary school,m,specifically described in the reference statute,a f,as an established academic high school particularly designated by the immigrant and approved by the attorney general after consultation with the secretary of education.the relevant regulation describing the duration of an alien nonimmigrant status on an visa links the status duration specifically to an educational institution approved by the service for attendance by foreign students.f i see also united states atandi,cir.
because m refers specifically to such a school rather than to a or any private school,and because its internal statutory references and the regulations regarding student visa duration point only to a school specifically selected by the immigrant and approved by the government,we hold that the school to which the statute refers in this case is riverview christian academy,the school selected specifically by lee and approved by the government.having established that the school in question is riverview christian academy,we now scrutinize whether lee terminated or abandoned her course of study at this school.
beginning with the plain language of the statute,we note that terminate is defined as.to put an end to to bring to an end.to end to conclude.black law dictionary ed.to abandon means 
to desert,surrender,forsake,or cede.to relinquish or give up with intent of never again resuming one right or interest.to give up or to cease to use.to give up absolutely to forsake entirely to renounce utterly to relinquish all connection with or concern in to desert.it includes the intention,and also the external act by which it is carried into effect.
