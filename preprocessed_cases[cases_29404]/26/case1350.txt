the first ceqa action.
appellant is an unincorporated association whose members first came together to save the historic van de kamps bakery building building or site when a real estate developer proposed to demolish it and build a home base store.after the city of los angeles city prepared and certified an environmental impact report eir for the project,the city planning commission denied approval.appellant supported the laccd acquisition of the site for the development of a satellite campus for los angeles city college.the laccd completed the purchase of the site in through the issuance of proposition bonds.
during the next several years,the laccd worked toward the construction and opening of a million community college campus,comprised of the rehabilitated building used for art studios and other classrooms and a new education building housing classrooms and a library.an eir update and two addenda were prepared to analyze the environmental impacts of a satellite community college campus.due to the state budget crisis,the laccd realized by that it would be financially unable to operate the facility as a full satellite campus.but it recognized that there were a number of existing education and service providers that had the ability to operate on the site and present a comprehensive program of classes and training that could meet the community educational needs.in order to use the site for educational purposes,on july,the board adopted resolutions which approved an interim use of the property and authorized a lease of part of the building to an outside tenant resolutions.
by way of the resolutions,the board determined,found and ordered that for a period of five years los angeles city college would have no programmatic or administrative responsibility for the operation of the facilities that had been constructed at the site effective immediately,for a period of five years the laccd would assume those responsibilities the complex at the site would be renamed the los angeles community college district van de kamp innovation center and t he district office shall make the laccd van de kamp innovation center space available on a rental basis to a variety of service and educational entities to meet the needs of the community and fully cover the costs of operation and maintenance on a basis,subject to approval by the board of trustees.at the same time,the board authorized a lease agreement with the alliance for college ready public schools alliance at the site.at the board meeting the laccd indicated that additional environmental review for the lease was unnecessary because the site would have the same functionality that was originally planned and reviewed in the eir update and addenda.
also in,the board took certain actions in furtherance of the resolutions.on november,the board approved a expenditure to quatro design group for the purpose of redesigning the building to meet the needs of the proposed new tenants.further,on december,the board approved the purchase of a neighboring property from the portola group portola purchase agreement laccd staff reported that the land was not for any particular project and the laccd had no current plans to develop the land 
on january,appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate ceqa i seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against laccd and others,challenging the adequacy of ceqa review for the july,november and december,project approvals.appellant alleged the actions on july,and november,were taken without any effort by the laccd or its board of trustees to assess the potential significant environmental impact of the major changes being made to the land uses at the vdk campus.for the action on december,contrary to substantial evidence in the record,the board of trustees adopted a resolution falsely claiming that the purchase of the land was exempt from ceqa because the laccd has no current plans for the land.
the instant ceqa action.
following the filing of ceqa i,the laccd undertook additional actions in furtherance of the resolutions.on may,the board approved a lease with the city for a portion of the building to be used for employment retraining.in july and again in october,some of appellant members as individuals filed separate taxpayer petitions under proposition challenging the same actions alleged in ceqa see jackson et los angeles community college district et.los angeles county super.case no.folsom et los angeles community college district et.los angeles county super.case no.on august and october,the board approved a first and second amendment,respectively,to the portola purchase agreement which added indemnification provisions related to the filing of ceqa i and the taxpayer actions.finally,on november,the board approved an amendment to the contract with quatro design group for additional architectural services to meet the needs of new tenants.
the trial court denied appellant motion for leave to file a second amended petition in ceqa i to include claims based on the laccd actions undertaken in,which appellant claimed it discovered during the preparation of the administrative record.on november,appellant filed a second petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief ceqa ii,and filed the operative first amended petition and complaint in february appellant characterized ceqa ii as a companion to ceqa i and filed a notice of related cases for all four actions.appellant alleged that the discretionary decisions made in were the subject of ceqa i and challenged the decisions as being null and void because of the laccd failure to undertake the requisite environmental review.
demurrer and judgment.
initially,the trial court sustained with leave to amend the unopposed demurrer filed by the laccd and the board the laccd thereafter demurred to the operative ceqa ii petition on the grounds it was and duplicative,and failed to state a claim.it argued that the limitations period for a ceqa claim was triggered by the resolutions,not by subsequent actions taken as a result and in furtherance of the resolutions.in support of the demurrer the laccd sought judicial notice of pleadings and motions in other cases,board resolutions and minutes,and correspondence from public officials.
appellant opposed the demurrer,arguing that the laccd did not commit itself to a particular course of action until the later approvals in.it also objected to judicial notice of correspondence before the demurrer was heard,it also moved to consolidate ceqa i and ceqa ii,and the laccd opposed the motion.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that the day limitations period began to run with the approval by the board of the leasing of the campus to college activities and not with the execution of the lease with the city of los angeles.although the july,resolutions stated that the execution of any lease would be subject to the board approval,such reservation and subsequent approval do not constitute a substantial change in the project as is necessary to trigger a new day limitations period.the trial court specifically rejected appellant multiple arguments that subsequent project decisions triggered a new limitations period,ruling that b ecause the may,august,october,and november,decisions each relate back and are part of the decisions made on july,december,and november,respectively,the actions based on the decisions are barred by the statute of limitations.moreover,because each of the decisions is the subject of litigation in ceqa i,the present actions are duplicative,which is also grounds for dismissal.finally,the trial court denied the motion to consolidate,explaining that ceqa i was ready for trial and ceqa ii had been dismissed.
judgment was entered in june and this appeal followed.in september,the trial court granted in part and denied in part the ceqa i petition,ruling that the change in tenants resulting from the resolutions created the reasonable possibility of increased traffic impacts requiring environmental review but that the purchase of property from the portola group did not require further ceqa analysis.

day limitations period.
in its petition,appellant alleged that the laccd actions in furtherance of the resolutions should be declared null and void because the laccd failed to assess the potential significant environmental impacts resulting from the proposed changes in land use.accordingly,appellant sought an order compelling the laccd to comply with ceqa and to prepare and approve a legally adequate supporting environmental document prior to consideration of any new resolutions,legislative actions or approvals concerning the proposed changes in use of the northeast satellite campus to los angeles city college at the historic van de kamps bakery.
public resources code,section,subdivision d,provides that a n action or proceeding alleging that a public agency has improperly determined that a project is not subject to ceqa shall be commenced within days from the date of the filing by the public agency of notice of the determination.however,where,as here,no such formal notice has been filed,the action or proceeding shall be commenced within days from the date of the public agency decision to carry out or approve the project see also,tit,subd.c.the parties do not dispute that the day limitations period applies to appellant ceqa ii petition.
the limitations period starts running on the date the project is approved by the public agency and is not on each subsequent date that the public agency takes some action toward implementing the project.citizens for a megaplex free alameda city of alameda th,megaplex free alameda see also guidelines,subd.c.the court in committee for a progressive gilroy state water resources control bd.d,explained it is true that a project,by definition,includes a ctivities involving the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.citation.but it is equally true that a project means the whole of an action,which has a potential for resulting in a physical change in the environment citation.it refers to the underlying activity which may be subject to approval by one or more governmental agencies it does not refer to each of the several approvals sequentially issued by different agencies.the term project does not mean each separate governmental approval.citations.
to illustrate,in city of chula vista county of san diego th chula vista,the city filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking environmental review of a lease agreement between the county and aptec,the operator of a hazardous waste facility in the city.in,the county board of supervisors approved and authorized its contracting director to enter into negotiations with aptec parent corporation and,subject to successful negotiations and the determination of a fair price,awarded a service contract.id.at pp.at the same time,the county determined that its approval was categorically exempt from ceqa.id.at.in january,the county and aptec executed a lease agreement,and the city filed its petition six months later.ibid.the trial court sustained the county and aptec demurrer without leave to amend and the appellate court affirmed,holding that the day limitations period applied to bar the action,because the facts alleged in the city petition,as read in conjunction with judicially noticeable facts,clearly show that the project,the agreement was approved by the county on november,and the actual agreement executed on january,was not substantially different from the original project.accordingly,the day limitations period began to run on november,and expired days later,barring the city petition which was not filed until july.id.at.
appellant filed its petition more than days after project approval.
we agree with the trial court reliance on chula vista,supra,th.the trial court ruled that the facts alleged were substantially similar to those in chula vista and determined that the day limitations period began to run with the laccd approval of the leasing of the site to noncommunity college entities and not with the subsequent execution of a lease.the trial court further found that the limitations period was not affected by the qualification that any lease would be subject to the board approval,as any reservation and subsequent approval did not amount to a substantial change in the project sufficient to trigger a new day limitations period.
a project under ceqa is defined as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and which is any of the following b an activity undertaken by a person which is supported,in whole or in part,through contracts,grants,subsidies,loans,or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.c an activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.pub.resources code.according to the ceqa guidelines,a project refers to the activity that is being approved,which may include multiple discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.guidelines,subd.c.the term project does not mean each separate governmental approval.ibid.this definition ensures that the action reviewed under ceqa is not the approval itself but the development or other activities that will result from the approval.citation.megaplex free alameda,supra,th at.
correspondingly,a pproval means the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person.the exact date of approval of any project is a matter determined by each public agency according to its rules,regulations,and ordinances.legislative action in regard to a project often constitutes approval.guidelines,subd.a.in save tara city of west hollywood cal th,save tara,the california supreme court confirmed that a project may be approved for the purpose of ceqa even though further discretionary governmental decisions would be needed before any environmental change could occur.there,the court rejected the argument that approval of a private project for ceqa purposes was limited to an unconditional agreement by the agency which irrevocably vested development rights,reasoning that s uch a rule would be inconsistent with the ceqa guidelines definition of approval as the agency earliest commitment to the project.citation.just as ceqa itself requires environmental review before a project approval,not necessarily its final approval citations,so the guideline defines approval as occurring when the agency first exercises its discretion to execute a contract or grant financial assistance,not when the last such discretionary decision is made.ibid.the save tara court emphasized that the policies behind ceqa are served by early environmental review.id.at the agency reservation of ceqa review until a later,final approval stage is unlikely to convince public observers that before committing itself to the project the agency fully considered the project environmental consequences.
here,the trial court properly determined that the july,resolutions constituted the project approval for the purpose of ceqa review.at that time,the laccd demonstrated its commitment to a project by directing that the laccd shall make the site available on a rental basis to a variety of service and educational entities and authorizing the laccd to negotiate and enter into a lease agreement with alliance.appellant representatives were present at the meeting when the laccd adopted the resolutions and expressed their concern about the lack of environmental review given the impacts triggered by the change in land use.also in,the laccd approved a discretionary expenditure of to the quatro design group for the purpose of redesigning the building interior and providing other services related to the implementation of the changed use of the building.over appellant objection,the laccd additionally approved a resolution committing itself to the portola purchase agreement,involving the acquisition of an adjacent property from the portola group.
the laccd actions in constituted approval of a project triggering the 
day limitations period in public resources code section,subdivision d,which means appellant november petition was untimely.see megaplex free alameda,supra,th at pp.city resolution authorizing approval of a disposition and development agreement was a project approval for statute of limitations purposes,even though the agreement was thereafter subject to a number of discretionary approvals chula vista,supra,th at resolution authorizing county staff to negotiate and award an agreement was a project approval for statute of limitations purposes.
we are not persuaded by appellant efforts to avoid this result.appellant contends that a new limitations period was triggered by the may execution of the lease to outside entities,because it was only at that point the previously identified traffic impacts would be realized.but as the trial court recognized,those impacts had already been identified in connection with the resolutions,and the execution of the lease therefore did not constitute a substantial change in the original project triggering a new limitations period.see concerned citizens of costa mesa,dist.agricultural cal d,if the agency makes substantial changes in a project after the filing of the eir and fails to file a later eir in violation of public resources code section,subdivision a,an action challenging the agency noncompliance with ceqa may be filed within days of the time the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that the project under way differs substantially from the one described in the eir.according to the statement of decision petitioner argues that a traffic analysis in an by richard brand,respondent construction manager,shows that both the alliance lease and the city of los angeles lease will result in an increase in traffic congestion during peak hours,which is a change to the physical environment requiring a new environmental review under ceqa.however,the discussion to which petitioner cites occurred in may and july of prior to the july,decision and,therefore,can not reasonably form the basis for petitioner to allege that substantial changes were made after the date respondent board approved the leasing of the campus.citation.as a result,petitioner fails to allege how the may,decision substantially changed the project.
on appeal,appellant argues that the may and july evaluation of traffic impacts was offered not to show a substantial change in the project,but rather,to show that the laccd obligation to conduct an environmental review of those impacts was not triggered until it committed itself to a particular course of action by entering into a lease.appellant relies on city of vernon board of harbor comrs.th,disapproved by save tara,supra,cal th at page,footnote,where the court held that a city complied with ceqa by not initiating environmental review at the time it entered into a letter of intent for a project but instead waiting until after federal approval.the save tara court expressly rejected the principles set forth in city of vernon,declining to limit project approval for ceqa purposes to an agency unconditional agreements irrevocably vesting development rights or an agreement to be legally bound to take that course of action.citation.save tara,supra,at.the court explained that o n this theory,any development agreement,no matter how definite and detailed,even if accompanied by substantial financial assistance from the agency and other strong indications of agency commitment to the project,falls short of approval so long as it leaves final ceqa decisions to the agency future discretion.such a rule would be inconsistent with the ceqa guidelines definition of approval as the agency earliest commitment to the project.citation.ibid.the court emphasized that ceqa approval typically occurs when an agency initially exercises its discretion to enter into a contract or provide monetary support not when the last decision is made.ibid.according to save tara,the resolutions approving an interim use of the building,directing the laccd to make the building available for lease to outside entities and authorizing a lease with alliance not the may,lease agreement constituted a project approval triggering the commencement of the day limitations period 
appellant also takes issue with the trial court reliance on chula vista,supra,th,arguing that differences in terminology render that case distinguishable.the trial court characterized the resolutions as authorizing the laccd to negotiate and enter into a lease with alliance and to negotiate and enter into other leases with college entities.appellant points out that while the resolution in chula vista authorized staff to negotiate and award the agreement,here the resolutions authorized the laccd staff to make the space available for rent,subject to approval by the board of trustees.chula vista,supra,at.in our view,the inclusion of board approval does not change the applicability of chula vista,as board approval was merely one of the additional steps that the laccd intended to take in implementing its project approval.see generally save tara,supra,cal th at citing case
