background 
scottie began kindergarten in the district in the fall of.at the conclusion of that school year,he was evaluated by his teacher and the school counselor,and they recommended that he be placed in developmental first grade the following year.these evaluations and recommendations were recorded in a placement form dated april.developmental first grade is not a special education placement.appellant agreed with this recommendation.scottie began the following year in hansen developmental first grade class.after three weeks in the class,appellant removed scottie from the class and the district 
after scottie removal,the next time appellant saw hansen was eight and a half years later when hansen purchased the condominium above appellant.hansen leased this condominium to kathy garrison.over the next few months,appellant and garrison became involved in unfriendly encounters,which included each side calling the police on the other,and allegations of threats and racial epithets.appellant also learned that someone had been making comments around the condominium property about herself and scottie.she hired a private investigator,christie spencer,to discover the substance of the comments and their source.
spencer arranged a meeting on march,in the condominium owned by hansen.the meeting was tape recorded and attended by hansen,garrison,and spencer.hansen viewed the meeting as a neighborly kind of dispute,not a school matter.hansen comments at that meeting about scottie social skills,behavior,and academic progress constitute the basis of appellant fourteenth amendment privacy claim 
scottie returned to the district for third grade and has been enrolled ever since.in the school year,his year,scottie became ill,underwent surgery,and was placed on homebound status.scottie was diagnosed with virus,which fatigues him to the point where he can not attend classes.as such,he has remained on homebound status ever since his year.an individual accommodation plan iap was developed for him pursuant to section to deliver homebound services and these iap have been revised annually.appellant has participated in these meetings and her requests for educational services for scottie have been complied with by the district,but at times,the district was late in providing some teaching materials to scottie homebound teacher.in the last two or three years,the associate superintendent,counselors not assigned to scottie,psychologists,and a psychomotrist have attended these iap meetings.
appellant was allowed to request teachers from outside the district to teach scottie for his seventh through years.her recommendation to teach scottie during his year,carmen heath,did not complete the district employment forms until the spring semester of that year,because she was hired through the unconventional process of appellant selection.upon receipt of these forms and completion of a background check,the district discovered that heath had a prior felony conviction.the district allowed her to finish the remaining school year but did not continue her employment the next year.
appellant was unhappy with this decision by the district because scottie and heath had a good relationship and she was pleased with heath performance.the district once again permitted appellant to request a teacher for scottie year.she selected an male with years of teaching experience and a master degree.this candidate was interviewed by the district but was not hired.instead,the district assigned andrea luster,who previously had taught scottie in his fifth and years,to serve as his teacher for his junior year.upon being notified that luster would replace heath,appellant informed the district that she disapproved of this decision because luster had had difficulty teaching scottie math.appellant had not expressed her dissatisfaction with luster before this time,however.because appellant refused to let luster teach scottie,he was without a teacher for his year.
the district tardy provision of teaching materials,selection of scottie teachers,and attendance of additional personnel members at scottie iap meetings provide the primary basis for appellant section disability discrimination and title vi racial discrimination claims.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.see bullington united air lines,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,affidavits,and other evidence show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we review the evidence and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see bullington,at.
although the movant must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,the movant is not required to negate the opposing party claim when the movant does not bear the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.see adler stores,cir citing celotex catrett,d.once the movant carries the first indicated burden,however,the nonmovant can not rest upon his or her pleadings,but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.bullington,at.summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence is such that no reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
at the time appellant brought this appeal,this court had held that a violation of the ferpa section at issue,b,is actionable under.see falvo owasso indep.sch,cir,rev on other grounds,d.the supreme court subsequently has held,however,that ferpa nondisclosure provisions create no rights enforceable under.gonzaga doe,d.accordingly,we affirm judgment for appellees on the ferpa claim,although on a different ground than relied upon below.
iv.fourteenth amendment 
before the district court,a component of appellant claim alleged that the district violated scottie right to privacy,as incorporated into the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.on appeal,she again raises her constitutional claim,but fails to argue that she is bringing it under.construing her cursory argument on the issue as a properly raised claim for a violation of fourteenth amendment rights,we reject appellant claim.
appellant claims that the following statements by hansen on march,violated scottie constitutional rights 
scottie had no social skills 
hansen held back scottie 
scottie should have stayed in kindergarten 
scottie never should have gone to developmental first grade 
scottie was a hellion or frustrated 
scottie was a bully 
scottie acted like king 
scottie was horrible or mean.
we recently considered whether school work and test grades of grade school students rose to the level of a category of information and concluded that there is no constitutional right of privacy in such information.see falvo,at.we do not believe that a teacher disclosure of information,observations,and impressions of students rises to the level of invading intimate privacies that have been recognized as part of the privacy penumbra of constitutional rights.see falvo,at holding that grades were not so highly personal or intimate as to fall within zone of constitutional protection.like the falvo court,we believe that to recognize constitutional protection for such comments would trivialize the fourteenth amendment.falvo,at.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the district on appellant fourteenth amendment claim.
section of the rehabilitation act 
the district argued below and in its brief on appeal that the district court did not have jurisdiction over appellant disability discrimination claim because she had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the individuals with disabilities education act the idea,et.the district court did not address this argument,because it found that appellant had failed to state a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada or section of the rehabilitation act of.as this court must always satisfy itself of jurisdiction before addressing the merits of a claim,we turn to the exhaustion issue first.see hayes unified sch.dist,cir addressing jurisdictional question of exhaustion before proceeding to merits of disability claim.we believe that both the language and the policy of the idea suggest that if a student with a disability seeks to bring a claim for educational injuries,then he must plead and show either that he has exhausted his administrative remedies under the idea or that the relief he is seeking his not available under the idea we agree with the district that appellant was required to exhaust her administrative remedies before bringing her disability claims in federal court.
the idea,and its predecessor the education of the handicapped act eha,was designed to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education fape that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.d a.the statute defines a child with a disability as including a child who has an other health impairment and who,by reason thereof,needs special education and related services.id.a ii.the idea regulations,in turn,instruct that other health impairment means having limited strength,vitality or alertness that i s due to chronic or acute health problems and a dversely affects a child educational performance.c i ii.
to ensure that children with disabilities were being afforded all of the educational benefits of the statute,congress mandated,among other measures,a host of procedural safeguards,so that parents and advocates could participate fully in the design and implementation of the child fape.see id.a.these procedural safeguards include the right to examine all records and participate in meetings with respect to identification,evaluation,and educational placement of the child,and the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child,and to obtain an independent evaluation of the child,id.b the right to receive prior written notice when the school proposes to change or refuses to change the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,id.b a b and an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the child identification,evaluation,or educational placement,id.b.if the school receives such a complaint,parents are given the opportunity to have an impartial due process hearing on the matter,id.f,and the right to appeal any finding or decision reached in the hearing,id.g.
as part of the bargain of providing children with educational rights and parents with procedural safeguards to protect those rights,congress required that parents turn first to the statute administrative framework to resolve any conflicts they had with the school educational services.in pertinent part,the idea provides,
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,the americans with disabilities act of,title v of the rehabilitation act of,or other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter,the procedures under subsections f due process hearing and g appeal of this subsection shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.
l internal citations omitted emphasis added.
congress added this exhaustion provision in response to the supreme court opinion in smith robinson,d,superseded by statute as stated in fontenot.bd.of elementary secondary,cir,in which the court held that the eha was the exclusive avenue through which to pursue a claim regarding the provision of publicly funded special education.at.following smith,congress passed the handicapped children protection act of,stat.codified at,preserving judicial review and clarify ing that the eha did not provide the exclusive remedy for such claims,but requiring exhaustion for relief that was also available under the eha.hayes,at.congress read the supreme court decision in smith and acted swiftly,decisively,and with uncharacteristic clarity to correct what it viewed as a judicial misinterpretation of its intent.id.quoting fontenot,at.
besides the statute straightforward and explicit requirement that plaintiffs exhaust administrative measures for available relief before filing a civil action,the policy supporting the exhaustion requirement also counsels that parents turn first to educational professionals,as opposed to courts,to remedy disputes over a child education.the idea design provides a carefully structured procedure for administrative remedies,which encourages parents to seek relief quickly when the injury occurs and allows the educational system to bring its expertise to bear in correcting its own mistakes.polera bd.of educ.of the newburgh enlarged city sch,cir.in adding the exhaustion provision,congress stressed the primacy of administrative remedies,stating that nothing in the amendment should be interpreted to allow parents to circumvent the due process procedures and protections created under the eha,at,reprinted in.indeed,the idea exhaustion requirement wisely gives educational professionals,in a child educational needs and the range of educational services that could ably meet those needs,at least the first crack at formulating a plan to overcome the consequences of educational shortfalls.charlie bd.of educ.of skokie sch.dist,cir 
aside from the unique advantages realized by the student from having educational experts address the shortcomings in the student education in the first instance,other benefits flow from requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies,such as allowing the agency to exercise its discretion and correct its own mistakes,and to develop technical issues and a factual record fully prior to court review.allowing plaintiffs to bypass the administrative process en route to state or federal court shifts the burden of factfinding from the educational specialists to the judiciary,thereby disrupt ing the idea carefully calibrated balance of providing judicial review only after administrative remedies have been exhausted.frazier fairhaven sch,cir.the factual record developed is an invaluable resource for a state or federal court required to adjudicate subsequent civil action covering the same terrain.id.exhaustion generally is credited with promoting accuracy,efficiency,agency autonomy and judicial economy,christopher portsmouth sch,cir citing mckart united states,d,and in the realm of special education,its benefits,both to the student and to the judiciary,prove to be even more valuable.
by the idea terms,however,exhaustion is required only for relief that is also available under the subchapter detailing the idea procedural safeguards.we turn our attention to the meaning of relief that is also available under that subchapter.
