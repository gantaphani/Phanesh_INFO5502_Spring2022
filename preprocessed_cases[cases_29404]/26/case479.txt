this court opinion,cir,is hereby withdrawn,and the following opinion is substituted.
in this interlocutory appeal,the appellants request reversal of a district court decision rejecting their claims to qualified immunity.in reaching a decision,we are required to determine the availability of a retaliation cause of action under,the applicability of the defense of qualified immunity to such a claim,and whether the appellees are entitled to that defense under the facts as determined by the district court.in the case of one appellee,nora hutto,we are also required to determine whether her claim alleging violation of her first amendment rights can survive a defense of qualified immunity.

nora hutto was appointed chair of the education division in february,succeeding prince.according to hutto,she became aware of the existence of a clique within the education division led by prince.hutto became convinced that prince and her allegedly including hines and carlson were out to get foley they not only opposed his promotion,but also schemed to bring about his termination.hutto supported foley,believing that he was being treated unfairly.she blames prince and her faction for causing her own removal as chair of the division in august.in july,she filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc,alleging that she had been removed as chair in retaliation for her support of foley

iv.discussion 
qualified immunity 
in addressing the claim of a public official to qualified immunity,we engage in a analysis.first,we must determine whether the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that the official violated a clearly established constitutional or statutory right.if the answer is in the affirmative,we then ask whether the official actions were objectively reasonable in light of the clearly established right.siegert gilley,d.
the appellants contend that their motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity should have been granted by the district court.qualified immunity attaches only to officials in their individual,not their official,capacities.harvey blake,cir.of course,the issue of qualified immunity arises only if the individual official is subject to liability in the first place,and liability does not necessarily run to all individual defendants.we recently noted in felton polles,cir,that it has not yet been decided whether a claim lies against an individual defendant not a party to the contract giving rise to a claim.id.at.we have,however,accepted that liability will lie against an individual defendant if that individual is essentially the same as the state for the purposes of the conduct.id.at quoting bellows amoco oil,cir.in the instant case,the district court found genuine issues of material fact as to whether the appellants exercised control over the faculty positions and titles held by foley and hutto.if so,the appellants were essentially the same as uhv for purposes of the retaliatory conduct alleged in this case.see francis college,cir holding that plaintiff could bring a claim against individual members of a tenure committee if those individuals were personally involved in the discrimination action see also,bellows,at citing with approval and interpreting faraca clements,cir.
we recognize that there is a tension between our decisions in bellows which cites faraca and oden oktibbeha county,cir which does not cite faraca with respect to the liability of individual defendants who are not parties to the employment contract.however,we do not believe that this is the proper case in which to decide the outer boundaries of liability as it applies to individual defendants nor to attempt to catalogue every fact situation which might subject an individual to such liability instead,we proceed to determine whether appellants prince and carlson are entitled to qualified immunity.
claims against individual public officials under are subject to the defense of qualified immunity,todd hawk,cir wicks mississippi state employment services,cir,as are claims against such individuals under.coleman,at.public officials are entitled to qualified immunity when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.as noted earlier,the reasonable person step is not reached unless the court first finds that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff,if proved,would constitute a violation of his clearly established rights.siegert,at.
