this appeal arises out of an order for payment of attorney fees and costs by a newspaper publisher to a public agency that complied with a burdensome request for documents under the california public records act pra,et section,subdivision d,provides for an award of attorney fees and costs to the public agency in the event of a clearly frivolous pra case.the trial court in this case found tim crews,the publisher of a newspaper with a small circulation in glenn county,pursued a frivolous pra petition against the willows unified school district district.crews made the pra request as part of his investigation into whether district superintendent steve olmos used public resources for such improper purposes as supporting the recall of the glenn county superintendent of schools.crews asked for a period of to and from olmos.the district responded that it would comply with the request but noted it would have to withhold some documents as required by the education code and other statutes that impose confidentiality protections.the district also requested that crews narrow his request,a request crews declined.over the ensuing weeks,the district and crews also discussed the format in which the would be delivered,eventually settling on scanned copies of the printed and redacted.
on the day the district had previously indicated it would begin turning over the requested documents,crews filed a pra petition in the superior court to compel production of the promised documents.although crews had not received any documents when he filed his pra petition,he did not serve his petition on the district until after he started receiving the scanned copies of the.district employees ultimately spent hours in reviewing,printing,scanning,and turning over approximately in portable document format pdf the district withheld approximately pages under a claim the documents were exempt from disclosure under the pra.the trial court eventually spent an inordinate amount of time in reviewing the documents in camera before finding the district did not improperly withhold any documents.the district omission of pages of attachments appears to have been inadvertent and cured when the district realized its error.the trial court denied crews pra petition on the merits and also found the pra petition to be frivolous.based on having to defend the frivolous pra petition,the court awarded fees and costs to the district.crews then petitioned this court for a writ of mandate to reverse the denial of his pra petition by the trial court.see,subd.c limiting appellate challenge to the denial of pra petition to writ review.this court summarily denied the petition 
crews also appealed from the judgment denying his pra petition and ordering attorney fees and costs to the district for defending against a frivolous pra petition and the order determining the amount of attorney fees and costs.on appeal,crews contends we must reverse the award of attorney fees and costs because his petition was not frivolous,he was really the prevailing party in this action,and the punitive nature of the award would have an impermissible chilling effect on journalists seeking to investigate governmental wrongdoing the district asserts the petition was clearly frivolous because it did not result in the production of any documents requested under the pra thus,the district requests that this court affirm the attorney fees and costs award.

we conclude the pra petition lacked merit but was not frivolous.crews filed the petition before he received any documents from the district.after rolling production of documents began,crews relied on the pra petition to challenge the district withholding of documents claimed to be exempt from disclosure and the district compliance with a conditional agreement to produce in pdf format by a reasonable date.although crews did not succeed in securing the withheld documents,his arguments on the matter were sufficiently meritorious to cause the trial court to examine the documents in camera.as to crews pursuit of in native format instead of pdf format,it remained uncertain whether the scanned were received in a timely manner and permissible pdf format until the trial court resolved the issue in the district favor.thus,while crews was unsuccessful in obtaining withheld documents or in native format,his pra petition was not frivolous.consequently,we reverse the award of attorney fees and costs to the district.
factual and procedural history 
crews request for records from the district 
the district serves students in four schools but employs only five administrators.the low level of staffing requires olmos,the district superintendent,to carry out duties that include interacting with the school board,serving as the human resources administrator,serving as principal of one of the schools,handling student expulsions and discipline,engaging in staff and curriculum development,handling special education considerations,and attending extracurricular events at the schools.
on march,crews requested that the district produce all to and from olmos for the preceding year.on march,the district responded that it would comply with the request with the exception of those documents exempt from disclosure.fifteen days later,the district stated it could begin producing documents on april.the district estimated crews request encompassed approximately that would result in approximately printed pages on april,the district asked crews to narrow his request in order to make compliance easier and less burdensome.crews declined.
olmos undertook the task of reviewing the subject to the request and sought technical assistance in determining the optimum way to provide the materials to crews.as the trial court noted,the records request required olmos to personally review his and then to submit them to the districts sic legal staff to insure the protections he is required to provide to the school district,his staff and particularly the students in the district were strictly complied with.the district director of technology services informed olmos it did not have the software capable of redacting that contained exempt or privileged information.thus,the district was required to print,redact,and scan the to ensure safeguarding confidential information.
the district legal counsel informed crews of the procedure it planned to use to comply with his records request.on may,crews legal counsel informed the district an agreement had been reached to provide the requested materials on compact discs cds.the transmission of the requested materials remained a contentious issue.eventually,crews attorney informed the district we can agree to disagree over whether or not producing the in the precise pdf format that the district is using is sufficient compliance with the pra.if you commit to produce all remaining by a reasonable date of your choosing,then the electronic format wo be an issue.
on april,the district delivered the first cd of in pdf format to crews.the rolling production continued with the last cd of in pdf format delivered on december.the district withheld documents it claimed were exempt from disclosure drafts,notes,or memoranda pending litigation student records personnel matters and privileged documents under the california evidence code.
pra petition in the superior court 
shortly after noon on april,crews filed his pra petition in the glenn county superior court.when he filed his pra petition,crews had not yet received any of the requested from the district.however,by the time crews served his petition on may,he had received the first of sets of documents on cd rolling production of documents continued throughout.ultimately,district staff devoted nearly hours reviewing,printing,scanning,and transmitting approximately to crews.however,the district also withheld approximately pages of under a claim of exemption or privilege.
crews requested that the trial court order the district to provide anew all of the previously requested in the exact electronic format that the are held in also known as native format.the district took the position that it had complied to the best of its ability with the pra request.
on march,the trial court issued a tentative decision finding the district did not have the ability to produce the in native format.the court further found additionally and very importantly,crews through his own attorney not only agreed to the pdf format,he insisted on it.the court acknowledged that crews pointed out a number of missing attachments from the materials handed over.the district was ordered to hand over any omitted attachments crews chose to specify.the court noted the district offered to produce the records that it withheld on the basis of privilege or exemption for the courts sic review in camera and therefore prove no violation of the pra has occurred.the tentative decision concluded by indicating the court would deny the pra petition.
on september,the trial court received a banker box of approximately pages of copies of the emails.the court then spent an inordinate amount of time in reviewing the documents and determined that the district has withheld the documents properly under b c and k as they are exempt or privileged from release under the pra and therefore the withholding was justified under.
judgment denying the pra petition and ordering attorney fees and costs to the district for defending against a frivolous pra petition 
on november,the trial court entered a judgment denying the pra petition.in the judgment,the court made the following findings the district consistently responded it would comply with crews request to the extent the district could do so without violating any exemptions or privileges.specifically,the court found that upon being served with the records request,the district launched upon a course of conduct indicative of nothing less than an appropriate response to the request.as the court further noted,due to the nature of the business of respondent as a unified school district,the district was required to utilize the utmost protection relative to sensitive data that was exempt or privileged from dissemination to the public under the california education code.the district,on a regular basis,provided the latest data as it became available.due to the sheer volume of involved,this court can not find that the district delayed unreasonably the delivery of the cd to crews.the trial court also reiterated its finding that the district produced the in the pdf format insisted upon by crews counsel.the court concluded the district and olmos did not violate the pra.
in its judgment,the trial court also determined the district was entitled to attorney fees and costs for having to defend against crews frivolous pra petition.the court found crews filed his pra petition contemporaneously with the district first delivery of a cd containing the requested documents and crews served the petition after the district had initiated compliance with his pra request.the court concluded the service of the petition did not result in any benefit whatsoever to crews and was therefore frivolous pursuant to section,subdivision d.
crews petition for writ of mandate in this court 
crews filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court in which he argued the pra petition had been erroneously denied.we summarily denied the petition for writ of mandate in crews superior court willows unified school district,nonpub.order.
award of attorney fees and costs to the district 
the district moved for in attorney fees.crews opposed the motion,arguing no fees should be awarded in order to avoid a chilling effect on pra requesters.crews also argued that virtually any sanction award would subject him to virtually certain financial ruin.in response,the district introduced evidence of a settlement agreement in crews glenn county office of education glenn county case under which crews received to dismiss another lawsuit against a different public agency.
the trial court awarded in attorney fees and in costs to the district.the court noted it had previously found the pra petition to be frivolous.the court found the only conceivable reason for service of the writ may have been in connection with the documents protected by the claimed privilege.however,it appears to this court that the parties certainly could have agreed to a neutral party to resolve any issue presented before application was made to the court through a formal writ proceeding.the amount of time spent by counsel in defending against the pra petition amounted to.in determining fees,the court stated it was concerned with the accuracy of crews declaration regarding his income and assets.the court found crews exceptionally declaration was filed without benefit of any supporting documentation whatsoever.at the very least,the court would expect a financial statement,statement or a tax return or a profit and loss statement to support his claim of indigency.the court took judicial notice of the settlement agreement proffered by the district and rejected crews claim he did not receive the settlement amount due under the agreement.
crews timely filed notices of appeal from the judgment denying the pra petition and ordering attorney fees and costs to the district and the order determining the amount of attorney fees and costs.
discussion 
iappealability and scope of review 
at the outset,we consider the scope of review for the issues raised by crews appeal.as we explain,crews can not challenge the trial court denial of his pra petition.nonetheless,he may challenge the trial court order awarding attorney fees and costs because he timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
appellate challenges to the trial court denial of a petition under the pra may be brought only by extraordinary writ.the government code provides that an order of the court,either directing disclosure by a public official or supporting the decision of the public official refusing disclosure,is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of section of the code of civil procedure from which an appeal may be taken,but shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for the issuance of an extraordinary writ,subd.c.
consistent with section,subdivision c,crews sought a peremptory writ of mandate in this court by arguing his pra petition should have been granted as to his request for olmos in their native electronic format and as to his request for an order compelling the district to identify the exemptions or privileges under which it withheld documents.the california supreme court in powers city of richmond cal th powers confirmed that decisions compelling or refusing disclosure of public records under the pra are reviewable only by petition for extraordinary writ.butt,supra,th at.thus,crews can not use this appeal to argue the trial court erred in denying the in native format or the district wrongly claimed exemptions or privileges for withheld documents.
nonetheless,crews may file an appeal challenging the propriety and amount of the attorney fees and costs award.an order granting or denying attorney fees under the pra is reviewable on appeal from a final judgment in the proceeding.motorola,supra,th at,fn,citing butt,supra,th.crews properly appealed from the judgment that both denied crews pra petition and found the district entitled to attorney fees and costs for defending against a frivolous pra petition.
crews also filed a second notice of appeal on october,from the order determining the amount of attorney fees and costs.however,it has been previously held that when a judgment awards costs and fees to a prevailing party and provides for the later determination of the amounts,the notice of appeal subsumes any later order setting the amounts of the award.grant list lathrop th.thus,we have jurisdiction under crews first notice of appeal to review the propriety of the trial court award of attorney fees and costs to the district.accordingly,we dismiss crews second appeal from the order determining the amount of attorney fees and costs.see guillemin stein th.

award of attorney fees and costs to the district for defending against a frivolous pra petition 
crews contends his pra request was not frivolous.moreover,crews asserts he was the prevailing party in this action.he further argues sanctions should not be imposed in any event due to the potential chilling effect on investigative journalists in california.we are not persuaded crews was the prevailing party,but nonetheless conclude the pra petition was not frivolous.
attorney fees and costs awards for frivolous pra actions 
as this court has previously noted,californians have a constitutional right to access the records of their public agencies.they have a strong interest in knowing how government officials conduct public business,particularly when allegations of malfeasance by public officers are raised.brv,superior court th.implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions.in order to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.los angeles unified school dist.superior court th,quoting cbs,block cal d.
to support the policy of disclosure,section,subdivision d,provides the trial court shall award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff should the plaintiff prevail in litigation filed pursuant to this section.however,public agencies are ordinarily not entitled to attorney fees and costs from a requester who has failed to secure documents under the pra.public agencies may recover attorney fees and costs only i f the court finds that the plaintiff case is clearly frivolous,subd.d.
section does not define the term clearly frivolous.thus,we turn to the guidance of the california supreme court in in re marriage of flaherty cal d flaherty.in flaherty,the court articulated the test for determining whether an appeal is frivolous.in formulating the test,the flaherty court explained that a n appeal that is simply without merit is not by definition frivolous and should not incur sanctions.counsel should not be deterred from filing such appeals out of a fear of reprisals.justice kaus stated it well.in reviewing the dangers inherent in any attempt to define frivolous appeals,he said the courts can not be blind to the obvious the borderline between a frivolous appeal and one which simply has no merit is vague indeed the difficulty of drawing the line simply points up an essential corollary to the power to dismiss frivolous appeals that in all but the clearest cases it should not be used.people sumner d.the same may be said about the power to punish attorneys for prosecuting frivolous appeals the punishment should be used most sparingly to deter only the most egregious conduct.flaherty,supra,at.thus,the supreme court held that an appeal may be deemed frivolous only when prosecuted for an improper motive,to harass the respondent or for purposes of delay or when lacking any merit,when any reasonable attorney would agree the appeal is totally without merit.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
the same test with its objective and subjective prongs has been applied in determining whether an action is frivolous from the start,jones jones d,citing flaherty lavine hospital of the good samaritan d,see also code civ.proc,subd.b defining a frivolous action to be one that is a totally and completely without merit or b for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.the addition of the adverb clearly to frivolous does not change the test for purposes of section,subdivision d.since a frivolous action is one entirely lacking in merit,there can be no lower standard for a clearly frivolous action.see flaherty,supra,cal d at state of california ex rel.standard elevator,west bay builders,th,clearly frivolous action under the false claims act is one devoid of merit.
prevailing party 
of course,a prevailing party can not be deemed to have brought a clearly frivolous action.crews first challenge to the award of attorney fees and costs is to argue he rather than the district was the prevailing party.in his view,his receipt of the documents he requested from the district means he prevailed under the pra.we reject the contention.
mere receipt of documents does not necessarily mean the plaintiff prevailed in a pra case because the request alone might have caused the documents to be released.a plaintiff prevails within the meaning of section,subdivision d,when he or she files an action which results in defendant releasing a copy of a previously withheld document.citation.los angeles times alameda corridor transportation authority th,belth garamendi d.an action under the pra results in the release of previously withheld documents if the lawsuit motivated the defendants to produce the documents.rogers superior court th,motorola communication electronics,department of general services th.cases denying attorney fees to a plaintiff under the act have done so because substantial evidence supported a finding that the litigation did not cause the agency to disclose any of the documents ultimately made available citations.los angeles times alameda corridor transportation authority,supra,at.galbiso orosi public utility dist.th.
in this case,the trial court found t he service of crews pra writ did not result in any benefit whatsoever to crews.the record supports the trial court finding.upon receiving crews request,the district responded it would comply with his request but withhold documents exempt from disclosure.although the district indicated its limited resources would require time to produce the documents,it did not refuse to comply with the pra request.crews ultimately received all of the records to which he was entitled.the trial court found the district had not erred in withholding even a single document among the thousands for which an exemption or privilege was claimed.although the district inadvertently omitted a small number of attachments to the,the oversight appears to have been corrected promptly and voluntarily.in short,the trial court finding that the pra petition did not cause the release of any documents is well supported.consequently,crews is not the prevailing party in the pra action.
whether crews pra petition was frivolous 
the conclusion that an action lacks merit does not determine whether it was frivolous.as the flaherty court noted,counsel and their clients have a right to present issues that are arguably correct,even if it is extremely unlikely that they will win.flaherty,supra,cal d at.thus,crews failure to prevail on his pra claims does not mean his case was utterly devoid of merit or brought solely to harass olmos or the district.lesser huntington harbor d,see also marriage of gong and kwong th,lack of merit alone did not establish that an appeal was frivolous.based on our examination
