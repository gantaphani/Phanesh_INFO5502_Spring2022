introduction 
this appeal concerns the proper method for calculating leave deductions for days of missed work for an injured school bus driver,donna haynes.a classified school employee is entitled to receive several kinds of compensation and leave when injured or ill workers compensation benefits,days of industrial and illness leave sick leave vacation leave and a form of leave called differential leave.under the rule of section,in addition to other forms of leave,an employee is entitled to receive differential leave at half pay for up to days.
the california school employees association csea and haynes,petitioners and respondents on appeal petitioners,contend that the colton joint unified school district and the school board collectively colton improperly deducted both vacation leave and differential leave under section concurrently.
colton appeals from a judgment granting the writ petition.we agree with petitioners and the superior court that colton could not deduct vacation leave and differential leave concurrently.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are generally undisputed except for a slight disagreement about when haynes received workers compensation benefits.haynes was employed as a school bus driver for colton.on may,she injured her knee.she had surgery on may.she was absent for various periods between may,and july,during which time she received workers compensation benefits.the csea contends colton,while collecting haynes workers compensation benefits,miscalculated her vacation leave and differential leave.
two leave periods are at issue.petitioners do not contest the calculations made for the initial days of industrial and illness leave between may,and september,or for the leave period between may,and july,when colton deducted sick leave of day and differential leave of one day at.the two periods for which petitioners do question the deductions are the leave period of work days between september and december,and another six days for the winter school break between december and.
between september and december,for each of the work days absent,haynes assigned her workers compensation benefits of of a day pay to colton.colton then deducted of a day of haynes accrued vacation,and paid her for one full day.during that time,haynes had no sick leave.additionally,colton deducted differential leave,an additional day at pay under section,meaning that colton charged haynes the equivalent of two days of leave while paying haynes for only one day.colton declarant,james downs,asserted colton had the right under the collective bargaining agreement,articles and,to deduct differential leave concurrently while deducting vacation leave and while receiving haynes workers compensation benefits.
the parties disagree about the deductions made for the six days of the december winter break.in the writ petition and her supporting declaration,haynes avers that she received of her pay in workers compensation benefits,which she assigned to colton,and colton deducted one full vacation day and one day of differential leave,making the amount of deductions two and days of leave for each of the six days.
in its opening appellant brief,colton contends haynes did not receive workers compensation benefits for the six days of winter break because it was a mandatory vacation for employees.colton asserts it deducted one full vacation day and one day of differential leave for each day.in their respondents brief,petitioners cite the record to show that haynes did receive workers compensation for the six days in december.colton does not attempt to refute this point.
csea and haynes did not file a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement.instead,they filed the petition for writ of mandate seeking to compel colton to recalculate haynes leave deductions.colton demurred on the grounds that petitioners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not pursuing the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement.the court overruled the demurrer.
the court rejected colton argument about exhaustion of remedies and granted the writ petition colton contends that petitioners have an obligation to exhaust their administrative remedies.at bench,the court finds this does not apply in that petitioners are attempting to enforce a controlling statute and not a collective bargaining agreement.the language of education code supports petitioners contention.in part,the paid sick leave authorized under such a rule shall be exclusive of any other paid leave,holidays,vacation,or compensating time to which the employee may be entitled.from the court review of the moving and responding papers the only reasonable conclusion is that exclusive means just that.
discussion 
we conduct a de novo review where the facts are not disputed and the legal issues on appeal involve statutory construction.california school employees kern community college dist.th,d,citing california sch.employees willits unified sch.dist.d.although the parties may have initially disagreed about whether haynes received workers compensation benefits for the six days of the december winter break,colton finally seems to concede she did receive benefits because it does not contest csea citation to the record.we also do not deem the facts about workers compensation benefits to be dispositive in deciding the principal legal issue in the case whether colton could deduct vacation leave and differential leave concurrently.
colton argues both the collective bargaining agreement and the education code permit it to deduct the two kinds of leave concurrently.colton also contends the issue involves interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and therefore should have first been presented for administrative adjudication.
petitioners counter that their writ petition depends wholly on statutory interpretation,allowing recourse to the courts in the first instance.furthermore,they assert the education code provides for consecutive,not concurrent,use of vacation leave and differential leave.
several kinds of leave were available to haynes.during the whole period of her absence for injury,she received workers compensation benefits of her regular pay,and.for the first days,she was entitled to industrial and illness leave.after that leave was exhausted,under the education code and the collective bargaining agreement,she was entitled to receive any accrued sick leave,succeeded by her vacation leave,and augmented by her differential subject to coordination under articles and of the collective bargaining agreement to keep her in status as long as possible,and.petitioners agree colton could properly deduct sick leave and differential leave concurrently,as it did between may and july.petitioners,however,contend that colton could not properly deduct vacation leave and differential leave concurrently between september and december.
the issues on appeal primarily involve statutory construction of the education code.based on an interpretation of section and the other related statutes,the writ petition challenged colton practice of deducting vacation and differential leave concurrently.a writ of mandate ordering colton to recalculate the amounts wrongfully deducted from haynes leave banks would,of necessity,conclude colton policy violated section.california school employees,tustin chapter tustin unified school dist.th,d.we conclude a writ petition was the appropriate proceeding for petitioners to pursue their claims rather than a grievance or administrative proceeding.
the most significant statute at issue is section,which provides for differential leave of days at half pay,minus the number of regular sick leave days the employee has accrued.section excludes vacation leave from its operation 
when a person employed in the classified service is absent from his duties on account of illness or accident for a period of five months or less,whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of employment of the employee,the amount deducted from the salary due him for any month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum which is actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill his position durin
