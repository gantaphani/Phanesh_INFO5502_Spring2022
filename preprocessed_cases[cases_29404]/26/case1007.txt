on january,the district court for the district of arizona ruled that arizona was violating the equal educational opportunity act of,et.eeoa,because the state funding for english language instruction for speakers was not reasonably calculated to effectively implement the educational theory which the state had approved.flores arizona,d,flores ii.eight years later,arizona has still not satisfied the terms of that judgment,nor complied with the bulk of the injunctions entered against it as a result of that ruling.although arizona and the arizona board of education acknowledge that the state remains out of compliance and do not seek to vacate the judgment or the injunctive orders,the arizona superintendent of public instruction,the speaker of the arizona house of representatives,and the president of the arizona senate moved for relief from judgment we affirm the district court denial of relief.
background 
it has been more than fifteen years since the initial complaint in this action was filed and eight years since the final judgment on liability issued.the relief process has been arduous,with arizona moving forward,to the considerable degree it has,largely in response to a consent decree resulting from this litigation and a series of relief orders.over this long period,local and national conditions have shifted in significant ways.the moving parties contend they have done so sufficiently as to warrant relief from judgment,even though arizona has never complied with the specific terms of the present injunction against it.explaining why that argument fails requires rehearsing the history of this case.we do so here,beginning with the complaint and declaratory judgment,moving through the intermediate orders,and then discussing in detail the proceedings leading up to this case,which were triggered by a new state funding statute and resulted in an evidentiary hearing.
a.the eeoa and the complaint 
nogales is a small city along the mexican border in southern arizona.in,when this suit began,the population of the nogales unified school district nusd was almost entirely hispanic that is still so.most of its approximately students come from homes where spanish is the first language.these students are distributed among six elementary schools,two middle schools,one high school,and one alternative high school.the great majority of the district students are classified as english language learners ell for at least some portion of their academic careers.in,for instance,thirty percent of the students were in ell programs and an additional sixty percent had been in such programs.although arizona theory of ell instruction has changed over the years,the enormous importance of such programs to students and parents in nogales has not.
ell students and parents in nogales we refer to them as flores,after class representative miriam flores,were faced with serious inadequacies in ell instruction and sued to correct them.the suit proceeded as a class action,with the class defined as all minority at risk and limited english proficient children now or hereafter,enrolled in nogales unified school district,as well as their parents and guardians.
flores second amended complaint,filed november,primarily alleged that the state has failed to provide financial and other resources necessary for adequate implementation of mandatory ell programs by public school districts in arizona,because t he cost of ell instruction complying with federally prescribed state mandates far exceeds the only financial assistance the state theoretically provides school districts for such purposes.as a result,flores contended,arizona,the state superintendent,and the state board of education violated the eeoa.
the relevant portion of the eeoa provides 
no state shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race,color,sex,or national origin,by 
f the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.
this provision of the eeoa was intended to remedy the linguistic discrimination identified by lau nichols,d,in which the supreme court held that failing to provide for the needs of speaking students is to make a mockery of public education,rendering classroom experiences for these children wholly incomprehensible and in no way meaningful.id.at.see also castaneda pickard,cir noting that the eeoa codifies the essential holding of lau,that schools are not free to ignore the need of limited english speaking children for language assistance to enable them to participate in the instructional program of the district.
flores alleged that such needs were not being met in arizona.she charged arizona with administer ing a school finance scheme that is just sufficient to let less distressed,predominantly anglo districts impart essential skills to their mainstream student bodies but that does not and will not enable nusd or similarly situated districts to impart the same essential skills to decisively minority enrollments requiring expanded compensatory programs,smaller class sizes and further efforts of like nature in order to acquire them.
flores complaint was premised on the eeoa analytic framework provided by the fifth circuit in castaneda.see at see also gomez illinois state bd.of,cir applying the castaneda analysis.the castaneda framework is first,courts must be satisfied that the school system is purs uing a program informed by an educational theory recognized as sound by some experts in the field or,at least,deemed a legitimate experimental strategy.castaneda,at.second,the programs and practices actually used by a school system must be reasonably calculated to implement effectively the educational theory adopted by the school.id.at.there must,in other words,be sufficient practices,resources and personnel to transform the theory into reality.id.third,even if theory is sound and resources are adequate,the program must be borne out by practical results.id.flores alleged,consistent with castaneda step two,that arizona had failed to provide financial and other resources necessary for adequate implementation of its ell programs.
b.the declaratory judgment and arizona school funding system 
after lengthy proceedings and a bench trial,the district court on january,held that arizona was in violation of the eeoa and granted declaratory judgment in flores favor see flores ii,d at.of the many issues raised in flores complaint,only one eeoa issue was decided by the court w hether or not defendants sic adequately fund and oversee the lau program in nusd id.at.the rest of the eeoa violations originally alleged,including failures adequately to evaluate and monitor ell students,to provide tutoring and other forms of compensatory instruction,and to design successful ell programming,were covered by a consent decree approved by the district court on july.see id.
the particulars of arizona school funding system are therefore at the heart of this case.we pause to describe them here.
consistent with article xi,of the arizona constitution,school funding in arizona is designed to be essentially equal across districts,despite differences in local property values.see roosevelt elementary sch.dist.bishop,roosevelt i to ensure equality,the state calculates the maximum support level a district may spend,referred to as the revenue control limit,see,and then pays the difference between that level and the amount the district can raise by levying a tax rate against property in its area,see.thus,regardless of the local tax base,the amount each district can spend per pupil is roughly equalized statewide,by first setting a maximum spending level and then making up the gap between local tax revenues and that level with state funds 
the revenue control limit,and hence the district support level,is calculated by adding together funds designated for transporting students to school,see,and base support funds,see.it is these base funds with which we are primarily concerned these funds are districts may spend them essentially as do not appear to have been calibrated to any minimum amount necessary for a basic education.see roosevelt i,at.nonetheless,they represent the core funding provided for such an education.
funding allocations are made by using a weighting system a per pupil weighted amount of funding is calculated by multiplying a support level weight which varies by district type and size and by the student grade level by a statewide baseline amount.see.a a weights,b baseline.for the school year,for instance,the statewide baseline amount was.b a.the support level weight for a typical student in grade eight in most school districts is.a,so a district could spend to support that student in.
not all students are typical,of course.some have special needs which impose additional,incremental costs.ell students,for example,naturally require additional support.arizona funding formula provides for these incremental costs through an additional group b weighting system which adds additional funding for various student groups,including ell students.see.b.in,for instance,the group b weight for ell students was,so a district received an additional to cover the ell component of that student education,on top of the base level provided for each pupil.
the core assumption of arizona funding formula,then,is that ell students impose incremental costs on a district,above the base level funding allocation.so,while all of the funding base level and group b weights is allocated to the district as a block grant,a district that spends more on ell incremental costs than allocated is necessarily spending less on basic educational needs per pupil.
taking this framework as a given,the district court in its declaratory judgment opinion inquired whether arizona funding specifically for ell group b covered the incremental costs of ell programming.the court found that it did not.flores ii,d at.
this finding was well supported.arizona had conducted a cost study in which determined that school districts were spending about in dollars,unadjusted for inflation per ell student.id.at.this study was seriously methodologically flawed it did not,for instance,determine what districts should be spending.but even by the study flawed measure,arizona ell funding was inadequate on a statewide basis.twelve years after the study,the district court found,arizona ell group b weight,provided only about per student.id.at.
that this support was inadequate to live up to arizona eeoa obligations to its school districts and their students was supported by several examples of ell program deficiencies in nusd,including 
too many students in a class room,
not enough class rooms,
not enough qualified teachers,including teachers to teach english as a second language and bilingual teachers to teach content area studies,
not enough teacher aids,
an inadequate tutoring program,and 
insufficient teaching materials for both english as a second language and content area courses.
in short,arizona minimum base level for funding lau programs was arbitrary and capricious and bore no relation to the actual funding needed to ensure that ell students in nusd are achieving mastery of its specified essential skills.id.in particular,the court held,the ell group b weight appropriation was not reasonably calculated to effectively implement the ell programs,and arizona had,therefore,failed to follow through with resources necessary to transform theory into reality,as the castaneda framework requires see castaneda,at.
relief and arizona ell programs 
the judgment was not appealed.nonetheless,arizona did not take action to eliminate the violations found in the declaratory judgment.instead,the state legislature defeated several attempts to commission an adequate study of ell costs that would enable it to set appropriate ell funding levels.
in october of,ten months after the issuance of the declaratory judgment,the district court ordered arizona to prepare a cost study to establish the proper appropriation to effectively implement ell programs.flores arizona,d,flores iii.such a study was critical,the court indicated,because as a matter of law the state minimum base level for funding lau programs bears no relation to the actual funding needed to ensure that ell students are achieving mastery of the state specified essential skills.id.at.this injunction was not appealed either.
shortly after the injunction issued,in november,arizona voters approved two propositions that altered arizona school funding and ell programs.proposition largely abolished bilingual education,replacing it with sheltered english immersion,a teaching method in which nearly all classroom instruction is in english but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language.proposition increased school funding generally in arizona through a sales tax increase.see.funding is available for many purposes but is not directed specifically towards ell programs.see.e.
meanwhile,as ordered,arizona commissioned a cost study we refer to it as the sjobergevashnek study,after the consulting group that largely directed it.the final study,however,proved to be a disappointment.it did not estimate the incremental costs of eeoa compliance,but instead reported on what several districts nationwide were spending.the study reported widely variable incremental costs for various ell programs,ranging from about to per ell student.it also found that nusd was spending in incremental costs per pupil,while noting that the nusd program might not fully address the unique and extraordinary needs of nusd ell population.
some additional guidance came from a study conducted by the staff of several democratic members of the legislature the staffers study,also released in.aggregating data from other states and from arizona,the staffers study estimated in incremental costs per student would be required for eeoa compliant number,it noted,which was generally consistent with the experience of other states.
arizona did not act on either study.after flores again moved for relief,the court,on june,restated its holding that as a matter of law the state minimum base level for funding lau programs was not rationally linked to funding needed to ensure that ell students are achieving mastery of the state specified essential skills.flores arizona,no,wl at flores iv.it ordered arizona to provide funding that shall bear a rational relationship to the actual funding needed by no later than january.id.at.this injunction,too,was not appealed.
the legislature responded by enacting hb on december.that law increased the ell group b weight to,which generated,at that time,about per student,roughly the amount that nusd was recorded as spending in the sjobergevashnek study.hb also provided funds for a more comprehensive cost study than had been done previously.contending that hb was not adequate,flores again moved for relief.
initially,the district court agreed with flores.it held,in an order issued on april,that the in base level funding was not adequate because it was based on nusd actual spending as of,which generated the very program that this court declaratory judgment held to be deficient.flores arizona,no.at flores v.a few months later,however,the court reconsidered,on arizona motion,and held that hb funding levels were adequate as an interim measure pending further study and review,including the cost study funded by hb.flores arizona,no.at flores vi.june.the order was not appealed,and three years passed 
again,the legislature gathered some data and,again,it did not act upon the data it received.as part of hb,the legislature commissioned a detailed cost study from the national conference of state legislatures the ncsl study.ncsl submitted a first draft in august and a second draft in february,upon which we rely.the study used two approaches a survey sent to arizona school districts to determine ell program spending and two expert panels,one of state and one of national experts,convened to estimate the costs of ell programs.
the school district survey was hampered by a small response seven of the sixteen surveyed districts provided data.ncsl noted the problem but analyzed the available data,which showed an average expenditure of per pupil in incremental costs.ncsl cautioned that this data was limited and of questionable quality,noting that the cost figure might be somewhat understated.
expert estimates of appropriate rather than actual spending were significantly higher.the national expert panel recommended a range of spending,based on the degree of students need for help and grade level from per pupil for students at the high school level to for elementary school students.the state expert panel recommended spending in per pupil incremental costs in grades and in grades.
again,arizona did not act to bring its system into line with either set of cost data.again,flores moved for relief on january,the court set an april,deadline for arizona to appropriately and constitutionally fund the state ell programs taking into account the court previous orders.flores arizona,no.at flores vii.
d.the first contempt order and hb 
arizona failed to act before the deadline.flores moved for sanctions.on december,deploring the fact that t housands of children who have now been impacted by the state inadequate funding of ell programs had yet to begin school when plaintiffs filed this case,the court held that arizona was in civil contempt.flores arizona,d,flores viii.it set a deadline of fifteen days after the start of the legislative session for compliance with its order,and imposed a schedule of fines that would begin to accrue if arizona did not act and that were to be distributed to arizona schools to support ell students.id.at see also order re distribution of fines,no.march.
arizona did not enact compliant legislation and accrued over million in fines.eventually,in the spring of,arizona governor janet napolitano allowed hb,the legislature effort to create a permanent compliant funding system,to become law without her signature 
hb is consistent with arizona base costs plus group b weights approach to education funding,but includes some additional ell funds designed to cover incremental costs above group b weight levels,although there are no guaranteed appropriations for these funds.along with this funding structure,the statute provides for further statewide standardization of ell programs,presumably in part to make it possible for the state more easily to monitor and assess the impact and use of allocated funds and the need for additional funds.
to drive the standardization process,hb creates the arizona english language learners task force within the state department of education.see.the task force is to develop and adopt research based models of structured english immersion programs for use by school districts and charter schools.id.at c each school district and charter school is to adopt one of the models or request a waiver.see.to aid in implementing the models,hb also creates an office of english language acquisition services,which is to develop guidelines for monitoring ell students and programs,create teacher training programs,and provide other forms of technical assistance.see.finally,the state board of education is charged with developing a structured english immersion endorsement program for use in training and certifying arizona teachers.see.
the models,and ell education generally,are funded by three mechanisms under hb,representing significant potential increases in ell funding but coming with significant limitations 
first,hb raises the group b weight for ell students from to,which corresponds to an increase from about per student to about per student.see hb,to be codified at.b there is,however,a significant as well unlike earlier group b weight funding,under hb group b funding for the same ell pupil shall not be provided for more than two fiscal years.hb.
second,hb establishes the arizona structured english immersion fund,which provides supplemental funds above the group b weights to implement the models.see.those funds come,however,with several restrictions.like the group b weights,they are limited to two years of availability for any one student.j.and only incremental costs of the programs are funded,which are defined as those in addition to the normal costs of conducting programs for english proficient students,id.at l,and which do not include compensatory instruction.compensatory instruction consists of programs in addition to normal classroom instruction which are limited to improving the english proficiency of current english language learners and pupils who were english language learners and who have been reclassified as english proficient within the previous two years.stat at g.
in addition,the amount of money provided by the structured english immersion fund is offset by the following funding sources 
all federal title iii monies and any other federal monies designated solely for the educational needs of english language learners.
the portion of title i and title ii a monies determined by the english language learner population as a percentage of the qualified population.
the portion of impact aid monies determined by the english language learner population as a percentage of the qualified population.a school district or charter school shall only apply unexpended impact aid monies to english language learner programs after it has applied its impact aid monies for other allowable uses as permitted by state law.
the portion of monies the district may levy to further desegregation efforts pursuant to.determined by the english language learner population as a percentage of the qualified population.
the ell group b weight 
i.at the same time,hb provides that m onies from the fund are to be used to supplement existing programs for english language learners and shall not be used to supplant available monies used to pay for the normal costs of conducting programs for english proficient students.f.
importantly,there is no guaranteed legislative appropriation for the structured english immersion fund.instead,after school districts and charter schools submit budget requests,the department of education is to verify and collect all the requests and submit them to the arizona legislature for funding.c.the legislature is not required to appropriate any monies to fund such requests.
third,hb establishes the statewide compensatory instruction fund to be used for compensatory instruction only.see.these funds,too,come with a caveat they shall not be used to supplant any federal,state or local monies,including desegregation monies,used for compensatory instruction that had been budgeted for english language learners as of february.id.at e.in other words,the state funds provided must not replace any funds already in use for the same purpose.the total amount of funding is also limited.although the legislature appropriated million for this program for the fiscal year,no further appropriations are required by the statute.hb.
hb was for the most part immediately effective.school districts and charter schools,however,could not adopt the models until they were developed,which they now have been.also,monies for the structured english immersion fund do not have to be appropriated and to this point have not been.most importantly,the provisions associated with the group b weight increase,require court approval.in this regard,hb provides 
the group b weight increase and appropriation to fund it,along with the do not become effective unless the united states district c ourt for the d istrict of arizona in the case of flores state of arizona issues an order that,by this act,the state has taken appropriate action to establish a program that addresses the orders in the case and,at least on an interim basis,the court will permit this act to be fully implemented to determine whether the resulting ell plans and available funding to implement the plans bear a rational relationship to the cost of implementing appropriate language acquisition programs.
although governor napolitano allowed hb to become law,she did so without vouching for its compliance with the court order or with the declaratory judgment.to the contrary,she announced that she was convinced that getting this bill into court now is the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state into compliance with federal law,and requested that the attorney general move the court for expedited consideration of the law 
e.the first relief from judgment ruling and the remand 
by this point,six years after the declaratory judgment,the positions of the parties had shifted,with arizona and the state board of education abandoning their defense of the suit and largely siding with flores.as a result,when,on march,the state attorney general moved on behalf of arizona for the court to consider whether hb satisfied its order,he was arguing against arizona own law.
the superintendent,however,maintained his position and was joined by the speaker of the arizona house of representatives and the president of the arizona senate as intervenors we refer to them as the legislative intervenors.later that march,these parties moved to purge contempt and,in the alternative,for relief from judgment under rule b.their joint motion was based largely on hb,which,they contended,creates a plan for adequate funding of programs for ell students,and brings arizona into compliance.
the district court disagreed,ruling on april,that hb does not comply with its orders or with the declaratory judgment because the act does not bear any rational relationship to the cost of providing an ell program and it has added new hurdles to the mix.flores arizona,no.at flores ix.the court held the group b weight increase insufficient,and the on most funds irrational.id.at.the two new funds,moreover,were structured in ways that violated federal law.id.at.the superintendent and legislative intervenors appealed both that order and the december contempt order.
on august,in an unpublished memorandum disposition,this court vacated both orders as well as the obligation to pay fines.flores rzeslawski.flores x cir.the court noted that the landscape of educational funding has changed significantly since and remanded for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding whether changed circumstances required modification of the original court order or otherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.id.at.the court made clear that it reached none of the other issues in the case.id.
f.the evidentiary hearing 
on remand,the district court held an hearing in january.testimony at the hearing focused on three broad areas hb and other changes in arizona ell programming and funding conditions in nusd and conditions in other school districts statewide.as the evidence adduced in the hearing is at the core of our inquiry today,we summarize it in some detail here.
statewide changes 
as is required by the flores consent decree,arizona has significantly improved its ell infrastructure.it has also increased overall school funding and,to a lesser degree,ell funding.nonetheless,arizona ell students continue to lag behind statewide average test results for all students.
the new administrative structure created by hb augments arizona efforts to further improve and standardize ell programs statewide.the state department of education holds regular seminars and training sessions and has developed monitoring protocols for school districts.proficiency standards for ell students are used to evaluate programs and to identify problems.arizona has also made efforts to standardize the testing used to classify children as ell or english proficient perhaps most importantly,after august,all classroom teachers,supervisors,principals,and superintendents are required to obtain an endorsement in ell teaching methods.see.admin.code j.
along with these structural changes,arizona has increased overall school funding on an statewide basis,including all sources of funding,support for education has increased from per pupil in to an estimated per pupil in.adding in all county and local sources,funding has gone from per pupil in to an estimated per pupil in.finally,federal funding has increased.in,the federal government provided an additional per pupil in,it provided an estimated 
arizona funding increases are associated with hb and hb.at the hearing,two important points concerning hb emerged first,none of the defense witnesses were able to establish what data,if any,the group b weights are based upon.the weights do not appear to have been set with regard to any specific program costs,known or estimated.second,flores expert on federal educational funding statutes,thomas fagan,testified that if the federal government concluded that hb was in violation of federal statutes,it could take significant enforcement actions,including a of some or all federal education funds 
despite arizona expanded ell infrastructure and budget,ell students still achieve often far average passage rates on arizona aims academic achievement test and fall below the minimum passage rates arizona must meet to reach the annual measurable objectives required by the no child left behind act of nclb,stat,as test results from the and school years show see federal standards.
these test results must be viewed with two significant caveats first,because aims testing was not carried out in,we do not know whether the performance of ell students has improved relative to that time.second,arizona has changed the aims test itself,including altering the passing score,and has twice changed the system it uses for reclassifying ell at the beginning of the school year,and again at the start of the school year.results for those students classified as ell across those years are therefore not clearly comparable.
due to these limitations,and to a general lack of longitudinal data on individual ell students,we do not have data that conclusively demonstrates whether ell programs ultimately is,whether children pass through them rapidly and ultimately perform as well as students.so,while the test results we next discuss are certainly troubling,it is important to understand the limits of their analytic reach.
with these caveats,we turn to the data.while arizona students generally exceeded passage rates in math and reading,passing the aims test at rates of between and,ell students were far behind.for example,among third graders,who pass the exam at a higher rate than older ell students,only passed the math exam in and just under passed the reading exam in the same year the situation grows worse at higher only of ell tenth graders passed math and only passed in.in reading,only passed in and that number fell to barely more than in.in neither year did ell reading scores in any grade meet federal standards,and in ell students math test results for all grades also fell below the federal line at every grade level.
nor do students necessarily leave ell status rapidly.while all witnesses agreed that some students may swiftly become proficient in english,they also agreed that many will need ell instruction for more than two years,and that some will still need help after three years of training.
in short,despite considerable efforts,and some improvements in outcomes,arizona,as a state,does not appear to have turned the corner on ell education performance.
conditions in nogales 
the statewide achievement gap between ell and students is also present in nusd,although the district has made significant strides since.the improvements it has made,however,appear to be due largely to successful management rather than to adequate state funding for ell programs.the record indicates that with adequate incremental ell funding,the improvements could have been greater and this gap could have been further narrowed.
policy changes and test results 
much of the improvement at nusd stems from the successful management of kelt cooper,the district superintendent from to.his successor,guilermo zamudio,has largely sustained cooper management policies.despite the efforts of both superintendents,however,ell students in nogales continue to face serious challenges.
cooper,who took the helm at about the time the declaratory judgment issued,adopted policies that ameliorated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies discussed by the district court at that time.cooper was able to reduce class sizes by enforcing restrictions on the district open enrollment policy,significantly improving ratios.in addition to lowering class sizes,cooper improved teacher quality by changing the district policies regarding the hiring of experienced teachers and by refusing to pay unqualified teachers who had been certified on an emergency basis as if they had the proper experience.he also fired many teachers aides,many of whom were,he found,largely unqualified.cooper also worked to institute student performance monitoring.additionally,he pioneered a uniform system of textbook and curriculum planning,and he largely eliminated what had been a severe shortage of instructional materials by better accounting for and preserving available materials and by acquiring new materials when needed.
using careful financial management and applying for all funds available,cooper was able to achieve his reforms with limited resources.his budget did,however,rise between two and four percent annually,partly because the district twice passed an override,that is,a tax measure.
nonetheless,cooper successor,zamudio,indicates that there are still significant resource constraints.despite cooper recruitment efforts,nogales still must rely on some substitutes,rather than upon permanent teachers.other teachers have been and so have not been trained according to arizona standards.nusd starting base pay of per year,which is below the statewide average,makes it difficult to recruit the teachers that nusd needs.the recruitment challenges mean that zamudio has been unable to reduce ratios further,to,which,both he and a defense expert testified,would significantly enhance english learning success.he would also like to be able to hire trained teacher aides,who would be helpful in ell programs,for the lower grades but has been unable to do so because of resource limitations.
the limits of nusd progress,even as it has improved its ell programs,are apparent in the aims test results and reclassification test results introduced at the hearing,which show the same problems that appear in the statewide data.the test results,we caution,have the same limitations that we have discussed at the state level,and can not be read unequivocally to demonstrate that ell programs are failing in nusd because we lack longitudinal data on the performance of student cohorts who began as ell students and who may or may not have been reclassified.it is fair to say,however,that the indications provided by the test data largely do not point in positive directions.
for instance,while it is clear that nusd has reclassified many students,it is not clear how much of this success can be attributed to genuine academic progress and how much to changes in its classification methodology.during the school year,there were ell students.the next year saw similar numbers,but between the and the school years,the number of such students hovered around.then,when arizona implemented a new testing protocol which was later concluded to be reclassifying too many students and replaced,the ell population declined to about students in the school year and to the next year.in a new,reputedly more accurate and more difficult to pass test came into use,and zamudio testified that he expects ell student numbers to increase again.
because of these shifts in reclassification methodology,the meaning of ell changed over time.comparison of aims test data for ell students and students over time are therefore not reliable.but,as some patterns persist,we can point to several general trends based on aims test results for the,and school years 
first,within nusd,ell students in lower grades are doing substantially better than ell students in higher grades.in,for instance,while only of ell third graders failed math,of ell tenth graders failed.ell third graders failed reading of the time of ell tenth graders failed.and of ell third graders failed writing,while of ell tenth graders failed.
second,ell students in nusd generally do worse than the state average score for all students ell and.only students in the lower grades sometimes reached or beat the average.older students are falling far behind.for tenth graders in,for instance,only failed math statewide,but of ell tenth graders in nusd did.for reading,the tenth grade state failure rate was,while the tenth grade ell failure rate in nusd was.and for writing,the state tenth grade failure rate was and the nusd tenth grade ell failure rate was.
third,within nusd,ell students are still falling behind the district average for all students.again,the gap grows more pronounced in higher grades.in in third grade,ell students failed math at a rate,reading at a rate,and writing at a rate,rates that were not too much worse than the district averages of,and,respectively.by tenth grade,however,ell students failed math at a rate,reading at a rate,and writing at a rate,far worse than the district averages of,and,respectively.
the picture,then,is of relative success at lower grades although not equal to that of english speaking students within nusd,and increasing failures for older students,a significant majority of whom are failing the state basic achievement tests.
federal performance classifications under nclb generally correspond with this portrait in,one of nogales two middle schools failed to meet its adequate yearly progress goals under nclb,as did the alternative high school.in,the same middle school was under a restructuring plan,and corrective action was being taken in the alternative high school.the main high school had been given a warning,as had a elementary school.
in a survey of the test results of ell students statewide,nusd students performance was also consistent with this general snapshot.this survey,commissioned by arizona department of education,reported the test results of students who were classified as ell in and ranked schools by the average aims scores of these students some,but not all,of nusd younger ell students did very well.four nusd elementary schools ranked in the top ten schools in the state by this measure,with passage rates of over.two other elementary schools fared more poorly,ranking and,with passage rates of about and about,respectively.middle school performance was tied for place,also with about a passage rate,and the other ranked,with only about of its ell students passing the test.the high schools are at the bottom of the heap.the main high school ranks,with a overall passage rate and santa cruz alternative high school is four from the bottom at place and a passage rate.
finally,there is at least one clear bright spot for all grades in,reclassified ell students were doing about as well as native english speakers,which is a notable accomplishment,and which suggests that the ell programs may well benefit those who successfully transition out of them.but,as the data on such scores does not track individual students,showing when they passed through ell programs and how long it took them to do so,and because the reclassification methodology continues to shift,this bright spot does not offset the otherwise troubling ell test data.on the data available,it is possible that some high achievers may rapidly be leaving ell programs while other students continue to struggle,never achieving at the same levels as students.indeed,zamudio testified that reclassification in nusd takes,on average,four to five years and the district court so found.the encouraging success of reclassified students is therefore of limited significance with regard to the overall impact of nusd ell program.
nusd estimates its per pupil incremental costs for ell programming for the school year at,over three times the group b level weight funding arizona provides for ell programs under either hb or hb.nusd has been able to finance the improvements it has made by seeking grants,diverting state base level funding away from other purposes,and passing budget overrides.
of the per pupil that nusd indicates it spends on ell programming,over half this amount,is drawn from the district maintenance and operations account which includes both the ell group b funds and base level support funding.as this amount is well above the group b weights,it indicates that nusd is dipping into funds that would otherwise be used to fund basic educational purposes.federal funds add about per student,but most of these funds are earmarked for,students,rather than ell students although the two groups overlap.another per student comes from county override funds.the remaining per student comes from a variety of state,federal,and local funding sources and grants.
nusd budget has increased over the years,but funds have been a relatively small part of that increase.a schematic of the budget over the relevant period,which does not appear to include the relatively small amount of funding from the county,was entered into evidence before the district court.we reproduce a somewhat modified version of that table here.the shows all funds available to ell students,including funds that are not.funding sources are labeled as such,and the total amount of funding is separately recorded 
in sum,as this table suggests,funds have never covered all ell programming costs.nusd can pay the incremental cost of its ell programs only by diverting funds for that purpose,and the district was able to do that at the time of the declaratory judgment,as now.these funds,however,have increased,due largely to the rise in group b weights occasioned by hb in and will increase again due to hb if the new group b weight goes into effect.there remains,however,a fundamental mismatch between the ell costs nusd requires and the funds provided for that specific purpose 
conditions in other districts 
nusd reported incremental costs for ell programming,and its need to divert other funds to cover them,are generally consistent with the experiences of districts across arizona.district officials testifying at the hearing reported incremental costs ranging from per student to per student.all of these districts are funding their programs by diverting funds from other sources,often by using additional taxes that they are allowed to levy for use in desegregation programs group b weights,alone,are not generally sufficient to fund ell programs.
testimony from officials in other districts confirms that reclassification regularly takes longer than two years for many students.the average reclassification time in the tucson unified school district,for instance,is years.in the murphy elementary school district,nearly of ell students took more than four years to be reclassified.similarly,in the scottsdale unified school district,the majority of ell students take more than two years to be reclassified,and in the glendale union high school district,of ell students at one school and of ell students at another had been in ell programs for more than two years.no district submitted evidence showing that all of its ell students had been reclassified within two years.
g.the ruling on remand 
after the evidentiary hearing at which the facts concerning the current status of ell students and ell funding were presented,the district court again denied relief from judgment.flores arizona,d,flores xi.
the court held that the improvements at nusd do not establish that arizona is fulfilling its duty to fund ell programming rationally.id.at.most of these improvements,the court found,are due to nusd own management improvements,not to reliable or sufficient funding.id.at.and the improvements are limited nusd ell high school students,in particular,are still falling well behind its students,and even the successes will be fleeting at best unless arizona meets its funding obligations.id.thus,although nusd is doing substantially better,and the state has developed a significantly improved infrastructure for ell programming,mere amelioration of those specific conditions cited as examples of the funding shortage in the declaratory judgment,is inadequate to justify relief rather,compliance would require a funding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all elements of ell instruction.id.at.
the district court went on to determine that the superintendent and the legislative intervenors had not demonstrated that such a system was in place.the court decided that hb does not sufficiently address the inadequacies of arizona ell funding system and,in fact,introduces new problems.in so holding,the district court reasoned as follows hb increase in group b weights is inadequate,as the incremental cost of providing ell instruction is greater than either the current group b weight of set by hb or the increased weight of that would be provided if the c ourt approved hb,both in nusd and in other districts.id.at.hb of that funding would suddenly,and irrationally,further underfund school districts.id.at.the hb grant programs,which might have linked funding rationally to costs,are no better.the arizona structured english immersion fund suffers from the same irrational,id.at,and both it and the compensatory instruction fund violate provisions of federal law that bar taking federal funds into account in making state funding decisions and bar supplanting existing state funding with federal monies.id.at.
the district court concluded that,without a rational funding system for ell incremental costs,arizona remains out of compliance with the eeoa,despite some successes in nusd 
on january,this court held that the state minimum funding level for ell programs was arbitrary and capricious and bore no rational relation to the actual funding needed to insure that ell students could achieve mastery of the state academic standards more than years later,circumstances in this regard remain the same.the moving parties have not shown compliance with this court decree,much less changed circumstances that would warrant modification or dissolution of this court order.
id.at.the district court gave arizona until the end of the legislative session to comply.id.the legislative intervenors and the superintendent timely appealed 
ii.analysis 
standard of review and jurisdiction 
rule b provides that o n motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment when the judgment has been satisfied,released or discharged it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.
the first two circumstances do not obtain here although the moving parties argue that arizona has achieved the purposes of the judgment through actions other than those required by the declaratory judgment and the ensuing orders,arizona has in fact not satisfied the prior judgment,as it has not complied with its terms.and there is no pertinent earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated.instead,the moving parties are,in practical terms,contending that it is no longer equitable to apply the judgment and the present injunction prospectively.
it is appropriate to grant a rule b motion for this reason when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree meets its initial burden by showing a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.agostini felton,d quoting rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d see also bellevue manor united states,cir rufo sets forth a general,flexible standard for all petitions brought under the equity provision of rule b.once that showing is made,modification may be warranted when changed factual conditions make compliance with a consent decree or an injunction substantially more onerous,when a decree or injunction proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,or when enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest.rufo,at.citations omitted see also sec coldicutt,cir using this standard.finally,modification is necessary if a consent decree or injunction become s impermissible under federal law.rufo,at.see also agostini,at.same.
we review district courts rulings on motions for relief from judgment under rule b for abuse of discretion.united states asarco,cir.we may not reverse a district court exercise of its discretion unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon weighing the relevant factors.coldicutt,at.in this context,a district court abuses its discretion if it does not apply the correct law or if it rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of material fact.asarco,at.
we emphasize that our task in this context is a limited one we do not sit to retry the case,nor to reexamine unappealed legal determinations,and do not have jurisdiction to do so.t he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement,bowles russell,d,and b ecause the time for appeal ha s passed in this case,the interest in finality must be given great weight.ashford steuart,cir.we have cautioned against the use of provisions of rule b to circumvent the strong public interest in timeliness and finality served by rule a.see in re stein,cir.simply put,motions for relief from judgment may not be used to remedy a failure to contest in the first instance the legal rulings underlying the judgment itself

the superintendent and legislative intervenors also question the district court compliance with our mandate on remand and the propriety of several evidentiary rulings.this court reviews de novo a district court compliance with the mandate of an appellate court.united states perez,cir citations and alterations omitted.with exceptions not pertinent here,we generally review the district court ruling on a motion in limine only for an abuse of discretion.united states ross,cir.
finally,the parties dispute each others standing.the legislative intervenors,first,contend that flores lacks standing to argue that hb does not represent a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant relief.the legislative intervenors are wrong hb holds itself out as a remedy for flores and was presented to the court by arizona and by the superintendent and legislative intervenors as such.whether or not flores would have had standing to challenge hb in the first instance,she certainly has standing to argue that a purported remedy will not satisfy a judgment in her favor.
second,flores challenges the standing of the superintendent because he does not make the funding decisions at the core of this case.as to that basis for disputing the superintendent standing,flores is wrong.the superintendent does not,it is true,write school funding laws,but he does administer the state education system,including the hb grant system,see,and obviously has a vital interest in whether or not funding for the programs he oversees is eeoa compliant.he is a named defendant in the case the declaratory judgment held him to be in violation of the eeoa,flores ii,d at,and the current injunction runs against him that judgment against him may not be essential to relief does not mean that he lacks standing to contest an order running against him.
the superintendent standing is,however,for a different reason,fairly tenuous.he is s ubject to supervision by the state board of education with regard to distributing monies to local schools,and must e xecute,under the direction of the state board of education,the policies which have been decided upon by the state b oard.it appears that the superintendent,by filing the motion to vacate the judgment,by pursuing this appeal,by maintaining that funding does not matter to the success of ell education in arizona,and by seeking to derail any additional funding in arizona,is not carrying out the policies which have been decided upon by the state board,which this litigation suggests are directly to the contrary in all regards.moreover,the superintendent standing is limited to defending against the judgment and injunction as they run against him.the other defendants are not seeking relief from the judgment and orders,and the judgment and orders against the remaining defendants can be given full effect without running against the superintendent,as the state board of education can order him to comply.
the state board of education,however,is obviously fully aware of the actions the superintendent has taken in this litigation.there has been no suggestion that it has ordered him to drop his motion or this appeal,or to conform his position to that of the board,although it may well be that it could do so.given that vacuum,we have no basis for determining on the present record that the superintendent is acting outside his authority in bringing his motion and pursuing this appeal.we will not substitute our judgment for that of the state board,which better knows its own policy determinations and can choose when to exercise its supervisory authority.we do observe,however,that the current structure of this litigation is placing the federal judiciary in the uncomfortable position of mediating between state officials with regard to the execution of an obligation of the state as a whole.it would be vastly preferable for the state to work out through its own political structure a consistent position and approach.
despite these concerns and although the issue is exceedingly close,we conclude that the superintendent does have standing to maintain his rule b motion and this appeal,but note that the result had he succeeded would have been to vacate the judgment and injunction only as they run against him.
third,flores challenges the standing of the two legislative intervenors,as they speak only for themselves and do not represent the legislature as a whole,have no judgment against them,and no apparent direct interest in the judgment outside of an abstract policy interest.we need not decide this question,although the extent and degree of the standing of individual legislators under these circumstances is in very serious question.see raines byrd,d.parties need not have standing to intervene in our circuit,see state of california dep t of soc.servs.thompson,cir,although they must have standing to appeal,see diamond charles,d.because the superintendent does have standing and also appealed,we would not lose jurisdiction over this appeal even if the legislative intervenors did not have standing.
evidentiary issues 
preliminarily,we briefly address evidentiary issues arising from the hearing.the legislative intervenors contend that the district court erred by admitting evidence of ell costs outside nusd evidence of costs the testimony of flores expert on federal education funding law and the ncsl study,the staffers study,and essigs study.we find no abuses of discretion.
first,because arizona never complied with the district court earlier orders to prepare and adopt a cost study,the district court was right to look to whatever reliable evidence of ell programming costs was available so as to better understand and assess the costs in nusd.the experiences of other districts helps to establish what incremental costs for ell programs are likely to be,the variability in those costs,and various ways of delivering the programs.admitting such evidence was not an abuse of discretion.
likewise,we find no abuse of discretion with regard to admitting evidence of costs.the legislative intervenors contend that some of the costs identified by nusd and other districts do not fit within hb definition of incremental costs.it is not at all clear why that particular definition should control at the hearing,as hb adequacy as a whole was and is in question.in any event,although the legislative intervenors may disagree about how costs were measured,they had ample opportunity to challenge cost figures at the hearing,and took that opportunity.
third,we find no abuse of discretion with regard to the expert testimony on federal educational funding law.it is true that matters of law are generally inappropriate subjects for expert testimony,aguilar int l longshoremen union local,cir,but there may be instances in rare,highly complex and technical matters where a trial judge,utilizing limited and controlled mechanisms,and as a matter of trial management,permits some testimony seemingly at variance with the general rule,cir.in this hearing,which was,in large part,an inquiry into education law and policy,the expert testimony may well have been helpful.it was,in any event,not prejudicial in this bench trial,where there was no danger that a jury might give too much credence to a legal expert.see id.at.
finally,we find no abuse of discretion with regard to the admission of the three cost studies the ncsl study,conducted by an expert research agency and based on expert opinion is certainly not unreliable under the standards set by daubert merrell dow,d,and extended by kumho tire,carmichael,d.to the extent that one portion of the survey of arizona a low response rate,the study notes the deficiency and cautions against giving that portion too much weight.there was no error in admitting it.
the staffers study,which was prepared as a partisan advocacy document by,and essigs survey,which did not use any form of verification and appears to have been an entirely informal email survey,are more questionable.but even if there was error here,the legislative intervenors were not prejudiced.as a general matter,in a bench trial,the risk that a verdict will be affected unfairly and substantially by the admission of irrelevant evidence is far less than in a jury trial.farmer,cir.so,too,for potentially unreliable evidence.given that the two studies are largely duplicative of other properly admitted evidence,and given the facial deficiencies of hb,we can not say that the outcome of the hearing would have been any different had the two studies not been admitted.there is no reversible error here,so we turn to the merits.
is relief from judgment warranted 
this case is unusual in that the superintendent and legislative intervenors did not appeal from the original judgment holding that arizona funding system for ell programs was in violation of the eeoa did not appeal from the injunctions issued to remedy that violation and argue only in the alternative that hb,which defines arizona ell funding system,demonstrates actual compliance with the declaratory judgment and so warrants relief.the legislative intervenors maintain that arizona is in compliance with or without hb,and the superintendent similarly maintains that the statute is irrelevant.
as to the third point,both the superintendent and the legislative intervenors argue that the district court should not have considered hb legality on remand they instead primarily argue that neither we,nor the district court,need look to hb at all.in their view,conditions have so changed as to make the declaratory judgment emphasis on developing a ell funding structure irrelevant and so render it inequitable to require the state to do so.
our previous rule b cases generally deal with requests for modification due to changed circumstances that rendered compliance more onerous,see asarco,at bellevue manor,at,or due to actual compliance,see coldicutt,at.the moving parties here,instead,urge us to look away from arizona attempt to turn instead to other generalized increase in state funding,changes in the management of nusd,and passage of the no child left behind act of.these changes,they urge,sweep away the foundations of the prior rulings and so justify relief from them.
as a general matter,there are some instances,likely rare,in which a prior judgment is so undermined by later circumstances as to render its continued enforcement inequitable even though neither appealed nor complied with.see,rufo,at.such circumstances are not present here,however,nor do we think it proper to reward arizona by granting relief from judgment on grounds that could have been raised on appeal from the declaratory judgment and from earlier injunctive orders but were not.further,hb is among the most significant changes in ell education and finance in the state since the declaratory judgment issued and so must be examined to determine whether it constitutes compliance with the district court orders.
we now discuss the arguments for relief in turn,beginning with the novel proposition that the judgment need no longer be complied with and then turning to whether arizona has complied.
whether compliance is still equitable 
the core premise of the declaratory judgment is that arizona is violating the eeoa because its arbitrary and capricious lau appropriation is not reasonably calculated to effectively implement the lau educational theory which it approved,and nusd adopted.flores ii,d at.the central idea,then,is that ell programs impose costs additional to those generated by ordinary school activities,id.the state minimum base level for funding lau programs bears no relation to the actual funding needed,and that,in the absence of such state support,ell programs would necessarily be inadequate the district court listed six deficiencies generated by inadequate resources in.because many of these specific problems have been solved by better management in nusd,and because school funding has generally increased,the superintendent and legislative intervenors argue that the judgment has effectively been satisfied we review these arguments it is not,however,our task to retry the case.the district court should be affirmed unless it has clearly erred on the record before it in its factual findings or otherwise has abused its discretion.
nusd should not be penalized for doing its best to make do,despite arizona failure to comply with the terms of the judgment.granting relief would absolve the state from providing adequate ell incremental funding as required by the judgment.the judgment determined that the state has not provided adequate resources to support nusd ell programming,as required by the eeoa.we can not now decide anew the unappealed declaratory judgment,nor the many orders so holding.as we have explained,the provisions of rule b may not be applied to derogate from the purpose and effect of rule a.in re stein,at.the legal determinations made in the declaratory judgment were unappealed and are now final.
underlying the declaratory judgment and orders is the basic determination under the eeoa that,given arizona educational funding structure,ell programs require substantial state funding in addition to that spent on basic educational programming.that conclusion rests,in turn,on the recognition that ell students require additional attention to bring their language skills to the point where they can fully benefit from instruction in english.
to prevail on their argument,then,the superintendent and legislative intervenors needed to show either that the basic factual premises of the district court central incremental funding determination had been swept away,or that there has been some change in the legal landscape that makes the original ruling now improper.it will not suffice to argue for vacating the judgment because of factual or legal circumstances that have not changed the basic premises of the original rulings.
changes in fact 
we begin with the moving parties attempt to make the first,the factual circumstances have so shifted as to sweep away the unappealed incremental funding determination.to succeed on this ground,given the original ruling,they were required to demonstrate either that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ell programs in arizona or that arizona base plus incremental costs educational funding model was so altered that focusing on incremental costs funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.
turning,then,to the first possibility,we can not find that the district court clearly erred when it found,consistent with the basic premises of this litigation,that in,as in,ell students need extra help and that costs extra money.flores xi,d at.at the evidentiary hearing,all witnesses agreed that ell students face unique challenges which require school districts to invest substantially in teacher training,materials,monitoring,and assessment efforts.if anything,after,when arizona moved away from bilingual education and required most courses to be taught in english,regardless of students language abilities,these challenges have become greater a tenth grader,for example,who speaks no english but must pass a biology course taught entirely in english will require considerable assistance.the recent statewide program to improve ell testing,monitoring,and support programs also imposes incremental costs on school districts.
nor did the district court err when it determined that the incremental cost of providing ell instruction is greater than either the current group b weight of about per student or the roughly per student that would be provided were hb provision on group b weights to be approved.id.at.as the superintendent and legislative intervenors observe,superintendent cooper management changes did ameliorate many of the specific examples of resource shortages that the district court identified in.they did not,however,result in such success as to call into serious question nusd need for increased incremental funds.nusd own cost study,along with evidence from other districts throughout arizona,placed estimated incremental costs at well over per student.the expert panels consulted in the ncsl study similarly recommended spending over per student,and,in some cases,recommended spending over per student.the ncsl school district survey reported actual per student spending as in the range but cautioned that that figure might be an underestimate.the sjobergevashnek study reported that actual expenditures in nusd shortly after the declaratory judgment were in the per student range but also noted that its estimate was likely low.taken together,these studies provide very strong support for the proposition that the incremental costs of a compliant program not only exceed the group b weights,either as presently set or as provided by hb,as the district court concluded,but in fact likely exceed per student,both in nogales and statewide 
the superintendent and legislative intervenors nonetheless maintain that the improvements in ell achievement in nusd demonstrate that additional incremental funding is no longer required.to the contrary,the data from nusd supports our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding otherwise.
as zamudio testified,resource constraints remain nusd still can not afford to pay market rate salaries to attract the teachers it needs to reduce class sizes to levels more conducive to ell education,nor can it hire qualified teacher aides for the lower grades.that these constraints matter is apparent from the persistent achievement gaps documented in nusd aims test data.as we discussed at length above,ell students in nusd continue to fall behind their counterparts,both statewide and within the district.these gaps grow in the higher grades,as the district court found,and are disturbingly large.although,as we have noted,the data is limited,the burden here is on the moving parties to prove the factual changes on which they premise their motion to vacate the judgment.see asarco,at.we can not say that the district court clearly erred when it found this burden was not met.a district in which the majority of ell tenth graders fail to meet state achievement standards while the majority of native english speakers pass is not one whose performance demonstrates that the state is adequately funding ell programs and so warrants relief from judgment 
the superintendent and legislative intervenors respond,essentially,that even if ell programming costs do exceed funding,there is ample state funding to cover them.they argue,in other words,that focusing solely on funding,and on the group b weights in particular,is no longer appropriate given general increases in education funding since such a focus,they contend,mistakes the details,even the minutiae,of the intermediate methodologies the court has devised to reach compliance for compliance itself.glover johnson,cir with this argument,the superintendent and legislative intervenors seek to reopen matters made final when the declaratory judgment was not appealed.the eeoa provides that states must not deny equal educational opportunity by the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation.f emphasis added.diverting base level hurting all students in an attempt to equalize opportunities for ell not an appropriate step.the district court recognized as much by holding that arizona had not taken appropriate action to comply with the eeoa at castaneda step two by failing to set a minimum base funding level per ell student that was rationally related to costs,regardless of the base level funding provided for all students.flores ii,d at.
for eight years,arizona has attempted to remedy that deficiency in funding,and for eight years the parties have litigated based upon that premise.unlike in glover,which repudiated the district court excessive concern with specific compliance steps rather than with the core of its judgment,looking to the adequacy of funding does not miss the forest for the trees.it cuts to the heart of this case,which has been about such funding since,when the parties dealt with the other issues in a consent decree.if the superintendent and legislative intervenors believed that the district court erred and should have looked at all funding sources differently in its eeoa inquiry,they should have appealed the declaratory judgment.they may not now its basic legal conclusions.
nor have the fundamentals of the arizona school funding system changed in any way that undermines the district court original conclusion that incremental ell funding is what matters for eeoa purposes.accepting the superintendent and legislative intervenors argument would be to hold that the funding restrictions and categories used by arizona are meaningless.as we have explained,arizona allocates ell funding on top of base level support.hb and hb have followed this approach.this statutory scheme is still premised on the idea that ell programming imposes costs additional to those covered by ordinary base level funding.base level funds are still provided in block grants,as in,and the grants are,as they were in,unrestricted.and base level funding,although apparently not itself based on a clear cost accounting of educational needs,see roosevelt i,at,must still support most educational costs.it is the base level funds that,if nusd had no ell students,would be spent on math,reading,writing,and other basic subjects.that funds for both basic educational support and ell costs have increased does not indicate that the fundamental pattern has changed.in,as today,ell incremental costs could be covered by diverting basic educational support,hampering the state ability to provide a basic education to all arizona students.so,by underfunding ell programs and forcing nusd to dip into those base level funds,arizona still forces it to choose between base level needs and ell the district court refused to view as an answer to ell funding in,when the option was as available as it is now.that binding legal determination is not now subject to reconsideration 
nor do circumstances in nusd demonstrate that anything has happened to undermine the district court conclusion in the original declaratory judgment that adequate levels of funding were critical to eeoa compliance.ninety percent or more of nusd students are either still in or have been in ell programs.it is the same students who will suffer as the district shifts funding away from core educational needs to support ell programs.when nusd must choose to fund,say,required structured english immersion endorsements for its staff,rather than expanding its high school math or art offerings,all students will suffer,including ell students,now as in.
in short,the solution posited by the superintendent and legislative the amici school districts and school boards in this case call a hobson choice was rejected by the district court as a matter of law in the declaratory judgment when it based its holding on funding in general and the group b weights in particular.nothing significant has changed to undermine that ruling.instead,the superintendent and legislative intervenors are simply placing their suggested less on basic education so as to have sufficient funds for ell the table after it was necessarily rejected in the unappealed judgment,which requires funding.that they may not do.
there was no clear error in the district court factual findings and no abuse of discretion in its legal conclusion that the landscape was not so radically changed as to justify relief from judgment without compliance.
changes in law 
the superintendent and legislative intervenors also offer a legal change argument as to why the premises of the declaratory judgment have been so undermined as to justify relief from judgment despite noncompliance.they maintain that the passage of,in particular its title iii,which focuses on ell in some fashion altered their obligations by making the castaneda pickard framework obsolete,urging two points first,that state compliance with nclb benchmarks should be enough to satisfy the eeoa,and hence the judgment and,second,that nclb obviates any need to do a cost study of ell program incremental costs.
we are unpersuaded by the first,more important point.the superintendent and legislative intervenors fail to appreciate the distinct purposes of the eeoa and nclb the first is an civil rights statute,while the second is a program for overall,gradual school improvement.compliance with the latter may well not satisfy the former 
title iii of nclb sets out to help ensure that children who are limited english proficient attain english proficiency and meet the same challenging state academic content and student achievement standards as all children are expected to meet.to aid in this goal,it provides grants to states with federal plans to benefit ell students.see.to retain grant eligibility,grantees must meet annual measurable achievement objectives includ ing making adequate yearly progress for limited english proficient children.see.
these objectives include at a minimum,annual increases in the number or percentage of children making progress in learning english,at a minimum,annual increases in the number or percentage of children attaining english proficiency by the end of each school year,and making adequate yearly progress in such children academic achievement.a a.arizona defines these goals as yearly growth in the fraction of students making progress towards english proficiency,those attaining english proficiency,and those students the aims objectives in order for arizona to meet the requirement that of all students pass aims by.arizona school accountability system technical manual volume iii title iii accountability at.specifically,school districts are required to increase the fraction of students making progress toward english proficiency or being reclassified as english proficient by a specified percentage each year additionally,increases in reading and math proficiency are prescribed id.at.importantly,this very gradual improvement plan does not set as an objective immediate equalization of educational opportunities for each such student.
nclb,in other words,packages federal grants with discrete,incremental achievement standards as part of a general plan gradually to improve overall performance.it does not deal in the immediate,framework inherent in civil rights law,although it is intended to ameliorate over the longer haul the conditions that lead to civil rights violations.perhaps recognizing as much,title iii of nclb explicitly provides that n othing in this part shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any federal law guaranteeing a civil right.
the eeoa is just such a law.it requires states to ensure that needs of students with limited english language proficiency are addressed,idaho migrant council bd.of,cir,by requiring them to remove barriers to equal participation in educational programs now rather than later,and it provides students with a right of action to enable them to enforce their rights,see los angeles naacp los angeles unified sch,cir.the eeoa concerns,in other words,lie fundamentally with the current rights of individual students,while nclb seeks gradually to improve their schools.an individual student whose needs are not being met under the eeoa need not wait for help just because,year after year,his school as a whole makes adequate yearly progress towards improving academic achievement overall,including for ell students.
the position pressed by the superintendent and the legislative state compliance with nclb necessarily satisfies the eeoa can not be squared with this understanding of the two statutes.in their view,nclb now defines appropriate action under the eeoa,such that nclb compliance is dispositive of eeoa compliance,regardless of whether incremental ell funding is currently adequate to provide equal educational access to ell students.but such an interpretation would,first,produce strange results if a state happened to meet adequate yearly progress under nclb one year,no suits could proceed under the eeoa,even if fundamental linguistic inequalities persisted in some or all of its schools,even if ell financial resources were entirely inadequate,and even if the particular students bringing suit had not received adequate ell assistance nor made any progress towards english language proficiency.any meaningful ability to use the right of action under the eeoa would thus wink in and out of existence based upon the vagaries of overall school test scores.the eeoa does not tolerate such ephemeral compliance.see castaneda,at holding that a state violates the eeoa if even an program fails,after being employed for a period of time sufficient to give the plan a legitimate trial.the district court so held in the declaratory judgment.flores ii,d at.
our point,boiled down,is that the superintendent and legislative intervenors view,if adopted,would effectively repeal the eeoa by replacing its framework with the gradual remedial framework of nclb.such a result is simply not consistent with the text of either the eeoa or nclb.there is certainly no express repeal provision in nclb.quite to the contrary,nclb contains a savings clause with regard to civil rights statutes.
nor did nclb repeal the eeoa by implication.r epeals by implication are not favored in the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal,the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.morton mancari,d see also ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d implied repeals are not favored and will only be inferred if the later statute expressly contradicts the original act or unless such a construction is absolutely necessary in order that the words of the later statute shall have meaning at all internal quotations and alterations omitted.such is not the case here.the goals of the two statutes are complementary,as the saving provision of nclb for civil rights statutes indicates.
we also can not agree with the superintendent and the legislative intervenors that this is a case where a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies.brown serv,d.such cases concern instances where congress has provided a narrower remedy for a class of harms otherwise covered by an older and more general statute.see id.collecting cases.we have already discussed the quite different focuses of the two statutes.that title iii of nclb operates in the same general substantive area as the eeoa is not enough for us to hold that the former was intended to replace the latter,particularly in light of explicit statutory language to the contrary.
our analysis is further bolstered by the supreme court similar analysis of a purported conflict between a civil rights statute and a general spending statutory grant program,like nclb,in blessing freestone,d.in that case,the court considered whether the remedial scheme of title of the social security act displaced a right of action under.id.at.the court held that a statute like title could displace actions in only two ways e xpressly,by forbidding recourse to in the statute itself,or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.id.at.
there is,as we have noted,no express repeal here.and implied repeals of the remedial displacement kind are very rare,as the court recognized in blessing.id.at.noting only two such instances with regard to see also middlesex county sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n,d detailing such an instance where the quite comprehensive enforcement mechanisms of two federal pollution statutes rendered it hard to believe that congress intended to preserve remedy for problems covered by the statutes.
blessing also explicated an additional reason why nclb can not supercede the eeoa the eeoa provides an express private cause of action,while nclb does not.in blessing the spending clause statute enforcement scheme was limited because it had no private judicial or which aggrieved persons can seek redress.at.the court held that the substantive statute could not close the door on,because a plaintiff ability to invoke can not be defeated simply by the availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the plaintiff interests.id.at.internal quotation and alteration omitted see also city of rancho palos verdes abrams,d i n all of the cases in which the court has held that a general program did not preempt a cause of action the statute at issue did not provide a private judicial remedy or,in most of the cases,even a private administrative remedy for the rights violated.emphases in original wilder virginia hosp.ass n,d no repeal where the programmatic statute contain ed no comparable provision compared to statutes in sea clammers and similar cases for private judicial or administrative enforcement smith barton,cir t he doctrine of sea clammers only bars section claims that could have been brought under a separate federal statute which provides remedial devices sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a congressional intent to preclude section claims.asw oregon,cir holding that even some statutes with administrative mechanisms to protect plaintiffs rights can not preclude price city of stockton,cir same like the statute in blessing,nclb does not provide an explicit private enforcement scheme applying the holding of blessing and similar cases,the existence of an explicit private enforcement mechanism in one statute but not the other strengthens our conclusion that nclb did not close the door,blessing,at,on suits such as this one.
the second argument in this vein made by the superintendent and the legislative intervenors has more merit.that argument is that,after nclb,an order to perform a statewide cost study of ell program incremental costs,and fund accordingly,may not be entirely sensible.while such an order would not be an abuse of discretion,it is true that nclb monitoring protocols have encouraged the development of substantial data.this data may make it easier,and more sensible,for a state like arizona to tailor some amount of funding to the particular incremental costs associated with the ell program in each district,rather than to provide a uniform ell increment to all districts regardless of the distinct conditions in each district.it appears that the arizona constitution would permit some degree of such tailoring.see roosevelt i,at u nits in general and uniform state systems need not be exactly the same,identical,or equal.that point,however,does not avail the superintendent and legislative intervenors,as they did not move for such a limited modification of the judgment.instead,they argued that the district court should simply grant complete relief from judgment.
in sum,just as no changes in fact have eliminated the premises of the declaratory judgment,no changes in law have done so either.the motion for relief from judgment,then,depends on showing that arizona is,in fact,in compliance.and that question,in turn,depends on hb.
hb and actual compliance 
perhaps recognizing the flaws in hb,the superintendent and legislative intervenors begin by arguing that the legality of the statute should not have been considered.that issue,they contend,was outside of our mandate on remand.
the contention makes no sense.hb was enacted as arizona effort to comply with the declaratory judgment and was so represented to the district court.that this characterization of hb is correct is indicated in the statute itself,which provides that it will not go fully into effect unless the district court approves the statute as in compliance with its orders.it would be very strange if,on remand,our mandate to survey relevant changes of circumstances excluded such an obvious change.
certainly,no portion of our mandate forbade such consideration.a lthough lower courts are obliged to execute the terms of a mandate,they are free as to anything not foreclosed by the mandate.united states kellington,cir quotation omitted.we remanded for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing and explicitly decided no other issue.the district court held such a hearing there is no further mandate issue in this case 
proceeding to the merits of the hb issue,we hold that the district court conclusions of law regarding the statute were not abuses of its discretion the court held that hb funding was irrational,rendering it inadequate to comply with the judgment and that,in addition,several facial violations of federal law further compounded the statute problems.flores xi,d at.we agree 
first,and most clearly,hb funding alone renders the law inadequate as a funding scheme rationally grounded in the costs of providing ell programs,as the district court held.flores xi,d at.there is absolutely no evidence in the record to support the proposition that a student need for ell programs invariably vanishes after two years of instruction instead the evidence is squarely to the contrary,as all witnesses testified that some students would certainly take longer than two years to become proficient in english.yet funding for both the group b weights and the arizona structured english immersion fund is unavailable after two years.see.j,hb.all that remains thereafter is compensatory instruction funding,see,which can not be used to support normal classroom instruction.g.to cut funding to children who have not yet learned english after two years of instruction,providing only for compensatory can not occur during and so leaves the incremental costs of assistance for such children during the regular school day comply with the judgment.the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding hb inadequate in this regard.
second,as we have discussed above,the district court did not clearly err in holding that hb group b weight increase alone was not sufficient to meet the incremental costs of ell programming.flores xi,d at.the two grant programs created by hb might,however,be able to make up the gap between the incremental costs and the group b weights,as the district court found,and so these secondary programs become important to our analysis.it is,first,important to note that these grant programs will be of no significance at all unless they are funded and,as we have noted,the statute does not require that any appropriations be made for either program in coming years,although it does provide an initial appropriation for the compensatory instruction fund.but even if the programs are funded,they do not well serve arizona effort at compliance.
specifically,the district court held that hb can not comply with the judgment because its grant programs violate several provisions of federal education funding law.id.at.penalties for such violations include limitations on further grants and,in some cases,requirements that states pay back some or all of the grants they have already received.see et.if such violations are present,hb can not be adequate relief.its implementation would imperil federal funds for both and ell students.
the clearest violation of federal law discussed by the district court is the state violation of,which,covering all of the pertinent federal grant programs,provides that a state shall not take into consideration payments under this chapter other than under subchapter viii in determining the eligibility of any local educational agency in that state for state aid,or the amount of state aid,with respect to free public education of children.the declaratory judgment in this case is directed at the funds distributed by the state to local educational agencies,so is applicable.and hb manifestly requires that federal funds be considered with regard to distribution of funds from both the structured english immersion fund,see.i,and the compensatory instruction fund,see.e hb therefore violates on its face.
the legislative intervenors offer only one on this point,which we do not find persuasive they suggest that free public education,as used in,is defined in relation to state law and that,under arizona law,the term does not apply to ell programs.so,they contend,does not apply to hb programs.
the federal definition of free public education is education that is provided a at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without tuition charge and b as elementary school or secondary school education as determined under applicable state law,except that the term does not include any education provided beyond grade.the provision relies only on state law to define elementary or secondary school education,not free public education,and thus defers to states with regard to which grades are embraced by the with regard to subject areas or services.that the as determined under applicable state law provision applies only to subsection b of the definition is indicated by the absence of a comma after secondary school education by the existence of an except clause after the as determined phrase that pertains directly to subsection b and by the absurd results that would flow from the superintendent and legislative intervenors reading under their interpretation,states could define entire subjects or programs out of the federal funding statute reach by changing their state definitions of free public education.
in any event,we find nothing in arizona law to suggest that ell programming is,in any sense,not part of a free public education in arizona.the very existence of hb and hb,and of the group b weighting program,indicates otherwise.
in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that hb does not constitute compliance 
we therefore affirm the district court holding that hb does not warrant relief from judgment indeed,to the extent that improved conditions in nusd might somewhat support relief from judgment,hb flaws largely negate their import the stark it creates on all of arizona ell funding save for compensatory instruction funds which are no substitute for funding for instruction combined with the very real possibility that the funding scheme may trigger federal enforcement action,may well retard or reverse whatever progress has been made.so,to the extent that circumstances have changed after hb,due to these two flaws they changed in large measure for the worse.
we note,however,that the district court has recently spoken again to this issue in its current contempt order,flores xii,no,indicating that,despite hb flaws,arizona may be nearing compliance.in that order,the court again noted the problems with hb that we have discussed but emphasized that,in its view,they could be cured by abandoning the and by declining to consider federal funds in the process.id.at.the funding structure of the statute itself,the court held,was not at variance with the declaratory judgment,and the incremental costs data that districts are required to submit would,save for the flaws we have noted,enable arizona to rationally fund the new models for the ell programs.id.at there is reason,then,to hope,if the models are in fact funded and the two changes noted by the district court in its most recent order are made,that this dispute,which has been in the courts longer than it takes a student to go from kindergarten to college,may finally be nearing resolution.
iii.conclusion 
arizona did not appeal the original judgment and has not complied with the declaratory judgment or with the bulk of the relief orders.for all the reasons we have given,it is not inequitable to continue to require compliance.we therefore affirm the district court.
the arizona school boards association,tucson unified school district,mesa unified school district,sunnyside unified school district,and phoenix union high school district filed an amicus brief supporting arizona,the board of education,and the plaintiffs.they emphasize the many pedagogical challenges districts face in attempting to educate students who are not fluent in english and the substantial resource costs those hurdles create.in their view,arizona school districts have performed an admirable job of educating english language learner students despite being grossly by the state.school districts are already stretched to their limits both economically and in terms of morale and personnel.they will continue to struggle to provide quality programs for such students without additional assistance and resources from the state.they further note that arizona school districts can not divert general education funding to programs for such students without seriously crippling school districts ability to provide all other aspects of a public education.
the eeoa contains an express private right of action,under which this suit proceeds.see flores arizona,d,flores i holding that the plaintiffs could proceed under.we have held that abrogates state sovereign immunity.los angeles naacp los angeles unified school,cir see also gomez illinois state bd.of,cir same.arizona does not contend otherwise.
the earlier proceedings,which involved changes of counsel on both sides and various other procedural hurdles and delays,are summarized in flores i,d at.
because f codifies the central holding of lau,ell programs are sometimes referred to as lau programs.
article xi,provides in pertinent part that t he legislature shall enact such laws as shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a general and uniform public school system.emphasis added.
school districts may also try to pass ballot measures,called overrides,to raise county taxes and so secure funds above the revenue control limit.see.
these funds,along with other federal,state and county funds,including funds provided to support ell students,are sometimes referred to as maintenance and operation or m o funds.see savage glendale union high sch.dist,cir.
this figure is the product of the support level weight multiplied by the baseline amount.
this figure is the product of the group b weight multiplied by the baseline amount.
the district court was aware that base support funds could be diverted to ell students if the target group b weight funding is inadequate and a district so chooses.flores ii,d at.because base level funds support typical students,the district court focused on the group b weights,see id.at,which are,again,the amount that arizona projects will be necessary to spend in addition to the base level funds to meet the special needs of ell students.
among the events of those years was another general school funding increase.in november,arizona voters approved proposition,which dedicated a portion of the state share of indian casino gambling proceeds to a school improvement fund for teacher compensation,class size reduction,dropout prevention,and instructional improvement programs.see.h b i.none of these monies are specifically directed to ell programs.
not long before this motion was filed,the litigation was transferred from senior district judge alfredo marquez,who had handled it from the outset,to district judge raner collins.
governor napolitano statement on hb appears later in this opinion.
the models are limited to a regular school year and school day,id.at e,and do not provide guidance for and summer school programs.
as we note below,this increase is not yet in effect.
governor napolitano statement on the matter provides,in relevant part i received house bill,related to ell programs.i have decided to allow the bill to become law without my signature so that we can move this dispute to a different forum and get a ruling from the flores court as to its sufficiency.after nine months of meetings and three vetoes,it is time to take this matter to a federal judge.i am convinced that getting this bill into court now is the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state into compliance with federal law.although i am allowing house bill to become law without my signature,i do not believe this bill meets either the court multiple orders or our existing consent decree.it fails in a number of important ways,including but not limited to arbitrary funding level there is no reason to believe that the funding contained in house bill bears any rational relationship to the actual cost of implementing a successful language acquisition program.failure to ensure academic accountability the point of teaching children to speak,read and write in english is to allow them to succeed academically and to ultimately become contributing members of the workforce.this bill cuts off funding to students after two years,regardless of their academic progress and does not ensure ell students would even be able to pass aims arizona achievement test.failure to determine program effectiveness rather than using respected experts to advise the state on best practices and the real costs of ell instruction,house bill instead creates a system by which political appointees with no required minimum qualifications make important educational policy decisions.unwise creation of a new bureaucracy and excess paperwork the bill adds an extra layer of government and does not focus on student success.violation of federal supplanting laws the bill requires ell payments to school districts and charter schools to be reduced by the amount of federal monies they receive,in violation of federal law.
before,arizona allowed districts to select among four different tests to decide when to reclassify students out of ell programs into mainstream classes.beginning in,arizona instituted the stanford english language proficiency assessment selp,which was in use from through.selp was generally regarded as too easy to pass,and reclassification rates increased measurably during its use.arizona selp,renaming it the arizona english language learner assessment azella,and has been using the new test since the fall of.the transition from selp to azella appears to have measurably decreased reclassification rates.as a result of these shifts in testing methodology,ell reclassification rates are not easily comparable over the years.
broader state efforts for children generally benefit some ell students.these efforts include several funding streams for tutoring programs.in one tutoring program,of ell students were able to raise their scores by one achievement level in at least one subject area of arizona standardized academic achievement tests of students in the same program so raised their scores.
arizona has also significantly increased spending on school physical plant needs,largely in response to another suit.see roosevelt elementary sch.dist.arizona,roosevelt ii.
we discuss these potential violations and their consequences below.
standardized tests do not,of course,provide a full measure of a school successes and failures.educational quality is too complex to be reflected in a single score.but test scores do provide us with at least a rough sense of relative performance,and so are useful here.
the passage rates for third graders in were even lower for math and for reading.
although the patterns we describe are consistent from year to year,passage rates varied somewhat from year to year.they rose from to but fell again in.one of the defense witnesses suggested that the high passage rates could be related to problems with the reclassification system.
aims is graded on a scale.students may fall far below the passing score,approach but not meet the standard,meet the standard,or exceed the standard.when we refer to the percentage of students failing,we mean those who either fell far below or only approached the state passing score.
no effort was made to verify that a given student was still ell or that he or she had remained in ell programming for the two intervening years.nor are test scores available for these students in.the result is that the survey data does not present a longitudinal survey of the progress of students who remained in ell programs for that period.nor is the data of value in demonstrating that nusd ell students are doing better relative to students,as students performance was not measured or ranked.more importantly,if,as flores alleges,arizona systematically underfunds ell programs statewide,comparing one allegedly underfunded district with another does not show that funding in any given district is adequate.
this amount is based on hb group b weight increase.if that portion of hb does not go into effect,the figure will be.this amount is based on hb group b weight increase.if that portion of hb does not go into effect,the figure will be.
we note that,for a variety of contractual and statutory reasons,and to ensure a fiscal cushion,nusd carries over some portion of its budget every year,including some funds that it might otherwise spend on ell programming or other needs.that practice,rooted in careful fiscal planning,does not indicate a surplus of funds for educational needs.
a broader survey of school district officials conducted for flores by chuck essigs of the arizona association of school business officials yielded similar results.essigs did not independently verify his survey results or ensure that responding districts used a common cost reporting system.as these results vary widely from to,neither we nor the district court rely much upon them.it is worth noting,nonetheless,that,for the fourteen surveyed districts with over ell students,incremental costs in in all but one were above,with most of the districts incremental costs in the range between and.
after arizona failed to comply with the district court order in flores xi,the court again found the state to be in contempt on october.see flores arizona,no.flores xii.the present compliance deadline is march.id.at.the contempt order has been separately appealed and is not before us.we do,however,discuss it below in part ii c for the light it sheds on the adequacy of hb.
amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure designed to clarify but not to make any substantive changes became effective on december.see joseph kimble,guiding principles for restyling the federal rules of civil procedure part i.bar j.we quote the current version of the rule,although the district court ruled based on the prior version.the prior version provided that on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding if the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective find no relevant distinction between the two formulations.
the legislative intervenors cite to a sixth circuit case,in re detroit auto dealers ass n,cir for the proposition that a party should be entitled to modification whenever the original decree could not properly have been issued on the state of facts that now exists.this sentence,in turn,is drawn from a student note,developments in the,harv,which was prescribing changes in the law,not describing the state of the comport with modern law,and particularly with the final nature of unappealed judgments,the language must be read to mean that relief is appropriate when the original decree could not properly have been issued on the state of facts that now exists applying the legal framework used by the original unappealed judgment.otherwise,such a rule would invite relitigation of settled judgments using rule b as a vehicle,a use which,as noted,is improper.
that the injunction may be enforced against the superintendent is indicated by the current civil contempt order which orders him to use his best efforts within the power granted to him to ensure compliance with the march,order flores xi by march.flores xii,no.october.
flores argues that two of the studies are admissible under the public record
