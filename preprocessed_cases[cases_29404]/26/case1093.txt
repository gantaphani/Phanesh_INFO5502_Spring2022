plaintiffs are a class of,and educators and educators in california.they appeal from an adverse judgment in their action against the state of california and its agency,challenging the district court holding that the california basic education skills test cbest,which is a prerequisite to employment in a variety of positions in the california public schools,violates neither title vi nor title vii of the civil rights act of,and the district court use of a technical advisor at trial.defendants from the district court rulings,on summary judgment,that title vi and title vii apply in this case.defendants also appeal from the district court order denying their request for costs.for the reasons that follow,we hold that title vii applies to the cbest that the cbest was validated properly that the district court permissibly used a technical advisor and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to award costs to defendants.accordingly,we affirm both the judgment in defendants favor and the order denying them costs.
factual and procedural background 
effective february,the california legislature amended the california education code to prohibit the california commission on teacher credentialing cctc from issuing any credential,permit,certificate,or renewal of an emergency credential to any person to serve in the public schools unless the person has demonstrated proficiency in basic reading,writing,and mathematics skills.cal.b.at the same time,the legislature authorized the state superintendent of public instruction to adopt an appropriate state test to measure proficiency in these basic skills.cal.c.the superintendent adopted the cbest and,in may,cctc assumed responsibility for administering and revising the test.
the cbest is a examination consisting of three sections reading,writing,and mathematics the reading and mathematics sections each contain questions,of which are scored.the writing section consists of two essays.the cbest was revised in.at that time,questions that tested higher order mathematical skills,such as geometry,were eliminated from the mathematics section of the test.
to pass the cbest,a candidate must receive a scaled score of.accordingly,a candidate passes by averaging points on each of the three sections out of a score range of to.a scaled score of on the reading section translates into a raw score of out of questions correct on the mathematics section,a scaled score of equates to a raw score of out of correct.each of the two essays is graded by two readers,who give raw scores of between one and four points per essay.thus,the range of possible scores for the writing section is between four and points.a raw score of points translates into a scaled score of points.the cbest employs a compensatory scoring model,under which a candidate passes the test with a scaled score lower than on a particular section,so long as his or her total scaled score is at least.
a passing score on the cbest is required for all public elementary and secondary school teachers in california.see cal.a passing score also is required for many nonteaching employees of the california public schools,including administrators,see id,school counselors,see id,and school librarians,see id.
since the cbest inception,minority candidates have disproportionately received failing scores.the named plaintiffs are three nonprofit organizations that represent the interests of minority educators,and eight individual minority candidates.they brought this action against the state of california and the cctc to challenge the validity of the test under title vi and title vii,on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.the district court certified the following class 
all latinos,and asians who have sought or are seeking california public school credentials and certificated positions who have been,are being,or will be adversely affected in their ability to obtain credentials and certificated positions by cbest results.
in their complaint,plaintiffs sought to enjoin the use of the cbest,alleging that the test has a disproportionate,adverse impact on minority candidates and that defendants have failed to adopt screening procedures with a less adverse impact.
the parties filed for summary judgment,addressing the applicability of titles vi and vii.in august,the district court granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs,concluding that both titles vi and vii apply to the cbest.see association of educators california.amae i.following a bench trial,the district court held that plaintiffs had demonstrated that the cbest has a disparate impact on minorities the studies that were submitted at trial demonstrated that the test was a valid measure of skills the level at which the passing scores were set reflected reasonable professional judgments about minimum levels of basic knowledge and plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that other,equally effective screening devices existed.the court entered a judgment in defendants favor.see association of educators california.amae ii.
defendants then presented the district court with a bill for taxable costs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d.that cost bill totaled.in an order dated february,the district court denied the cost bill in its entirety.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding,after trial,that the cbest was validated properly and that the court violated federal rule of evidence by relying on the advice of an expert who was not subject to and did not prepare a report.defendants with respect to the district court conclusions,on summary judgment,that titles vi and vii apply.defendants also appeal from the district court order denying costs 
discussion 
title vii title vii applies to the cbest 
defendants appeal from the district court summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the issue of the applicability of titles vi and vii.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see robi reed,cir,cert.denied,d.
as a threshold matter,we note that,because we ultimately hold that the cbest was validated properly see part,below,we could decline to decide whether titles vi and vii apply.were we to do so,we simply would assume for the sake of argument that the statutes apply and move immediately to the question of validation.although that might appear to be an expedient approach,we decline to follow it for three reasons.first,as a matter of logic,the applicability of title vi or title vii is a predicate to any discussion of validation.validation would not be required,and indeed would not even be relevant,if neither title vi nor title vii applies.second,as a matter of fairness,these parties deserve an answer not only to the bare question of who wins this case,but also to the underlying question of the applicability of federal civil rights law to the cbest.the state,in particular,has proceeded for years on the assumption that those laws apply to its administration of the cbest and has expended considerable effort and expense in attempting to comply with federal law in this area.if that effort was unnecessary,the state deserves to know,so that it may act accordingly in the future.third,as a matter of judicial economy,our answer to the statutory question can avoid future litigation by other parties.we turn,then,to a discussion of title vii application.
title vii of the civil rights act of provides 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 
to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.
a.title vii applies to governmental and private employers alike.dothard rawlinson,d.
plaintiffs and defendants do not have a direct employment relationship.rather,plaintiffs are employees and potential employees of individual school districts in california.that fact does not end our inquiry,however.a direct employment relationship is not a prerequisite to title vii liability.although there must be some connection with an employment relationship for title vii protections to apply,that connection with employment need not necessarily be direct.lutcher musicians union local,cir.
among other things,we have held that an entity that is not the direct employer of a title vii plaintiff nevertheless may be liable if it interferes with an individual employment opportunities with another employer.gomez alexian,cir quoting lutcher,at.in gomez,we held that the defendant hospital could be held liable under title vii for its discriminatory treatment of the plaintiff,notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff was employed by a third party,if the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff employment by that third party.see id.at.
in so holding,we followed the opinion of the district of columbia circuit in sibley memorial hospital wilson,in sibley,the plaintiff was a male nurse.when a patient in the defendant hospital requested a private nurse,the hospital arranged through a registry service to have a private nurse provided.that nurse attended the patient at the hospital,but was paid directly by the patient.the plaintiff alleged that the defendant allowed male nurses like him to attend male patients only,but allowed female nurses to attend both male and female patients.see id.at.
the circuit concluded that the defendant could be held liable under title vii even though it was not the plaintiff direct employer.the court reasoned that,although the defendant did not employ the plaintiff,it exercised considerable power over his ability to form employment relationships with third parties.the court noted that congress intended,through title vii,to prohibit entities that possessed such power from foreclos ing,on invidious grounds,access by any individual to employment opportunities otherwise available to him.id.at.the court further stated 
to permit a covered employer to exploit circumstances particularly affording it the capability of discriminatorily interfering with an individual employment opportunities with another employer,while it could not do so with respect to employment in its own service,would be to condone continued use of the very criteria for employment that congress has prohibited.
id.finally,the court held that the defendant control over the premises on which the plaintiff provided his services,as well as its control over the plaintiff access to patients,created a highly visible nexus with the creation and continuance of direct employment relationships between third parties that brought the defendant actions within the scope of title vii.id.at.
the circuit holding in sibley was rooted in the text of title vii.the court reasoned that,although title vii applies to employees,congress extended the protections of the statute to any individual who suffers discrimination nowhere are there words of limitation that restrict references in the act to any individual as comprehending only an employee of an employer.id.at.as we did in gomez,we agree that the circuit interpretation of the statutory text is the proper one in view of congress directive to read title vii broadly so as to best effectuate its remedial purposes.duffield robertson stephens,cir,cert.denied,d.
we also note,as did the sibley court,see at,that congress explicitly made title vii applicable outside the direct employment context by including employment agencies and labor organizations in the statute coverage.see b,c.in particular,employment as parties regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for an employer or to procure for employees opportunities to work for an employer,c may not refuse to refer or otherwise discriminate against any individual under title vii.b.this provision of title vii,like the others,applies to states.see dothard,at.dumas town of vernon,cir,overruled on other grounds by larkin,pullman,cir,rev sub nom,swint,d.we do not suggest that defendants are,strictly speaking,an employment agency under title vii,although they perform an analogous function.rather,we mention this statutory provision as evidence that congress intended to close any loopholes in title vii coverage and to extend the statute coverage to entities with actual c ontrol over access to the job market,sibley,at,whether or not they are direct employers.
in concluding that title vii applies in this case,the district court held that defendants interfere d with plaintiffs employment opportunities with local school districts in california by requiring,implementing,and administering the cbest.see amae i.at.we agree.
our conclusion is dictated by the peculiar degree of control that the state of california exercises over local school districts.in california,public schools are a matter of statewide rather than local or municipal concern their establishment,regulation and operation are covered by the state constitution and the state legislature is given comprehensive powers in relation thereto.hall city of taft,cal d.the california legislature has plenary authority over the education of california youth.san francisco naacp san francisco unified sch.it is well settled that the california constitution makes public education uniquely a fundamental concern of the state and that the degree of supervision retained by the state over the common school system is high indeed.butt california,cal th,d.
the state involvement is not limited to general legislative oversight but,rather,affects the operations of local public schools.unlike most states,california school districts have budgets that are controlled and funded by the state government rather than the local districts.belanger madera unified sch,cir.as the california supreme court noted in butt,california statutes regulate district organization,elections,and governance educational programs,instructional materials,and proficiency testing sex discrimination and affirmative action admission standards compulsory attendance school facilities rights and responsibilities of students and parents holidays school health,safety,and nutrition teacher credentialing and certification rights and duties of public school employees and the pension system for public school teachers.butt,cal th at,d,at citations omitted.the state also dictates when students may be expelled or suspended,and exerts control over the textbooks that are used in public schools.belanger,at citations omitted.
indeed,the state is so entangled with the operation of california local school districts that individual districts are treated as state agencies for purposes of the eleventh amendment.see freeman oakland unified sch,cir.the fact that the districts are entitled to assert eleventh amendment immunity underscores the state unusually high degree of involvement in the operation of local schools.
against that background of plenary state control,we have no difficulty concluding that the state of california is in a theoretical and practical position to interfere with the employment decisions of local school districts.and by requiring,formulating,and administering the cbest,the state has interfered to a degree sufficient to bring it within the reach of title vii.through the cbest,the state has created a limited list of candidates from which local public school districts may hire.private schools may hire candidates who have not passed the cbest but california public schools,which are under the state control in almost every aspect of their operations,may not.thus,in addition to controlling local districts budgets and textbooks and regulating the duties of public school employees,the state dictates whom the districts may and may not hire.that degree of control over districts hiring decisions subjects defendants to the coverage of title vii in this case.
the relationship between the state of california and california local school districts is analogous to the relationship between a corporate parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries.in the absence of special circumstances,a parent corporation is not liable for the title vii violations of its wholly owned subsidiary.watson gulf,cir.in watson,this court held that the parent corporation was not subject to title vii because the case presented no special circumstances.id.but the court went on to explain that,i f there was any evidence that the parent participated in or influenced the employment policies of the subsidiary,then we would be presented with a very different case.id.ours is that very different case.the parent state has participated extensively in,and influenced,the employment policies and practices of the subsidiary local school districts therefore,the state is covered by title vii.
defendants contend,however,that they are not subject to title vii because the cbest is merely a licensing examination.the administration of such examinations,they argue,is not covered by title vii.as support for that argument,they cite several cases that have held that governmental agencies are not subject to title vii with regard to their licensing activities.see haddock board of dental exam rs,cir fields hallsville indep.sch,cir george new jersey bd.of veterinary med.exam rs,cir 
the cases on which defendants rely are not controlling for two reasons.first,the state high level of involvement in the operation of local public schools distinguishes this case from those that defendants cite.in those cases,licensing was the entire connection between the plaintiffs and the defendants here,the cbest is but one aspect of pervasive state control.second,the cbest is not merely an ordinary licensing examination it applies only to public school employees.in other words,the state of california is acting pursuant to its proprietary,as well as its police,power.
there is no overarching licensing exception to title vii.the cases that defendants cite stand for a related but narrower title vii does not apply when the only connection among the licensing agency,the plaintiff,and the universe of prospective employers is the agency implementation of a general licensing examination.in such cases,to borrow the words of the sibley court,the agency does not have a highly visible nexus with the creation and continuance of direct employment relationships between third parties,such as would subject it to title vii under an interference theory.sibley,at.
in haddock,the plaintiff conceded that his only connection to the defendant board of dental examiners was that the board had given him an examination that he failed.this court concluded that such a connection,by itself,was insufficient to subject the board to title vii liability.see at.the plaintiff apparently did not argue that the board had interfered with his employment under the principle adopted in gomez and sibley if he did,the opinion does not mention it.
in fields,the plaintiffs argued that the defendants had violated title vii through their administration of the texas examination for current administrators and teachers tecat,a compulsory certification examination.see at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state defendants,concluding that they did not have an employment relationship with the plaintiffs.on appeal,the plaintiffs challenged that conclusion,arguing that the state defendants actually controlled their employment even though the plaintiffs nominally were employed by local districts.in rejecting that argument,the fifth circuit noted that t he only evidence presented by the plaintiffs suggesting control is the texas state board of education administration of the tecat exam and its ability to decertify teachers who fail the exam.id.emphasis in original.of particular relevance to this case is footnote three of the opinion,which reads 
in a footnote in the plaintiffs brief on appeal,they present evidence regarding state funding of facilities,payment of salaries and selection of textbooks.as this evidence was not before the district court,it is not part of the summary judgment record on appeal.
id.at.the court suggested that the outcome might be different if there were such evidence of the state right to control the work of the teachers.see id.at.
finally,in george,the plaintiff alleged that the defendant board of veterinary medical examiners had violated title vii by administering a licensing examination that discriminated against him on the basis of national origin.see at.the third circuit affirmed the district court dismissal of the plaintiff action.the court distinguished sibley,on which the plaintiff had relied,stating 
in the sibley memorial hospital case the relationship of the hospital to the employment by its patients of private duty nurses secured for them by the hospital was very close,whereas in the present case there was nothing even remotely resembling an relationship between the board and the plaintiff.
to summarize,the circumstances here demonstrate a level of control and interference far greater than that in the mere licensing cases on which defendants rely.the state of california exerts a high degree of control over the operation of local public school districts.that control is evidenced both by the record and by california law.
defendants cite george for the further proposition that state licensing examinations are acts of state police power,to which title vii does not apply.but in george,the board was acting only pursuant to the state police power to protect the public from incompetent veterinarians and was not attempting to control the hiring practices of,or the performance of work for,any specific employer.by contrast,the cbest does not apply to all who wish to teach in california,as for example a veterinary licensing examination applies to all who wish to practice the profession of veterinary medicine within the state borders.rather,the cbest applies only to those who wish to teach for the public school system over which the state of california exerts plenary control,including regulation of employees duties.
we conclude,therefore,that administration of the cbest is not solely an exercise of the state police power.rather,it is an exercise of both the state police power and its proprietary power and it is the exercise of proprietary power that subjects the state to the coverage of title vii in this case.
we hold that the cbest examination is subject to the provisions of title vii.we turn next to the question whether the cbest violates the provisions of that act.
b.the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the cbest was properly validated 
d iscriminatory tests are impermissible unless shown,by professionally acceptable methods,to be predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.albemarle paper moody,d.in evaluating employment tests that are alleged to have a racially disparate impact,we first consider whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case by demonstrating that the test causes a disparate impact on the basis of race.here,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case.see amae ii.at.defendants do not challenge that conclusion on appeal.
because plaintiffs have established a prima facie case,the burden shifts to defendants to demonstrate that the cbest was validated properly see albemarle paper,at.in its detailed and careful opinion,the district court concluded that defendants had met their burden and that the test had been validated properly based on three studies the wheeler and elias study the practitioners review and the lundquist study.see amae ii.at.plaintiffs challenge that conclusion.
although this court has not discussed in detail the appropriate standard of review for a district court ruling on test validation,we have applied the clearly erroneous standard.clady county of los angeles,cir.the other circuits that have addressed this issue likewise have applied the clearly erroneous standard.see,melendez illinois bell,cir bernard gulf oil,cir hamer city of atlanta,cir.the question whether a test has been validated properly is primarily a factual question,which depends on underlying factual determinations regarding the content and reliability of the validation studies that a defendant utilized.consistent with clady,we review for clear error the district court determination in this case that the cbest was validated properly.
to demonstrate that the cbest was validated properly,defendants are required to show that it has a manifest relationship to the employment in question.clady,at quoting griggs duke power,d.in cases in which a scored test,like this one,is challenged,we require that the test be job related that is,that it actually measures skills,knowledge,or ability required for successful performance of the job.contreras city of los angeles,cir.in making a determination about,we follow a approach 
the employer must first specify the particular trait or characteristic which the selection device is being used to identify or measure.the employer must then determine that the particular trait or characteristic is an important element of work behavior.finally,the employer must demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the selection device is predictive of or significantly correlated with the element of work behavior identified in the second step.
craig county of los angeles,cir quoting albemarle paper,at.
we will analyze each of those three steps in turn.in addition,we will consider plaintiffs argument that the passing score on the writing component of the cbest is set too high 
specific traits or characteristics 
the first step of our inquiry is to identify the trait or characteristic that the test is designed to measure.see craig,at.here,the district court found that the test was being used to measure basic skills in reading,writing,and mathematics,amae ii.at,and plaintiffs do not dispute that finding.
important elements of work behavior 
next,we consider whether basic skills in reading,writing,and mathematics are important element s of work behavior,craig,at,for the public school jobs for which the test is required.the district court found that the tested skills were important to the jobs at issue.see amae ii.at.plaintiffs challenge that finding on three grounds.first,they argue that the practitioners review failed to identify any particular work behaviors or job duties and thus could not be used to assess whether the cbest measured important elements of work behavior.second,they argue that lundquist study failed to distinguish important skills from skills that are less important.third,they argue that defendants failed to demonstrate that the cbest is for the particular positions for which it is required.we address each of those arguments in turn.
plaintiffs first argue that the practitioners review,conducted by richard watkins,was inadequate because it failed to identify specific job duties to which the cbest skills could be correlated.we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the study adequately identified the element s of work behavior,craig,at,that the cbest is designed to measure.
the district court found that the review comprised the pooled judgments of knowledgeable persons,such as incumbents in the jobs,about the relevance of the skills tested on the cbest to the jobs for which it is required,an appropriate form of a job analysis under the professional standards of the time.amae ii.at.specifically,the practitioners review consulted teachers,administrators,and other public school employees,percent of whom were members of minority groups.see id.at.the participants took part in nine review panels,in which they judged the relevance of both the skills assessed by the cbest and the test items themselves.id.they were asked to rate how relevant each of the cbest skills would be to the work of four groups elementary school teachers secondary school teachers librarians,counselors,and attendance officers and school administrators.see id.the possible ratings ranged from not relevant to very relevant.id.
thus,the practitioners review was designed to learn from teachers,administrators,and other school employees the categories of skills that they considered relevant to their own jobs.the skills measured by the study tracked the categories of skills measured by the cbest,and the skills were described in some detail on the rating forms used by the panel members.for example,the broad skill category mathematical concepts and relationships was further described as follows 
questions in this category test the understanding of basic concepts,such as the meaning of certain terms area,for example,order among numbers,relationships shown by graphs,elementary probability,and the like.questions in this category may be from arithmetic,algebra,or elementary geometry.
the study participants were guided by detailed instructions relating to each skill category and were told to rank the importance of each skill for both teaching and nonteaching jobs.the study therefore satisfies the requirement from craig that the employer determine whether a specific trait or characteristic is an important element of work behavior.craig,at.the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the practitioners review was an appropriate form of a job analysis under the professional standards of the time.amae ii.at.
we next consider plaintiff second challenge under the important elements prong of craig.plaintiffs do not challenge the lundquist study methodology for identifying skills.they do,however,challenge that study method for determining which skills are important to particular jobs.
lundquist polled experts and interviewed and observed educators in order to develop a list of activities and skills used by educators.see amae ii.at.she then polled teachers and administrators,asking them to rate the importance of those activities and skills on a scale from not applicable to critical.activities and skills were retained only if at least percent of the survey respondents rated the activity or skill as applicable to the job and the mean importance rating was or higher.id.at emphasis in original.applying those standards led to elimination of a number of the activities and skills from lundquist list.after conducting additional studies,which are described in detail in the district court opinion,see id.at,lundquist then formulated new specifications for all three sections of the test.in response to those specifications,defendants revised the cbest before they administered the august test.
plaintiffs focus on the fact that lundquist retained activities and skills on her list if they received a mean importance rating of on a scale that designated as important and as minor.by using a mean rating of,plaintiffs argue,lundquist retained skills and activities that were rated as less than important by the study participants.therefore,their argument proceeds,the study violated the requirement from craig that only important work skills be measured.
the district court rejected plaintiffs argument,finding that lundquist decisions reflect manifestly reasonable professional judgments with respect to the mean,as lundquist testified at trial,a rounds up to.it must be remembered that the mean rating of was coupled with an percent endorsement criterion,which is quite stringent.amae ii.at.
we agree that it is theoretically possible to imagine a circumstance that illustrates plaintiffs concerns on this point.for example,suppose that percent of the study participants agreed that a particular skill was relevant,but percent of them rated that skill importance as minor.if the remaining percent rated the skill as critical,then the skill would be retained despite the fact that a majority of the study participants rated its importance as minor.although that scenario is possible,such a skewed distribution of responses is unlikely.plaintiffs present only a theoretical possibility that such highly relevant but unimportant skills remained on lundquist list.further,as the district court noted,lundquist conducted additional importance reviews of the mathematics section of the test.
validation studies are by their nature difficult,expensive,time consuming and rarely,if ever,free of error.cleghorn herrington,cir.plaintiffs argument demonstrates,at most,that lundquist study may not be totally free of error.but the argument does not persuade us that the district court clearly erred in relying on lundquist study.
finally,plaintiffs argue that defendants failed to conduct studies to determine that the cbest is job related for the position s in question.k a i.the cbest is not intended to measure all the skills that are relevant to all the jobs for which it is required.indeed,it does not purport to measure all the skills of any of the jobs for which it is required.rather,the cbest is intended to establish only a minimum level of competence in three areas of basic educational skills.the question is whether the validation studies in this case have satisfied the requirement that those skills be job related for all the positions in question.the district court found that the validation studies adequately analyzed the cbest in terms of both the teaching and nonteaching jobs for which the test is required.see amae ii.at.the district court did not clearly err in so finding.
both the and the validation studies contained adequate consideration of the specific positions for which the cbest is required.the practitioners review defined the positions that it analyzed as elementary school teachers,secondary school teachers,librarians,counselors,and attendance officers,and school administrators.all participants in the study were asked to judge the relevance of the cbest skills by category for those jobs.because the study participants were asked to determine the relevance of the basic skills measured by the cbest to the disparate groups of positions for which the test is required,we can not say that the district court clearly erred in finding the job analysis in the practitioners review to be sufficiently specific and particularized.
the lundquist study,as noted,identified job activities through observation,interviews,and reviews of specialized literature.see id.at.lundquist then pared her list of job skills and activities through surveys of educators and arrived at a list of common skill requirements that were relevant for both teachers and administrators.see id.at.her study reports 
basic skill ratings were examined for administrators to determine if the same skill sets applied to both teacher and administrator jobs.results showed all but one skill item a math item retained for teachers also applied to the administrator group.thus,the basic skill requirements identified for teachers were found to be for administrators as well,and the same test specifications may be used to test basic skills for teachers and administrators.
lundquist study classified jobs for which the cbest is required as either teacher or administrator and determined that the cbest was valid for both groups of positions.accordingly,the study considered the validity of the cbest across the range of jobs for which the test is required.the district court accepted the study conclusions and found that the cbest had been validated adequately with respect to teaching and jobs.id.at.on this record,that finding is not clearly erroneous.
in sum,we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the skills measured by the cbest are important element s of work behavior with regard to the jobs for which the test is required.craig,at.
actual measurement of skills 
the final step in this court analysis from craig is to determine whether defendants have demonstrated by professionally acceptable methods that the selection device is predictive of or significantly correlated with the element of work behavior that it is designed to measure.see id.internal quotation marks omitted.the district court concluded that the cbest actually measures basic skills in reading,writing,and mathematics.amae ii.at.plaintiffs claim that the district court simply accepted the facial validity of the cbest without any evidence that it actually measures the basic skills that it purports to test.
this court held in contreras that a key requirement of the third step from craig,a requirement essential to proof of job relatedness generally,is that the validation method be professionally acceptable.at.here,there is evidence in the record from an expert,william mehrens,that supports the district court findings on this issue.mehrens reported 
ets educational testing service personnel wrote some of the original items and assisted the test development committees in writing other items.ets is well known and respected as a developer of standardized tests.they have well trained item writers and an impressive internal set of guidelines they follow with respect to item writing.
when asked whether the cbest development was appropriate with respect to writing and evaluating the items,he reported 
it has been.many of the items came from an existing ets pool.others were written specifically for cbest by members of the test development committee in concert with ets test development specialists.the individuals on the committees worked with specialists from ets to further develop and define the content specifications,to review an existing ets pool test item,to write new test items,and to review the items submitted by fellow committee members.in addition,the committees studied all of the data from the field testing,made recommendations for revisions as they felt necessary,and reviewed all final test results.
there also is additional evidence in the record that the test questions were matched to the skills that they were intended to measure.the district court referred to the curriculum matching project,in which two ets employees matched cbest test specifications to material found in textbooks purportedly used in the california public schools.amae ii.at.the district court was somewhat critical of this study,but noted that the study did support the overall conclusion that the kinds of skills tested on the cbest can be found in elementary and secondary school textbooks.id.
in short,there is if not overwhelming the development and evaluation of the cbest were appropriate and that the test measures the types of skills that it was designed to measure.we therefore hold that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the test questions had been shown by professionally acceptable methods to be predictive of or significantly correlated with the element of work behavior that they were designed to measure.craig,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in sum,we hold that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the cbest was validated properly 
standards for passing scores 
plaintiffs also argue that the passing score on the writing section of the cbest is too high.according to plaintiffs,the wheeler and elias study demonstrates that the proper passing score is or out of.
an employer is not required to validate separately the selection of particular passing scores on an employment test.see id.at.rather,the eeoc guidelines more generally provide where cutoff scores are used,they should normally be set so as to be reasonable and consistent with normal expectations of acceptable proficiency within the work force.h.this court previously has applied that standard.see,craig,at.in analyzing the guidelines scoring requirement,the second circuit has stated that an employer might establish a valid cutoff score by using a professional estimate of the requisite ability levels,or,at the very least,by analyzing the test results to locate a logical in the distribution of scores.guardians ass of new york city police dep t,civil serv.comm of new york,cir.
here,the district court found that the passing scores on the cbest reflect reasonable judgments about the minimum level of basic skills competence that should be required of teachers.amae ii.at.the evidence before the court revealed that the california superintendent of public instruction,who was responsible for establishing the cutoff scores,relied on polling data created as part of the wheeler and elias study in setting the cutoff for the writing section of the test.as part of that study,readers reviewed approximately cbest essays and made recommendations regarding the cutoff between passing and failing scores.the readers unanimously agreed that a raw score of out of was a passing score.approximately percent of the readers agreed that a score of out of could be a passing score.on that basis,the superintendent established a passing score of out of,with an absolute minimum of out of under the compensatory scoring system.
those cutoff scores represent a logical breakpoint between passing and failing scores.plaintiffs argue that the breakpoint should have been set at or out of,because a majority of the readers opined that out of was a passing score.but the superintendent was not required to set the score at the lowest level that a majority of the readers considered to be passing.rather,he was required to set a cutoff that was logical,reasonable,and consistent with the data before him.he chose to set the cutoff at a level that all the readers agreed was passing,and to set an absolute minimum at a level that percent of the readers thought was passing.the district court found that the superintendent decision to set the cutoff score at that level was consistent with the eeoc guidelines.we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in so finding.
ii.title vi 
because we have concluded that title vii applies to the cbest,we need not consider whether title vi also applies.see.plaintiffs proceed on a disparate impact theory under both title vi and title vii.thus,our discussion of the merits under title vii,and of the validation of the cbest,would resolve plaintiffs claims on the merits under title vi as well.accordingly,we decline to issue an advisory opinion on the applicability of title vi.
iii.the district court appointment of a technical advisor 
plaintiffs also argue that the proceedings were tainted by the influence of stephen klein.klein was appointed by the district court as a technical advisor,but was not called as an expert witness,was not subject to,and did not furnish an expert report.
in those rare cases in which outside technical expertise would be helpful to a district court,the court may appoint a technical advisor like klein.see reilly united states,cir see also general joiner,d breyer,concurring endorsing the appointment of special masters and specially trained law clerks to assist district courts with scientific or technical evidence.the court appointed klein in an order that specifically identified him as a technical advisor.
plaintiffs argue that the court committed legal error under federal rule of evidence a by neither requiring klein to submit a report nor allowing him to be.the short answer to plaintiffs argument is that rule applies to expert witnesses,but not to technical advisors like klein.see reilly,at.
at one point in the proceedings,the district court told the parties that it intended to call klein to testify near the conclusion of the trial and that the court would permit at that time.had the court called him,klein would have testified as an expert witness,and federal rule of evidence would have applied.but the court never called klein,and there is no indication in the record that the court relied on klein as a source of evidence.on this record,klein acted only as a technical advisor,and the district court did not err in refusing to allow or to require an expert report.
in his dissent,judge tashima agrees with us that district courts retain inherent authority to appoint technical advisors in appropriate cases that this was an appropriate case for a technical advisor that rule a does not apply and that we are reviewing for an abuse of discretion.
his disagreement rests on his analysis of how we should respond to the relative paucity of information in the record about klein interaction with the district court.in our view,the absence of any evidence even suggesting an impropriety on the part of the district court militates against a conclusion that the court abused its discretion.although it is at least possible,as judge tashima suggests,that klein may have impermissibly influenced the court ultimate finding,diss.op.at,we instead assume that the district court did its job properly when we lack evidence to the contrary 
judge tashima also proposes a list of procedures for district courts to follow when appointing technical advisors.even assuming that those procedures are appropriate,the district court did not have the benefit of judge tashima dissent before this trial,and we will not fault the court for failing to foresee his recommendations.we are not willing to find an abuse of discretion and to undo this entire trial because the district court did not follow a set of guidelines that are required nowhere in the rules or relevant case law.
iv.the district court refusal to award costs 
defendants appeal from the district court order denying their cost bill in the amount of.federal rule of civil procedure d provides that costs other than attorneys fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.by its terms,the rule creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to a prevailing party,but vests in the district court discretion to refuse to award costs.see national info,trw,cir.
that discretion is not unlimited.a district court must specify reasons for its refusal to award costs.subscription television,southern cal.theatre owners ass n,cir.on appeal,we determine whether the reasons that the district court has specified are appropriate and whether,considering those reasons,the court abused its discretion in denying costs.see national info,at.
in past cases,this court has approved the following reasons for refusing to award costs to a prevailing party the losing party limited financial resources,see national org.for women bank of,cir see also wrighten metropolitan,cir moore hughes helicopters,cir and misconduct on the part of the prevailing party,see national info,at.further,in stanley university of southern california,cir,cert.denied,d,we held that the district court abused its discretion in denying a losing civil rights plaintiff motion to costs without considering the plaintiff limited financial resources and the chilling effect of imposing such high costs on future civil rights litigants.
here,the district court gave four reasons for denying costs to defendants the case involve s issues of substantial public importance,specifically educational quality,interracial disparities in economic opportunity,and access to positions of social influence there is great economic disparity between plaintiffs,who are individuals and small nonprofit educational organizations,and the state of california the issues in the case are close and difficult and plaintiffs case,although unsuccessful,had some merit,as evidenced by the modification of the cbest to eliminate higher order mathematics questions.
defendants argue that the district court reasons for denying costs were improper.according to defendants,this court opinion in national information services establishes that the only proper reason for denying costs to a prevailing party is to punish misconduct by that party.we disagree.
as noted,this court previously has held that district courts may consider other,nonpunitive reasons for denying costs to a prevailing party.national information services does appear to suggest that such a denial is proper only as a means of punishing a prevailing but undeserving litigant.see also zenith ins.breslaw,cir following national information services.but that suggestion is inconsistent with earlier opinions of this court,see,national org.for women,at,opinions that national information services,as a panel opinion,could not and did not purport to overrule.
more importantly,we see no basis for limiting district courts discretion in the manner that defendants suggest.the rule itself contains no such limitation it provides simply that costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party unless the district court otherwise directs.the requirement that district courts give reasons for denying costs flows logically from the presumption in favor of costs that is embodied in the text of the rule if a district court wishes to depart from that presumption,it must explain why so that the appellate court will be able to determine whether or not the trial court abused its discretion.subscription television,at.but the limitation on district courts discretion that defendants advocate curtails that discretion in a manner and to a degree that are inappropriate in view of the broad wording of the rule.we now overrule national information services to the extent that it held that only misconduct may support the denial of costs to a prevailing party.
federal rule of civil procedure d establishes that costs are to be awarded as a matter of course in the ordinary case.our requirement that a district court give reasons for denying costs is,in essence,a requirement that the court explain why a case is not ordinary and why,in the circumstances,it would be inappropriate or inequitable to award costs.misconduct on the part of the prevailing party is one factor that might render a case extraordinary.but it is not the only such factor.here,the reasons that the district court gave for denying costs reflect what is clear at a glance this is an extraordinary,and extraordinarily important,case.plaintiffs are a group of individuals and nonprofit organizations.the record demonstrates that their resources are limited.they have brought an action that presents issues of the gravest public importance,and the action affects tens of thousands of californians and the state public school system as a whole.the issues in the case are close and complex.although plaintiffs have not prevailed in this action,their claims are not without merit.indeed,as the district court pointed out,defendants substantially altered the cbest during the pendency of this litigation.finally,costs in this case are extraordinarily high.in keeping with our decision in stanley,we note that divesting district courts of discretion to limit or to refuse such overwhelming costs in important,close,but ultimately unsuccessful civil rights cases like this one might have the regrettable effect of discouraging potential plaintiffs from bringing such cases at all.
we do not mean to suggest that the presumption in favor of awarding costs to prevailing parties does not apply to defendants in civil rights actions.nor are we attempting to create an exhaustive list of good reasons for declining to award costs.we simply hold that the reasons that the district court gave for refusing to award costs in this case were appropriate under rule d and that,considering those reasons,the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award costs to defendants.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we hold that title vii applies to the cbest that the cbest was validated properly that the district court permissibly used a technical advisor and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to award costs to defendants.accordingly,we affirm both the judgment in defendants favor and the order denying them costs.
the result we reach is most unfortunate.not only is it wrong as a matter of law,but it may lead some to conclude that we are insensitive to the needs and problems of minority educators and minority students.while that may not be so,one thing is certain.the loser in the case before us is clearly the already beleaguered public education system of the state of california.
although i concur in section ia and parts ii,iii,and iv of the majority opinion,i can not agree with the majority holding that the cbest was properly validated under title vii.as a result of this ruling,qualified minority,administrators,librarians,and other be denied the opportunity to work in california severely public schools,simply because they failed to pass a test that concededly has a disparate impact on minority group members.despite title vii clear requirement that a test that has a disparate impact on minorities must be validated by reference to a particular job,the majority accepts validation studies that fail to differentiate among different school jobs,ranging from bilingual education teachers to mathematics teachers to physical education teachers.further,even though title vii demands that the defendants demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the test items are predictive of or significantly correlated to skills,the majority finds that the cbest met this requirement through a study that the district court found to be unscientific and not particularly helpful.
a sampling of the plaintiff class illustrates the disservice the majority decision does not only to minority educators but also to the students in the california public school system.the plaintiff class includes a applicant with a teacher preparation certificate and a bachelor degree in liberal studies from a california state university,who is seeking to teach bilingual elementary school classes to address the needs of over students in california public schools.he is qualified but for the fact that he is four points short of obtaining the required score on the reading section of the cbest.the class also includes a latino resident of los angeles county,in which latinos comprise the largest ethnic group.the man seeks a position as a counselor in the public schools,and has an undergraduate degree from university of california at irvine and a master degree in counseling from california state university at los angeles,but has failed the reading section of the cbest.he too is qualified,but for the test.another class member is an assistant principal and physical education teacher with a bachelor degree and a master degree in physical education from stanford,who was promoted from his position as a teacher to assistant principal,and who received excellent performance reviews as an assistant principal.he has been denied the opportunity to return to his post as assistant principal because he is six points short of passing the math portion of the cbest.the result of the failure to validate the cbest in a lawful manner is to perpetuate discrimination against minority teachers who could be of particular assistance to minority students and serve as role models for them.it is significant in this regard that minority students outnumber white students in many of california largest school districts,in some cases by substantial amounts.
as the majority notes,we follow the approach set forth in craig county of los angeles,cir to determine whether a test is job related.i believe that the district court erred in applying the second and third steps of the craig test,because the studies relied on by the ctc commission on teacher credentialing do not differentiate among different school jobs in determining the skills to be tested and the studies do not demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the test items actually measure the skills identified by the ctc.either of these errors in the method of validation would be sufficient to render the cbest invalid.finally,although i believe that the district court determination of should be reversed even under the clear error standard adopted by the majority,the proper standard for reviewing the determinations at issue in this case is de novo.
failure to validate for separate jobs 
the use of a test that has a disparate impact under title vii is impermissible unless it is proven that the test is job related for the position in question.k a i emphasis added.the uniform guidelines provide that a ny validity study should be based upon a review of information about the job for which the selection procedure is to be used.a.the cbest is invalid because it was not validated with specific reference to the various particular jobs for which the cbest is used.
the supreme court clarified the validation requirement in albemarle paper moody,holding that a test may be used in jobs other than those for which it has been professionally validated only if there are no significant differences between the studied and unstudied jobs,d.in albemarle,employment tests designed to measure general intelligence were administered to ten different job groups,which were primarily grouped together on the basis of their proximity to each other in the line of progression,rather than in terms of the specific skills that the jobs required.id.at.the court held the tests invalid in part because the validation study focused on positions on the production lines without adequately examining whether the tests were valid for workers entering lower level jobs.id.at.further,the court noted that one of the tests required for the skilled lines of progression correlated to job performance in only three of the eight lines at issue.id.at.because the study had not shown that there were no significant differences between the various jobs this test purported to evaluate,the test was held invalid.id.at.
we required a similar level of job specificity in craig,which involved,in relevant part,a height requirement for prospective sheriffs.craig,at.although the height requirement was justified by reference to the need for officers to command respect,we rejected the generalization that all police officers expend a significant portion of their time and effort in confrontation and control conditions because n o study proved the generalization to be a fact.craig,at.we therefore required the defendants to validate the requirement by reference to more than a general description of a police officer functions,because different police officers have different duties.other circuits have also rejected attempts to use a single test to measure skills for jobs that were generally similar but had appreciably different specific duties 
the cbest was validated without regard to the important differences among the various jobs at issue,which range from twelfth grade mathematics teachers to seventh grade bilingual education teachers to guidance counselors,librarians,and administrators.the wheeler and elias study encompassed skills relevant to the job of teaching at any grade level the practioner review study divided the particular jobs into four groups,specifically elementary school teachers,secondary school teachers,pupil personnel and librarians,and administrators and the lundquist study divided the pool into teachers and administrators.thus,even the study that provided the most specific analysis of job categories did not differentiate among the job duties of bilingual education teachers,mathematics teachers,and physical education teachers,for example.
the majority states that the cbest establishes only a minimum level of competence in skills that are job related for all the positions in question.while it may be possible to construct a test that measures skills relevant for all teachers,albemarle holds that such a test may only be used if it has been validated for each particular job involved or if there are no significant differences among the jobs at issue.albemarle,at.the positions at issue in amae bear less resemblance to each other than those in craig,albemarle,or the cases from other circuits.if a validation study must differentiate between different officers in the sheriff department or workers on different lines at the paper production factory,it is certainly improper for the cbest to be validated by reference to undifferentiated but significantly different teaching jobs.a validation study that focuses on the particular job of a teacher or even a secondary school teacher fails to satisfy the legal requirement that the examination predict job performance for each particular job position in question.teachers jobs are too diverse to be lumped into one or two categories for validation purposes.there is no legal or logical basis to support the majority abandonment of the validation requirement employed in albemarle and craig.in doing so,it clearly erred.
ii.failure to match test items to skills important to the job 
as the majority notes,the third step of the craig test requires employers to demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the selection device is predictive of or significantly correlated with the element of work behavior identified by the job analysis.craig,at quoting albemarle paper,at.in other words,the employer must demonstrate not only that the skills identified in the job analysis are job related,but also that the test items actually measure those skills.in contreras city of los angeles,for example,this requirement was satisfied by an independent examination review phase in which a new group of job experts reviewed each test question and decided whether it tested one of the critical elements identified in the preceding job analysis phase,cir craig,at finding that testimony from the sheriff and a physical training instructor that height was important in commanding respect and applying restraint was insufficient to show by professionally acceptable methods that the height requirements were predictive of the ability to carry out the control functions of the job.as the majority acknowledges,a key requirement of the third step,a requirement essential to the proof of job relatedness,is that the validation method be professionally acceptable.contreras,at.here,even assuming that the job analysis was sufficiently specific to generate skills important for all the positions in question,the cbest is invalid because the ctc failed to demonstrate in a professionally acceptable manner that the test actually measures the skills identified in the job analysis.
the majority appears to concede that neither the practitioner review study nor the lundquist study attempted to match the test items to the job skills as required under craig.op.at.to support the district court finding of validity,the majority cites evidence describing the process of test development employed by ets.however,this evidence merely purports to show that the test items were expertly developed it does not demonstrate,as the third step of the craig test requires,that the final version of the cbest administered to job applicants is predictive of or significantly correlated with the skills identified in the job analysis as important for the job.where an employer seeks to use a test that has a disparate impact on minorities,it must present evidence that the test actually measures the skills that have been identified as important for the job,and may not rely solely on the fact that it used a well known and respected as a developer of standardized tests.op.at quoting the report of william mehrens.
as evidence that the test questions were matched to the skills they were intended to measure,the majority points only to the curriculum matching project,in which two ets employees matched cbest test specifications to material found in textbooks purportedly used in california public schools.the district court criticized this study as unscientific and not particularly helpful,but nevertheless upheld the test.amae state of california.we have explicitly held that it is essential that the item validation method be professionally acceptable.contreras,at.unscientific and not particularly helpful tests clearly do not meet that standard.thus,even under a clear error standard,the district court determination that step three of the craig test was satisfied requires reversal.
iii.standard of review 
it is plain from a reading of the majority opinion that it is heavily influenced by the fact that we are reviewing district court determinations that it believes to be of some complexity.indeed,in oral argument,the state relied almost exclusively on the fact that the district court had considered the matter carefully and reached its conclusions following a long trial.this may have caused the majority to fail to examine sufficiently the legal inadequacies of the validation studies pointed out in the preceding sections of this dissent.
at each step in its analysis of,the majority emphasizes that the district court determination was not clearly erroneous.however,as the majority recognizes,courts have not discussed the appropriate standard of review for a district court ruling on test validation issues.in fact,the standard of review here should be the same as it was in albemarle and craig,where the supreme court and this court reversed a district court determination that a test was valid based on errors in the application of the test similar to those committed by the district court here.at no point did either court suggest that the clearly erroneous test applied.
although i believe that the district court determination of job relatedness should be reversed regardless of the applicable standard of review,the proper standard is de novo.the majority fails to separate errors regarding the application of the various prongs of the craig test,which involve primarily legal issues,from errors regarding the underlying factual evaluations of expert testimony and statistical significance.the errors here fall in the former category and are therefore subject to de novo review.see united states mcconney,cir en banc 
iv.conclusion 
the defendants failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the cbest,with its discriminatory impact,is job related.the studies relied on by the ctc to validate the test did not differentiate among different teaching jobs,and the ctc did not demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the test items actually measured the skills identified in the job analysis.title vii requirement that tests be validated properly must be vigilantly enforced to ensure that tests that have a disparate impact on minorities are used only if they are job related for the position in question and if no alternative nondiscriminatory selection device exists.plaintiffs challenge to the cbest implicates one of the most important objectives of title employers from erecting arbitrary barriers which interfere with minority access to employment opportunities.griggs duke power,d.by erroneously affirming the district court decision,we allow the state of california to perpetuate discrimination against qualified minority teachers,who are already seriously underrepresented in the california public school system,and,derivatively,against minority students as well.in the end,all californians are the victims of the discriminatory tests the majority upholds.i respectfully dissent.
i concur in the majority opinion with the exception of part iv,where the majority determines that a district court can refuse to award costs to the prevailing party simply because the court decides that the losing parties do not have much money,and are worthy because they have presented an important issue which is close and has some merit.as to that,i dissent.
to my mind,reasoning along that line bespeaks an improper bias in favor of plaintiffs.if the issue is important,both sides have a hand in seeing to it that the true public interest is vindicated,and,as it turns out,a defendant may well be the party correctly representing that public interest.here we deal with the public interest in having competent people running its schools and teaching its children,and defendants showed that it is plaintiffs who erred when they incorrectly thought that a competency test was overly burdensome and improper.that is to say,plaintiffs claim that they and those they represent should not have to meet the minimal competency requirements of the cbest was wrong.the public interest has been vindicated,but not by them.rather,defendants properly represented the public desires and aspirations for california children.they were right,and should not be denied their costs.
thus,i support the reasoning found in national information services,trw,cir,which recognized,as does the majority opinion,that rule d creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing party.because of that strong presumption,a district court therefore generally must award costs unless the prevailing party is guilty of some fault,misconduct,or default worthy of punishment.id.at see also zenith ins.breslaw,cir.as we noted in national information services,at,it does not matter that the plaintiff sued in good faith and with no vexatious purpose,and even raised important and intricate legal questions and included claims that were not meritless.that is no reason to punish the defendant.
when a prevailing party is denied costs,that party is punished but the punishment should not be exacted unless the party has done something to deserve it.id.at.of course,the district court should have broad equitable discretion to decide whether the prevailing party deserves it,but that is where the discretion should generally stop.therefore,all of the other reasons cited by the district court and the majority to justify denying costs to the prevailing parties in this case are improper.they,in fact,represent an abuse of discretion by the district court.
the majority opinion correctly notes that some of our prior decisions have upheld district courts decisions to deny costs to the prevailing parties on the basis of the losing parties limited financial conditions.see,wrighten metropolitan hospitals,cir moore hughes helicopters,cir national organization for women bank of california,cir.however,they did so without much explanation,and,unlike the majority,i would overrule those decisions instead of national information services.
the fact,if it is a fact that plaintiffs do not have access to much money is hardly a good reason to allow them to impose enormous costs upon defendants,which have shown themselves to have been correct in the first place.i see nothing especially extraordinary about plaintiffs who are of modest means but still sufficiently well funded to carry out lengthy litigation.i see no reason to encourage them to cause great expense to their adversaries,safe in the knowledge that there is little downside to their efforts.again,that is why this court has properly recognized that denial of rule d costs operates to punish the prevailing party for some impropriety during the course of litigation,and should otherwise be eschewed.zenith,at see also cherry champion intern,cir holding that there should not be an exception to the presumption in favor of awarding costs to prevailing party because losing plaintiff is of modest means,and disparity of resources is likewise an improper basis smith southeastern pennsylvania transp.authority,cir holding that disparity in financial resources between the parties is not a valid basis to exempt losing party from paying costs.
nor should it matter that defendants are public entities.see smith,at denying costs would be unfair to taxpayers who subsidize prevailing defendant burroughs hills,cir posner,concurring the plaintiffs limited means claim is entitled to little weight in a case such as this where the defendants are public officials whose expenses of suit were borne by the united states,which is to say by the federal taxpayer.most taxpayers are persons of limited means most government revenue is raised from such persons,and not from the wealthy few.the denial of costs to the defendants in this case will not contribute,however slightly,to a more egalitarian distribution of the nation wealth.
i find it regrettable that the majority is using this case for the purpose of overruling national information services and enshrining a kind of test in its place.while the majority does not specifically say that it is taking that position,the denial of costs to defendants surely has that effect.that is most unfortunate.see mitchell city of moore,cir rejecting argument that presumption in favor of costs should be relaxed when the prevailing party is the defendant in a civil rights case cherry,at holding that presumptive award of costs to prevailing party can not be overcome because of public interest nature of the litigation contreras,at holding that civil rights plaintiffs do not warrant special treatment with respect to payment of costs to prevailing party jones,at same.in many cases,it is inequitable to require prevailing parties to bear their own attorney fees.national information services holding that unless the prevailing parties did something wrong,we should not impose the further inequity of depriving them of costs may not be all encompassingly perfect.however,it is much closer to perfect than the position we now adopt.
thus,while i agree with most of the fine majority opinion,i must respectfully dissent from its decision regarding costs.
i join in parts i b,ii,and iii of judge graber opinion,but not parts i a or iv in part ii of judge gould opinion but not part i that part of judge fernandez opinion dissenting on costs but not his concurrence in part i a of judge graber opinion.that is to say,i agree with judge graber that the test was adequately validated and did not violate the civil rights act.and i agree that the judgment does not need to be vacated because of the district court use of an expert though judge tashima concerns strike me as valid,and i might join in his view were i not confident that the result has to be the same regardless of the ex parte advice from the expert.i agree with judge gould dissent on whether title vii applies.and i agree with judge fernandez that we should reverse the denial of costs.
i write separately for two related reasons.first,without at least a paragraph like the one above and a scorecard to keep track of such paragraphs,readers of the opinion can not figure out who stands where,and what the count is.so i have to write something.second,our decision on whether title vii applies,which generates most of our division and the need for so incomprehensible a sentence as the one with which i begin this separate opinion,is entirely unnecessary and could better be avoided.we are not bound to avoid deciding,as we would be with a constitutional question but it would be preferable for us to avoid deciding 
the way to avoid deciding the issue of whether title vii applies is the obvious and traditional formula assuming without deciding whether title vii applies,we conclude that it was not violated,because this test does not discriminate in violation of that law.i would have preferred that we had used that formula.
the reason why i advocate such avoidance is not the difficulty of the question.judge gould analysis is compelling and clearly correct.congress prohibited discrimination by employers with respect to employees.the defendants do not employ the plaintiffs or those whom the plaintiffs represent.so the title vii prohibition does not speak to the situation.
congress adopted the civil rights act of after one of the great legislative battles of our time.it did not choose to impose the expense of justifying tests and other actions that affect employability on third parties other than employers.the country suffered from massive direct and intentional race discrimination at that time.considering the political challenge that the civil rights act of posed for its advocates,and the skill and consumption of political capital it required of such great men as president lyndon johnson,senator hubert humphrey,and senator everett dirksen,we can not assume that congress would have gone any further than it did.reading statutes as if they said what they do not say,in order to go further than the legislature did,vitiates careful legislative compromises.if we do not respect the compromises legislators make,how shall they be induced to make them if we were to fully effectuate what we take to be the underlying policy of the legislation,without careful attention to the qualifying words in the statute,then we would be overturning the nuanced compromise in the legislation,and substituting our own cruder,less responsive mandate for the law that was actually passed.those who only got half a loaf from congress frequently come to the federal courts for the other half,but their mail ought to be forwarded to capitol hill.
there are several reasons why it would be better for us to avoid deciding whether title vii applies.one is that deciding the issue reduces the collegiality of our decision.by collegiality i do not mean civility or good feeling among colleagues,meanings sometimes inferred from the word.i mean the dictionary definition,shared authority among colleagues,so that we meld our individual voices into the voice of the court.an appellate court ought to speak collectively as nearly as possible,particularly when it speaks with the force of an en banc decision.in my experience,the way votes are accumulated for a collegial decision is mainly by deletion of matters not essential to the result,and on which there is disagreement.
in this case,the decision on whether title vii applies is not essential to the result.of the eleven judges on this en banc panel,nine agree that,whether title vii applies or not,the test was adequately validated and would not violate title vii.we could simply stop there.if the test is appropriate even if administered by an employer,as the district court found and nine of us would affirm,then we need not decide whether a state board should be treated as if it were an employer for purposes of title vii.
there are quite a few reasons why such collegiality is desirable.one is that the law is hard to figure out when a reader needs a scorecard to count votes on an issue by issue basis.it is much easier to know what the law is from chief justice marshall unanimous opinions,than from the old english reports with individual judges opinions reported seriatim.careful jurists can fall into disagreement on how to keep score when we do decide on an issue,despite the decision being inessential to the result,there is necessarily a question of whether our decision is mere dictum.the traditional definition of obiter dictum is a remark by the way or as s tatements and comments in an opinion concerning some rule of law or legal proposition not necessarily involved nor essential to determination of the case in hand and lack the force of an adjudication.our resolution of inessential issues invites more litigation.
in this case,our reaching out to hold that title vii applies to opens the door to more litigation,instead of shutting it.we have now created a circuit split on a national issue of great importance.as judge gould points out,all the other circuits to have ruled on whether title vii or the analogously construed adea provision applies to such as state licensing boards have gone the other way.in a schools case in the seventh circuit a veterinary board case out of the third and most closely analogous,a school teacher state certification examination case out of the fifth our sister circuits have gone the other way.so have we,for that matter,in a dental board case though the majority opinion struggles to distinguish these cases,it is indeed a struggle,and the distinction is not solid enough for any state licensing board to rest on.a decision like today,where we set up an conflict on a matter of great national importance,is colloquially known among those of us who do appellate law for a living as cert bait.that is to say,we have furnished the supreme court with a reason to grant a petition for certiorari.as soon as we file our opinion,the highly capable lawyers involved will start calling around to arrange meetings relating to the certiorari petition and amicus briefs.
the majority opinion today says that we ought to decide the title vii applicability issue because it is logical,but there is nothing illogical about assuming without deciding.in the study of logic,assuming without deciding is termed conditional,if p then just as it is perfectly logical to say if today is thursday then tomorrow is friday,without saying whether today is thursday,it is perfectly logical to say that if title vii applies,it is satisfied,without saying whether title vii applies.
the majority also says we should decide the title vii issue even though we do not have to reach it,because the parties probably want to know the answer,particularly the state of california.somehow i doubt that the state of california really wants to know that now it may have to spend hundreds of thousands,maybe millions,of dollars,and years of litigation,validating examinations and possibly all the other screening it does of all licensed professions.more likely,both sides just wanted to win this case and establish either that the cbest examination was or was not permissible.these are school people.they probably care about schools,and want a final answer about the cbest examination.we have undercut the finality of the answer by reaching out for cert bait.
there is another,and to my mind,especially important reason why we ought to avoid deciding this question on which we disagree.we may be wrong.on anything,we can be wrong.i am fairly confident that judge gould is right about title vii,but i could be wrong.the scope and applicability of title vii is an exceedingly important,and always controversial,question.because we are not elected and always in every circumstance run a substantial risk of being wrong,the less we govern the better.that is not to say we should dodge the controversial.if the law is established and the facts show a violation,we are obligated to apply the law without regard to whether it is controversial.but we should restrain ourselves from deciding important public policy issues,when they are unnecessary to decision in the matter before us,we lack a consensus,all the other circuits to have decided them have gone the other way,and the law we establish is not clearly compelled.the people can govern themselves.
all that said,i am not going to make the score even harder to keep by withholding my judgment.we have reached the title vii issue whether i like it or not.i can not prevent us from reaching it.so i join judge gould in concluding that it does not apply because the lawsuit is not against the relevant employer.
i concur in parts ii,iii,and iv of the majority opinion,and in the judgment.i write separately,however,to dissent from part i and to express my view to the contrary that title vii does not apply to the cbest.the majority extends the reach of title vii far beyond what congress intended and in so doing creates potential mischief for all of our states 
section a of title vii provides,in relevant part 
a it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 
to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment 
a natural reading of this section suggests that the individual it references is a potential,current,or past employee of the employer.that is the typical title vii case.see,oncale sundowner offshore,d harris forklift,d ansonia bd.of educ.philbrook,d albemarle paper moody,d griggs duke power,d.
however,in a line of cases beginning with sibley memorial hospital wilson,many this extended title vii liability to employers who discriminatorily interfere with an individual employment relationship with a third party.see id.at see also gomez alexian,cir.to extend title vii reach in this way requires not only an unnatural reading of the statute,but also a dubious inference about congress intent in enacting it.if congress had intended to create liability for interference with employment relationships,there is no discernable reason why it would have limited that liability to employers,as defined in title vii.see,ehret louisiana,voluntary association of river pilots that interfered with third party employment relationship not subject to sibley liability because it was not an employer.as the seventh circuit has noted 
it might be a good idea to impose liability on those who aid or abet violations of laws such as title vii,but what sense would it make to confine that liability to persons or firms that happen to be employers since it would make very little sense that we can see,we find it implausible to impute to congress an intention to create,by language not at all suggestive of any such intention,aider and abettor liability of one employer to the employees of another employer.
eeoc illinois,cir 
this interpretation of the statute under sibley and gomez when applied to private employers at least advances the purpose of title vii to eradicate discrimination in the workplace,and is consistent with the general directive that courts construe the statute broadly to effectuate that purpose.see duffield robertson stephens,cir.
the same can not be said,however,of the majority further extension of title vii to impose indirect liability on the state of california the supreme court repeatedly has admonished that,absent a clear expression of congressional intent,courts must not interpret federal statutes as creating by implication on state authority to exercise what have historically been state police powers.palmer massachusetts.see also will michigan dep t of state police,d.numerous courts have recognized that sibley liberal reading of the statute can not extend title vii liability to states that,in the course of exercising their police powers in good faith,may indirectly affect employment prospects.in haddock board of dental examiners,cir,for example,this court correctly observed that there is no evidence that when congress amended title vii to apply to state governments,it intended to benefit anyone other than those actually employed by state governments or their subdivisions.id.at emphasis added.we thus held that title vii did not apply to the licensing activities of the california state board of dental examiners.see id.virtually all other courts to have considered title vii possible application to state licensing activities and to other exercises of traditional police powers have reached the same conclusion.see,fields hallsville indep.sch,cir george new jersey bd.of veterinary med.exam rs,cir united states new york state dep t of motor vehicles,d,national org.of women waterfront comm of new york harbor,see also eeoc illinois,at because state regulation of teaching,even though pervasive,is exercise of police powers,sibley liability does not apply.
the majority holding in part strays from these cases and is inconsistent with the supreme court controlling law and mandate on which they rest.it also creates a striking conflict among the circuits on an issue of importance to our states,is discordant with basic principles of federalism,and is unworkable in practice.
the supreme court has consistently held that the establishment and regulation of a public school system lies at the core of a state historic police powers it is quintessentially a governmental,not a proprietary function.see wisconsin yoder,d providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a state.hadley junior college,d education has traditionally been a vital governmental function.epperson arkansas,d p ublic education in our nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities.
because california regulates teaching pursuant to its police power,we should read title vii as imposing liability on such regulation only if congressional intent to do so is clear.see united states lopez,d e ducation is a traditional concern of the states in these circumstances,we have a particular duty to ensure that the balance is not destroyed.we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not displaced by a federal statute unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.kennedy,concurring citations and quotations omitted.as noted above,evidence of such an intent is far from clear.in fact,as this court recognized in haddock,it is entirely absent.courts have no business imputing to congress an intent that title vii specific terms reach the sort of regulatory activities at issue in this case.
the majority turns away from this necessary conclusion by taking two routes to error.first,it argues that t here is no overarching licensing exception to title vii,and the state high level of involvement in all areas of local public schools distinguishes this case from the licencing cases cited above.this argument misperceives the issue and misapprehends applicable law.the rationale underlying the licensing cases has little to do with the extent of the state involvement in the regulated activity,as the majority asserts,and everything to do with the principle that courts should not lightly infer a congressional intent to regulate in areas of peculiarly state concern.see,new york state dep t of motor vehicles,at.
both the united states supreme court and the california supreme court recognize that the establishment and control of public schools is a peculiarly governmental function.see lopez,at.butt state,cal th,d.that california regulation of public schools is pervasive does not convert that activity from a governmental exercise of police power into a proprietary activity.rather,california pervasive regulation of public schools is the result of the state constitution requirement that the state ensure equality of educational opportunity.see generally butt,supra.the degree of regulation that california exerts over public schools shows that it is properly performing a governmental function in light of the state constitutional mandate that underlies that function 
second,on another erroneous path,the majority asserts that,because the cbest applies only to public school employees,in imposing the test requirement california is acting in a proprietary capacity.this assertion fails to see the full picture of california educational system.california regulation of teacher qualifications is not confined to the public school system,but extends to all teachers.private tutors and parents intent on home schooling must possess valid teaching credentials.cal.similarly,private school teachers must be capable of teaching,and to permit the state to monitor that requirement private schools are required to file annually with the superintendent of public instruction a statement listing each of their faculty members and their qualifications.cal.students who attend private schools that do not meet these standards are not excused from the state compulsory education laws that require public school attendance.see see also cal.
that the state has chosen to impose different qualification requirements on teachers in different settings does not mean that the cbest is an exercise of proprietary,rather than governmental,powers.instead,it reflects the differing circumstances and differing state interests that are implicated.for example,the california constitution requires the state to ensure basic educational equality in its public schools.butt,cal th at,d,at.at the same time,under the united states constitution,california may not require all children to attend those public schools,because t he fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only.in re shinn,d,quoting pierce society of sisters.while the state may have a strong interest in ensuring uniformity of basic skills among public school teachers,it does not have the same interest in ensuring uniformity among private school teachers or private tutors.for this and perhaps other reasons,in exercising its police powers california might rationally impose different qualification requirements on teachers in these vastly different settings.see,people turner,d supp,dep t describing basis for distinction in qualification requirements for private tutors,home school teachers,and teachers in private schools.further,even if a lack of basic skills were perceived to be a problem in all educational settings,it is in precedents assessing equal protection that a state may address such problems in a piecemeal fashion.see,city of new orleans dukes,d.
not only does the majority holding miss the clear mark set by supreme court precedent,it also squarely conflicts with the decisions of the only two other circuits to have considered a similar issue.in fields hallsville independent school district,cir,the fifth circuit held that a texas teacher skills test,much like the cbest and applicable only to public schools was merely a licensing exam and not subject to title vii.id.at.the majority attempts to distinguish fields by urging that in that case there was little evidence of the control over schools that is present here.the evidence that the fields court was looking for,but did not find,was evidence of,for example,whether the state played any role in the general hiring and firing of teachers or was involved in their daily supervision.id.no such evidence existed there,and none exists here either.hiring and firing of california school teachers is performed by local school boards,as the majority concedes.and those boards are charged by statute with controlling the daily activities that teachers perform,and with evaluating their performance.see,cal.
similarly,in eeoc illinois,the seventh circuit rejected the theory that sibley liability applied to render the state of illinois liable for discrimination in school districts hiring and firing of teachers,despite the pervasive control that the state exerted over various aspects of the districts and their teachers,not unlike the control exerted by california upon which the majority theory relies 
the state of illinois exerts more control over public school teachers than over any private employees in the state and probably over any other persons formally employed by local governments in the state.the state fixes not only a minimum salary for all is after all not much different from fixing a minimum wage for private as well as public employees,and no one supposes that the federal government is the indirect employer of all the workers covered by the federal also the number of days a teacher must work,what holidays he gets off,the amount of sick leave he is entitled to,his eligibility for and length of sabbatical leave,the minimum lunch period,the terms of teachers tenure,the rights of recalled teachers,and much else besides.ilcs et.but we do not think this makes the state the real employer of these teachers.so far as discrimination in hiring and firing on the basis of age or other forbidden characteristics is concerned,the key powers are,naturally,those of hiring and firing.those powers are in the hands of the local school district,though constrained of course by the tenure provision of the state school code.ilcs.fields hallsville independent school district,cir per curiam,holds that a state role in licensing public school teachers does not make them the state employees.to similar effect,see haddock board of dental examiners,cir.we think the present case is closer to fields and haddock than to the cases that classify the defendant as an indirect employer.
the majority theory that a state that extensively regulates an activity is subject to sibley liability also is unworkable.where and how are we to draw a line,other than arbitrarily states regulate a wide range of activities in ways that potentially interfere with individuals employment opportunities with third parties.for example,california extensively regulates farm labor contractors,requiring them to have a state license,and regulating their relations both with farm laborers and the farms with whom they contract.see cal.labor code et.it heavily regulates the pharmacy industry,including licensing pharmacists,and regulating their authority,duties,and work hours.see cal.bus.et cal.labor code.it regulates school busing,including driver certification,whom buses may carry,and the features that buses must have.see cal.et.it regulates nursing and nursing education,requiring licenses for all nurses,and special licenses for public health nurses,including those employed by local,in addition to state,agencies.see cal.bus,et.it regulates harbors and navigation,including navigation,cal.harb.et,vessels,id.et,masters and crews,id.et,and requires special licenses for pilots in the san francisco bay area,id.et.
under the majority theory,depending on the extent of the regulation in each of these areas,the state of california potentially could be liable under title vii for the good faith exercise of its police powers to protect migrant farm workers,the public health,the safety of school children,and the environment and safety in san francisco,san pablo,and suisin bays.this result would impair federalism and is not a choice made by congress.
the majority opinion also calls into question this court own decision in haddock.the majority contends that haddock is not inconsistent with its holding in part,arguing that in that case licensing was the entire connection between the plaintiffs and the defendants.the state of california,however,is heavily involved in regulating the dental profession,including such diverse areas as setting licensing requirements,employment and compensation for acupuncturists in dental offices,the use of general anesthesia,and the facilities and equipment that dentists may use.see cal.bus.et.on the majority theory,this regulation seems sufficient to render the state of california,if not the board of dental examiners,liable under title vii for any discriminatory impact in the dental licensing exam.was haddock only problem that he sued the board of dental examiners rather than the state 
these are only examples but illustrate that the majority reliance on a pervasive involvement trigger for state title vii liability either will extend title vii into every aspect of a state exercise of its police power,or will permit arbitrary application of title vii depending on each court interpretation and assessment of the scope of state regulatory control in varied fields.neither result could be what congress had in mind when it made it unlawful for employers to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment a.
conclusion 
the majority holding in part ignores the mandate of the supreme court that,absent clear evidence of a congressional intent,courts must refrain from construing federal statutes as regulating in areas where states traditionally have been sovereign in exercising their police powers.in addition,it conflicts with the only two other circuits to have considered the issue whether a state can be held liable for its school district hiring and firing actions.the holding in part also impairs respected values of federalism because the majority applies title vii to states good faith exercise of their police powers.for these reasons,i respectfully dissent from that part of the majority opinion.
among the issues raised by plaintiffs on appeal are the procedural errors procedural taint which result ed in the unreported influence of klein.plaintiffs explain their contention as follows 
we do not know the extent of klein ex parte communications with the court,nor the influence these communications had with the court,nor the extent to which his views and unfamiliarity with employment testing standards could have been tempered by the heat of.we know none of this because the district court did not require any report of the advice he received from klein and,most importantly,denied plaintiffs their right to the court expert.
appellants opening brief at.because i can not agree with the majority cursory and mistaken treatment of the technical advisor issue in part iii,i respectfully dissent.
courts and jurists have long recognized that the law should in some way effectively use expert knowledge wherever it will aid in settling disputes.learned hand,historical and practical considerations regarding expert testimony,harv.the only question is as to how it can do so best.id.i agree with the majority that the district court retains the inherent authority to appoint a technical advisor in especially complex cases.op.at.as justice brandeis,speaking for the court,noted more than years ago 
courts have at least in the absence of legislation to the contrary inherent power to provide themselves with appropriate instruments required for the performance of their duties.this power includes authority to appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties,as they may arise in the progress of a cause.
ex parte peterson.approving appointment of an auditor and report to be made by him.in exercising that power,however,the district court must observe certain,minimal,procedural safeguards in order to insure that the advisor is unbiased and impartial,and that his participation is properly confined.here,at the district court invitation,a question of the advisor bias and partiality was raised,but not resolved.the record is also completely devoid of any evidence of what role klein played in the proceedings,the scope and basis of his influence,what materials or knowledge he may have called on in bringing that influence to bear,and what part his knowledge,expertise,and advice played in the district court ultimate finding that cbest is a valid test under title vii.i would therefore vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for it to make findings on the bias and partiality issue,and to explain klein role,in accordance with the guidelines set forth below.
even though we have never held explicitly that district courts may appoint technical advisors outside the confines of federal rule of evidence courts and commentators agree that a trial court inherent authority to appoint a technical advisor has not been displaced by the federal rules.see reilly united states,cir note,improving judicial gatekeeping technical advisors and scientific evidence,harv,hereinafter technical advisors hall baxter healthcare,appointing technical advisor under inherent authority of.although the use of a technical advisor should be the exception and not the rule,expert advice can be quite useful in a trial that involves unusually complex issues in fields beyond the regular questions of fact and law with which judges must routinely grapple.reilly,at.moreover,because the district court is in a better position to decide if the appointment of a technical advisor is warranted,we should defer to its discretion with respect to whether or not to appoint one.see id.reviewing appointment of technical advisor for an abuse of discretion.
the majority correctly concludes that this is one of those rare cases in which the appointment of a technical advisor under the inherent authority of the court is justified.op.at see reilly,at.as the original panel opinion pointed out,this case involves the highly technical field of psychometrics,and presents problems of unusual complexity beyond the normal questions with which judges routinely grapple.association of educators california,cir,reh g en banc granted,cir.
after three years of discovery,the district court found that it needed guidance on a host of complex,factual issues.as the district court noted in its order appointing technical advisor,the court comes face to face with many prickly problems requiring expertise in the esoteric fields of education and psychometrics including knowledge of theories about educational measurement and testing,cognitive psychology,statistics,and other fields pertaining to the cbest and other cases.it then appointed stephen klein,a test validation expert,as its technical advisor.although i agree with the majority that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to appoint a technical advisor,that is only the beginning of our inquiry,and not its end,as the majority seems to think.
the order appointing the technical advisor provides that he is to review all of the direct testimony of the experts heretofore furnished to the court,briefs,selected pleadings,and depositions.klein was also to be present in court during expert testimony,take such notes as he deems proper and confer ex parte with the court from time to time.it also noted that h is role will be similar to that of a judicial clerk and,therefore,he will not be available for communication with or questioning by the parties.the order nowhere stated,however,what klein was to do with all of this evidence and other information he was directed to absorb,except to confer ex parte with the court from time to time.
the use of a technical advisor is not without risks.first,whenever a court appoints a technical advisor,there is a danger that the court will rely too heavily on the expert advice,thus compromising its role as an independent decisionmaker and the requirement that its findings be based only on evidence in the record.this risk is especially salient if the contents of the communications between the trial judge and the advisor is hidden from the parties and appellate review,and where the parties have no opportunity to respond to the advisor statements.see technical advisors,harv.at.second,experts in the relevant field,particularly if it is a narrow and one,may be aligned with one of the parties therefore,the district court must make every effort to ensure the technical advisor neutrality,lest the advisor develop into,or give the appearance of being,an advocate for one side.without some safeguards,the parties confidence in the fairness of the trial will erode.
thus,once the district court has appointed a technical advisor,its discretion concerning the advisor role in the trial should not be unfettered.we have never had occasion to give definitive guidance to district courts on the use of technical advisors and this case clearly demonstrates why we should simply put,we are utterly unable,on this record,to review the propriety of klein advice to the district court because we have no idea what role he played in the district court factfinding process.as indicated above,the district court laid out klein duties in its appointing order,but that order does not state what klein was to do with that store of knowledge.there is no evidence in the record that would provide any hint about the nature,scope,or substance of klein advice.we therefore do not know whether and,if so,to what extent,klein may have impermissibly influenced the court ultimate finding that cbest is a valid test under title vii did he draw upon his own expertise and knowledge of test validation to discount or contradict the opinion of a testifying expert on either side did he explain to the court why cbest was valid,based either on his own opinion on information such as the scientific literature in the field,including his own writings not in the record or was he asked only to review the court proposed findings for technical accuracy moreover,plaintiffs have alleged that klein was biased in favor of defendants and the district court did little to allay plaintiffs concerns.
although we need not require strict adherence to any specific procedures,i would hold that a district court minimally must utilize a fair and open procedure for appointing a neutral technical advisor address any allegations of bias,partiality,or lack of qualification clearly define and limit the technical advisor duties make clear to the technical advisor that any advice he gives to the court can not be based on any information and make explicit,either through an expert report or a record of ex parte communications,the nature and content of the technical advisor advice.by adopting these minimal safeguards,the parties can be assured that the technical advisor appointment process is fair and that the technical advisor does not exercise undue influence on the district court.these procedures will also enable meaningful appellate review.
neutrality of the technical advisor 
the district court,of course,should have wide latitude when choosing a technical advisor,who,after all,is retained to aid the court understanding of the difficult and complex technical issues presented in the case.the parties,however,should be given an opportunity to object to any proposed appointment based on bias,partiality,or lack of qualification.see reilly,at technical advisors,harv.at daubert merrell dow,d noting that,with respect to proffered scientific evidence,the trial judge must determine the qualification of a person to be a witness quoting.a.while the district court is not required to reject the appointment of a technical advisor merely because one side or the other objects,it must adequately address any concerns of bias,partiality,or lack of qualification that the parties raise.
here,the district court properly allowed both sides an opportunity to review klein curriculum vitae and to submit written interrogatories to him concerning his experience and background plaintiffs objected to klein appointment on the grounds that he had worked closely with the california commission on teacher credentialing,one of the defendants in this case his private practice focuses on supporting certification exams he has taken positions on issues raised in the case and he had worked closely with one of defendants key experts,mehrens.
we are unable to discern from the record whether any of these allegations are,but it is clear that the district court did not adequately address these objections.after plaintiffs objected to the appointment,the district court overruled the objection,stating that plaintiffs would have the opportunity to examine him fully with respect to any views that he may have.this response to the objection might have been adequate,had the district court actually given plaintiffs the promised opportunity.as it turned out,however,the court response to plaintiffs concerns was wholly inadequate because the district court later decided that it would not have klein testify.there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court seriously considered plaintiffs objections or that it took any other measure to insure klein neutrality,such as making its own independent inquiry.this omission is all the more troubling because the objections,if,might well provide valid bases for disqualifying klein from serving as a neutral technical advisor.
to avoid this situation in the future,i would require,absent mutual agreement by the parties on an acceptable technical advisor,that the district court meaningfully address,on the record,any colorable objection to the appointment of a specific technical advisor.because the district court failed adequately to address plaintiffs objections to klein appointment,i would remand to the district court for this determination to be made on the record.
b.the technical advisor role 
the role of a technical advisor also should be carefully defined and limited to reduce the risk that the advisor will usurp the role of the court as factfinder,see technical advisors,harv.at,or of even giving that appearance.to this end,the district court should lay out the specific duties of the technical advisor,keeping in mind that the advisor role should be that of sounding board and tutor who aids the court in understanding the jargon and theory relevant to the technical aspects of the evidence.reilly,at see technical advisors,harv.at.this job description should make explicit that the technical advisor is not to contribute evidence unless called as a witness or to be an advocate on behalf of either party,harv.at see reilly,at.if the parties,the court,and the advisor all are clear on the advisor role,there will be less likelihood that the advisor will overstep his bounds or that the parties may be led to believe that he has.moreover,a job description that highlights those areas in which the district court needs aid or clarification may help to focus the parties attention on issues that are important to the court and,therefore,aid the parties in addressing those concerns directly.see technical advisors,harv.at.
when the district court appointed klein,as noted above,it ordered that he was to review all the direct testimony of the experts,the parties briefs and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,and other such documents as seems appropriate.it also explained that klein should listen to the expert testimony,take notes,and confer with the court ex parte when necessary.the district court,however,failed to complete the list of klein critical duties.it did not describe the nature or scope of its consultations with klein,whether his role was limited to reviewing the court proposed findings for technical accuracy,whether he was to evaluate the opinions of the testifying experts,or whether he was to give the court his own,independent,expert opinion.
in the future,district courts should be more specific concerning the technical advisor precise role.for example,the court could explain which technical concepts it finds troubling,and limit the expert role to helping it comprehend those technical issues.see hall baxter healthcare.at listing specific questions submitted to the technical advisors.the district court may even find it helpful to invite the parties to participate in defining the expert duties to reduce the risk of perceived unfairness and to help focus the issues.see technical advisors,harv.at.
making a record 
finally,the nature and scope of the advice provided to the district court by the technical advisor should be recorded in some manner.while i would not prescribe a mandatory procedure for making that record,such as a reporter transcript of all ex parte conferences between the court and the technical advisor,obviously,some documentation is as a report by the advisor,a summary of the advice given,or the court statement on the the court interaction with the technical advisor 
the district court,as well as other courts,likened the duties of a technical advisor to those of a law clerk and,thus,reasoned that the communications between the court and advisor may be kept confidential,concealed from the parties and the appellate court.see reilly,at.while there are some similarities between a law clerk and a technical advisor,that analogy is limited 
in some important respects,a technical advisor is quite unlike a law clerk.a law clerk function is to aid the judge in researching legal issues in cases pending before the court.because the judge is an expert in the law and fully understands legal theory and analyses,it is unlikely,to say the least,that a law clerk will impermissibly usurp the judicial function.on the other hand,a technical advisor is brought in precisely because the judge is not familiar with the complex,technical issues presented in the case.see id.at appointment of a technical advisor must arise out of some cognizable judicial need for specialized skills.there is therefore an understandable concern that the technical advisor opinion will carry undue weight with the judge.daubert,at.noting that e xpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it internal quotations and citation omitted.in short,a judge can filter out bad legal advice or research from a law clerk he or she is,however,to do the same with bad technical advice.moreover,resolution of legal issues is committed to the judge qua judge and is subject to de novo review.on the other hand,factual issues,no matter how technical,are committed to the factfinder and,to be reviewed properly,must be based on the record made in the trial court.
whatever method the court employs in making a record of the technical advisor advice and counsel,there is no reason why a neutral technical advisor advice should be shrouded in absolute secrecy.concealing the nature of that expert advice can only erode confidence in the court role as a neutral and independent decisionmaker.
these procedural safeguards are not especially burdensome and should not be difficult to apply.they are,however,essential in order to insure that the parties have confidence that the technical advisor is unbiased,impartial,and qualified,and that he has not unduly influenced the proceedings.such minimal procedural safeguards are also required so that any challenge to the appointment of a technical advisor or to the degree of his participation in the case can meaningfully be reviewed on appeal.here,other than a short order appointing klein,the district court provided no explanation of his role.it also failed adequately to address the parties written objections to klein neutrality 
for the foregoing reasons,i would vacate the judgment and remand this case to the district court for its resolution of these issues and for such further proceedings as may thereafter be necessary

our discussion of validation owes much to the original panel majority excellent treatment of these issues.
we affirm the district court conclusion that the cbest was validated properly based on the second and third studies the practitioners review and the lundquist study.because we conclude that those tests adequately support the district court finding of,we do not discuss in detail the wheeler and elias study,on which the district court also relied.all three studies reviewed the same basic version of the cbest the version that was given between and august,when the test was revised.there is no allegation that the test changed significantly during that period or that the test was invalid until but valid thereafter.accordingly,it is sufficient for us to conclude that the test was validated properly by the and studies and,because we so conclude,we do not decide whether the study provides an additional source of validation.
