factual and procedural background 
on september,plaintiff filed a complaint against mcneal,allen tollefson,and the regents of the university of california the regents.tollefson and the regents are not parties to this appeal.the operative first amended complaint filed october,alleged sexual harassment,as against all defendants,negligent hiring,supervision and training,as against the regents,and violation of civil rights,as against all defendants.plaintiff also sought punitive damages.
the complaint alleged mcneal was an employee,agent,and manager for the defendant regents at ucd.mcneal is sued in her individual capacity.mcneal is the director,operations and maintenance for ucd and has responsibility for the management of an estimated million annually in construction and maintenance projects at ucd and overall supervision of an estimated employees.mcneal is tollefson immediate supervisor.a political appointee,prior to her designation by the regents as director,operations and maintenance in mcneal had no managerial or supervisory experience or familiarity with the management of large budgets,construction projects,or work crews,and no training or experience as a fair and impartial hearing officer for employee grievances.
the general allegations asserted as follows 
plaintiff was employed by ucd as an inspector,planner and estimator,and on several occasions during the year last past was sexually harassed by his supervisor,allen tollefson.on february,and march,plaintiff filed grievances,and the regents assigned an investigator,who allegedly verified from other employees that tollefson referred to plaintiff as my boy toy and my bitch.in july,mcneal,who was director of operations and maintenance for ucd,and who was also tollefson supervisor,acted as the hearing officer and managing agent for the regents in the matter of plaintiff grievances.mcneal denied the grievances and wrote to plaintiff that it was more likely that the allegations of excessive controlling behavior,verbal threats and sexual harassment did not occur.mcneal refused to recognize the substance of plaintiff grievances or to take effective action to prevent recurrence of tollefson conduct or to protect plaintiff from future unwelcome contact with tollefson.the complaint alleged mcneal was being sued in her individual capacity.the complaint alleged plaintiff had filed a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh on october,and was awaiting a right to sue letter.
the first count alleged sexual harassment as against all defendants,but did not make any specific allegation against mcneal.it alleged tollefson harassed plaintiff,and the regents had an obligation to prevent sexual harassment after another employee complained about tollefson in.
the second count alleged negligent hiring,supervision and training as against the regents.
the third count incorporated by reference the other allegations and alleged violation of civil rights as against all defendants.the third count alleged 
in hearing,processing,and deciding the grievances alleged in paragraphs and,julie mcneal and other employees of the regents were acting as managers and agents for the regents under the personnel policy and the color of state law.
the denial of plaintiff grievances against tollefson conduct as alleged denied plaintiff the benefit and protection of his federal statutory and constitutional right to be free of sexual harassment,discrimination and retaliation.
the personnel policy contains no written provision that grievances filed by employees of ucd shall be heard by a fair and impartial hearing officer thereby perpetuating a long standing and persistent pattern,practice,and custom of the regents to deny employee grievances in which grieving parties have alleged sexual discrimination,harassment,or retaliation by supervisors and managers.
the regents do not provide training for mcneal as a hearing officer to hear and decide grievances under the personnel policy.
on august,mcneal filed a section special motion to strike the third cause of action the civil rights violation as a slapp,because it accused mcneal of conduct hearing,processing,and deciding plaintiff workplace grievances that arose from alleged activities in furtherance of her right of petition or free speech.the motion further argued plaintiff could not show a likelihood of success so as to avoid a section dismissal in part because he failed to exhaust internal administrative remedies.
mcneal attorneys submitted declarations explaining why the motion was not filed until almost three years after the complaint was filed.
mcneal submitted a declaration attesting that,in handling plaintiff grievances,she followed the procedures set forth in the statewide regents personnel policies for staff members and the local implementing procedures collectively,ppsm.section of the ppsm permitted an employee such as plaintiff to file an employee complaint form with the human resources department and seek a remedy for employee grievances.step i of the section process was review by the department head,who could delegate investigation to an appropriate individual.if the complainant was not satisfied with the step i response,he could appeal it for step ii review.an employee and labor relations elr analyst would determine if the appeal was eligible for step ii review,in which case a complaint resolution officer would be appointed and would convene a meeting with the complainant and others to obtain information and respond to the complaint.some types of grievances could be appealed to a third step,in which a step iii hearing officer would hold an evidentiary hearing and issue a decision 
mcneal attested that plaintiff filed complaints pursuant to ppsm section on february and march,accusing tollefson of sexual harassment.these grievances were assigned to mcneal as department head.elr analyst dan grey was assigned to investigate the complaints and prepare a report for mcneal review.grey reported that plaintiff claims were unsubstantiated by the evidence.mcneal had no reason to believe grey harbored any unlawful prejudice against plaintiff,and mcneal herself did not harbor any unlawful prejudice against plaintiff.mcneal reviewed grey report,found it to be adequate,and agreed with its conclusions.she accordingly found plaintiff complaints to be without merit and so notified him.mcneal attested,to my knowledge,plaintiff did not appeal this decision to the next step in ppsm section process.
plaintiff opposed the motion.he submitted various declarations,parts of which were excluded by the trial court sustaining of some of mcneal evidentiary objections the parties do not challenge the evidentiary rulings on appeal.the admitted portions of the declarations include ucd senior superintendent leslie nopp declaration asserting that mcneal took it upon herself to be the person to review plaintiff grievance concerning tollefson the plaintiff declaration in the joint appendix on appeal is unsigned a point not noted by the parties.in any event the trial court sustained evidentiary objections to paragraph in which plaintiff described alleged incidents of harassment by tollefson on the grounds it conflicted with plaintiff interrogatory answers.plaintiff interrogatory answers said tollefson followed plaintiff around,sometimes came up behind him,stared at plaintiff hair and body,made comments about the penises of other men,said one man had pretty lips,tugged at his own tollefson crotch,and got angry when plaintiff refused to move into tollefson office.plaintiff interrogatory answers also said ucd policy does not require a hearing officer to be fair or impartial.
on november,the trial court issued an order denying mcneal motion.the court first determined there was good cause for mcneal delay in filing the motion.as to the court denial of mcneal motion to strike the third cause of action civil rights claim,the trial court said,defendant mcneal has not shown that section applies to plaintiff third cause of action.the gravamen of plaintiff third cause of action is defendant hearing,processing and deciding of plaintiff grievances.citation to complaint.plaintiff third cause of action is not based on the content of what defendant stated in any proceeding or the exercise of the right to petition.citation.the trial court also ruled on evidentiary objections.
mcneal appeals.
discussion 
appealability and standard of review 
an order denying a section motion is an appealable order,subd.i,subd.a.
on appeal,we first independently determine whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the cause of action triggers the statute.if the cause of action triggers the statute,we then independently consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.olaes nationwide mutual ins.th,d.
ii.cause of action triggers section 
mcneal argues her statements and communicative conduct in handling plaintiff grievances which are the gravamen of plaintiff civil rights claim against her are protected by section,because they were connected with an issue under review by an official proceeding authorized by law,and furthered the right to petition of plaintiff and similarly situated employees.we agree.
we begin with the legislative mandate to construe section broadly.thus,section,subdivision a,states the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly.
section,subdivision e,provides as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.italics added.
the case before us involves subdivision e of section statement or writing made in connection with an issue under review in an official proceeding authorized by law.
subdivisions e and e of section do not require the defendant to show a public issue or issue of public interest.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.these first two clauses safeguard free speech and petition conduct aimed at advancing self government,as well as conduct aimed at more mundane pursuits.under the plain terms of the statute it is the context or setting itself that makes the issue a public issue all that matters is that the first amendment activity take place in an official proceeding or be made in connection with an issue being reviewed by an official proceeding.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,but see flatley mauro cal th,d,section does not apply to speech or activity that is illegal as a matter of law.
as we have mentioned,this case involves subdivision e of section statement or writing made in connection with an issue under review in an official proceeding authorized by law.
thus,mcneal reviewed plaintiff grievances pursuant to the ppsm,which was established by the regents,which is a constitutional entity having powers.cal,art.ix,campbell regents of the university of california cal th,d.the regents have rulemaking and policymaking power in regard to the university their policies and procedures have the force and effect of statute.kim regents of university of california th,d.statutory hearing procedures qualify as official proceedings authorized by law for section purposes,kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d,kibler hospital peer review procedure qualified as official proceeding under section because procedure was required by business and professions code statutes 
plaintiff argues his third cause of action against mcneal does not arise from mcneal conduct or writings.he says he did not target mcneal as a officer for her written decision on his grievance,but rather as a defendant for her participation in aiding and abetting tollefson harassment of plaintiff.however,plaintiff argument ignores his own pleading,the third count of which complained of mcneal hearing,processing,and deciding his grievances.that the third count of the complaint incorporated by reference the preceding allegations of the complaint including the first count allegations against all defendants for sexual harassment does not help plaintiff.scott metabolife,th,d plaintiff may not immunize a cause of action challenging petitioning activity from a section motion by the artifice of including extraneous allegations concerning nonprotected activity.plaintiff fails to point to any allegation of any aiding and abetting conduct by mcneal,other than her hearing,processing,and deciding his grievances.his respondent brief on appeal says he named mcneal as an individual defendant in his first and third causes of action for direct supervisor liability under feha,et as an aider and abettor pursuant to the holding in fiol doellstedt th d.however,fiol said that supervisory employees should not be placed at risk of personal liability for personnel management decisions which have been delegated to the supervisor by the employer,such as deciding whether to take action on a complaint of sexual harassment.fiol,supra,th at,d.moreover,in interrogatory responses,plaintiff did not cite the feha when asked to identify the statutory bases for his civil rights cause of action.he cited only federal civil rights statutes and the fourteenth amendment.plaintiff points to the declaration he submitted from leslie nopp,stating that mcneal was not known to have reviewed any other grievance but took it upon herself to review plaintiff grievances.plaintiff claims mcneal thereby furthered tollefson conduct which created a hostile work environment for plaintiff.however,nopp declared i am informed and believe that julie mcneal never reviewed any other grievance besides plaintiff grievances concerning tollefson.this statement on information and belief does not constitute admissible evidence evans unkow,supra,th at,d and would fall within the hearsay statements excluded by the trial court.we therefore disregard plaintiff implication that mcneal hearing,processing,and deciding of his grievances constituted aiding and abetting tollefson alleged sexual harassment of plaintiff.
in denying the section motion,the trial court in this case said plaintiff third cause of action was based on mcneal conduct and not on the content of what she stated in any proceeding or in the exercise of the right to petition.we disagree.the gravamen of plaintiff third cause of action is mcneal communicative conduct in denying plaintiff grievances.the hearing,processing,and deciding of the grievances as alleged in the complaint are meaningless without a communication of the adverse results.we need not address mcneal argument that section also applies to noncommunicative conduct.
the trial court cited san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement th,d san ramon.however,that case is not controlling.in san ramon,a fire district sought mandamus relief after a county retirement board decided to increase contributions payable by the fire district its employees.id.at,d.the first appellate district upheld the trial court denial of an motion.the introduction to the opinion states this case requires us to decide whether litigation seeking judicial review of an action or decision by a public entity is subject to a special motion to strike under the statute merely because the challenged action or decision was taken by vote after discussion at a public meeting.our answer is no.even if the conduct of individual public officials in discussing and voting on a public entity action or decision could constitute an exercise of rights protected under the issue we need not and do not does not mean that litigation challenging a public entity action or decision always arises from protected activity.in the present case,the litigation does not arise from the speech or votes of public officials,but rather from an action taken by the public entity administered by those officials.moreover,that action was not itself an exercise of the public entity right of free speech or petition.we therefore affirm the trial court order denying the entity special motion to strike.id.at,d,italics added.san ramon went on to say,although we need not and do not reach the issue here because no individual board member was sued by the district,we note that there is support for the argument that the protection accorded by the statute extends to statements made by public officials at an official public meeting,and perhaps also to their votes.citations.id.at,d.san ramon noted that nothing about the board action increasing pension contributions implicated the rights of free speech or petition.ibid.
thus,even assuming san ramon is correctly decided,the case did not decide the issue presented in this appeal.plaintiff argues san ramon is nevertheless controlling,because it recognized that government bodies may invoke section where appropriate,just like any private litigant,and its holding was based on the conclusion that the board act did not implicate free speech or the right to petition.however,san ramon expressly stated it was not deciding the issue of suits against individuals.cases are not authority for propositions not considered.people barragan cal th,d.moreover,in observing in dictum that support exists for applying section to statements made by public officials at official public meetings,san ramon cited schroeder irvine city council th,footnote,d,which noted in dictum that insofar as the lawsuit targeted city council members,the basis for their liability was premised on their vote in favor of adopting a voter participation program,and voting is conduct qualifying for first amendment protections.plaintiff argues schroeder is distinguishable because he is not suing mcneal due to any speech or petition,but for aiding and abetting a harassing supervisor.we have already rejected plaintiff aiding and abetting theory.
here,unlike san ramon,we do deal with a lawsuit against an individual public employee.moreover,we are mindful of our mandate to construe section broadly.we agree with mcneal that a narrow reading of the statute in plaintiff favor could result in public employees reluctance to assume the role of hearing officer in such cases,and thus thwart the petitioning activities of employees with grievances.in concluding that hospital peer review proceedings are official proceedings within the meaning of section,the supreme court in kibler,supra,cal th at page,d,observed that to hold otherwise would discourage physicians from participating in peer review committees.kibler is not necessarily on point,because it noted physician participation is voluntary and unpaid,whereas in our case the handling of section claims appears to be part of the job description of managerial employees though mcneal argues a decision in her favor in this case would encourage public employees to volunteer to help mediate workplace disputes.in any event,the purpose of section is best served by applying it to all individual participants in the official proceeding,including the decision maker.
we conclude the third cause of action triggered section,subdivision e,any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by any other official proceeding authorized by law.
we also agree with mcneal that she acted in furtherance of the right to petition within the meaning of section,even though it was not her own right to petition at stake.section does not require that a defendant moving to strike under section demonstrate that its protected statements or writings were made on its own behalf rather than,for example,on behalf of its clients or the general public.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,statute applied to nonprofit provider of tenant counseling services see also,mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara th,d mission oaks protected independent environmental consultant,hired by the county,who prepared environmental impact report for required public hearings concerning potential development of projects dowling zimmerman th,d protected attorney who furthered the petition rights of a client.as noted in mcneal reply brief,the statute has also been applied to witness statements in response to subpoenas.greka integrated,lowrey th,d.
plaintiff argues application of section should be limited only to persons,such as lawyers,who support another person petition rights,and should not extend to hearing officers because such a blanket application would necessarily require extension of the statute to protect tortfeasors on the basis that the tortfeasor provides a ground for a tort victim to petition for redress.we disagree.hearing officers in an official proceeding deserve the protection of the statute.
plaintiff argues mcneal was not acting in furtherance of the right to petition because her conduct,by her own description,appears to have been nothing more than a ministerial act in reviewing and accepting the investigator report.we disagree.by mcneal description,she exercised discretion in determining plaintiff grievances.
plaintiff cites city of cotati cashman cal th,pages through,d,which said the mere fact an action is filed after protected activity took place does not mean it arose from that activity within the meaning of section,subdivision b fn,ante.cotati held an motion should not have been granted in a state court declaratory relief action filed in response to a federal declaratory relief action between the same parties,raising the same issues owners of mobile home parks challenging the city enactment of an ordinance creating a mobile home park rent stabilization program.cotati reasoned that the state court action arose from the underlying controversy that had prompted the federal litigation,rather than from the filing of the federal litigation itself,and thus did not fall within the scope of section.id.at,d.
here,plaintiff third cause of action arose from mcneal denial of plaintiff grievances under the ppsm.thus,cotati does not help plaintiff.
we conclude section applies to the third cause of action.we now turn to the question whether plaintiff showed a probability of prevailing on the claim.olaes nationwide mutual ins.company,supra,th at,d.
iii.probability of plaintiff prevailing 
mcneal argues plaintiff failed to show a probability of prevailing on the civil rights claim so as to avoid the striking of the claim under section.we agree.
when a defendant makes a threshold showing that a cause of action arises from speech or conduct protected under section,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a probability of prevailing on the merits at trial,subd.b navellier sletten cal th,d.the plaintiff must show the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment
