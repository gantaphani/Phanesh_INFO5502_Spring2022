this is not the usual lawsuit brought under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,in which the parents of a disabled child demand reimbursement for the costs associated with sending their child to a private school while the school district defends its decision to provide the child a public school education.in the present action,anthony and adele gagliardo the gagliardos or parents and arlington central school district the school district agree that the gagliardos child,belonged in a private school for his senior year.they differ only as to the school.
upon competing motions for summary judgment,the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge granted the parents motion.gagliardo arlington cent.sch,d.the district court held principally that the private school chosen by the school district in formulating individualized education program iep would not afford the free appropriate public education required by the idea and that the parents placement was appropriate accordingly,it ordered the school district to reimburse the parents for the tuition expenses they incurred in sending to the private school they chose.in doing so,the district court rejected the conclusions reached by an impartial hearing officer iho and a state review officer sro to deny reimbursement.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court decision to reject the iho determination regarding the appropriateness of the private school chosen by the parents is not supported by the record we thus reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the school district.

factual and procedural background 
with regard to the academic year at issue,to,was a high school senior who was eligible for special educational services on account of his classification as a student with an emotional disturbance specifically,he suffered from depression and social anxiety.while this lawsuit involves the parents request for tuition reimbursement for that period,the relevant history of emotional disturbance begins several years earlier.
first exhibited symptoms of depression in the fifth grade and began seeing a therapist on a weekly basis in the sixth grade school year from to.by april,was receiving more advanced treatment for his depression,including antidepressants.in the fall of,attended arlington high school as a ninth grader and started the school year performing quite well.but after being threatened by another student in october of that year,he began to experience anxiety about attending school.feeling overwhelmed,he found himself skipping classes,and as a result,his grades declined.
returned to arlington high school for tenth grade,but as the year passed,his anxiety mounted.in february of,he refused to attend school.soon thereafter,his parents admitted him to the adolescent intensive outpatient program at francis hospital where he underwent a mental status examination and problem appraisal.the social worker at francis,while recognizing that the goal was to get back in school,opined that he would need a structured educational setting before transitioning back.the social worker recommended extended home tutoring the school district began providing it in early march.
on march,the gagliardos referred to the cse.in april,they consented to an evaluation of their son and completed a social history that indicated he had been teased and bullied by other students,had a history of depression,and did not want to attend school.the school district psychologist administered a set of standard intelligence tests,which revealed that had an iq in the high average range,average achievement in reading and writing,and superior achievement in mathematics.additional testing confirmed anxiety,depression,and exclusion from social interaction.
in june,the cse convened for an initial examination into situation.after reviewing all of the evaluations,the cse classified as having an emotional disturbance.consistent with that classification,the cse developed an iep for to school year,his junior year in high school.it recommended that he receive resource room services one period each day,individualized counseling once a month,and various testing modifications.the parents consented to the iep.
returned to arlington high school for his junior year,but by september,he refused to attend classes.on october,his treating psychiatrist concluded that could not attend school due to his severe anxiety and depression.the school district thereupon arranged for home schooling.
in november,the gagliardos arranged for a psychiatric evaluation of their son by keith ditkowsky,director of clinical services at new york university child study center.also in that month,they withdrew their consent to iep on the basis that his needs had changed since the iep had been developed six months earlier.the parents requested a cse meeting and an extension of home instruction.
ditkowsky transmitted his evaluation and recommendation to the gagliardos in a letter dated december.in the letter,ditkowsky recommended that 
in light of the continued symptoms of his anxiety disorder,coupled with his history of recurrent depression,it appears that would benefit from an alternative placement.such a setting should have a smaller teacher to student ratio,and be in a more supportive or therapeutic environment.hopefully this will allow to into a school setting.it is also important that the academic curriculum be at an appropriate level given clear ability.
ditkowsky further emphasized the urgency with which needed to reintegrate into a school setting and that prolonged home instruction would aggravate his problems.
the cse met a week later to review the december,letter from ditkowsky.based on the information before it,the cse described to the parents several alternative high school programs,including that of the karafin school,a small day school in kisco,new york.the cse agreed to reconvene at a later date to review further information.
in january,and his parents began visiting the various alternative high school programs.at the same time,the parents sought independent advice from a private organization regarding other private schools.this organization recommended oakwood friends school,a quaker school in poughkeepsie,new york,that was not approved for the provision of special education services by the new york state department of education.
ditkowsky submitted his final report to the cse on february.in it,ditkowsky provided a more detailed description of disorder 
has a history of recurrent symptoms of depression and anxiety,which have interfered in his ability to function well in school.the persistent pattern of symptoms with occasional exacerbations is consistent with a diagnosis of dysthymia with intermittent major depressive episodes h is school refusal,coupled with his numerous concerns about running into peers in the school,and social withdrawal is suggestive of social anxiety,most likely consistent with social phobia.
largely echoing his december,recommendations,ditkowsky stated that academically did not appear ready to return to arlington high school and that he would benefit from placement into a smaller,therapeutic or more supportive program with a good academic component in order to help him again function in a school setting.ditkowsky explained that t his is especially important,as needs not only the credit,but also the social interaction.
on february,the cse reconvened,with ditkowsky participating by telephone.in response to questions regarding how much psychological support needed during the school day,ditkowsky explained that the environment he recommended would include staff with expertise in anxiety disorders that would be able to work with should issues associated with his emotional disturbance manifest themselves in the course of the school day.at the same cse meeting,the parents authorized the release of file to karafin and the other schools that had been discussed at the previous cse meeting.
the following month,and his parents visited karafin and met with the school associate director,bart donow.according to the gagliardos,the visit went poorly.shortly after the visit to karafin,the parents hired counsel to assist them in their dealings with the school district.counsel recommended that neuropsychologist marian rissenberg evaluate 
on april,the parents asked for another cse meeting.in a letter to the school district,they represented that they had visited the various schools discussed in the february meeting and considered all of them inappropriate for their son.at about the same time,the parents applied for admission to oakwood and authorized the release of his information to that school.the parents had not mentioned oakwood to the school district earlier and did not notify the school district that they were taking this step they did,however,tell rissenberg that they hoped their son would attend oakwood.
in a letter dated may,the parents notified the school district that its evaluations of their son are not correct in diagnosing his disability,and therefore not correct in educating or treating him.the parents also requested that rissenberg evaluate,and the school district agreed.
the cse met on june,to conduct annual review.they reviewed the gagliardos letter explaining their dissatisfaction with the schools they had visited,including karafin.the parents were asked for suggestions but provided none.the parents were also asked to consent to additional academic skills testing,but they refused because the same testing was to be administered by rissenberg.
on july,oakwood accepted three days later the cse met to finalize placement for his senior year.at this meeting,the cse recommended that be placed at karafin,with various program modifications,testing accommodations,and once a week counseling.the cse continued to request additional academic skills testing,and the parents consented.on july and again on july,father wrote to the school district demanding an iep based on the discussions at the july meeting,which the school district furnished on july.
on august,the parents requested an impartial due process hearing,asserting that karafin was an inappropriate setting for.he commenced attendance at oakwood in september.
in october,while the due process proceedings were pending,rissenberg completed her report on evaluation.her report,in substance,was consistent with that of ditkowsky.she found evidence in of superior intellectual ability,social anxiety,inflexibility,poor social perception,and depressed mood.she opined that his situation was consistent with a diagnoses of asperger mild autistic spectrum the context of very superior intellectual capacity.rissenberg recommended an alternative academic placement with small classes and an individualized approach,instruction at a high level of conceptual complexity with students whose intellectual capacity was similar to,and learning and group participation.she also recommended that be protected from bullying and ostracizing by peers.rissenberg further recommended various supports consistent with an attention deficit disorder,including extended time for tests,preferential seating,help with planning and organization,and individual instruction as needed.last,she recommended both individual and group therapy.
after a total of nine days of hearings,the iho rendered a final decision dated june.it found that the proposed iep was reasonably calculated to enable to receive educational benefits and therefore appropriate the parents did not meet their burden of demonstrating that oakwood was an appropriate placement and equitable considerations weighed against granting the parents reimbursement request.accordingly,the iho denied the parents request for tuition reimbursement.the sro affirmed the iho decision based on the iho conclusion that the iep was appropriate to needs.because this conclusion was sufficient to affirm the iho,the sro did not address findings and.
the parents filed this reimbursement action pursuant to i.both parties moved for summary judgment on the amended complaint.the district court granted the gagliardos motion.gagliardo,d at.the district court found,based on its own review of the administrative record and certain additional evidence,that the proposed iep that specified karafin was not appropriate principally because karafin was not the least restrictive environment in which to educate see id.at.it further found that oakwood was an appropriate placement,id.at,and that the parents were equitably entitled to reimbursement,id.at.accordingly,the district court awarded the parents tuition reimbursement.id.at.judgment was entered on march,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
as we have noted earlier,in order to receive federal funding under the idea,a state must provide to all children with disabilities a free appropriate public education.a a rowley,at.if parents believe that the state has failed their child in this regard,they may,at their own financial risk,enroll the child in a private school and seek retroactive reimbursement for the cost of the private school from the state.see sch.comm.of the town of burlington dep t of,d ex rel.bd.of,cir.in determining whether parents are entitled to reimbursement,the supreme court has established a two part test was the iep proposed by the school district inappropriate was the private placement appropriate to the child needs.see burlington,at.frank bd.of,cir.the party who commences an impartial this case,the the burden of persuasion on both burlington factors.see schaffer weast,d.if parents meet their burden,the district court enjoys broad discretion in considering equitable factors relevant to fashioning relief.see florence county sch.dist.four carter,d.
in this case,the question of whether the gagliardos carried their burden of demonstrating that the iep proposed by the school district was inappropriate is a close one.we
