citing lukewarm performance evaluations,indiana state university isu decided not to renew professor oladele omosegbon contract as a junior,untenured faculty member in the department of african and studies.whom we refer hereafter as dele,following the lead of his suit in indiana state court alleging that isu and various members of the university had deprived him of his due process and academic freedom rights under the fourteenth and first amendments to the constitution,and had also breached his employment contract in violation of indiana law.isu removed the case to federal court and then moved for summary judgment.the district court determined,without the benefit of the supreme court recent clarification in lapides board of regents of university system of georgia,d,that all but dele claims for injunctive relief were barred by the eleventh amendment.the district court then found that the remaining claims failed on the merits because dele could not show the property or liberty interest necessary to succeed on a procedural due process claim,and because his academic freedom claims were otherwise meritless.dele appeals on all counts.in light of the supreme court decision in lapides,we now reverse in part the district court jurisdictional holding,but we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the merits as to all claims not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,both federal and state.
dele was hired by isu in as a junior,untenured professor in the african and studies department.the offer was accompanied by a letter which read as follows 
tenure at indiana state university is a status earned through service to this institution,and eligibility exists after the satisfactory completion of a probationary period of seven years of university experience.you will be reviewed for tenure during the academic year and with a positive evaluation and recommendation,will be eligible for tenure status at the beginning of the academic year.continuation during the probationary period is based on annual faculty evaluations,which include among their criteria scholarly and creative activity as well as the quality of instruction,university and professional service,and other duties assigned by your chairperson.
dele received two annual evaluations in accordance with the terms outlined in the letter,in fall of and fall of.both evaluations were conducted by a personnel committee of four professors from the department,appointed by the department chairperson,aisha.in each case,took the committee findings and final vote under advisement and forwarded her own recommendation to at isu.the fall evaluation was lukewarm at best.the personnel committee voted to make a conditional reappointment to a second probationary year within the department.also favored conditional reappointment,which is obviously not as desirable as unconditional reappointment the other favorable possibility open to the university.dean joe weixlmann of the college of arts and sciences agreed and sent a letter which dele also received up the chain to provost richard wells,outlining various problems with his teaching duties and his scholarly output.provost wells thereafter made a conditional reappointment of dele.
the fall evaluation was also lukewarm,but slightly better than the first.this time,the personnel committee deadlocked,with two members favoring conditional reappointment,and two members favoring unconditional reappointment.again took the committee recommendation under advisement,but this time recommended that dele not be reappointed to a third probationary year.dean weixlmann and provost wells separately concurred,and wells delivered the bad news to dele by letter dated december.
pursuant to university,dele requested a formal hearing regarding the termination decision that hearing took place before a committee of the isu faculty on may.the committee recommended reinstatement for dele.under isu,however,this recommendation was,and dean weixlmann and provost wells separately rejected the committee position and held fast to the decision not to dele.dele responded with this suit.
we turn first to those parts of the district court order that pertain to jurisdiction.the district court held that the eleventh amendment barred dele claims for money damages against the state of which isu is a part and against the individual defendants in their official capacities.while we agree that those claims can not go forward,there is no need to reach the eleventh amendment issue,because the state is not a person that can be sued in this way under.see will michigan dep t of state police,d see also lapides,supra.at vermont agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d.dele claims against the individuals allegedly in their individual capacity present a slightly more complex question,but because he seeks backpay and other forms of monetary compensation based on an employment contract,we think it so inescapable that any resulting judgment will be paid by the state rather than the individual defendants that this bears no resemblance to a bona fide individual capacity suit.the individuals,after all,were not even parties to the contract in their individual capacity.accordingly,he has no claim against these defendants either.finally,the district court held,and we agree,that dele claims for injunctive relief come within the ex parte young exception to the eleventh amendment and therefore are not barred.see.mci telecomm,cir.
where we do find error is in the district court dismissal of dele claims for lack of jurisdiction under the rule first announced in pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d.the fact that this was error became clear after the supreme court intervening decision in lapides.the defendants conceded the point in their brief before this court,citing lapides for the proposition that removal is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court jurisdiction sufficient to waive a state objection to litigation of the matter in a federal forum.
while we agree that lapides ultimately commands reversal of the district court dismissal of dele claims,lapides must be read with care.what the court said,more precisely,was that a state voluntary invocation of a federal court jurisdiction through removal waives a state otherwise valid objection to litigation of a claim in a federal forum.see lapides,at.at.the result is that there is an extra layer to our sovereign immunity analysis regarding dele claims,given this court repeated holdings that under erie state rules of immunity are binding in federal court with respect to state causes of action.benning bd.of regents of regency,cir see also richman sheahan,cir magdziak byrd,cir.before we find the rule announced in lapides to be controlling here,we must first satisfy ourselves that indiana immunity rules would have allowed an indiana court to hear dele contract claim had this lawsuit not been removed to federal court.
the indiana supreme court abolished sovereign immunity in.see campbell state.the indiana legislature responded with the indiana tort claims act itca,which established extensive immunity provisions which shield governmental units from tort liability benton city of oakland city.but the itca is neither here nor there for the purposes of dele claims,which sound in contract,not tort.the rule for contract claims in indiana state courts appears to be the one announced in campbell.this means that an indiana state court could have heard dele claims against isu and its officials,and thus under lapides that the federal court could do so also,in the exercise of its supplemental jurisdiction.compare raygor regents of of,d holding that supplemental jurisdiction statute,d,did not toll state statute of limitations for state claims against unconsenting state when federal claim dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds.
on the merits,dele raises two principal arguments.first,he claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him on his claims for violation of his due process and academic freedom rights under the fourteenth and first amendments respectively.second,he urges that the district court brushed off his breach of contract claim too has
