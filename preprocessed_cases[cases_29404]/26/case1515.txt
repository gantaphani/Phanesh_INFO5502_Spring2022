an association of citizens appeals the denial of its petition for a writ of mandate and contends that a community college violated the california environmental quality act ceqa when it failed to perform an initial environmental study in connection with its decision to close and remove a campus shooting range and transfer certain classes to a range off campus.the community college argues its decision and actions were not a project subject to ceqa,if a project existed,it was exempt from ceqa,and the matter is moot because the decisions have been implemented.
we conclude the whole of the community college action constitutes a project for purposes of ceqa,the project is not exempt,and the matter is not moot.accordingly,we reverse and remand to the superior court with direction to issue a writ of mandate requiring that an initial environmental study be conducted.
facts and proceedings 
appellant association for a cleaner environment ace is a nonprofit organization and alleges that it represents citizens who object to the destruction of an shooting range at modesto junior college mjc range and are concerned with the failure of the respondents to comply with ceqa.donald clark is an individual residing in san joaquin county and a professor emeritus at modesto junior college mjc.
ace and clark filed a petition for writ of mandate against respondents yosemite community college district district and the district board of trustees board.the district consists of columbia college in columbia and mjc.chancellor pamila fisher is the chief administrative officer of the district.the board governs the district.
in,the mjc range was built on the west campus of mjc.the mjc range was used for firearms courses offered through the criminal justice training program and the administration of justice program.the mjc range also was used by law enforcement officers,individuals from a private security department and community service classes.
the minutes of the board meeting conducted on april,provide the following description of events that led to the current litigation 
since,the campus has grown considerably and the student population will more than double when the sierra halls are fully occupied.in addition,we have added four new child care facilities.this year,a new soccer field was built immediately south of the range based on plans for the range removal.parking lots are scheduled to be built immediately west of the range next year,before sierra halls open in the summer of.eventually two more classroom buildings will be built nearby and the agriculture complex is planned for the current site.
although the firing range has served as an important part of the criminal justice training center during the last years,it has been a source of concern to students,staff and neighbors.consequently,the master plan adopted by the board of trustees in,and the joint powers agreement with stanislaus county and the city of modesto adopted in,called for the firing range to be removed after the firearms classes are moved to the new facility built by the jpa,which includes the modesto police and the stanislaus county sheriff office.this plan was consistent with the moving of the entire criminal justice training program to its new facility on crows landing road in.since then,all other west campus cjtc old buildings have been removed.
the new modesto police department firing range,which is part of a larger complex including equestrian and canine training,will be completed some time in late summer or early fall.when it is complete,our classes,our weapons arsenal,and any useable equipment,and our range master will be located at the new site.the cjtc academy,modesto police,and stanislaus county sheriff,as well as other law enforcement agencies,comprise percent of the activity at the range and will be served there.in addition,our two classes per term which are open to the public also will be offered there.
thus,the remaining issue before the board of trustees was the future status of the old firing range once the program is relocated.operating two facilities would incur significant extra costs for staff,utilities,maintenance,and liability insurance.it is staff conclusion that it is inappropriate to have an active public firing range on a growing and heavily populated campus.complaints from students,staff and neighbors regarding safety and noise,as well as concerns about environmental issues,also contribute to this conclusion.the facility could be sold to a private entity,donated to a public agency,demolished,or stay vacant until a later date.
in addition to the foregoing reference to plans for removal of the mjc range,the administrative record contains other statements about its removal.a march,letter from the district director of facilities and plant operations,maria baker,to chancellor fisher states the mjc facilities master plan for the west campus assumes the removal of the firing range.this has been noted on all the plans for the mjc west campus at least since and may even that time.also in march,chancellor fisher wrote two letters referring to plans for removal of the mjc range.
the joint powers agreement referenced in the april,minutes is titled joint exercise of powers agreement of the criminal justice training agency by and between the yosemite community college district,the county of stanislaus and the city of modesto unnecessary capitalization omitted and is dated as of july,jpa.the jpa was entered for purposes of outlining the duties,responsibilities and obligations of each party as they relate to providing educational services for the mjc regional criminal justice training program.
because of concerns about lead contamination and safety,the district had the mjc range examined by an environmental firm,an architect and its insurance provider.hazard management services,hms took soil and wipe samples from the mjc range for purposes of determining levels of lead contamination and reported its results to the district.hms concluded that the level of lead in the soil samples exceeds california regulatory levels and therefore qualified the materials as hazardous waste.
after visiting the mjc range,the architect concluded the range was in need of maintenance,direct shots were not escaping the range,but bullets or fragments were breaking out after initial impact,and the district should confront the serious personal safety issue of escaping bullets or fragments.
valley insurance program joint powers authority sent the district a letter stating that from a general liability and workers compensation risk control perspective,it considered the location of an outdoor firing range adjacent to the educational complex and recreational athletic field to be unusual and out of the ordinary.
after receiving information from hms,the architect,the insurance provider and many other sources,the board adopted the resolution that is at the center of this appeal.the minutes from that october,meeting provide 
a motion was made by neumann,seconded by allen,that the board of trustees authorize proceeding with conducting lead abatement at the mjc firing range site,closing the range and donating salvageable portions of the firing range to the tuolumne county sheriff office,and preparing an agreement with the county of tuolumne regarding the transfer of this property and the provision of firearms training at their new range.the motion carried by a vote of ayes and nay 
subsequently,an addendum dated october,was added to the district previously drafted request for bids on the lead cleanup of the mjc range and surrounding area.the addendum stated that the district had decided to close the mjc range but that the decision to dismantle or demolish it was still in question and would not be decided for some time.nevertheless,the administrative record contains no minutes showing that the board changed the resolution adopted at the october,meeting.
on november,ace and clark filed a petition for writ of mandate alleging that the board action on october,failed to comply with ceqa.after an administrative record was prepared,the district and board filed a motion for judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the
