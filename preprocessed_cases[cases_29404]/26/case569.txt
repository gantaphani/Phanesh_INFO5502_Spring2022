this case concerns two federal statutes promoting the access of students with disabilities to educational opportunities,the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,and section of the rehabilitation act of section,et.defendants are the knox county,tennessee schools and school superintendent charles lindsey collectively,the school system.plaintiffs are minor child and her mother,as next friend.
on january,idea and section evaluation teams convened by the school system determined that was ineligible for special assistance under either statute.was the sole dissenting member of both teams.after was determined ineligible,requested a due process hearing for her daughter under the idea.at the conclusion of the due process hearing,the administrative law judge affirmed the finding of the idea team.then appealed the administrative decision to the district court.the district court agreed to hear both the idea and section claims,having jurisdiction over the idea claims pursuant to i a a and over the section claims pursuant to.after reviewing the evidence,the district court declined to rule on the merits of the case,but instead found that procedural errors occurred during the eligibility determination process under both statutes.the district court final order required the school system to reconvene evaluation teams to reconsider eligibility under both statutes.the school system appeals from this remand.we now reverse the district court decision.
the purpose of the idea is to guarantee children with disabilities access to a free appropriate public education.see d a.under the idea,a school system conducts an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies for special education or related services in the form of an individualized education program iep.see d a.to conduct its evaluation,the school sets up an individualized education program team iep team comprised of the parents,at least one teacher of the child,a special education teacher,a representative of the local education department,an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation results,and any other individuals with special expertise.see d b.tennessee regulations require schools first to create an evaluation team composed of experts to develop an assessment report which is then presented at the iep team meeting.see.rule september.if the iep team fails to certify a student for an iep,f permits the parent to request a due process hearing.the hearing must abide by certain procedural safeguards,and the idea gives parents the right to counsel and outside experts.see generally.
the purpose of section is to ensure that disabled individuals have the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid,benefit,or service of any program receiving federal financial assistance.see a.programs receiving federal financial assistance include public schools.see b b.
there can be no doubt that the child at issue here,had a long history of behavioral and scholastic problems.in,when was seven years old and in the second grade,she was certified as disabled under the idea as health impaired based on a diagnosis of hyperactivity disorder adhd.behavior included biting,kicking,disrespect toward adults,and the use of vulgar language.as required by the idea,the school developed an individualized education program iep and a behavior management plan.achievement test scores suggest made decent educational progress over the next few years.at the beginning of her year in,began the recertification process under the idea.in january,an iep team meeting decertified as health impaired.over the previous two years,she had received average to above average grades in most areas measured.
the next school year,the family moved to baltimore,maryland where attended the sixth grade for one semester.some of grades that semester were failing.her school report from baltimore indicated that her conduct interferes with her learning.
in january,returned to the knox county school system and problems persisted.a conference was held because behavior was getting in way of academic progress.her grades were a low during the spring semester.according her mother,attended summer school but was dismissed because of behavioral problems.
by the end of october of her seventh grade year,received nineteen days of suspension and two days of suspension as punishments testified that she met with the school principal at this time and requested that be evaluated and strategies set up to help her,but the principal responded that behavior was not affecting her academic performance.took to a mental health clinic,where a doctor prescribed ritalin.
despite medication,behavior problems continued.soon after meeting with the principal,was accused of slapping a teacher.in response,the school began proceedings to consider expulsion was not ultimately expelled.the school also concluded that an evaluation by an iep team was necessary.
the initial evaluation team was comprised of sandra machleit,a school psychologist,michael greer,a private psychiatrist,vance sherwood,a private psychologist,and suzanne hartsell,a social worker.prior to the full iep team meeting,these experts conducted evaluations of,interviewed her mother,and wrote an assessment report as specified by tennessee regulations.see.rule september.the report found that did not meet the criteria to qualify as a disabled student under the idea.the experts agreed that had adhd but concluded that behavioral problems were volitional and not caused by her disability.they noted that could control her behavior under many circumstances and that behavioral problems are not usually associated with adhd.
the iep team meeting was held on january,at which the evaluators and were present,as well as the principal,a special education consultant,a special education supervisor,and one of teachers.with the exception of,the iep team concluded that was not eligible for special education under the idea.was an active participant in these meetings and not only registered her disagreement with the iep team conclusion but also requested alterations to the reports.according to,following the iep team meeting school personnel composed largely of the same group held a section meeting that lasted about five minutes,again over objections,was found ineligible for special services under section.
after a due process hearing conducted at request,the administrative law judge upheld the iep team earlier determination that was not eligible to receive specialized services under the idea.on appeal from the administrative decision,the district court first considered whether the school system had complied with the procedural requirements of the idea.based on the meeting of the experts who issued the assessment report prior to the formal iep team meeting,the district court concluded that the school system had violated provisions of the idea that require full,fair,and informed parental participation in the process.in support of this holding,the district relied heavily on the following exchange between machleit,and counsel during the due process hearing 
q.did you conclude at the pre team meeting that did not meet criteria 
under idea,that true.
q.so the meeting before january,the decision was she did not meet certification under idea 
based on this testimony,the district court found that,prior to the iep team meeting,machleit met with other members of the evaluation team,and they concluded that did not meet the requirements for eligibility under the idea,thus depriving of her right to participate in this initial determination of eligibility 
the specific nature of these meetings is disputed by the defendants.they contend that any meetings were merely organizational and necessary for the evaluators to complete the assessment report to be given to the iep team.sherwood and greer testified at the administrative hearing that they understood that only the iep team could make the actual eligibility determination and that their role was limited to the contribution of their expertise.notably,machleit did not testify and the district court did not find that a final determination was made prior to the iep team meeting.
regarding the section meeting,the district court concluded that the school had not applied the proper standards when it denied eligibility by merely referencing the report and conclusions of the idea team.
having found these procedural violations,the district court declined to reach the merits.the court reached the following conclusion 
if this were a case where the student was clearly handicapped and entitled to services under the idea,the appropriate remedy would be to reverse the alj and find that was deprived of an individualized educational program to meet her special needs.however,that result is not so clear in this case.the questions at issue are close.eligibility under idea should be decided by a full iep team and not beforehand by a portion of the iep team.her eligibility under should be determined by the full section assessment team or committee examining the appropriate factors and apply the appropriate standards under rather than under the idea.
memorandum opinion,at citations omitted.the district court then remanded the action to the knox county school system to reconvene an iep team to reconsider eligibility under both statutes.
standard of review 
we apply a clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court findings of fact and a de novo standard of review to its conclusions of law.see knable bexley city sch,cir.the district court,however,is required to give modified de novo review to the findings of fact in the administrative proceedings under the idea.id.
this modified de novo review of administrative proceedings stems from the supreme court decision in board of education rowley,d,requiring courts to give due weight to state administrative proceedings in idea cases.see knable,at burilovich board of educ,cir citing rowley,at.under a modified de novo standard of review,a district court is required to make findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence contained in the complete record,while giving some deference to the fact findings of the administrative proceedings,particularly when educational expertise is essential to the findings.see knable,at burilovich,at.we clarified the meaning of the rowley due weight standard in burilovich as follows 
because administrative findings in idea cases should be afforded less deference than that given to agencies under the substantial evidence test,and in view of the idea preponderance of the evidence standard,we hold that administrative findings in an idea case may be set aside only if the evidence before the court is more likely than not to preclude the administrative decision from being justified based on the agency presumed educational expertise,a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony,or both.
burilovich,at.
the plaintiffs correctly contend that the idea places a great deal of emphasis on correct procedure.as the supreme court noted in rowley 
it seems to us no exaggeration to say that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process,see,a d,as it did upon measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.
at.regarding procedural matters in state proceedings,we held in burilovich that the iep process should be reviewed for strict procedural compliance,although technical deviations would not make an iep invalid.see at citing dong board of,cir.
b.the school system idea procedures 
in rowley,the supreme court held that an idea inquiry is twofold.first,a court conducts an examination of prior proceedings for procedural compliance,and then an examination of whether the student substantive rights to services under the idea were violated.at.interpreting this requirement,we have held 
a procedural violation of the idea is not a per se denial of a fape free appropriate public education rather,a school district failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the act will constitute a denial of fape only if such violation causes substantive harm to the child or his parents.substantive harm occurs when the procedural violations in question seriously infringe upon the parents opportunity to participate in the iep process.
knable,at citations omitted emphasis added.in knable,we concluded that failure to hold an iep meeting constituted a substantive harm.id.at.we reached a similar conclusion in babb knox county school,cir.reversing the district court,we held that the student met the criteria for emotional disturbance under the idea and that the school did not inform the parents of the seriousness of the student disruptions and punishments at school.id.at.
in burilovich,we addressed the procedural issues raised by meetings held outside the presence of the parents in the context of an alteration to an existing iep 
plaintiffs have not indicated how they were prevented from participating in the development of the iep.the parents attended a december iepc individualized educational program conference,strongly expressed their views at the march iepc,had the opportunity to participate in the may iepc,and also expressed their views through letters and telephone conversations with district staff.furthermore,plaintiffs have cited no support for their implicit assertion that schools may never discuss a child iep,goals,objectives,or educational methodology out of the presence of the parents.for these reasons,plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they were denied participation in the iepc process.
at citation omitted.
as in burilovich,the record before us clearly indicates that the alleged procedural faults did not seriously infringe upon opportunity to participate in the iep team meeting.unlike the parents in knable and babb,was informed of problems at school,she attended the key iep team meeting,expressed her disagreement with the iep team conclusions,and even requested alterations in the iep team reports.as in burilovich,the plaintiffs here fail to cite authority holding that the mother must be present at all meetings or that discussions concerning eligibility can not take place outside the presence of the mother taken together,our holdings in burilovich and knable suggest that when a parent fully participates in the iep team meeting and is an active participant in the final determination of the child eligibility,there is no substantive harm caused when experts and school officials confer ex parte so as to coordinate the drafting of an assessment report.
indeed,it is far from clear that such meetings constitute even technical violations of idea procedures.the school system points out that it is standard practice for an assessment team to draft a report before the iep team meeting,and we do not see how the school could carry out its duties under the idea absent reports from experts.tennessee regulations require an assessment team to evaluate a student eligibility and prepare an assessment report prior to the iep team meeting.see.rule september.
plaintiffs argue that the existence of the assessment team report and the contacts between school appointed experts are themselves a premature decision constituting a predetermination of eligibility and hence a substantive procedural harm.in support,they cite,app.a,which prohibits the completion of an iep before the iep team meeting.
this argument conflicts with both with the regulation cited to support it and our prior holding in burilovich in which this court referenced,app.a,to note that a district staff may prepare information before meeting with parents.at.while this regulation refers to a situation in which a child is found eligible for an individualized education program under the idea,it is obviously analogous to the circumstances in which the child is found to be ineligible.the regulation prohibits a completed iep from being presented at the iep team meeting or being otherwise forced on the parents,but states that school evaluators may prepare reports and come with opinions regarding the best course of action for the child as long as they are willing to listen to the parents and parents have the opportunity to make objections and suggestions
