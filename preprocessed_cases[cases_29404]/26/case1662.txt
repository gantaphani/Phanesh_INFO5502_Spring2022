background 
on august,matthew was working as a manager for the springfield lanphier high school football team during its preseason summer practice sessions.at some point during practice,a coach told matthew to leave the practice field to get a helmet from the locker room for one of the players.the locker room was in the gymnasium to the north of the practice field.matthew exited the practice field using the north gate,gate this was the most direct route to the locker room and did not lead near to the vicinity of the hole.after retrieving the helmet,however,matthew found that gate b had been locked,so he headed through the parking lot toward the west gate,gate he was focusing his attention on the player who needed the helmet,when he stepped into a hole in the parking lot between gates a and b and broke his ankle.matthew had noticed the hole in the parking lot earlier that day.the parking lot was located north and west of the practice field,between the gym and practice field.the parking lot served the entire school complex,with the doors located west of the lot.
the hole matthew fell in was about square feet in size,inches deep,and was filled with sand.it was created by the removal of a fire hydrant.city workers placed barricades and an orange ribbon around the hole following the excavation,and the barricades were to remain in place until the city filled the hole and paved it to make it level with the parking lot.however,the barricades were not in place at the time of matthew fall instead,they were lined up against a fence behind the hole.
shirley laurik testified in her deposition that she went to all of the springfield lanphier high school football practices in because her son,russell laurik,was a manager for the team.matthew testified in his deposition that shirley always watched the team practice and that when he fell on the day in question,she was seated in a chair near the hole in the parking lot,but did not see him fall.
plaintiffs filed a negligence suit against the city and the school board.defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the site of matthew injury was intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes under section of the tort immunity act ilcs west and defendants were therefore immune from an ordinary negligence claim.defendants summary judgment motion further alleged that they owed no duty to matthew because the hole was an open and obvious condition on the premises.the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants,finding that they were immune from suit under section of the act.the trial court did not address the question of whether the hole was open and obvious.
the appellate court affirmed,relying primarily on this court decision in sylvester chicago park district,section immunity applied where plaintiff was injured in a public parking lot across the street from soldier field.d at.the appellate court noted that the locker room and the practice field are recreational facilities.it then found that,l ooking at the property as a whole,the parking lot is integral to the football recreational facility because it connects the locker room and football practice field.accordingly,the parking lot increases the usefulness of the football practice field that is permitted to be used for recreational purposes.d at.
summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,affidavits,depositions,admissions,and exhibits on file,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ilcs c west sollami eaton.the purpose of summary judgment is not to try a question of fact,but is instead to determine whether one exists.golla general motors.we review de novo an order granting summary judgment.harrison hardin county community unit school district.
the first issue presented on appeal is whether section of the tort immunity act is applicable to the school parking lot where plaintiff was injured,thereby immunizing defendants from liability.section of the act provides as follows 
neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury where the liability is based on the existence of a condition of any public property intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes,including but not limited to parks,playgrounds,open areas,buildings or other enclosed recreational facilities,unless such local entity or public employee is guilty of willful and wanton conduct proximately causing such injury.emphasis added.ilcs west.
section provides a public entity with an affirmative defense,which,if properly raised and proved,bars a plaintiff right to recovery.bubb springfield school district.by providing immunity in section,the legislature sought to prevent the diversion of public funds from their intended purpose to the payment of damage claims.bubb,at.in,the legislature expanded the scope of immunity because local public entities began facing difficulty in affording liability insurance.sylvester,at.prior to its amendment in,section applied only to public property intended or permitted to be used as a park,playground or open area for recreational purposes,ch,par.the general assembly amended the statute to its current language,applying to any public property intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes,including but not limited to parks,playgrounds,open areas,buildings or other enclosed recreational facilities.pub.act,eff.november,amending,ch,par.see ilcs west.section immunity was expanded to cover any recreational property,similar in nature to the kinds of properties listed in the statute.bubb,at.
this court has had two prior opportunities to examine the language of section of the act.in bubb springfield school district,we found that section applies if public property is intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes,regardless of the primary purpose of the property.more recently,in sylvester,we found that section might apply to facilities or structures that increase the usefulness of public property intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes,even though the facilities or structures themselves may not be recreational in character.sylvester,at.
plaintiffs argue that the character of school property as a whole is educational,not recreational.therefore,they contend,this case is distinguishable from sylvester.they claim that because the parking lot was not within the bounded area of the practice field,the independent character of the parking lot must control over any increased usefulness it may have added to the practice field.to support their position,plaintiffs rely upon adamczyk township high school district,d,capps belleville school district,d,and batson pinckneyville elementary school district,d.in response,defendants urge this court to read sylvester as granting immunity for nonrecreational pathways on school property that provide access to recreational facilities because such paths increase the usefulness of the facilities.
we find plaintiffs arguments more persuasive,as defendants interpretation would be too expansive and would swallow the common law duty of due care codified by section a of
