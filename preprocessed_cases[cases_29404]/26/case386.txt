kenneth lawson,in his capacity as superintendent of the anne arundel county public schools aacps,and the board of education of anne arundel county appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of maryland bredar,entered under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,ordering payment of reimbursement to the parent of a learning disabled child for two years tuition at a private school.the district court concluded that such reimbursement was necessary because aacps denied ab a free appropriate public education fape.
aacps and the student mother,db,had engaged in a protracted dispute as to the nature and extent of ab learning disability.an administrative law judge held that aacps formulated an individualized education program iep for the and school years that was reasonably calculated to provide ab with a fape under idea.the district court reversed the alj ruling and granted summary judgment for the bs.the lower court held that ab had not been provided a fape,and aacps was obligated to reimburse db for two years of private school education.because,as explained below,aacps complied with idea and formulated an iep reasonably calculated to provide ab with some educational benefit,we reverse the district court and direct that summary judgment be entered for appellants.we also vacate the district court order insofar as it ordered aacps to reimburse plaintiffs for ab placement at the summit school for the and school years.
this case involves the application of idea,a statute designed to provide free appropriate educational services to millions of children with learning disabilities in the united states.one of congress primary purposes in enacting idea in was to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a fape that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs d a see also mm ex rel.dm sch.dist.of greenville county,cir to receive federal funding under idea,the state must provide all children with disabilities a fape.c,a.a fape requires the school district to provide instruction that suits the child needs as well as related services to ensure that the child receives some educational benefit from instruction.see also,educ.a defining fape defining related services.

in addition to idea requirement that the state provide each student with some educational benefit,the student must be placed in the least restrictive environment to achieve the fape.the disabled child is to participate in the same activities as children to the maximum extent appropriate.a a see also that special classes,separate schooling or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes can not be achieved satisfactorily.tit.regulations concerning least restrictive environments.we stated in devries fairfax county sch,cir,mainstreaming of handicapped children into regular school programs is not only a laudable goal but is also a requirement of the act.
to assure that students with disabilities receive fapes,idea requires that school districts provide ieps for each disabled child.d.before providing special education,the school district must conduct an individual evaluation to determine a student eligibility under idea.id.a a.upon a determination that a student is learning disabled and thus eligible for special education services,the school district is to develop an iep through cooperation between parents and school officials.a.the iep is to be formulated by an iep team consisting of the child parents,one of the student regular teachers,a special education teacher,a representative of the school board,an individual who can interpret evaluation results and,whenever appropriate,the disabled child.id.d b.an iep must detail the student current educational status,set forth annual goals for the student education and state the special educational services and other aids that will be provided to the child as well as the extent to which the child will be mainstreamed.id.d a.

ab is a student that all parties now agree is learning disabled in the areas of writing and reading,thus he is considered disabled under idea.the dispute between aacps and db arose because ab was not initially coded as learning disabled,and once coded,db and her experts disagreed with the ieps proposed by aacps.
ab was born in.he attended kindergarten through third grade at annapolis area christian school annapolis christian during the school years from.during,because of ab difficulties with reading,db brought her son to aacps for educational and psychological testing.the aacps test results showed various iq scores between and,and its report noted that ab full scale iq placed him in the percentile and that he was in the average range of intellectual ability.on educational tests,ab scored below average for his grade in writing and word recognition,but he scored above his grade level in mathematics.aacps concluded that the student should be able to perform academically at a level consistent with peers.
during the spring of,annapolis christian administered multiple achievement tests,finding that while ab was at an advanced level in arithmetic,he had difficulties in written language and reading.the following spring,annapolis christian conducted more tests,and ab scored in the average range in reading but scored below his grade level in spelling.his arithmetic performance continued to be above his grade level.at the administrative hearing,db testified that her son was frustrated at annapolis christian and he was shutting down and withdrawing at the end of the third grade.at the end of the school year,annapolis christian recommended that ab repeat the third grade.
in july,db had ab evaluated by the kennedy krieger institute kki.kki tests results revealed ab verbal iq was in the high average range,performance iq in the superior range,and full scale iq in the high average range.by other testing indicia,however,kki found that ab reading and writing skills were poor enough to qualify him as learning disabled.
though annapolis christian recommended that ab repeat third grade,db withdrew her son from that school and enrolled him in the fourth grade in aacps at millersville elementary school for the school year.before the school year started,db requested that aacps identify ab education needs and determine whether he had a disability that would qualify him for special education.aacps held an iep meeting on september.based on the information presented at the meeting,aacps recommended that ab receive further evaluations to be completed by november.
on october,aacps school psychologist sabbino strippoli strippoli administered the oral and written language scales owls to ab,and he found all of ab scores were within the average range.on october,the iep team held another meeting and determined that ab did not have a learning disability.on october,db requested a due process hearing on ab eligibility for special education services.that hearing was scheduled for december.
on november,the iep team held another meeting and concluded that the student did not have a special education disability.at the meeting,the iep team concluded that ab was making solid progress in school,noting satisfactory grades and favorable comments by ab classroom teacher.db,however,contended that ab would be better off if he was identified as having a learning disability,because she asserted her son was performing at a level below his potential as evidenced by his high kki ability scores.db further cited the kki report as determinative evidence of a learning disability.
on november,db counsel requested that the due process hearing be postponed so she could obtain an independent evaluation for ab.on november,aacps opposed the request for postponement.on the same day,db attorney withdrew ab petition for a due process hearing.
on january and,sue antell conducted the independent evaluation.antell concluded that ab was a child of superior intellectual abilities with problems in complex language formulation giving rise to a disorder of written expression,reading disabilities with problems in both vocabulary and comprehension.after aacps belatedly received ab scores on the tests conducted by antell,aacps offered to hold an iep meeting on march or march.db found those dates inconvenient,thus the meeting was delayed 
on march,the iep team reconvened and identified ab as having a special education disability.the team stated,however,that they had 
some reservations regarding an adverse impact on this student educational performance to the extent that special education services are warranted.this student is displaying satisfactory achievement based on the report card,work samples and classroom performance.db representatives do not agree that there is a lack of impact on his educational performance and believe that he needs intensive educational services 
on april,strippoli prepared a report regarding the iep team interpretation of the various assessment results.an iep meeting originally scheduled for april,was again delayed to accommodate db expert antell.at the rescheduled may meeting,the team presented the draft iep,and the parties agreed to reconvene on may,to give db time to review the draft.the draft iep found ab had a disability limited to the area of written expression.
on may,antell sent aacps counsel a letter stating that the proposed iep was unacceptable.she concluded that a mainstream public school education would not provide ab proper flexibility,but also that ab superior intelligence render sic it inappropriate to place him in a public school special class for children with far more severe and persuasive disabilities.again,the only available option appears to be placement in a specialized private school for intelligent children with significant learning disabilities,such as summit school.emphasis added.at the may iep meeting,at db insistence supported by antell and the kki evaluation,the iep team agreed to further consider whether ab was also learning disabled in reading.db,however,denied aacps request to conduct testing on an expedited basis because she contended the assessments already provided a basis for the diagnosis.
on june,db filed another request for a due process hearing,arguing that ab should be coded learning disabled in reading.after aacps moved to dismiss the hearing request as premature,db counsel withdrew her request for a hearing on july.on or around july,db granted consent to conduct additional testing.
on august,aacps administered the lindamood auditory conceptualization lac test to ab.the test showed that ab could read and spell at approximately the third grade level and his phonemic ability was not fully developed.on august,db notified aacps that she would be placing ab in the summit school for the school year at aacps expense.on august,aacps administered the wechsler individual achievement test to ab.that test found reading difficulties ab scored approximately two years below his grade level on each of the tests.
ab enrolled in and attended the summit school for the school year.on august,counsel for aacps notified db counsel that an iep meeting was scheduled for september,however,at db request the meeting was pushed back one month to accommodate antell.at the october meeting,the iep team defined ab as having a learning disability in the area of reading in addition to the already identified disability in written expression.aacps presented an iep plan whereby ab would attend hours of general integrated education per week and various forms of special education each day,amounting to hours of special education each week.db requested time to review the iep.on october,antell wrote aacps again,contesting the iep sufficiency and requesting that it provide ab with among other things books on tape,a reader,a note taker,extra time for math assignments,oral presentations of math lessons,a dictation system or similar apparatus and other accommodations.
again,per db request,the iep meeting was scheduled for november.at the november iep meeting,the team considered antell letter as well as a pathology evaluation from april,which db presented for the first time.db additionally requested that ab be placed in a special education program.the iep team agreed to review the april evaluation and discuss it at a meeting.
on february,db proposed that an iep meeting be held on march,and she stated that joan mccarthy of the summit school would attend.at the march,meeting,the iep team submitted a revised iep which called for hours of special education.db again declined to accept the iep because it did not entail special education.dissatisfied with aacps proposal,db left ab enrolled at the summit school and pursued her challenge to the proposed iep through a due process hearing.
on may and june,an alj conducted the due process hearing at aacps offices in annapolis to consider whether the iep offered by aacps for the and school years was reasonably calculated to provide a fape and if not,whether db should be reimbursed for the cost of the summit school.at the hearing,the alj admitted exhibits and heard testimony from eight witnesses.
on july,the alj issued an order holding that both ieps were reasonably calculated to offer a fape and denying db request for reimbursement.in issuing its order,the alj considered the parties joint stipulated findings of fact,as presented at the hearing,and made numerous additional findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence.the alj first dismissed db claim that her son had been improperly evaluated and coded by aacps,stating there was no evidence presented at the hearing to show that the evaluation process was flawed,that the parent was not provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate,or that any factors or considerations presented by the parent were not duly considered during the process.alj op.at.
db claim rested on her assumption that aacps should have immediately coded her son as learning disabled based on the kki evaluation.indeed,the alj considered db claim that the lengthy evaluation process impacted her child academic progress,and found the measures taken by aacps to diagnose the child were proper,albeit lengthy.alj op.at.the alj held that aacps was not required to rely on the kki report,noting that the responsibility to determine whether a student is eligible for special education is the responsibility of the iep team.alj op.at.
the alj concluded that the iep was reasonably calculated to provide ab educational benefit,citing idea mandate that to the maximum extent appropriate,children with disabilities be educated with children who are not disabled.alj op.at.in holding that the proposed iep offered a fape,the alj credited the testimony of aacps experts,finding that the child did not require special education and that the proposed iep offered the least restrictive means of conferring educational benefit to the child.the judge cited aacps expert testimony,which she credited,finding that the summit school program was overly restrictive.alj op.at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the alj rejected the views of db and her experts,who had maintained that ab required an entire school day with special educational services.in so holding,she rejected db contention that the child must be placed in a private school that serves only students with learning disabilities.
in supporting her holding that the iep offered a fape,the alj noted her reliance on testimony from millersville personnel as well as evidence of ab educational progress as measured by his report card and teacher comments.alj op.at.in reviewing such data,the alj noted that ab reading ability increased nearly two grade levels while attending millersville despite the fact that he was not receiving special education.see alj opinion at.on the basis of such evidence,the alj concluded there is no indication that the child needs can not be met at millersville elementary school.alj op.at.the alj concluded that under idea,t he issue is not whether the summit school is better,or even appropriate,but whether aacps has offered an appropriate program for the child at millersville elementary.alj op.at.in denying db claim,the alj acknowledged that while she appreciated db concern that given ab high iq,he should have performed at a greater academic level at millersville and in contrast was thriving at the summit school,alj op.at,idea does not require a program that would maximize a student s potential,but instead simply a program that is appropriate,id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
on january,db filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maryland,appealing the alj decision and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to idea,et,the rehabilitation act,and.after for summary judgment,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment for the bs,holding that aacps ieps did not offer a fape.the court further ordered that aacps reimburse db for the costs of summit school for the and school years,holding that the summit school provided the least restrictive means of providing a fape.
ordinarily,we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards employed by the district court.search,llc,cir citations omitted.in the idea context,as we explained in mm,at,we are obliged to conduct a modified de novo review,giving due weight to the underlying administrative proceedings citations omitted.additionally,w hether a district court has accorded due weight to the administrative proceedings is a question of at least a mixed question of law and be reviewed de novo by an appellate court.id.at.further,administrative findings in an idea case are entitled to prima facie correctness,and the district court,if it is not going to follow them is required to explain why it does not.doyle arlington county sch,cir.indeed,we need not defer to factual recitations made by a district court from the administrative record,because that court stands in no better position than we do in reviewing the record.id.
finally,the court role in reviewing the administrative proceeding concerning idea is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities they review.rowley,at.accord hartmann,at.the supreme court has directed that courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the states.rowley,at.
on appeal,aacps argues that the district court erred in finding a violation of idea.aacps contends that,as the alj held,the iep for the and school years was reasonably calculated to offer a fape and it was the least restrictive environment for the child.we consider these arguments in turn.overarching all of appellants arguments is their contention that the district court erred in failing to accord the alj findings proper deference.see generally appellants br.at.appellees counter that the district court properly deviated from the alj findings of fact and made factual findings and legal conclusions de novo,with explicit reasons therefore.appellees br.at.they argue that aacps proposed ieps did not offer ab a fape.appellees further contend that the iep was not the least restrictive environment,outward appearances ab did not make progress in the general education setting.id.at.
we find appellees arguments wholly unconvincing.the district court ignored the principles animating idea and wrongfully dismissed the alj findings of fact.the district court substituted its own views on educational those of db and her the determinations of the local education officials charged with formulating an iep.accordingly,we reverse the district court and hold that the alj correctly recognized that aacps offered ab an iep that was reasonably calculated to provide him some educational benefit,thus providing a fape and satisfying idea modest requirements.see rowley,at.mm,at.
in tice botetourt county sch,cir,we held that once a procedurally proper iep has been formulated,a reviewing court should be reluctant indeed to second guess the judgment of education professionals.neither the district court nor this court should disturb an iep simply because we disagree with its content w e wholeheartedly agree that once education authorities have made a professional judgment about the substantive content of a child iep,that judgment must be respected.id.at internal citations omitted the alj recognized that the iep team determinations concerning ab eligibility for special education services were,by law,solely the responsibility of the iep team.alj op.at citing a.tit.additional citation omitted.as such,the alj found the team crafted an iep reasonably calculated to provide ab with some educational benefit and that aacps officials made professional judgments in accord with federal and maryland regulations.the alj correctly noted that the aacps iep team considered a litany of factors concerning ab educational background,and proposed an iep that focused on the child difficulties in reading and writing,providing him with individualized services to improve in those areas.further,the alj found that the proposed ieps reflected the studied determinations of aacps experts that the child did not require intensive special education in a segregated classroom.finally,the alj correctly and explicitly held that under idea,the aacps iep team was not required to rely on the kki report and complied with state and federal law.alj op.at 
db has nonetheless continuously maintained that the proposed ieps did not offer a fape because ab did not make progress in the general educational setting.db and her experts assert that ab would regress in general education,and that he required special education services.undergirding all of db arguments are her claims that because ab,a child of iq,was not fulfilling his potential within a general education,in contrast,allegedly was thriving and getting the help he needs at the summit was not in compliance with idea.although,as discussed above,nowhere does idea require that a school system maximize a student potential,rowley,at,the district court ignored the findings of the alj and adopted db contrary reading of the statute.
whereas the alj found that the iep was formulated to meet ab educational needs and a general education setting was appropriate because,in part,the child made educational progress during the academic year he spent at millersville,albeit not as great as the parent had hoped for,alj op.at,the district court consistently reached diametrically opposing conclusions,see,dist.op.at ab require s placement in special education services in order to make educational progress and to obtain some benefit id.at ab would have regressed rather than progressed were aacps proposed iep to have been implemented.
appellees contend,however,that the district court properly discarded the alj factual findings in reversing the administrative body.however,we find the district court repudiated the findings of the alj and discarded the expertise of the iep team without reason or explanation.instead,the district court simply adopted the worldview of db experts and their perspectives on proper educational policy.nowhere did the district court try to square its findings with those of the alj,although in this circuit the determination of whether an iep is appropriate is a question of fact.see dibuo bd.of ed.of worcester county,cir doyle,at.nor did the district court explain how it,despite the fact that it was reviewing a cold record,reached a conclusion completely contrary to that of the alj,who conducted the proceedings.see doyle,at noting that the district court if it is not going to follow the alj findings of fact,is required to explain why it does not.rather than providing the required explanations,the district court substituted its own credibility assessments for those of the alj,stating only that it found the testimony provided by aacps to have been externally and internally inconsistent,generally garbled and aimed primarily at.the testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs,in contrast,was clear and consistent t he court finds wholly competent the assessments from the plaintiffs witnesses and incompetent the assessment from aacps.dist.op.at 
in doing so,the district court disregarded the alj resolution of conflicting expert testimony.the alj carefully considered the views of db experts antell and mccarthy,implicitly finding them unconvincing while crediting the contrary views of aacps experts despite the alj findings,the district court opinion rests almost entirely upon a voluminous discussion of antell and mccarthy testimony.see dist.op.at.the district court thus reached factual conclusions entirely irreconcilable with those of the alj,c hildren with superior intelligence and learning disorders require special treatment in a special classroom setting additional testing that was performed by aacps was unnecessary what ab needed could not be done at this point in an inclusion classroom or general ed classroom ab not only could not succeed but would degenerate in a general education setting an appropriate iep could not be implemented at millersville because the school did not have the ability to integrate all of the goals in every classroom,in every subject,with every teacher.the district court fully adopted mccarthy testimony that placement at summit was absolutely the least restrictive environment in which ab could learn and reiterated that placing ab in a general education setting was not appropriate although that assessment was flatly contradicted by aacps experts which the alj credited.dist.op.at.
in its sweeping dismissal of the alj little explanation other than that on the basis of a cold record it found their experts generally garbled and aimed primarily at the district court wholly disregarded idea mandate that it leave the substance and the details of the proper education for a disabled child to state and local officials.barnett fairfax county sch,cir.the alj correctly recognized that while aacps and db experts disagreed,idea requires great deference to the views of the school system rather than those of even the most parent.however,the district court failed to apply the proper standard of review to the alj findings and incorrectly applied idea fape standard.
first,the district court did not apply the proper standard in determining whether the iep at millersville would provide an educational benefit,rather it essentially assessed whether the iep would replicate the benefit to ab of the summit school program,which the district court found successful for him.g ex rel.ssgt rg bragg dependent,amended on reh g,cir.the district court ignored the fact that the alj found that ab was obtaining some educational benefit at aacps even when he was receiving no special education.see alj op.at noting ab reading level had increased nearly two grade levels while at millersville id.at the child made educational progress during the academic year he spent at millersville,albeit not as great as the parent had hoped for yet the district court did not even bother to refer to the alj findings that ab made progress at millersville,rather the magistrate judge simply to the findings of fact and weight of the.mccarthy testimony that ab would degenerate in a general educational setting.dist.op.at see also id.at the court is convinced that the final iep offered by aacps for ab was not designed to confer some educational benefit upon him and,in fact,that ab would have regressed rather than progressed were such a program to have been implemented.
the district court not only evaded the alj findings without explanation,but it also credited the testimony of mccarthy though it was riddled with internal inconsistencies.specifically,the magistrate judge chose to ignore that mccarthy acknowledged that ab had at minimum a satisfactory year academically at millersville.indeed,that admission completely refutes the district court favored reading of mccarthy testimony,and wholly supports the alj finding that aacps offered a fape.
appellees,however,have contended in their briefs and at oral argument that the district court gave proper deference to the alj findings because the court turn stemmed from unsupported weight afforded to evidence rather than on the credibility of witnesses.appellees br.at.appellees arguments indicate that they simply do not understand the role of the fact finder.for they state the alj failure to consider significant parts of testimony and exhibits is doubly of concern for example,the administrative decision literally only mentions antell in passing,though the district court opinion chiefly relies upon this expert testimony,and quotes her opinions in unabridged detail.appellees br.at emphasis added.appellees appear oblivious that this is precisely the role of a fact finder.the alj heard extensive testimony from antell and mccarthy who claimed the iep did not offer a fape,yet in holding that aacps provided a fape and resting its opinion on an entirely contrary body of expert testimony,the alj obviously found the testimony of appellees experts unpersuasive.in essence,appellees argument is reducible to the sour grapes claim that the alj was simply wrong in failing to rely on the testimony of antell and mccarthy.accordingly,that argument merely illustrates just how far the district court had to deviate from the alj findings to reach its result 
in chiefly relying on antell testimony,the district court adopted db preferred reading of what idea requires.db and her experts testified before the alj they believed the summit school environment was ideal ab was thriving and getting the help he needs there and given his high iq,he should be performing at a much greater academic level than he has done in the past.alj op.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,as the alj recognized,but the district court ignored,this is not what idea requires.indeed,t he issue is not whether the summit school is better,or even appropriate,but whether aacps has offered an appropriate program for the child at millersville elementary.alj op.at.as discussed above,idea fape standards are far more modest than to require that a child excel or thrive.the requirement is satisfied when the state provides the disabled child with personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from the instruction.rowley,at.a
