educational credit management corporation educational credit appeals from the district court decision affirming the bankruptcy court order discharging keldric dante mosley student loan debt on the basis of undue hardship.we affirm.
mosley incurred several student loans while attending alcorn state university,where he majored in history,between and.at alcorn state,mosley joined the army reserve officers training corps.during his training in the summer of,mosley hip and back were injured when he fell from a tank.medical problems associated with his injury ultimately led him to resign his commission.
in the spring of,mosley left alcorn state because it was not offering a class he needed to graduate and because he believed his mother health was deteriorating.he lived with his mother in atlanta,georgia,from to.during this time,mosley had brief stints at several jobs,including jobs at bruno supermarket,united parcel service,city sanitation,and a moving company.he attempted to attend heavy equipment school to learn a trade,but he was unable to complete the training or keep any of his jobs because he was depressed,drank heavily,and experienced physical limitations from his injury.mosley also attempted to go back to school but could not obtain financial aid because of the debts he had incurred to attend alcorn state.he filed for chapter bankruptcy pro se in december of and obtained a discharge the discharge did not include his student loans.
in,mosley mother committed him to georgia regional hospital,a mental health facility,where he stayed for approximately one to two weeks and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression.after his release,mosley sought treatment for depression and chronic back pain at the department of veterans affairs.veterans affairs placed him on prescription medication for depression,anxiety,back pain and swelling,and high blood pressure,which he continues to take but which makes him unable to function.
mosley is registered with the georgia department of labor and has sought work through the labor pool since with little success.he worked at an airport for a short time but was unable to meet the physical demands of the job because his medication made him groggy and he can not do heavy lifting.his monthly income consists primarily of disability benefits of from the veterans administration,and he relies on food stamps to survive.mosley has been homeless since and frequently sleeps at his aunt house.he has no car.
mosley student loans total approximately and have been in default since.he has not made any payments since then and,in,filed a pro se motion to reopen his bankruptcy case and cease collection activities.the bankruptcy court granted the motion,and mosley filed an adversary proceeding against usa funds,the loan holder at the time,seeking discharge of his student loans on the basis of undue hardship.mosley loans were transferred to educational credit,which accepts title to certain federal student loan accounts on which the borrower has filed bankruptcy,and educational credit intervened and replaced usa funds in the action.
proceeding pro se,mosley was the sole witness and testified before the bankruptcy court about his medical problems,work history,and living situation.he introduced social security and medicare earnings statements showing that his annual taxable earnings between and have never exceeded and have been as low as.the court also admitted a letter from an emory university professor,angel iglesias,on veterans affairs letterhead stating that mosley had been diagnosed with hypertension,depression,anxiety,and lower back pain but that did not show significant pathology.educational credit objected to several other doctors letters that mosley attempted to introduce,and the bankruptcy court reluctantly excluded them because they had not been properly authenticated.the bankruptcy court granted the discharge of mosley student loans even without these letters,however,reasoning that mosley testimony that he was in a vicious cycle of illness and homelessness that prevented him from working was credible and demonstrated that repayment would be an undue hardship.the bankruptcy court initially issued these findings orally and entered a short written order granting the discharge about a month after the hearing,it issued and published a supplemental order restating its findings and rationale and citing the relevant case law.in re mosley.
educational credit appealed to the district court,arguing that mosley failed to meet his burden because he failed to produce medical evidence to corroborate his testimony that his disabilities would prevent him from repaying his loans.it also moved to strike the supplemental order the bankruptcy court issued for publication after the appeal was filed.the district court denied the motion to strike,reasoning that the supplemental order did not alter any of the findings of fact or conclusions of law the bankruptcy court had reached orally in granting mosley discharge,but only elaborated on its rationale,and thus was not prejudicial to educational credit.the district court affirmed the discharge,summarily approving of the reasoning set forth in the bankruptcy court supplemental order and concluding that mosley produced sufficient evidence of his likely inability to repay the loans.educational credit appealed to this court,arguing that mosley failed to meet his burden of proof and that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter the supplemental order.
in this appeal from the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order,we review the bankruptcy court decision.see educ.credit mgmt.frushour in re frushour,cir.educational credit challenges the bankruptcy court conclusion that repayment of the student loans would impose an undue hardship on mosley,which is a mixed question of law and fact.id.we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see hemar ins.of am.cox in re cox,cir.
the bankruptcy code provides that student loans generally are not to be discharged.a.a narrow exception is made,however,where excepting such debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.id.the bankruptcy code does not define undue hardship,but this circuit has joined several others in adopting the standard set forth in brunner new york state higher education services,cir.see in re cox,at.to establish undue hardship,the brunner standard requires the debtor to prove by a preponderance of the evidence 
that the debtor can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.
brunner,at.
educational credit does not contest that mosley has satisfied the first requirement,an inability to maintain a minimal standard of living,as he lives below the poverty line and has for several years.it contends that the bankruptcy court improperly relaxed mosley evidentiary burden on the second and third requirements in light of his status as an impoverished pro se litigant.the bankruptcy court concluded that mosley established undue hardship with his credible testimony that he has tried to obtain work but,for ten years,his substantial physical and emotional ailments have prevented him from holding a steady job.while the letter from iglesias corroborates mosley testimony that he has been diagnosed with several illnesses,the court conclusion that those illnesses are likely to impair mosley ability to repay his loans was based on mosley testimony.citing several bankruptcy court cases and two courts of appeals cases,educational credit argues that corroborating medical evidence independent from the debtor testimony is required to make the second brunner showing where medical disabilities are the additional circumstances that make it unlikely the debtor will be able to repay his loans.
