background 
appellee trudi lytle is a teacher at marion earl elementary school marion earl in the clark county school district in nevada.in,lytle sent a letter to her state senators in which she criticized a new program being implemented in the district.the district then sought to transfer her to another elementary school.when lytle refused to agree to the transfer,the district fired her.lytle filed suit under,claiming that the district had violated her first amendment right to free speech by retaliating against her for criticizing the district program.a jury awarded lytle in damages,and she was reinstated at marion earl in the fall of by court order.
in october,lytle brought this suit under,alleging that the district and several administrators retaliated against her upon her return to marion earl,in violation of her first amendment rights to free speech and access to the courts.in her complaint,she named as defendants the district and several administrators,including superintendent brian cram,assistant superintendent edward goldman,area superintendents eva simmons and kay carl,and marion earl principal robert wondrash.the defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted with respect to the free speech claim,but denied with respect to the claim of access to the courts.the court further granted summary judgment to cram and carl as individuals based on qualified immunity,but denied summary judgment to the remaining individual defendants and the district.in an earlier appeal,we held that the remaining individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,but allowed proceedings against the district to continue.lytle wondrash,cir.
after remand,lytle went to trial against the district.at the close of lytle,the district moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.the district contended that the board of trustees board was the only authorized policymaker,and that since lytle had not shown any retaliatory action taken by the board,there was no basis for district liability.the district court disagreed,concluding that superintendent cram and assistant superintendent goldman had final policymaking authority.it therefore denied the motion.the jury ultimately found for lytle,awarding her in damages.the district filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial under rule b.the district court denied this motion as well,reaffirming its earlier conclusion that cram and goldman were final policymakers and concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion by the jury that the district had violated lytle first amendment right of access to the courts.
after entry of judgment,lytle moved for attorneys fees of.the district court reduced the hourly rate of three of the attorneys for whom fees were sought,deducted hours for duplicative and insufficiently documented work,and reduced the overall figure based on its conclusion that lytle had not achieved an excellent result in the litigation.after reductions,the district court awarded lytle in attorneys fees.
the district appeals the denial of its motion for a judgment as a matter of law and the attorneys fees award.lytle the fee award.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court in all respects.
ii.standards of review 
we review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.sanghvi city of claremont,cir.w hether a particular official has final policymaking authority is a question of state law.t he identification of those officials whose decisions represent the official policy of the local government unit is itself a legal question to be resolved by the trial judge before the case is submitted to the jury.jett dallas indep.sch,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also christie iopa,cir.once those officials who have the power to make official policy on a particular issue have been identified,it is for the jury to determine whether their decisions have caused the deprivation of rights at issue jett,at.when we review the decision of a jury,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party.we then determine if there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the nonmoving party.see.a howard everex,cir.we will not disturb a jury verdict if it is supported by substantial evidence.gillette delmore,cir.
we review a district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.webb sloan,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it applies an inaccurate statement of the law,or if it bases its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.barjon dalton,cir.
iii.the district liability under 
in monell department of social services of new york,d,the supreme court held that the word person in includes municipalities and other local governing bodies such as school districts.a school district liability under monell may be premised on any of three theories that a district employee was acting pursuant to an expressly adopted official policy that a district employee was acting pursuant to a longstanding practice or custom or that a district employee was acting as a final policymaker.webb,at.there is no allegation in this case that a district employee was acting pursuant to an express official policy or a longstanding practice or custom.rather,district liability is based on the conclusion that a district employee,assistant superintendent goldman,was acting as a final policymaker and violated lytle first amendment right of access to the courts by retaliating against her and by ratifying retaliatory acts.see rendish city of tacoma,cir describing claim of retaliation for exercising first amendment right of access to the courts.
final policymaker 
to determine whether a school district employee is a final policymaker,we look first to state law.jett,at.a municipal employee may act as a de facto policymaker under without explicit authority under state law,but we are ordinarily not justified in assuming that municipal policymaking authority lies somewhere else than where the applicable law purports to put it.city of louis praprotnik,d.depending on the circumstances,however,we may also look to the way a local government entity operates in practice.jett,at.trial judge must identify official policymakers based on state and local positive law,as well as custom or usage having the force of law citation and quotation marks omitted.while a uthority to make municipal policy may be granted directly by a legislative enactment,it may also be delegated by an official who possesses such authority.pembaur cincinnati,d.
for purposes of monell liability,the term policy includes within its definition not only policy in the ordinary sense of a rule or practice applicable in many situations.it also includes a course of action tailored to a particular situation and not intended to control decisions in later situations.pembaur,at.emphasis added.when determining whether an individual has final policymaking authority,we ask whether he or she has authority in a particular area,or on a particular issue.mcmillian monroe county,d emphasis added.for a person to be a final policymaker,he or she must be in a position of authority such that a final decision by that person may appropriately be attributed to the district.for example,in jett,the plaintiff contended that he was transferred because of his race.in determining whether a school district superintendent was a final policymaker,the court focused on the question of whether the superintendent possessed final policymaking authority in the area of employee transfers.at.see also mcmillian,at.discussing jett.it does not matter that the final policymaker may have subjected only one person to only one unconstitutional action.as we wrote in christie,a municipality can be liable for an isolated constitutional violation when the person causing the violation has final policymaking authority.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.see also webb,at holding that nevada deputy district attorneys were final policymakers where an individual plaintiff contended that criminal charges against him should have been dismissed when any deputy in the office could have made the decision to dismiss the charges against the plaintiff without consulting any supervisor.
in this case,the relevant area of policymaking is decisions,particularly employee discipline.we must determine who,under state law,had final policymaking authority with respect to disciplinary decisions for district employees.nevada law designates the board of trustees for a school district as the body responsible for setting all district policies 
each board of trustees is hereby given such reasonable and necessary powers,not conflicting with the constitution and the laws of the state of nevada,as may be requisite to attain the ends for which the public schools,excluding charter schools,are established and to promote the welfare of school children,including the establishment and operation of schools and classes deemed necessary and desirable.
the board of trustees has the authority,as reasonable and necessary,to delegate its statutory grant of authority to a delegatee of its choice.see also.granting power to the board to prescribe or enforce rules,not inconsistent with the law or rules prescribed by the state board,for its own government and the government of public schools under its charge.
the board of trustees for the clark county school district,acting under,delegated to the superintendent of schools all powers necessary and proper for the operation of the district which are not inconsistent with law or reserved to the board by statute,policy,regulation,or contract.see district regulation.the board of trustees has also delegated to the superintendent the authority to subdelegate to district administrators the superintendent may,for good reason,designate and delegate such authority for the operation of the district to a certified administrator employed by the district.id.the delegation by the board under and regulation of all power necessary and proper for the operation of the district clearly includes delegation of disciplinary decisions.
the board of trustees explicitly delegated full authority over employee discipline to the superintendent and his delegatee.district policy provides,the board of school trustees does not have the authority to discipline employees.discipline is a right reserved to the superintendent and other administrators in accordance with the applicable negotiated agreements,laws,board policies,and regulations.assistant superintendent goldman formal job description stated that he was the responsible line administrator for contract management as well as the district officer responsible for conducting grievance and conflict resolution.goldman testified at trial that he was the assistant superintendent for administrative operations and staff relations my responsibilities were contract management and employment management relations he also testified that only a neutral arbitrator could reverse his sick leave decisions.
on october,shortly after the beginning of the school year,goldman sent a memorandum to wondrash,the principal of marion earl,instructing that all disciplinary actions relating to lytle including any documents that she is given are to be submitted to my office for review.superintendent cram was asked at trial whether that memorandum suggest s to you that goldman is making it clear that all disciplinary actions relating to lytle,including all documents that she is given,were to be submitted to his office or reviewed prior to either the action taking place or the document being given to her cram responded that is correct.
the district argues that the only policymaker was the board.it contends that the delegation to cram and goldman by the board was not delegation of final policymaking authority because the delegation was subject to constraints.see christie,at to determine whether an official is a final policymaker,courts consider whether the official discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that official making and whether the official decisions are subject to review by the municipality authorized policymakers.quoting praprotnik,at.the district contends that constraints operated equally on cram and goldman to prevent either of them from being final policymakers.it does not contend that the delegation of policymaking authority from superintendent cram to goldman was incomplete.
to support its argument,the district points to district regulation,under which the board delegated all necessary and proper powers not inconsistent with law or reserved to the board by statute,policy,regulation or contract.to the extent that the district argument rests on the proposition that this delegation from the board was incomplete because it required that cram and goldman follow the law,the argument is unpersuasive.under this argument,if a superintendent is instructed in general terms to follow the law,and if that superintendent then violates the law,he or she would be exceeding his delegated authority and would therefore not be a final policymaker.if that superintendent is not a final policymaker,the district is not liable.this argument proves too much,for the very premise of school district liability for the acts of a final policymaker is that the policymaker violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff.a general statement by a school board or board of trustees that a superintendent is not authorized to violate the law,without more,can not be enough to insulate the school district from liability.see id.
the core of the district argument is narrower and more plausible.the district argues that cram and goldman were not final policymakers because their decisions could be reviewed by the board for consistency with district policy and rules,or by an arbitrator under the grievance process established by the collective bargaining agreement between the teacher union and the district.
the problem with the first part of the district decisions were reviewable by the that the record indicates otherwise.the record reflects that the board did not review discipline of individual employees such as lytle,and did not retain the authority to review such discipline.indeed,the board had actively renounced its authority over employee discipline.district policy,quoted above,states explicitly,the board of school trustees does not have the authority to discipline employees.it continues if allegations of misconduct concerning a district employee are brought to the attention of the board,they will be referred to the appropriate administrator for investigation and action,if necessary.it is clear that the appropriate administrator was goldman.that goldman disciplinary decisions were not subject to review by anyone within the district indicates that he was a final policymaker.see christie,at courts consider whether the official discretionary decision is constrained by policies not of that official making and subject to review by the municipality authorized policymakers
