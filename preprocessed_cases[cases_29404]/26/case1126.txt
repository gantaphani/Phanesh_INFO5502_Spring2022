ii.background 
deschenie was the director of indian education and bilingual education for ccsd from august through june.from june through november,she was the bilingual education coordinator.ccsd is a school district located mostly within the navajo indian reservation in san juan county,new mexico,and of its students are navajo.the curriculum of ccsd includes a bilingual education program funded by the state.
on august,randy manning,the president of the school board,spoke at a ccsd administrator retreat.during this speech,manning referred to the bilingual education program as a sacred cow which needed to be looked at critically,and he discussed the possibility of changes to the program for children in kindergarten through third grade.deschenie was present at this meeting and interpreted these statements as indicating an intent to eliminate the bilingual education program.following the meeting,she and two other ccsd employees spoke to manning and expressed disagreement with his proposals.
subsequently,on august,deschenie wrote a letter to manning which she sent by email in this letter,she expressed concerns with the current state of the bilingual education program and gave suggestions on how to improve the alleged deficiencies.among other things,her concerns included the lack of access to the programs for many students,the inadequate number of staff,the inadequate salaries for staff,and the high level of staff turnover.she also informed manning that,as a whole,ccsd was not complying with the state bilingual program requirements of minutes of daily instruction.
on october,deschenie attended an indian education committee meeting in her capacity as a school administrator.at this meeting,manning spoke in an effort to clarify his position on bilingual education.he explained that although he had concerns with the bilingual education program,he did not intend to eliminate the program.deschenie also spoke at this meeting and repeated her concerns that the program was not complying with state standards and was not adequately supported within ccsd.
following the october meeting,the issue began attracting publicity and public controversy.deschenie wrote a guest column for the local newspaper on december,in which she again expressed the importance of the bilingual education program and the need for increased support from the administration and the community.this guest column identified deschenie as the director of bilingual and indian education for ccsd and was approved in advance by the superintendent,linda besett.
four months later,in response to an editorial praising native american education in the schools,deschenie wrote a note to the editor of the local paper which had published the editorial.in this note,deschenie stated teaching navajo language and culture was a lonely battle when the knock the job.although deschenie did not intend for this email to be published,it was published as a letter to the editor on april without prior district approval on may,at a school board meeting,members of the school board criticized deschenie for publishing the letter to the editor.
in the meantime,there is evidence deschenie job performance began to decline.on may,besett received an email from the new mexico state department of education that explained bilingual education funding applications,due on april,had not yet been received.it was deschenie responsibility to ensure these applications were submitted on time.shortly thereafter,on may,besett proposed dividing deschenie position into two separate positions an indian education coordinator and a bilingual education coordinator.under this proposal,deschenie responsibilities were split and she became the bilingual education coordinator.besett also placed deschenie on a growth plan that identified deschenie unsatisfactory performance in managing resources,working productively with others,and adhering to established timelines and procedures.
throughout the summer,there were numerous other problems relating to deschenie work performance.these included the rejection of the bilingual education applications on two occasions,the failure to assist in submitting the indian education funding applications and the failure to attend a meeting she had scheduled to discuss the bilingual funding applications with principals.deschenie disputes whether these problems can be attributed to her job performance.specifically,she argues the bilingual education applications were rejected primarily due to the program inadequate staffing,an issue out of her control.
on september,besett gave deschenie an additional set of tasks to complete as soon as possible and instructed her to compile a list of students in the bilingual program by october.deschenie did not meet this deadline and provided incomplete data when she submitted the information three days late.deschenie argues the volume of tasks given her was unrealistic and was intended to cause her to fail.after a few more meetings between deschenie and besett,in which the two discussed deschenie job performance,besett notified deschenie of her termination on november.
deschenie and three other plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico pursuant to,alleging the school board,manning,besett,and other individual defendants had unlawfully retaliated against them for exercising their first amendment rights.the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to deschenie arguing deschenie speech was not protected as a matter of law if the speech was protected,the pickering balancing test weighed in favor of the defendants the only adverse employment action was the termination and the speech was not a motivating factor for any action taken by the defendants.the district court granted the motion.in doing so,it concluded three instances of speech were unprotected as a matter of law,and it found no genuine issue whether the protected speech was a substantial motivating factor in any adverse employment action.
iii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,using the same legal standard applicable in the district court.baca sklar,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,this court views all evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.baca,at.mere allegations,however,are insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment.id.in cases involving the first amendment,an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.barker city of del city,cir quotation omitted.
it is that a public employee does not waive all her first amendment rights by accepting public employment.garcetti ceballos,d.the supreme court has also long recognized,however,that the government interest in regulating the speech of its employees differs significantly from its interest in regulating the speech of the public in general.pickering bd.of,d.in determining whether a public employer impermissibly retaliated against a public employee in violation of her first amendment rights,this court applies the test derived from pickering and connick myers,d.dill city of edmond,cir.
first,this court must determine whether the employee speech involves a matter of public concern.id.second,if this threshold requirement is satisfied,this court then balances the employee interest in commenting upon matters of public concern against the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.quotation omitted.third,if the employee interest outweighs that of the government,the employee then must show that the speech was a substantial factor or a motivating factor in the detrimental employment decision.id.at quotation omitted.fourth,if the employee shows the protected speech was a substantial factor,the burden shifts to the employer to show it would have taken the same action against the employee even in the absence of the protected speech.id.at.the first two steps of this analysis are questions of law to be resolved by the court,while the third and fourth steps are questions of fact for the jury.gardetto mason,cir.
in this appeal,deschenie argues summary judgment was inappropriate because her speech was protected as a matter of law and because she has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the speech was a substantial factor in the subsequent adverse employment decisions.to evaluate her claim,this court must first identify the speech which resulted in the alleged retaliation.hulen yates,cir.the district court in this case identified five specific instances of speech,and only these five instances of speech have been addressed by deschenie on appeal these alleged instances of protected speech include the oral comments made to manning on august,the email sent to manning on august,the statements made at the indian education committee meeting on october,the guest column published on december,and the letter to the editor published on april.
first four instances of speech 
in its order granting summary judgment,the district court determined the first two instances of deschenie speech were unprotected as a matter of law and the next two instances were not substantial factors in any adverse employment action taken by the school board.with respect to the first four instances of speech,this court need not decide whether the first two prongs of the pickering analysis are satisfied because deschenie has presented insufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the third prong.thus,this court may assume,without deciding,the first two prongs are satisfied.
the third step in a claim of first amendment retaliation requires the employee to show the exercise of constitutionally protected speech was a substantial motivating factor in the employer decision to adversely alter the employee conditions of employment.maestas segura,cir.to meet this burden,the employee need not prove that his speech was the sole reason for the defendants action,but need only show the speech played a substantial part in the adverse employment action.copp unified sch.dist,cir.in the context of a summary judgment motion,the employee must establish genuine issues of material fact as to whether his protected speech substantially motivated the adverse employment actions.baca,at.
the parties first dispute which actions taken by the board constitute adverse employment actions for purposes of deschenie first amendment retaliation claim.the district court determined only the position reclassification and the termination constituted sufficiently adverse actions.on appeal,deschenie urges this court to recognize the may reprimand,in addition to the position reclassification and the termination on the other hand,the school board contends only the termination may be considered an adverse employment action.because this court concludes there is no link between the first four instances of speech and any of these actions,it is unnecessary to decide this issue for purposes of deschenie claim.
to prevail on her appeal as to the termination,deschenie must present sufficient evidence linking her termination to any of these four instances of speech.maestas,at.in support of her position,deschenie relies mostly on circumstantial evidence,including her ongoing criticism of the school board and the board opposition and hostility toward her speech.as evidence of this hostility,she offers written correspondence by besett to the state superintendent,in which besett appears to blame the public criticism of the administration on deschenie.in addition,deschenie attempts to cast doubt on the stated reasons for her termination.deschenie contends she was given an unrealistic workload in the summer of in an effort to produce a paper trail sufficient to fire her.she also argues the rejection of the bilingual funding applications was not her fault,but rather a direct consequence of the inadequacies of the bilingual program she sought to improve.
under the facts of this case,however,the lengthy time period between the protected speech and the termination,combined with deschenie intervening poor job performance,are insurmountable.an inference of retaliatory motive may be undermined by a long delay between the employee speech and the challenged conduct or by evidence of intervening events.id.at.here,both of these circumstances are present.the four instances of speech preceded the termination by fifteen months,fifteen months,thirteen months,and eleven months,respectively.the termination was therefore too temporally remote to permit an inference of retaliatory motive without additional evidence.further,the board has presented overwhelming evidence deschenie job performance suffered greatly in the months between the last of these instances of speech and the termination.during this time,deschenie repeatedly missed deadlines,failed to perform assigned tasks,and received poor performance evaluations.although deschenie argues the board stated reasons are pretextual and besett actions toward deschenie were designed to cause her to fail,she has presented insufficient evidence to support this conclusion in opposing a motion for summary judgment,s peculation or hunches amidst rumor and innuendo will not suffice.id.significantly,there is no evidence in the record of any statements made by the board to directly suggest deschenie was terminated because of her speech.thus,deschenie has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her termination was substantially motivated by these first four instances of speech.
with regard to the reprimand and position reclassification,deschenie claim as to the first four instances of speech fails for the same reasons discussed above.the reprimand and position reclassification followed the four instances of speech by nine months,nine months,seven months,and five months,respectively,and deschenie failure to submit the bilingual education applications by the april deadline constituted a significant intervening event.further,to the extent deschenie speech was mentioned at the time of these actions,it was her april letter to the editor and not these previous four instances that was discussed therefore,deschenie has failed to present sufficient evidence to permit an inference that the board actions were in any way motivated by the first four instances of allegedly protected speech.
april letter to the editor 
the fifth and last instance of protected speech claimed by deschenie is her email to the editor of the local newspaper,which was published as a letter to the editor on april.the district court concluded this letter involved matters of public concern,but determined it was unprotected speech under the second prong of the pickering analysis.focusing on the letter identification of deschenie as a ccsd official and the board interest in clearing official statements with the administration,the district court determined the pickering balancing test weighed in favor of the school board.
