we are called upon to decide whether the university of montana may impose a dollar limit on what a student may spend on his campaign for student office.the university limit did not affect how the money could be spent rather,it directly told a student how much he could spend to get elected.the federal election campaign act of could not tell james buckley how much of his money he could spend to be elected a united states senator.buckley valeo,d per curiam.why,then,may a state university tell students how much they may spend to be elected to student office because,unlike the exercise of political at a national level at issue in buckley,the student election at issue here occurred in a limited public forum,that is,a forum opened by the university to serve viewpoint neutral educational interests but closed to all save enrolled students who carried a minimum course load and maintained a minimum average.these educational interests outweigh the free speech interests of the students who campaigned within that limited public forum.
when aaron flint was a student at the university of montana,he twice exceeded the campaign expenditure limit imposed on student candidates for positions in the associated students of the university of montana asum.following the second violation,flint was denied a seat as asum senator.flint sued asum,the university,and asum officers,claiming the spending limit,as applied,violated his first amendment right to freedom of speech.flint now appeals the district court order of summary judgment in favor of defendants.the precise question before us is this does the speech clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution prohibit a public university from imposing a expenditure limit on candidates running for a position in student government const.amend.i congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.we conclude that it does not.
the university of montana is a public university under the montana constitution it is administered through a board of regents.const.art.x.the board of regents requires that the university student government organization meet certain requirements.for instance,the student government must follow all board policies,and the student government constitution must be approved by the president of the university.
asum is the student government at the university of montana.asum is a representative body of the members of the association,organized exclusively for educational and purposes.asum const,available at.under its constitution,asum primary responsibility is to serve as an advocate for the general welfare of the students.id.asum government and activities must comply with montana state law and the policies of the montana board of regents on higher education.id.all students at the university registered for seven or more credits during the fall and spring semesters are assessed an activity fee,and each student who pays this fee is a member of asum.id.
asum not only serves to represent the students at the university but also provides,practical educational opportunities for university students.as explained by asum senior faculty advisor,
asum offers students experience in many forms of leadership,through which they develop a variety of skills to handle the responsibilities that arise in student government.asum senators and executives learn how to address conflicting interests of diverse constituencies,how to make recommendations about the allocation of budgetary resources,how to negotiate with administrators over matters such as tuition and fee increases,and how to draft policies and priorities for numerous student programs.
since asum inception in,the university has viewed asum as an invaluable educational tool for students of the university.asum exists,according to its senior faculty advisor,for essentially educational purposes.
consistent with its goals of representing the students at the university and providing students with leadership opportunities,asum allows for the election of three student executives and twenty student senators.asum const,a article of the asum constitution and article of the asum bylaws impose several procedures and restrictions on the student election process.for example,only asum members,student activity students of the university,who maintain at least a cumulative grade point average are eligible to run for elected office.id.students must be registered for at least one credit to vote in any asum election.id.
the asum bylaws broadly regulate campaigning,which is defined as any activity which directly or indirectly promotes the candidacy of one or more individuals for office.asum bylaws art.v.a,available at.umt.edu asum government bylaws.htm.the bylaws provide that on campus campaign materials may be displayed only after the official campaigning period begins and only in certain areas.id.the bylaws further prohibit any campaigning in university residence halls or family housing and condition campaigning in a classroom on the permission of the professor.id.
at issue in the case at bar is the bylaws campaign expenditure limitation for individual candidates for office.id.the bylaws require each student candidate to document and make public his expenditures two days prior to the general election.id.asum reimburses candidates for a portion of their expenditures.id.the bylaws prescribe that all contributions to campaigns come from students corporate and political action committee contributions are prohibited,as are contributions from organizations.id,i.as a means of enforcing these campaign regulations,the bylaws provide that any candidate who violates the election rules may be barred from candidacy or denied office.
with this general background in place,we turn to the facts of this case.flint ran for and won election on a joint ticket with gale price as asum president and,respectively,for the academic year.flint and price combined to spend about on their campaign and failed fully to disclose these expenditures as required by the asum bylaws.the asum senate censured both flint and price for exceeding the campaign expenditure limit but allowed them to retain their offices as asum president and.
the following year,flint ran for a term as asum senator and again exceeded asum spending limit.upon submitting his campaign expenditure form on april,in which flint reported expenditures of,flint was informed by asum elections chairman kyle engelson that flint name would be removed from the ballot for the upcoming election.flint,then asum president,responded to engelson letter with an email in which he noted asum procedures require a vote of the senate approving engelson recommendation,which would not be possible until the election was already underway.flint suggested that engelson recommend to the senate that candidates who violated asum election laws not be allowed to take office.after the election was underway,the asum senate voted to remove flint from his senate seat should he win.accordingly,after flint received enough votes to be elected asum senator,he was denied office.
flint filed a complaint in united states district court on may,under and the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,claiming that the asum bylaws spending cap on campaign expenditures was an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech.flint sued george dennison,in his official capacity as the university president asum kyle engelson,in his official capacity as asum elections committee chair and seven asum elections committee members in their official capacities.flint later filed an amended verified complaint adding gale price,then asum president,two asum executive officers in their official capacities,and twenty asum senators in their official capacities collectively referred to hereinafter as defendants.
flint also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,a motion for a preliminary injunction,and a motion to consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits.the district court denied flint motions.before the court rendered its judgment as to flint motion for preliminary injunction,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rules of civil procedure b,b and b.following the court denial of a preliminary injunction,flint then filed an amended verified complaint to which the defendants again filed a b and b motion to dismiss.thereupon,the district court issued an order to show cause regarding additional briefing and argument.flint requested further briefing and argument to resolve the issue as to whether strict scrutiny or rational relationship applied to test the constitutionality of the campaign expenditure limitations.defendants responded that additional briefing or argument was not needed and suggested that if the court chose to refer to matters outside the pleadings to resolve the b motion,the court should convert it to a rule motion for summary judgment based on the record developed in connection with the motion for preliminary injunction.the district court accepted defendants suggestion and,applying a rational relationship standard to the spending cap,issued an order and opinion granting summary judgment to defendants on march.
flint timely appealed that order.he claims that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in determining the constitutionality of asum regulations.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
before turning to the merits of flint appeal,we first consider two threshold issues whether flint claims are moot as a result of flint graduation from the university of montana and whether the eleventh amendment immunizes defendants from flint suit.
article iii of the constitution limits jurisdiction to cases and controversies.massachusetts epa,d see also daimlerchrysler cuno,d if a dispute is not a proper case or controversy,the courts have no business deciding it,or expounding the law in the course of doing so.a case that has lost its character as a present,live controversy is moot and no longer presents a case or controversy amenable to federal court adjudication.am.rivers marine fisheries,cir see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d explaining that the mootness doctrine derives from the requirement of an article iii case or controversy.a cause of action is moot when the issues are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation.city of erie pap,d quoting county of davis,d.mootness,however,is a flexible justiciability doctrine that allows review if there are present effects that are legally significant.jacobus alaska,cir see also parole comm geraghty,d explaining that the court cases demonstrate the flexible character of the art.iii mootness doctrine.where a court retains the ability to fashion some form of meaningful relief between the parties,an appeal is not moot,and the court retains jurisdiction.dream palace county of maricopa,cir quoting in re pattullo,cir order.
here,although flint filed his lawsuit prior to his graduation,we must consider whether flint graduation from the university of montana renders his cause of action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants moot.see harper ex rel.harper poway unified sch,d clark city of lakewood,cir mootness inquiries require courts to look to changing circumstances that arise after the complaint is filed.generally,once a student graduates,he no longer has a live case or controversy justifying declaratory and injunctive relief against a school action or policy,and his case is therefore moot.see doe madison sch.dist,cir en banc.when a student record contains negative information derived from allegedly unconstitutional school regulations,however,that information may jeopardize the student future employment or college career.hatter city high sch,cir.so long as a former student record contains evidence of disciplinary sanctions,and the former student seeks an order requiring school officials to expunge from school records all mention of the disciplinary action,the action is not moot.id.
here,flint amended complaint sought such an order of expungement.flint sued for a declaration that asum limitation on campaign expenditures violated his free speech rights,an injunction preventing asum from removing him from his elected position on the asum senate,and an injunction ordering asum to remove from his record all findings,proceedings,recommendations,and actions taken as a result of the election code violations.consequently,despite flint graduation from the university in,his controversy remains live because of his third claim for relief.given that mootness,unlike standing,is a flexible justiciability doctrine,see jacobus,at,we retain the ability to grant relief in a legally significant wit,ordering the expungement from flint record all evidence of his censure and the denial of his asum senate seat.such expungement is certainly a form of meaningful relief.dream palace,at quoting pattullo,at.if we were to determine that flint first amendment rights were violated,declaratory relief would require the university to expunge any and all records of flint censure and senate seat denial therefore,we hold that flint case is not rendered moot by his graduation 
having determined that flint claims are not moot,we now consider whether defendants are entitled to immunity under the eleventh amendment.the eleventh amendment limits claims such as flint.in will michigan department of state police,d,the supreme court held that states or governmental entities that are considered arms of the state for eleventh amendment purposes are not persons under.moreover,will clarified that a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is no different from a suit against the state itself.id.at.we have held that a state university is an arm of the state entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.see,armstrong meyers,cir per curiam.therefore,state officials sued in their official capacities,including university officials,are not persons within the meaning of and are therefore generally entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.
will recognized one vital exception to this general rule when sued for prospective injunctive relief,a state official in his official capacity is considered a person for purposes.will,at.of course a state official in his or her official capacity,when sued for injunctive relief,would be a person under because actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the state.quoting kentucky graham,d.this exception recognizes the doctrine of ex parte young,that a suit for prospective injunctive relief provides a narrow,but,exception to eleventh amendment immunity.see rounds or.state bd.of higher,cir ex parte young provided a narrow exception to eleventh amendment immunity for certain suits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against unconstitutional actions taken by state officers in their official capacities.doe lawrence livermore,cir t he eleventh amendment allows only prospective injunctive relief to prevent an ongoing violation of federal law.
flint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as related to past violations,namely,asum allegedly unconstitutional infringement of his right to freedom of speech.however,as in doe lawrence livermore national laboratory,the relief flint seeks is not so limited.in doe,a contract university employee sought damages and reinstatement for breach of contract and a violation after an alleged wrongful discharge.id.at.the district court dismissed both claims as barred by the eleventh amendment,but we reversed the dismissal of the claim,holding that reinstatement constitutes prospective injunctive relief because a wrongful discharge is a continuing violation.id.at.here,the injunctions flint seeks as related to past violations serve to expunge from university records the censure and denial of his senate seat,which actions may cause flint harm.thus,the injunctions sought are not limited merely to past violations they serve the purpose of preventing present and future harm to flint.therefore,they can not be characterized solely as retroactive injunctive relief and are not barred by the eleventh amendment 
satisfied that this case presents a live legal controversy and that the eleventh amendment does not bar flint suit against defendants,we turn to the merits of flint claims.because flint appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,we review de novo,viewing the facts in a light most favorable to flint and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.scheuring traylor,cir.because neither party disputes the relevant facts,our analysis is focused on application of the correct legal principles to the facts before us.arakaki hawaii,cir.
the speech at issue in this case takes the form of a student candidate spending during the election cycle for asum office.because campaign expenditures implicate a student candidate ability to convey his or her message to the university student body,the expenditures necessarily constitute speech and thus qualify for first amendment protection.see austin.chamber of commerce,d certainly,the use of funds to support a political candidate is speech buckley valeo,d per curiam.there is no dispute in this case that buckley and its progeny apply to the limited extent that they classify the student campaign expenditures as speech worthy of first amendment protection.
that asum campaign expenditures constitute speech is not,however,the end of the matter.the speech at issue occurred in the university of montana student election system,and,subject to constitutional limitations,government has the power to control speech in its school election system to preserve the character of that system.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.the existence of a right of access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at issue.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.in cornelius,the supreme court reaffirmed that when examining government speech limitations,we are to examine the nature of the restriction t he court has adopted a forum analysis as a means of determining when the government interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes.at.
here,both parties eschew forum analysis as the proper framework within which to analyze flint claim that the campaign expenditure limitation violates the first amendment flint points to buckley while defendants point to widmar vincent,d.we disagree on the one point upon which the parties agree their contention that traditional first amendment analysis is inapplicable here.to demonstrate why we disagree,we briefly address each party contention.
on the one hand,flint vigorously asserts that student spending as part of the asum election is political speech that may be regulated only subject to strict scrutiny.flint equates the asum student government to state and national government the role of the asum officers is no less important to society than is that of the montana state government.based on his equation of asum student leaders to elected political officials,flint contends that buckley is controlling and mandates that the asum campaign expenditure limitations be struck down as an unconstitutional limitation on speech 
flint arguments are unpersuasive.we may not simply ignore the facts that the campaign expenditure limitations in this case involved election to student government and that the expenditures occurred mostly,if not exclusively,on a university campus.the educational context of a university,the specific educational purpose of asum student government,and the numerous other limits placed upon student campaigning distinguish the campaign expenditure limitations in this case from those in cases such as buckley,which involved campaigns for national political office.furthermore,while asum undoubtedly has an impact on students at the university and has certain powers to distribute funds among student groups,it simply does not follow that asum is akin to a political government or that the asum election is the equivalent of a congressional race.the ubiquity with which political government is present to control facets of our lives is heavens replicated by student government in students lives.
the university uses asum primarily as an educational means to educate students on principles of representative government,parliamentary procedure,political compromise,and leadership.in contrast to participation in state or national politics,participation in asum student elections is limited to university must maintain at least a grade point average to run for office and only students are allowed to vote in the election.unlike state and national governments,asum is a creature of the board of regents,whose policy calls for asum constitution and conditions the validity of the constitution on the university president approval.indeed,asum entire operation is subject to the board of regents policies and campus policies.
thus,given the nature of this student organization and the environment in which it exists and operates,asum student officeholders are not the equivalent of elected political officeholders.as the eleventh circuit explained in a case dealing with similar campaign limitations for student government,this is a university,whose primary purpose is education,not electioneering.constitutional protections must be analyzed with due regard to that educational purpose,an approach that has been consistently adopted by the courts.student party student gov t ass of the of,cir.we should not apply the principles of buckley without first considering whether the university setting affects our first amendment analysis.see widmar,at.
we likewise disagree with defendants position,and that of the district court,that the university setting dictates that we must defer to all reasonable decisions imposed on student speech during the election process rather than first engaging in a forum analysis.relying on passages in widmar that public universities have the right to determine who may teach,what may be taught,how it shall be taught,and who may be admitted to study and the right to make academic judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources,defendants assert that absent a showing of unreasonableness,the spending limits are per se constitutional because asum is an educational tool,and the university desires that leadership opportunities be available to as many students as possible.at.internal quotation marks omitted.we should defer,defendants contend,to their judgment in reasonably regulating speech regardless whether the regulation advances the purpose of the forum the university has provided for the speech.
we do not read the supreme court cases to require such deference without first scrutinizing more carefully the nature of the student election forum and the government interest in limiting speech within that forum.although the supreme court in widmar discussed the unique setting of a university campus,it also stressed that its cases leave no doubt that the first amendment rights of speech and association extend to the campuses of state universities.at.the university institutional mission,which it describes as providing a secular education to its students,does not exempt its actions from constitutional scrutiny.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court looked to the nature of the property,explaining that the university in widmar had created a forum generally open for use by student groups and therefore the university had assumed an obligation to justify its discriminations and exclusions under applicable constitutional norms.id.at.
the supreme court has applied forum analysis in other,similar cases involving speech limitations on a university campus.in rosenberger rector visitors of university of virginia,d,the supreme court characterized a university student fund responsible for monetary reimbursements to student groups as a limited public forum.the court then analyzed the student fund denial of distributions to a university student religious group as viewpoint discrimination and subjected the denial to traditional first amendment scrutiny.id.at.likewise,in board of regents of university of wisconsin system southworth,d,the supreme court ruled that a university activity fee charged to students,which fee was used to facilitate extracurricular student speech,was constitutional so long as the university funding support was viewpoint neutral.
in sum,we conclude that the constitutionality of the campaign expenditure limitation depends on the nature of the forum and whether the limitation on speech is a legitimate exercise of government power in preserving the character of the forum 
although the student campaign expenditures constitute speech protected by the first amendment,e ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.cornelius,at.indeed,the supreme court has made clear 
nothing in the constitution requires the government freely to grant access to all who wish to exercise their right to free speech on every type of government property without regard to the nature of the property or to the disruption that might be caused by the speaker activities t he government no less than a private owner of property,has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated 
id.at.citation omitted quoting greer spock,d see also faith ctr.church evangelistic ministries glover,cir.accordingly,we apply a forum analysis to determine when the government has legitimate interests in restricting the use of a forum to certain intended purposes that outweigh a speaker interest in using the forum for a different purposes.cornelius,at.faith,at.forum analysis has traditionally divided government property into three categories public fora,designated public fora,and nonpublic fora.once the forum is identified,we determine whether restrictions on speech are justified by the requisite standard.faith,at citation omitted.
on one end of the fora spectrum lies the traditional public forum,places which by long tradition have been devoted to assembly and debate.perry,at.accord.educ.television comm forbes,d.next on the spectrum is the designated public forum,which exists w hen the government intentionally dedicates its property to expressive conduct.faith,at.a designated public forum can not exist in the absence of specific action on the part of the government.cornelius,at.the government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional public forum for public discourse.a restriction on speech in a public or designated public forum is subject to strict scrutiny,requiring the state to show a compelling interest in the restriction that is drawn narrowly to meet that interest.perry,at.a time,place,and manner restriction is permissible so long as it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,and leave s open ample alternative channels of communication.faith,at.
at the opposite end of the fora spectrum is the forum.the forum is a ny public property that is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication.faith,at.we subject speech restrictions in a forum to judicial scrutiny a s long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view,the government may preserve the forum for its intended purposes.perry,at.
the government is not left with only the two options of maintaining a forum or creating a designated public forum if the government chooses to open a forum,the first amendment allows the government to open the forum for limited purposes.the limited public forum is a of a designated public forum that refer s to a type of nonpublic forum that the government has intentionally opened to certain groups or to certain topics.hopper city of pasco,cir alteration in original quoting diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir see also rosenberger,at.the necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the state in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.but o nce a government has opened a limited forum,it must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.rosenberger,at.specifically,the government may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,id.quoting cornelius,at,nor may the government discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint,see also faith,at cogswell city of seattle,cir.
we conclude that the asum student election constitutes a limited public forum.while the campus of a public university,at least for its students,possesses many of the characteristics of a public forum,widmar,at,the forum in this case is not the university of montana campus.rather,because flint challenges the limitations on speech within the confines of the asum election,whether the speech is delivered on campus or off,the relevant forum is the asum election itself,with its accompanying rules and regulations see cornelius,at.i n defining the forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker.diloreto,at the relevant forum is defined by the access sought by the speaker.although the asum election is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense,the forum analysis outlined above is equally applicable.rosenberger,at.see supra note.
the asum election is not a traditional public forum unlike parks and streets,it has not by long tradition or by government fiat been devoted to assembly and debate.perry,at.see also forbes,at.the court has rejected the view that the traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic confines.
the asum election also is not a designated public forum.to create a forum of this type,the government must intend to make the property generally available to a class of speakers.forbes,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.g overnment does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.cornelius,at.emphasis added see also planned parenthood of,clark county sch,cir en banc.
here,the asum election provides for the selection of students to govern student affairs the election does not provide university installations for outsiders to showcase ideas in general thus,the asum election exists to allow campaigns for student office and to elect student representatives to asum leadership positions in order to provide student candidates a valuable educational experience.the asum bylaws define campaigning as any activity which directly or indirectly promotes the candidacy of one or more individuals for an office,including a candidate personal appearances,the posting or publishing of advertisements,distribution of literature,lobbying voters,and the buying of votes with money,gifts,or alcohol.asum bylaws art.v.a.while the bylaws do not limit the content of campaign speech,the bylaws certainly do not permit students or the general public to use the asum election system indiscriminately.see perry,at.
thus,a careful review of the asum constitution and the asum bylaws shows the university purpose of opening a limited public forum,in the form of the asum elections.see faith,at a limited public forum is a of the designated public forum,where the government opens a nonpublic forum but reserves access to it for only certain groups or categories of speech.hopper,at same diloreto,at same see also rosenberger,at.student party,at tjoflat,dissenting noting that regulations governing campaigns for student government at a university created a limited public forum.for example,a student ability to participate in the forum as a candidate is selective and the standards are clear.to run for office,a student must be registered for seven or more credits during the fall and spring semesters,pay a student activity fee,and maintain at least a cumulative grade point average.asum const.only students registered for at least one credit are allowed to vote in the asum election.id.
furthermore,unmistakably clear standards govern campaigning within the forum.under the asum bylaws,campaign materials may be displayed only after the official campaigning period begins.id.b.the bylaws prohibit any campaigning in university residence halls or family housing.campaign speech may occur in a classroom only with the consent of the professor.id.posters may be placed in residence halls only with the approval of the residence hall office and in the university center only with the approval of the university center office.id.on the university campus itself,campaign materials may be posted only on kiosks.id.and,of course,student candidates are not allowed to spend more than promoting their campaign.there is nothing in the asum constitution or bylaws,or the record before us,to suggest that these limitations,save the expenditure limitation,do not apply equally to all who participate in a student campaign,candidates and noncandidates alike.there is also no dispute that the university,through asum,applies these policies consistently.the spending limits have been in place since,and defendant gale price,who ran on a ticket with flint in the election,was censured along with flint for violating the spending limits.see hopper,at c onsistency in application is the hallmark of any policy designed to preserve the status of a forum.
in summary,the restrictions on who may participate as a candidate or voter,and the regulations of the manner in which the campaign is conducted,together demonstrate that the asum election constitutes a limited public forum.this forum exists solely to allow campaigns for asum student office and the election of student representatives,thereby providing an educational experience for the student candidates and student voters.
we now apply this framework to analyze the constitutionality of the campaign expenditure limitation.we must analyze whether the expenditure limitation is viewpoint neutral and reasonable given the purposes of the forum.rosenberger,at.faith,at cogswell,at.because government must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set in opening a limited public forum,any restriction on speech which is not viewpoint neutral or is unreasonable,fails constitutional scrutiny.rosenberger,at.
viewpoint neutrality is the requirement that government not favor one speaker message over another regarding the same topic.when government has excluded perspectives on a subject matter otherwise permitted by the forum,the government is discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.faith,at.if certain speech fall s within an acceptable subject matter otherwise included in the forum,the state may not legitimately exclude it from the forum based on the viewpoint of the speaker.cogswell,at.the supreme court has been clear that viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject.cornelius,at.emphasis added see also sammartano first judicial dist.court,cir recognizing that where the government is plainly motivated by the nature of the message rather than the limitations of the forum or a specific risk within that forum,it is regulating a viewpoint.discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional.rosenberger,at.
there is no dispute in this case that the spending limit applies equally to all asum student candidates,as do all other campaign restrictions.the district court was presented no evidence showing that the university,through the spending limit,is attempting to suppress a particular point of view in the context of the asum election.conversely,as evidenced by gale price censure,the record demonstrates that the spending limit is applied equally to all student candidates,regardless of their views.
this case stands in contrast to rosenberger and good news club milford central school,d,both of which involved viewpoint discrimination in a limited public forum.in rosenberger,the supreme court found that by excluding funding to a student religious group solely because the religious group promoted a particular religious perspective,the university was discriminating in a limited public forum on the basis of that group viewpoint.at.examining this holding in faith center,we explained that,b ecause other student publications were free to discuss the topic of religion from a myriad of views other than the prohibited perspective,the university had discriminated on the basis of viewpoint.at.similarly,in good news club,the supreme court found viewpoint discrimination where a public school excluded a christian club from meeting on the school grounds while permitting nonreligious groups to meet at the school.at.the religious club sought only to address a subject otherwise permitted in the limited public forum,the teaching of morals and character,from a religious standpoint.id.at.thus,exclusion of the religious group from the forum amounted to impermissible viewpoint discrimination.
here,no evidence suggests that the university desire to limit student candidate spending results from a desire to suppress any student viewpoint or that the limitation in any way suppresses a particular candidate viewpoint.the limit does not apply solely to vegetarians,pacifists and marxists,but not to,bellicists and fascists.neither does the limit apply to candidates who might wish to abolish student government or at least intercollegiate athletics,but not to servile of the status quo or jocks.thus,the campaign expenditure limitation does not constitute viewpoint discrimination.
flint contentions do not persuade us to hold otherwise.flint argues that the campaign expenditure limitation constitutes viewpoint discrimination because the limitation a llow s noncandidate students,student associations and outside groups to speak with unlimited volume while limiting candidate speech.
the distinction,however,is based on the status of the speaker,not on the speaker viewpoint.the supreme court has held that in a or limited public forum the government may make distinctions in access on the basis of subject matter and speaker identity.perry,at.holding that allowing different access based on the status of one union as the exclusive representative for the school district was not viewpoint discrimination because it distinguished based upon status,not particular views emphasis added see also.right to life political action comm.bayless,cir noting that a statute restricting the political speech of political action committees but not candidates or other participants did not discriminate by viewpoint.here,the spending limit is directed at the student candidates because they are the focus of the forum purpose.whether such focus is reasonable to achieve that purpose is our next inquiry.
we are also satisfied that the candidate spending limit is reasonable.the reasonableness inquiry focuses on whether the limitation is consistent with preserving the property here the asum election for the purpose to which it is dedicated.diloreto,at see also perry,at.reasonableness is not the legal equivalent of narrow tailoring or least restrictive means indeed,the government chosen method to preserve the character of a limited public forum need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.cornelius,at.accord cogswell,at t here is no requirement that a restriction in a limited public forum be narrowly tailored or the government interest be compelling for a restriction to be reasonable.so long as the government can reasonably justify its regulation on speech in the limited public forum in light of the purposes of the forum,the regulation passes constitutional muster.
since its inception,asum has been subject to the university of montana educational mission.asum faculty advisor explained that asum exists for essentially educational purposes.asum constitution declares that asum is organized exclusively for educational and nonprofit purposes.asum const.art.ii.the election of student representatives to asum leadership positions is designed to help further the educational purpose of asum.the evidence before us clearly shows that the university views the spending limitation as vital to maintain the character of asum and its election process as an educational tool,rather than an ordinary political exercise.asum senior faculty advisor explained that the spending limit was adopted in the revised asum constitution of as a measure intended to defend a
