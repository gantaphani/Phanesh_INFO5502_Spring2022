nicole delgado,a former student at western illinois university,a state university,claims to have been harassed by a professor at the university named james stegall.she filed this suit for damages against the university under title ix of the educational amendments of,and against stegall under the civil rights act of.the district judge granted summary judgment for both defendants.he ruled that delgado had failed to establish a violation of title ix by the university and that title ix provides the exclusive federal remedy for a teacher misconduct toward a student the latter ruling let stegall off the hook.
delgado,a music student at western illinois,was hired by her voice teacher,stegall,to be his office assistant during her sophomore year.the record does not reveal the duties of the position except that they were somehow connected to stegall job as choral director.work for professors is a common activity of college students,and although sexual harassment of university employees is not actionable under title ix if the employee could obtain relief under title vii,waid merrill area public schools,cir lakoski james,cir,there is no contention that the kind of position that delgado held whatever exactly it involved,even though it made her an employee of the university,precludes her from complaining that she was harassed as a student and therefore can seek a remedy under title ix.we can not find any cases dealing with the question but it seems to us that harassment of a student interferes with her educational experience whether or not she is also a employee the harassment of a nonstudent employee could have no such effect.
stegall made advances to delgado after she became his office assistant,repeatedly asking her do you love me and would you ever marry a man like me he would also ask her for hugs,rub her shoulders,and tickle her.troubled by these attentions,she confided her distress to another music teacher,a woman,who told her to remove herself from the situation,get herself to counseling,get her parents involved,and go see the chair the dean.she did speak to a counselor about things that were bothering her,including the uncomfortableness of the comments stegall was making.but neither the counselor nor the music teacher reported stegall misconduct to his dean or any other university official.eventually,however,though only after transferring to another college,delgado filed a complaint with western illinois university against stegall.the university responded by directing him to undergo training in proper behavior toward female students and by placing a letter in stegall personnel file,outlining the actions to be taken and the method for evaluating their effectiveness.
it turns out that stegall had made advances to three other woman students,but they had never filed complaints and his conduct had come to the attention of the university administration.actually there had been a fourth episode,ten years earlier,that had led to a complaint being made to the university about stegall but delgado makes nothing of fact does not even mention it in her briefs.
two years before stegall alleged harassment of delgado,his dean,james butterworth,dean of the college of fine arts and communications at the university,had investigated possible sexual harassment by unnamed members of the art faculty.stegall was and is a member of the music department,however,and no harassment by music faculty had been reported.butterworth responded to the allegations concerning the art department by recommending to the university president and provost the elimination of alcohol from social events sponsored by the department at which both teachers and students were present,the convening of meetings with current and incoming students to discuss the university rules on fraternization and harassment,and the distribution of copies of the rules to all faculty.the recommendations were adopted and implemented.
title ix prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs or activities supported by federal grants.a.the only remedy specified in the statute is the elimination of the federal funding,but in cannon university of chicago,d,the supreme court held that the statute by implication entitles a person injured by a violation to sue for damages.when,however,the claim for damages is based on the behavior of a teacher or of some other employee of the title ix recipient,the plaintiff must prove that an official of the defendant educational institution who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures has actual notice of,and is deliberately indifferent to,the teacher misconduct.gebser lago vista independent school district,d see also id.at.davis monroe county board of education,d gabrielle park heights,illinois school dist,cir hayut state university of new york,cir.western illinois concedes that both dean butterworth and the chairman of the music department were officials clothed with the requisite authority.but it denies that either of them had actual notice of stegall misconduct toward nicole delgado or any other delgado,by failing to mention the incident ten years earlier,has in effect conceded or was deliberately indifferent to that misconduct.
here a peculiarity of the supreme court formula should be noted.ordinarily,actual notice and deliberate indifference are alternative paths to proving knowledge.deliberate indifference means shutting one eyes to a risk one knows about but would prefer to ignore.boncher brown county,cir collignon milwaukee county,cir griffin city of,cir.it thus corresponds to the criminal definition of recklessness,delaney detella,cir collignon milwaukee county,supra,at hernandez keane,cir weaver shadoan,cir,which the law treats as the equivalent of intentionality.trw title ins.security union title ins,cir united states ladish malting,cir case credit first national bank,cir mcginty state,cir.for if a person with a lurking suspicion goes on as before and avoids further knowledge,this may support an inference that he has deduced the truth and is simply trying to avoid giving the appearance and incurring the consequences of knowledge.united states ramsey,cir see also united states giovannetti,cir.but under the supreme court formula,the plaintiff in a title ix damages suit based on a teacher behavior must prove actual knowledge of misconduct,not just actual knowledge of the risk of misconduct,and must also prove that the officials having that knowledge decided not to act on it.
there is less to the distinction than meets the eye.obviously a school officials know in a general sense that there is a risk that one or more of its teachers will harass a student sexually,even if no such incident has ever occurred in the school.that is not the kind of knowledge that establishes recklessness should the officials take no action against the risk.when the cases speak of a known or obvious risk that makes a failure to take steps against it reckless they have in mind risks so great that they are almost certain to materialize if nothing is done,higgins correctional medical services of illinois,cir west by and through norris waymire,cir billman indiana of corrections,cir coleman rahija,cir,for it is only in such cases that recklessness regarding the consequences if the risk materializes merges with intention to bring about the consequences more precisely,to allow the consequences to occur though they could readily be prevented from occurring.and that ought to be enough for liability under title ix.
so if,for example,stegall had been known to be a serial harasser,butterworth might well be found to have had a sufficient approximation to actual knowledge that delgado would be harassed to satisfy the supreme court standard.after all,in davis the court required knowledge only of acts of sexual harassment by the teacher,davis monroe county board of education,supra,at,not of previous acts directed against the particular plaintiff.see also id.at.attaching significance to the fact that there were multiple victims who were sufficiently disturbed by misconduct to seek an audience with the school principal baynard malone,cir school district of kansas city,cir.but stegall was not know
