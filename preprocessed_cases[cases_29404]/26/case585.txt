carolyn sue hager hager,a teacher and program coordinator in the pike county schools,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the pike county board of education board and frank welch welch on her claims of retaliatory demotion and reassignment for political expression and association.hager alleges that under,her demotion and reassignment violated her rights under the first and fourteenth amendments,and under kentucky state statutes,the actions violated a prohibition against demotion or discrimination against school employees for political activities.defendants claim entitlement to qualified immunity because the reassignment was for economic and efficiency reasons or they were permitted to take politics into account in their personnel decisions under the exceptions to the general rule against government employment actions based on political affiliations.applying the exceptions,the district court found politics was an appropriate requirement for the position and no constitutional violation exists.we disagree with the court finding on the exceptions and conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether plaintiff was demoted and reassigned in violation of her clearly established rights.therefore,we conclude that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity.thus,we reverse and remand for further proceedings in hager retaliation suit against the board and welch.
on january,hager was hired by the pike county school district as an elementary school teacher and taught in that capacity through the school year.prior to may,hager openly and actively supported reo johns johns in a political race for board appointment as pike county school district superintendent.johns opponent in the race was defendant welch.johns won and was appointed superintendent.in may,johns appointed hager to the position of gifted and talented g.the duties of the position include teaching gifted and talented students and overseeing various aspects of the district gifted and talented program gtp.once in the position,hager obtained her state gifted and talented teaching certification and program coordination endorsement.when hager took the g position,it paid a salary of,which was fully funded by a grant from the kentucky department of education kde.
as g,hager spent the majority of her time providing direct services to students,and the remainder administering the gtp.her office was in the district central office but she also traveled to local schools to work with the gtp teachers and students.she worked closely with johns and his administration to build and improve the gtp by creating and implementing several new local programs,obtaining additional grants,and identifying an increased number of eligible students.she also regularly conferred with the state gtp consultant,laura pekhonen pekhonen.hager received excellent personnel evaluations and the district and hager received national recognition for achievement in the program.in may,johns retired as superintendent.the board appointed brenda gooslin gooslin as interim superintendent.hager close working relationship on the gtp continued with gooslin and her administration.
between may and august,welch and gooslin were opposing candidates for board appointment as superintendent.as she had with johns,hager openly and actively supported gooslin against welch.in august,welch won and was appointed superintendent after he became superintendent,welch did little to learn about the gtp or what hager was doing or had done with the program,or about the grant monies and state requirements regarding the program.hager and welch had virtually no interaction during his first nine months as superintendent.hager considered herself an outcast in the new administration.
at some point prior to april,welch decided to eliminate the paid g position and reassign the duties to another central office employee in an unpaid capacity.his intent was to distribute the g salary to local schools and teachers for use in their gifted and talented programs.he believed this arrangement was a more economic and efficient use of district resources.welch allegedly based this decision on feedback and advice obtained from individuals inside and outside his administration,including his mentors and pekhonen.
on april,hager was called to an unscheduled meeting with welch,his assistant superintendent paul dotson dotson,and district personnel director david lester lester in welch office.in the meeting,welch informed hager that,due to a state budget deficit and instructions welch had received from the kde,there was a need for restructuring in the school district.welch informed hager that,as part of the restructuring,he was recommending to the board that it abolish the g position for the next school year.welch also told hager that she would be reassigned to classroom teaching at the elementary school level,with a salary reduction of and no responsibilities in the gtp.hager attempted to inform the men that there were state statutory and regulatory requirements for the gtp which prohibited abolition of the g position.according to hager,welch stated that he would research the state requirements and get back to her.hager asserts that at the end of the meeting welch told her that she was not to speak with anyone about the meeting or what was said in it.
in the days following the april meeting,hager did not hear from welch again.she did,however,speak individually with dotson and lester in an attempt to learn the reasons for the restructuring and whether she would have any duties in the gtp.she claims that she was met with derision and contempt.soon thereafter,welch recommended that the board abolish the g position and the board followed the recommendation.the board subsequently established new positions in the program,including title and title gifted and talented coordinator and title assistant coordinator.hager applied for both positions,but her applications were denied.prior to the school year,welch assigned the g duties to central office employee maritta belcher belcher,on a basis and in addition to belcher duties as the district instructional technology coordinator.belcher performs the ministerial coordinator duties but does not teach in the gtp.
on august,hager filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of kentucky,seeking injunctive relief and damages for violation of her first and fourteenth amendment rights of free speech,expression,and association,and pendent state law claims for wrongful demotion or discrimination based on political activities.she asserted that the g position was never really abolished,but that she was demoted and reassigned entirely out the gtp in retaliation for political support of candidates opposed to welch and his allies.after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,claiming that welch had reassigned hager for economic and efficiency reasons or that hager was in a position that required political affiliation and,therefore,she could be reassigned for political reasons under the exceptions to the general rule against government employment actions based on political activities.
on august,the district court granted defendants motion.the court applied the exceptions and determined that the g was either a confidential advisor to the superintendent or a direct delegate of significant discretionary authority to carry out policies of political concern,and,thus,in a position that required political loyalty.based on this determination,the court held that hager could be removed from the g position and reassigned without a constitutional violation.finding no genuine issues of material fact,the court dismissed the federal claims and did not address the pendent state law claims.plaintiff filed a timely appeal to this court.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment 
summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.this court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment.brooks am.broad,cir.when reviewing a motion for summary judgment,we must draw all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d christian belcher,cir.the moving party has the burden of showing the absence of genuine factual disputes from which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff.see anderson liberty lobby,d.in considering whether summary judgment is appropriate,this court must look beyond the pleadings and assess the proof to determine whether there is a genuine need for trial.sowards loudon county,cir.
the sole issue on appeal is the legal question of whether defendants are entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity.under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.thus,to determine if such entitlement exists,the court must conduct a analysis whether the plaintiff has shown a violation of a constitutionally or statutorily protected right and,whether that right was clearly established such that a reasonable government official would have realized that their action was in violation of that right.sowards,at.
violation of a constitutional right 
hager argues that her demotion and reassignment were in retaliation for the exercise of her constitutional rights to political expression and association.these rights are under the constitution.see,rutan republican party of illinois,d quoting elrod burns,d plurality opinion political belief and association constitute the core of those activities protected by the first amendment.moreover,even practices that only potentially threaten political association are highly suspect.mccloud testa,cir,mccloud i.
the defendants argue that hager was in a position that allowed the defendants to consider political affiliation in their personnel decisions under the exceptions to the general prohibition against government employment decisions based on political activities.the district court agreed and found no violation of a constitutional right.whether political affiliation is an appropriate consideration for a government position is a question of law.sowards,at.therefore,to obtain summary judgment,defendants must establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether political affiliation may appropriately be considered with respect to the position in question.id.quoting feeney shipley,cir.
it is that public employees enjoy first amendment freedoms of political belief and association,however,if the exercise of those rights interferes with the discharge of public duties,then the rights may have to yield to the government interest in maintaining effectiveness and efficiency.elrod,at.limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions is sufficient to achieve the valid governmental objective of preventing holdover employees from undermining the ability of a new administration to implement its policies.id.in contrast,n onpolicymaking individuals usually have only limited responsibilities and are therefore not in a position to thwart the goals of the.hall tollett,cir quoting elrod,at.therefore,the single substantive question is whether a nonpolicymaking,nonconfidential government employee can be discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that she is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of her political beliefs.elrod,at.stewart,concurring.this question extends beyond the context of firings,to include areas such as transfers,promotions,and recalls from layoffs.rutan,at.abolition of positions,reassignments,demotions are also included.see id blatter,cir en banc.thus,to avoid a constitutional violation in instances of patronage,the hiring authority must demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.branti finkel,d emphasis added.
gifted and talented position 
to determine whether political affiliation is an appropriate requirement,a reviewing court must look beyond the mere job title and examine the actual duties of the specific position.hall,at emphasis added.as such,it is the inherent duties of the position itself and the duties as envisioned for the new holder which must be examined,faughender city of north olmsted,cir emphasis in original,rather than the duties as performed by the person holding the position at the time of the alleged violation.williams city of river rouge,cir.where positions are defined by statute or regulation,this definition is entitled to some deference by a reviewing court.rice ohio dep t of,cir.
a inherent duties 
kentucky law clearly defines the state gifted and talented programs and its coordinator and teacher positions.the kentucky general assembly has committed the commonwealth to providing a comprehensive educational program for its exceptional children and youth,with the kde coordinating,directing,and monitoring the program.ann.krs.admin.regs.kar.gifted and talented students are defined under exceptional children and youth.the kde has promulgated extensive regulations defining and explaining the requirements for gifted and talented programs.see generally,kar.under the regulations,local school districts shall ensure that direct services are provided to students by professionally qualified and certified personnel.id.at.moreover,state funds for gifted education are required to be used for direct services to gifted and talented students,and percent of a district gifted education fund allocation must be used to employ the properly certified personnel to provide direct instructional services.id.at.additionally,under the regulations,each school district receiving state gifted education funds must designate a gifted education coordinator to 
a oversee the district gifted education operation 
b serve as liaison between the district and the state 
c ensure internal compliance with state statutes and administrative regulation and 
d administer and review the gifted education program budget.
the pike county board of education recognized and incorporated these requirements into the board gifted and talented policy.at.combining the teaching and coordinating responsibilities,the board established the itinerant gifted and talented coordinator or g position,with this job description 
the gifted and talented shall oversee the operation of the district gifted and talented program and assist schools in implementing the provisions and policies set forth by the kentucky department of education.the gifted and talented shall oversee the expenditure of funds for gifted education to ensure those funds are used to provide direct services to identified students.the gifted and talented shall meet the requirements for certificate endorsement as established in kentucky administrative regulation.
shall coordinate the annual,process of evaluating all aspects of the gifted program and make recommendations for upgrading those areas found to be deficient.
shall provide direct services to students who are gifted and talented.percent of the teacher coordinator time shall be spent directly teaching gifted students.percent of their time shall be spent coordinating the program.
will serve as liaison between the district and the state,ensure internal compliance with state statutes and administrative regulations.
at.the inherent duties of the g position as described in the board gtp policy and position job description clearly designate that percent of the position time must be spent teaching gifted and talented students and the remaining percent is to be spent on administration of the program.
b duties of new holder 
the second prong of the position analysis considers the duties as envisioned for the new holder.faughender,at.welch testified that he believed it was unnecessary for the g position to be a position.rather,in his view,the duties could be accomplished by an employee already operating in the district central office.after robinson declined the position,welch assigned the duties to belcher,the district instructional technology coordinator.consequently,belcher is the district instructional technology coordinator and the gifted and talented coordinator.belcher receives no additional compensation for the new duties.
from the record,it appears that belcher answers to and takes virtually all her direction on the gtp from welch.she testified that she had never seen the board job description before her deposition.at belcher dep.belcher is neither certified nor endorsed for the position by training in the gifted and talented area,but does have the grandfather teaching eligibility based on years of service.she stated that she design s program policy at welch direction,and if she did something that did not meet with welch approval,then he would let her know and they would either change the policy or she could argue the point.at belcher dep.belcher also stated,however,that she has been working with pekhonen on developing the program.although the state requirements and the board job description requires that percent of the g time be spent providing direct services to gifted and talented students,at the time of her deposition,belcher had not been teaching or providing similar direct services because she had been identifying students and finding lost records.she admitted that as the job description for the g position is now written,it would not be possible for her to provide the percent direct services and appropriately perform her duties as instructional technology coordinator.specifically,belcher described her actual tasks as she goes out to the local schools and talks to the local coordinators reviews documentation regarding students discusses the means for acquiring more documentation to identify students learns what types of instructions are taking place in the classroom and,determines how the instruction is being documented.belcher has also arranged for professional development training for the local gifted and talented coordinators on several topics,including the kentucky school law pertaining to the gifted and talented students service options for the students gathering data and parental permission and,forming local school committees for the program.in sum,belcher labeled her gifted and talented coordinator duties as ministerial.at belcher dep.
mccloud i categories 
defendants assert that the exceptions apply to this position.in mccloud i,this court developed a schema for classifying whether public employment positions fall under the elrod branti exception for patronage actions and,therefore,political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for consideration in affecting these positions 
category one positions specifically named in relevant federal,state,county or municipal law to which discretionary authority with respect to the enforcement of that law or the carrying out of some other policy of political concern is granted 
category two positions to which a significant portion of the total discretionary authority available to category one has been delegated or positions not named in law,possessing by virtue of named jurisdiction pattern or practice the same quantum or type of discretionary authority commonly held by category one positions in other jurisdictions 
category three confidential advisors who spent a considerable portion of their time on the job advising category one or category two on how to exercise their statutory or delegated policymaking authority,or other confidential employees who control the lines of communication to category one positions,category two positions,or confidential advisors 
category four positions that are part of a group of positions filled by balancing out political party representation,or that are filled by balancing out selections made by different governmental agents or bodies.
at.the court has stated that a government position need not fall neatly within one of the categories to be entitled to the exception.sowards,at.however,should the position fit into one of the categories with reasonable certainty,then political affiliation is an appropriate requirement and a public employee may be adversely affected without violating her constitutional rights.id.at emphasis added.
defendants claim that the g position falls under either category three or two and the district court agreed.hager argues that the position falls outside the mccloud i categories.we believe the district court erred in its application of the category schema.
a.category three 
during hager deposition,defense counsel characterized hager as johns right hand person for the gtp.at hager dep.based on this characterization of the close working relationship between hager and johns,and later with gooslin,defendants claim that the g is a confidential advisor to the superintendent and therefore falls under category three.in opposition,hager argues that a person in the position as written can not spend a considerable portion of their time advising others because percent of the position time must be spent providing direct services to students.next,she asserts that defense counsel questions in her deposition regarding confidential discussions and trust issues between herself and johns the relationship between the superintendent and g.she avers she was not a confidential advisor to either johns or gooslin.ultimately,hager submits that in all aspects of their relationship,johns was her boss and she was at all times taking directions as a subordinate employee.at hager dep.
in sowards,the court summarized the category three position as involving employees who control the lines of communication to category one or category two.this category is concerned with the access to confidential,political information transmitted to the policymaker,which requires political loyalty.at citations omitted.in mccloud i,this court compared the category three position to a judge law clerk or legal secretary.at.like a mayor or other political office holder assistant,the duties of a law clerk of legal secretary to a judge involve access to confidential and political material,as well as controlling the lines of communication to the judge.see faughender,at holding duties of mayor secretary are inherently political.neither position appears analogous to the position at issue here 
reviewing the inherent duties of the g and the position as envisioned by welch and presently performed by belcher,this position falls outside category three.the position requires percent direct teaching service to students and the g can not therefore spend considerable time advising the superintendent in the way that a law clerk advises a judge.although the court has noted that the nature of a ministerial position may involve elements of confidentiality and trust,see blair meade,cir,we believe the district court overemphasized the confidential nature of the position and the amount of advising involved in the relationship between the superintendent and the g.the position is either teaching or ministerial and there are no indications that the g deals with political issues,advises the superintendent on confidential information,or controls the lines of communication to the superintendent.thus,the g does not include the extent of confidentiality inherent in positions of this category.therefore,category three does not reasonably apply in this case.
b.category two 
defendants argue that the g has broad discretionary policymaking authority delegated from the board and the superintendent as to planning and implementing the gtp,especially regarding budgetary matters.a category two position holder receives a significant portion of the total discretionary authority available to the category one position holder,such as a deputy secretary of labor in a state,to whom the secretary of labor has delegated the responsibility of crafting the department annual legislative agenda.mccloud i,at.moreover,i n determining whether an employee occupies a policymaking position,consideration should be given to whether the employee formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals.faughender,at see also rice,at broad responsibilities,not well defined ones,mak
