g,a child with autism in the fort bragg dependent schools fbds,appeals from a district court order in this action under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.specifically,g appeals from the district court order holding that the individualized education program iep proposed by fbds in april met the governing standard under the idea refusing to order compensatory education on the basis of fbds asserted failure to provide g with an education meeting that standard during the school years finding that he was not a prevailing party for attorneys fees purposes and refusing to grant him prejudgment interest on an award of reimbursement of educational expenses because we are unable,based on the parties arguments on appeal and the record in the district court,to determine whether the district court properly found that the april iep met the governing standard,we reverse the district court conclusion on that issue and remand for further proceedings.we likewise conclude that the district court erred in holding that,as a matter of law,g request for an award of compensatory education was barred,and accordingly we reverse and remand the district court rejection of that claim for reconsideration.finally,because the district court erred in finding that g was not entitled to any attorneys fees because he was not the prevailing party on any issue,and because it abused its discretion in refusing to grant an award of prejudgment interest on the reimbursement award,we reverse and remand as to those issues.
a brief overview of the relevant law and administrative processes will put the subsequent discussion of the issues in this appeal in context.under the idea,states that receive federal funds for education must provide to all students with disabilities a free appropriate public education.as defined in the idea,a free appropriate public education fape includes both instruction designed to suit the needs of the disabled child and related services,a,which include such developmental,corrective,and other supportive services as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education,a 
the primary vehicle for delivery of a fape to students with disabilities is the iep.school districts are required under the idea to create an iep for each student with a disability.ieps are to be developed for all students with disabilities through cooperation between parents and school officials.a.the iep must state,inter alia,the student current educational status,annual goals for the student education,the special education services and other supplementary aids and services to be provided to the student,and the extent to which the student will be participating in mainstream classes.a.
the idea establishes a series of procedural safeguards designed to ensure that the parents or guardian of a child with a disability are both notified of decisions affecting their child and given an opportunity to object to those decisions.mm ex rel.dm sch.dist.of greenville county,cir internal citation omitted.parents have the right to participate in their child educational evaluation and the development of his iep,and to receive written prior notice before any change in or any refusal to change the evaluation or iep.b c.in the event that a parent is dissatisfied with the school actions,b e provides that parents must have an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such a child.b e.in turn,b provides a right to a due process hearing where a complaint has been received under b e.

g is the son of a sergeant in the united states air force,stationed at pope air force base in fayetteville,north carolina.born in april,g began receiving special education in fbds schools when he was approximately years old.because g is a child with autism and thus considered disabled under the idea,an iep was developed for g when he first was enrolled at fbds for the school year and at the conclusion of each school year thereafter.as required by the idea,a,a,the ieps stated goals for g education for the year and laid out the type and quantity of instruction he was to receive.
around the end of the school year,concerned that g did not appear to be progressing in the development of appropriate behaviors and skills,g mother attended a conference on the lovaas method after some further research,g mother communicated to g teachers and others within fbds that she felt the lovaas method held great promise for 
in may of,fbds proposed an iep for g for the school year closely resembling that in effect during the school year.the proposed iep did not include any lovaas techniques or methods,and g mother rejected it.instead,beginning in the summer of,g parents took steps to have the lovaas method provided for g in their home by private consultants certified in its implementation to pay the cost of the program,g parents launched an ambitious fundraising effort,eventually raising over from community sources.in october of,shortly after the beginning of the regular school year,the lovaas consultant who had been working with g prepared a document entitled iep goals,listing goals for the following nine months.the document recommended that g continue to receive the complete lovaas therapy at home.
g parents kept him home from school at the beginning of the school year,providing the complete lovaas therapy at home.because of his continued absence,fbds administratively withdrew g from its student roster in october.in november,g parents wrote a letter to the school requesting that the school provide funding for g to continue receiving the complete lovaas therapy at home at a cost of roughly per year.
with no affirmative response forthcoming from fbds,g parents continued to fund the complete lovaas therapy in their home from private sources.g made significant progress in several areas,including verbally imitating some sounds,using eating utensils,and dressing himself.the district court found that by the time the iho made his ruling in december,g had progressed to the point where he should be gradually transitioning to a school classroom in the near future.at.the record thus suggests that g educational progress from to was significant.
in april of,in consultation with g mother,fbds again proposed an iep for g,this time for the school year.g mother rejected the iep because,although on paper it contained the is,the instructional methods and the complete lovaas therapy it did not provide for the complete lovaas therapy,omitting in particular the participation of a consultant.
g parents first requested a due process hearing in a letter dated may,at.in the letter,g mother stated that the fort bragg school system has failed to provide a free and appropriate public education for our child in accordance with the idea,part,and other applicable laws.our son attended the fort bragg school system from october to july.during this time period,our son educational gains were minimal.at.she requested in the letter that the fort bragg school system be required to provide the education my child is entitled to under the aforementioned laws.at.
after the due process hearing,the iho concluded that during the,and school years,fbds had failed to provide g a fape under the idea.based on this finding,it ordered fbds to reimburse g parents for the costs they had incurred since initiating funding of the complete lovaas therapy in their home in the summer of costs that the iho determined to be slightly more than and to fund the complete lovaas therapy as it was being provided to g in his home through july.
fbds appealed to the appeal board,which found that the iho had erred in granting relief relating to the and school years because g parents had not properly raised claims for relief relating to those years the appeal board further found that the april iep was appropriately calculated to provide g with a fape and that the iho erred in granting reimbursement to g parents for money they spent outside of the period from november to april,because november was the date on which g parents first raised their fape claims,and april was the date on which the deficiencies in the provision of a fape were cured.accordingly,the appeal board reduced the award of reimbursement ordered by the iho to.finally,the appeal board found that the iho had exceeded the bounds of permissible relief in ordering the complete lovaas therapy to be provided through july.to impose such a requirement on fbds,the appeal board found,would usurp the responsibilities of both fbds and g parents under the idea to reevaluate,at least annually,the appropriateness of g educational plan.the appeal board found the april iep,incorporating the approach of the lovaas method,was sufficient to cure the earlier failure to provide a fape and thus struck down the iho prospective relief involving the complete lovaas therapy.
g parents then filed a civil action in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina pursuant to e,arguing that the appeal board had erred in reducing the reimbursement award and eliminating the prospective lovaas therapy required by the iho order.they also added claims for attorneys fees as the prevailing party and for prejudgment interest on their reimbursement award.fbds argued that the appeal board had not erred and furthermore that fbds had provided a fape during the period for which reimbursement was ordered the school year.the district court concluded that fbds had offered a fape in the april iep,but that fbds had not offered a fape during the school year.the district court found the board award of in reimbursement relating to the school year appropriate and awarded g that amount,but it denied the prospective relief g sought,attorneys fees,and prejudgment interest.g timely noted this appeal.
g argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that the april iep offered a fape that the district court erred in denying him relief in the form of a prospective compensatory education funding of the complete lovaas therapy,involving a fbds failure to provide a fape during the and school years that the district court erred in denying him an award of attorneys fees and that the district court erred in denying prejudgment interest on the reimbursement award it granted him for the school year 
before turning to g particular arguments,a brief overview of our review standards in the idea context is warranted.in an action under the idea,a reviewing court is obliged to conduct a modified de novo review,giving due weight to the underlying administrative proceedings.mm,at citing bd.of educ.rowley,d,and doyle arlington county sch,cir.further,findings of fact made in administrative proceedings are considered prima facie correct,and if a reviewing court fails to adhere to them,it is obliged to explain why.mm,at.but we need not defer to factual recitations made by a district court from the administrative record,because that court stands in no better position than we do in reviewing the record.id.
where the administrative proceedings are and the hearing officer and reviewing officer have reached the same conclusion,a reviewing court is obliged to accord greater deference to their findings.id.citing combs sch.bd.of rockingham county,cir.on the other hand,where a reviewing officer or board reaches a factual conclusion opposed to one reached by the hearing officer but in doing so departs from the normal process of,its decision may be entitled to little or no deference.doyle arlington county sch,cir.
a.the april iep 
g first contends that the district court erred in finding that the april iep proposed a fape.whether an iep is appropriate for purposes of the idea,whether it meets the relevant statutory definition of a fape is a question of fact in our circuit.dibuo bd.of ed.of worcester county,cir.
after reviewing the april iep terms,the district court concluded that t he school cured its deficiencies in the may iep at the april iep meeting and in the plan,and thus offered g a fape.at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court noted that the april iep reflected significant modifications and changes made to address concerns expressed by g mother after submission of the november,letter.at quoting appeals board opinion.g asserts that the district court erred in employing the federal fape standard rather than the more stringent state standard,and further,assuming the district court applied the correct law,that it erred in finding the april iep sufficient under the federal standard because fbds did not have personnel with the training or experience necessary to implement the iep.
inapplicability of the north carolina standard 
under a b a fape is defined as including special education and related services that meet the standards of the state educational agency a b.the supreme court held in rowley that 
a court inquiry in suits brought under e is twofold.first,has the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and second,is the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.
at.emphasis added see also id.at.noting that the idea fape definition,via its incorporation of related services,expressly requires the provision of such supportive services as may be required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education emphasis in rowley.thus,federal law establishes a minimum baseline of educational benefits that states must offer students with disabilities.states are free,however,to set a higher standard for provision of educational services to those students,and north carolina has taken this approach 
g argues that the north carolina standard governs the services fbds must provide because fbds schools are located in north carolina and thus north carolina standards are the standards of the state educational agency referred to in a b.see generally gill columbia school,cir if state legislation implementing the idea creates a higher standard than the federal minimum,an individual may bring an action under the federal statute seeking to enforce the state standard.fbds argues that the north carolina standard does not apply to it,both because congress did not clearly express an intent to make federally run schools subject to state standards and because congress elsewhere has provided by statute that the department of defense is responsible for setting substantive educational standards for department of defense elementary and secondary schools.we review the district court conclusion that the federal standard applies de novo.
for a federal installation to be subject to state laws,there must be a clear,unequivocal,federal statutory requirement that the entity be so subject.hancock train,d stating also that an authorization of state regulation of a federal entity is found only when and to the extent there is a clear congressional mandate,specific congressional action that makes this authorization of state regulation clear and unambiguous see also epa state water res.control,d federal installations are subject to state regulation only when and to the extent that congressional authorization is clear and unambiguous.
as we have noted,the definition of a fape under the idea requires that educational services meet the standards of the state educational agency.a b.a school run by a state or political subdivision of a state,then,must meet the standards established by the governing state educational agency,which in turn must meet or exceed the idea minimum requirement.the statement that a fape consists of education and related services that meet the state agency standard,however,does not explicitly address the situation federal entity operating a school within the borders of a state.under the idea,a state educational agency is the agency primarily responsible for state supervision of public elementary and secondary schools a.but in the case of fbds,there is no state agency responsible for state supervision of the schools.thus,g central argument on this issue fails.
moreover,the federal statutes relating to rights of children in department of defense schools,f and a west repealed in provide no clear indication that congress intended a federal institution such as fbds to be subject to fape standards established by state regulators,as state standards are not specifically mentioned in either or.further,the department of defense has promulgated regulations that mirror the substantive standards expressed in the idea and requires its schools to abide by those standards see a.
we find that a requirement of comparability to the maximum extent practicable and its reference to the rights of children with disabilities does not amount to the clear and unequivocal federal statutory requirement necessary to incorporate the fape standard of the state in which a department of defense school is located.section a refers only to qualitative standards of schools in comparable communities,such as the compensation,tenure,leave,hours of work,and other incidents of employment of personnel hired to operate those schools,as areas in which department of defense schools should be comparable.it is thus a reasonable conclusion that a was meant to compare schools operated by the department of defense to schools in comparable communities only in more general terms such as the conditions under which school personnel are employed to provide education to all,rather than only disabled,students.section f reference to the rights of children with disabilities under a may reasonably be read as indicating that f,in requiring that the idea protections be extended to children with disabilities in schools operated by the department of defense,does not relieve the department of defense of its burden,applicable with respect to the education of all its students,to ensure that the education those children receive remains generally comparable to education provided in comparable communities,as measured by indicators such as compensation,tenure,hours of work,and other incidents of employment 
in sum,g has not identified,nor have we found,any clear expression of congressional intent to subject federal entities to state fape standards in providing education under the idea.statutory references to substantive rights and procedural safeguards under the idea do not unequivocally refer to fape standards enacted by the states,because as the supreme court made clear in rowley,the idea itself contains a substantive fape standard.we conclude that the federal standard embodied in the idea,then,rather than north carolina full potential standard,governs g ieps.
whether the april iep proposed a fape under the idea standard 
having determined that the federal standard applies,we must next address the question of whether g april iep was reasonably calculated to provide g meaningful educational benefit.the parties agree that on paper that is,in the instructional methods and activities april iep is reasonably calculated to provide g educational benefit,but dispute whether fbds is able to implement the iep we conclude that the record before us is insufficient to permit a reasoned conclusion as to whether fbds could implement the april iep as proposed in a way that would provide educational benefit to 
as we have noted,g asserts that fbds is unable,without the involvement of a consultant,to implement the april iep in a way that would provide him educational benefit.g contends that the april iep is deficient because it does not propose that the necessary role of the lovaas consultant will be filled by anyone with comparable training or experience.in support of this argument,g relies primarily on the finding of the iho that t he lovaas consultant is the heart of the lovaas program.appellant br.at citing iho decision,at.in response,fbds casts the substantive dispute with respect to the april or not a consultant was necessary to provide g a a dispute over the choice of educational methodology included in the iep,an area to judicial.
after an extensive hearing,the iho found that the april iep was insufficient because n either g current therapists nor his special education teacher during are presently able to adequately perform the function of a lovaas consultant based on their current qualifications.at.the iho explained that 
the lovaas consultant is the heart of the lovaas program.lovaas is not simply a methodology that any educator may employ with success,but rather,the experience,insight,and adaptability that the consultant brings to the chair are what is essential.
the iho decision was reversed by the appeal board,which found that the april iep had proposed a fape.the appeal board reasoned that the iho had given insufficient deference to the educational professionals who created the iep,that the iho erred by comparing the april iep to the lovaas program,and that the april iep was not merely a repetition of the may iep,which the iho had already found inadequate.at.the district court affirmed the appeal board decision,finding that the april iep proposed a fape because it reflected significant modifications and changes made to express concerns expressed by g mother,including an increase in the number of skills goals listed.at.neither the appeal board nor the district court considered evidence apart from that assessed in the first instance by the iho.
while we ordinarily would owe deference to fbds simple assertion that it is capable of implementing the april iep,see mm ex rel.dm school dist.of greenville county,cir,in this case the iho,after considering extensive evidence,concluded that fbds personnel who were not and did not have comparable training or experience could not adequately implement the teaching methods called for in the april iep.the iho determination,however,does not appear to have been based on an evaluation of the evidence under the proper standard.rather than assessing fbds ability to provide g educational benefit under the april iep,the iho assessed fbds ability to replicate the complete lovaas therapy.that is,the iho conclusion was premised not on an analysis of whether the april iep was reasonably calculated to provide educational benefit to g,but instead on examination of whether that iep would replicate the benefit to g of the complete lovaas therapy,which had been successful for him.at the april iep does not propose to continue the complete behavioral therapy program for g although it has been proven empirically to work with g as well as some other autistic children as has sometimes been observed,if it is broken,do fix it.id.noting that without the consultant,there would be no assurance that the lovaas curriculum,including daily documentation,would be consistently followed.
neither the appeal board nor the district court addressed fbds ability to implement the april iep as proposed that is,absent a consultant involvement or provided an independent assessment of the educational benefit g would receive from that iep.this is thus an unusual case in that,even after the conclusion of the administrative process and a trial of the issues in the district court,none of the decisions below reflect a thorough assessment of the evidence under the proper is,whether the april iep,as proposed,was reasonably calculated to provide educational benefit to having examined the record and the parties arguments thoroughly,we conclude that they are not sufficient to support a reasoned analysis and conclusion in this court on the issue of fbds ability to implement the april iep as proposed.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment on this issue and remand for such further proceedings as are required to resolve the parties conflict under the proper standard.
g request for an award of compensatory education 
g next asserts that the district court erred in denying his request for an award of compensatory education based on fbds failure to provide him a fape during the school years.we conclude that the district court erred in rejecting g claim on the ground that his parents failed to object to his ieps during,and accordingly reverse its judgment and remand for reconsideration of this issue.
in a section of its opinion entitled was a fape provided for school years,the district court addressed and rejected g claim that he was entitled to compensatory education relating to those school years at.the district court noted that g parents had not asserted their claim regarding fbds failure to provide a fape during the school years until november,when g mother requested that fbds pay for g homeschooling and lovaas instruction,and thus fbds was not aware that g parents objected to the educational services he received during those school years until well after they had concluded.at.the district court reasoned that i f the parents believed that fbds was denying their child a fape,it was incumbent on them to bring that to the school attention via the available statutory mechanisms,and on that basis denied relief.at.in this connection,the district court noted that s chool boards must be given adequate notice of problems if they are to remedy them,and must be given sufficient time to respond to those problems before they can be held liable for failure to act.at citing combs,at.
several of our sister circuits have concluded that an award of compensatory education educational services ordered by the court to be provided prospectively to compensate for a past deficient be appropriate relief under the idea.see,ridgewood bd.of educ,cir recognizing appropriateness,in some circumstances,of award of compensatory education beyond age and remanding for determination of whether it should be awarded board of ed.of oak park river forest high school dist.illinois state bd.of,cir stating that the idea authorization to courts to grant appropriate relief encompasses the full range of equitable remedies and therefore empowers a court to order adult compensatory education if necessary to cure a violation parents of student puyallup school district,cir same pihl massachusetts of,cir same hall knott county bd.of,cir same jefferson county bd.of educ.breen,cir same miener missouri,cir recognizing appropriateness of compensatory education award and holding that plaintiff was entitled to recover compensatory education if she prevailed in her claim that she was denied a fape for several years.compensatory education involves discretionary,prospective,injunctive relief crafted by a court to remedy what might be termed an educational deficit created by an educational agency failure over a given period of time to provide a fape to a student.we agree with every circuit to have addressed the question that the idea permits an award of such relief in some circumstances.as we explain below,because the district court basis for rejection of g compensatory education claim involved an erroneous legal conclusion,we reverse its rejection of that claim and remand for reconsideration.
the district court concluded that an award of compensatory education was inappropriate in this case because g parents failed to object during the school years to the ieps under which g was receiving educational services.as we have noted,the district court cited combs as authority for this proposition,stating that the idea should can not be used as a sword to punish school districts unaware of parents concerns.at citing combs,at.
we addressed in combs whether a party may recover attorneys fees as the prevailing party in an action brought under the attorneys fees provision of the idea against the school board where the school board actions were deemed to be in accordance with the idea,but the school board later made some changes that comported with the plaintiff demands.id.at.thus,our statement in combs referred only to liability of the school district where its actions were in compliance with the idea,and is inapplicable here.moreover,other courts have concluded that failure to object to a child placement does not deprive him of the right to an appropriate education.ridgewood,at rejecting the contention that failure to object to an iep while in force categorically bars relief related to that iep.accordingly,the district court rejection of the compensatory education claim was based on an erroneous legal conclusion,and we therefore reverse the court judgment as to this issue we think it worthwhile,however,to note that our reversal is predicated only on the district court erroneous legal conclusion,and not on an assessment of the merits of an award of compensatory education in this case.we leave that issue to be decided on remand.
g next asserts that the district court erred in determining that he was not a prevailing party and thus not entitled to an award of attorneys fees under the idea attorneys fees provision,e b.the district court found that because the goal of g idea action had been to have the complete lovaas therapy adopted by the school and the court had declined to compel the school to adopt the complete lovaas therapy,g had not prevailed in the suit.the district court stated that there had been no material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,without addressing the award of over in reimbursement expenses to the plaintiffs.at.it further suggested that without prospective relief,a party can not be the prevailing party on a claim under the idea.at.the designation of a party as a prevailing or party is a legal determination that we review de novo.smyth rivero,cir.
the idea states in relevant part that 
in any action or proceeding brought under this subsection,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.
e b.the supreme court has noted that even an award of nominal damages makes a party the prevailing party.buckhannon bd.and care home.dep t of health and human resources,d noting that even an award of nominal damages suffices to make a party a prevailing party citing farrar hobby,d.an award of attorneys fees conditioned on a party having prevailed does not require the party to have prevailed on every claim the party obtaining judicially sanctioned and enforceable final relief on some claims is sufficient see,rum creek coal sales,inc caperton,cir noting that a party may receive attorneys fees as a prevailing party w hen it prevails on only some of the claims made see also richardson miller,cir a plaintiff need not prevail on every claim and obtain all relief sought to qualify as a prevailing party.accordingly,the district court award of reimbursement of over in expenses to g was an enforceable legal judgment which plainly rendered g a prevailing party for purposes of the idea,and we reverse its holding that g was not a prevailing party.
finally,g argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant him prejudgment interest on the reimbursement award.the district court determined,in ruling on a motion to reconsider its earlier judgment,that prejudgment interest should not be awarded because the plaintiffs were not the prevailing party,and that because the reimbursement award did not make the plaintiffs whole under their theory of the case,an award of prejudgment interest would not serve to complete an award that made g almost whole.at.a district court denial of an a
