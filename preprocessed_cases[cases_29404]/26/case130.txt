during his freshman year of high school,anthony zeno anthony transferred to stissing mountain high school smhs in pine plains,new york.smhs was a part of pine plains central school district the district.his fellow students harassed him for the next years.he brought this action below,contending that the district was deliberately indifferent to his harassment.a jury found the district liable for violating title vi of the civil rights act of title vi and awarded anthony million in damages.
the district court davison,mag.denied the district motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.b,but it granted remittitur of the jury award to million.the district appeals.we affirm.
background 
a.the facts 
we construe the facts in the light most favorable to anthony.see,townsend benjamin,cir.
freshman year january june 
in january,when he was sixteen years old,anthony moved from long island to pine plains,in dutchess county.he enrolled at smhs,a racially homogenous school where minorities represented less than five percent of the student population.for the several years preceding anthony enrollment,smhs was devoid of disciplinary incidents.that changed after anthony who is and biracial,began attending smhs.
in february,a few weeks after anthony arrival,a student a stranger to anthony charged toward him,screaming that he would rip anthony face off and kick his ass,and that w e do want your kind here.other students held the aggressor back,while unidentified students in the crowd called anthony a nigger and told him to go back to where he came from.
after this first incident,anthony mother,cathleen zeno mrs.zeno,voiced her concerns to smhs principal john francis howe.howe told zeno that this is a small town and you do want to start burning your bridges.
for the rest of the year,anthony was subjected to numerous racial comments and harassment at the school.for example,a student stripped a necklace from anthony neck,breaking it.the student claimed the incident was merely a joke and offered an apology whoops,did mean to break your piece of fake rapper bling bling.
anthony repeatedly reported the incidents to school officials.zeno wrote to district superintendent linda kaumeyer and the school board,raising concerns about students verbal racial attacks and physical abuse on anthony and his younger sister,who was also a student in the district.kaumeyer neither offered to meet with zeno nor informed howe of the letter.
beyond disciplining each student involved in incidents during this semester with a warning or suspension,the district did not implement other remedial measures in response to the student harassment of anthony.
sophomore year august june 
escalating harassment 
throughout anthony second year at smhs,student harassment continued.in addition to the pervasive hallway harassment reported by anthony,specific incidents revealed escalating racial tensions at smhs.
for example,a football teammate punched anthony as he told him that he was going to kick anthony black ass.another student,in the cafeteria,told anthony,you fucking nigger.go back to where you came from.the student picked up a chair,and started to throw it at anthony before he was restrained.on yet another occasion,anthony walked into the school bathroom to find graffiti on the walls warning zeno is dead and zeno will die.then,in december,another football teammate circulated a homemade rap cd at smhs.the cd used racial nigger,and language.anthony,like many of his peers,received a copy.
harassment of anthony continued the following semester.in january,a faculty member reported frequent racial comments in anthony art class.for example,a classmate repeatedly called anthony homey and gangster,referred to the hood,and made stereotypical remarks such as what up my nigger and you so ghetto.then,in february,the student who had broken anthony necklace and another student tampered with anthony locker.when anthony later opened his locker,the metal door fell off,hitting him on the head.the students had also filled the locker with garbage,which spilled onto anthony and the floor.moreover,on at least two separate occasions,students taunted anthony in a racial manner with references to lynching displaying a noose or threatening to take a rope to the nearest tree.
in response to these incidents,the district suspended the students involved,typically for five days.twice,anthony obtained orders of protection.the district moved one student to another school.
additional reports of harassment 
during his sophomore year,anthony faced additional harassment,which he repeatedly reported to school officials.in fact,halfway through the year,he told faculty and staff i tired of this i ca take any more of it,i have to stop this this has been going on forever.
similarly,by letter to superintendent kaumeyer dated september,zeno described verbal attacks includ ing racial slurs and threats to their lives and physical attacks so violent that smhs called the police.kaumeyer did not call or meet with zeno,but she responded in writing.principal howe responded by asking staff members and teachers to keep an eye on anthony and to reach out to him.
in addition,the zenos lawyer and members of the community notified the district about the harassment.in october,marilynn vetrano of the dutchess county human rights commission the hrc wrote kaumeyer,referring to a complaint of alleged racism related incidents.around this time,anthony lawyer,michael sussman,also contacted the district.sussman asked smhs to do two things provide anthony with a shadow,who would accompany him at school,and implement racial sensitivity programs to underscore the district zero tolerance of racism and bias.
in november,vetrano and elouise maxey of the dutchess county met with kaumeyer and with howe.at both meetings,vetrano and maxey reiterated the zenos requests for a shadow and racial sensitivity programs.in addition,they offered to provide these options at no cost.the district,however,declined to assign anthony a shadow and chose not to implement the hrc training program 
after meeting with vetrano and maxey,howe discussed anthony progress and transition to the district with his teachers.he learned that in anthony art class,r acial comments were made all the time.in addition,a teacher indicated that anthony presence just makes it worse.
at the end of the school year,the district prepared an individualized education program iep for anthony.the iep noted that anthony has been struggling with acceptance in the school environment.there have been numerous incidents between anthony and others with prejudicial or racial overtones.after the iep was finalized,special education director maryanne stoorvogel who prepared the iep,teachers,and other school officials discussed the iep with zeno.at this meeting,zeno also raised additional concerns regarding the bias anthony continued to encounter at school.
additional district actions 
stoorvogel,who was aware of the numerous incidents with prejudicial or racial overtones concerning anthony,never investigated the harassment.as the district title ix compliance officer,stoorvogel was charged with investigating alleged violations of both title ix of the education amendments of title ix and title vi nevertheless,she did not follow up or respond to these complaints.
stoorvogel was also part of a group which included kaumeyer and other administrators that met on a biweekly basis to discuss issues of internal importance.throughout anthony sophomore year even after the graffiti on the bathroom wall,the comments about lynching,the noose,and other incidents the administrators never discussed racial harassment,generally,or anthony,specifically.
in february,the district coordinated a mediation between zeno and anthony antagonists and their respective parents.the district neglected,however,to notify zeno of the date or time of the mediation,and she did not attend.moreover,the prospective mediator was not trained in bias awareness or diversity,issues at the core of the harassment.
the district also implemented separate programs for faculty and staff,students,and parents,run by mcgrath training systems.the course was called altering the culture of cruelty a legally based bullying and harassment prevention program.the program discussed bullying and sexual harassment,but despite being customized for the district,its treatment of race and discrimination was tangential at best.
the district never implemented discrimination,bias,diversity,or programs during the academic year.
junior year august june 
in the fall of,anthony was subjected to more hallway harassment in school.he reported it to the district less frequently,however,because n othing was being done,and it been already three years.zeno again contacted kaumeyer,by letter dated october,hoping to discuss solutions to her son continued harassment.kaumeyer again did not call zeno or meet with her,but she responded in writing a few days later.
in addition to the hallway harassment,in january,a student threatened to kick anthony black ass and repeatedly threatened to rape his younger sister.anthony threw a punch.the district punished anthony,but not the instigator.then,in february,smhs drama club planned to reenact a tv show,married with children.when anthony was assigned his role,another student commented that anthony would fit the role if it was like a black gangster.
anthony also began spending part of his junior year with the boards of cooperative educational services boces program as he travelled to the program,students on the boces bus repeatedly called him a nigger.anthony informed the district about these incidents,but even when a particular student was disciplined,the harassment continued because if it was the same kid,it would always be someone replacing that kid,because they were all connected.
the district responded by hiring james childs of jara consulting,who planned to conduct student focus groups,administer surveys,and meet with staff,parents,and community members to increase diversity awareness.childs was also supposed to train faculty and staff on the importance of acknowledging racial diversity and recognizing racial stereotypes,and to train students on diversity issues.during the entire school year,however,childs only did preliminary work and held no training sessions 
the district also reorganized stop students and teachers opposed to prejudice,a student extracurricular activity that had been defunded.
senior year august june 
during anthony fourth year,he reported fewer incidents of harassment to smhs authorities.when incidents did occur,however,they were serious.for example,at an smhs football game in september,a student called anthony sister a slut and threatened to kick anthony black ass.anthony and this student began to fight.anthony friend tried to intervene and break up the fight when another student suddenly jumped anthony friend,choking him until he lost consciousness.officers broke up the fight.the student who choked anthony friend ultimately received a day suspension.
students continued to call anthony a nigger in the hallways all the time,and he reported these comments to howe.similarly,he encountered continued racial harassment on the bus to his boces program.
during the academic year,childs preliminary work finally resulted in sensitivity training sessions for students.students were randomly selected to participate but could opt out.the district also instituted project wisdom,which consisted of reading a short message containing a quotation from a historic figure,celebrity,modern hero,or other notable voice that reinforce d the topic of the day.these messages were read over the school public address system each morning,and although some messages addressed racism and prejudice,the messages focused primarily on civic and personal values.
finally,on two occasions,the district invited camfel productions to produce student assemblies addressing character education.these assemblies focused on respect,bullying,prejudice,and decision making,and also discussed racism and racial harassment.
anthony accepts an iep diploma 
at the beginning of his fourth year,anthony and his family faced a choice.anthony was short of the credits required to graduate.he was entitled to stay in the district until he turned and try to satisfy the regents diploma requirements.based on his historic progress,however,it was unclear whether,even with more time,anthony could earn the requisite credits in math.
rather than endure further harassment and try to graduate with a regents diploma,anthony could also accept an iep diploma.students with iep diplomas can attend certain community colleges,but employers,the military,colleges,apprenticeship programs,and business or trade schools generally do not accept them.
zeno expressed concern about the iep diploma,but she felt she had no choice i could allow anthony to do another two years in that school and be subjected to that abuse h e was being torn apart by these tormentors in attacking his color the way he looked.while anthony was enrolled at smhs,zeno met with howe between thirty and fifty times.the school never offered proactive solutions on the contrary,howe told zeno that he was unsure of how to keep anthony safe on a daily basis.he claimed that he could only think of the short term,and that he would try to take every incident as it came and deal with it as it came.
anthony finished his senior year as part of the boces program and graduated with an iep diploma.his education at the district was complete.
proceedings below 
on july,anthony commenced this action against the district alleging discrimination in violation of title vi.after discovery,the district moved for summary judgment.the district court denied the motion on may.
trial commenced on march.after anthony rested,the district orally moved for judgment as a matter of law.the court denied the motion,ruling from the bench.on march,the jury returned its verdict,finding that the district had violated anthony civil rights under title vi,and awarding him million in damages.
on april,the district renewed its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law,and also moved for a new trial,a new trial limited to damages,or a remittitur of the jury award.by an august,memorandum and order,the district court granted the district motion for a new trial,subject to anthony accepting a reduced award of million.anthony agreed to accept the reduced award on august,and the district court directed the clerk of the court to enter judgment in the sum of million,as well as costs and fees,in favor of anthony.the district filed its notice of appeal on september,the district court entered an amended final judgment on september,
discussion 
the district advances two principal arguments on appeal.first,it contends that the district court erred by denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law.second,and in the alternative,it argues that the damages award,as reduced,was still excessive.we address both of these arguments in turn.
a.the district liability for student on student harassment under title vi 
the district contends that,as a matter of law,it was not deliberately indifferent to student harassment of anthony.specifically,it argues that it reasonably responded to each reported incident,it was under no obligation to implement the reforms requested by anthony lawyer,and it never knew that its responses were inadequate or ineffective.hence,it asserts that,on the record presented,no reasonable jury could have returned a finding of liability.we disagree.
applicable law 
we review de novo a district court denial of a judgment as a matter of law.see,jones town of haven,cir townsend,at.a court may grant judgment as a matter of law only if it finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for its decision.a.therefore,we will only reverse a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law if,drawing all inferences in favor of,and reviewing all evidence in the light most favorable to,the plaintiff,no reasonable juror could have returned a verdict for the plaintiff.see,townsend,at manganiello.city of new york,cir.
title vi prohibits a recipient of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race,color,or national origin see.public educational institutions that receive federal funds are subject to this mandate.i defining recipient to include any public agency,institution,or organization,or other entity in any state,to whom federal financial assistance is extended see also id.g ii.
title vi prohibits intentional violations of the statute.see alexander sandoval,citing alexander choate.in certain circumstances,courts view actions of a third party as intentional violations by the funding recipient itself.see,davis ex rel.lashonda monroe cnty.bd.of,board of education can be liable for harassment under title ix gebser lago vista indep.sch,school district can be liable for harassment under title ix for example,in the educational setting,a school district is liable for intentional discrimination when it has been deliberately indifferent to teacher or peer harassment of a student.see,davis,at gebser,at papelino albany coll.of pharmacy of union,cir sexual harassment claim under title ix could survive summary judgment.
the deliberate indifference standard outlined by the supreme court in davis monroe county board of education is a narrow one.see at title ix cabins the range of misconduct prohibited,and a school district liability is limited.liability only arises if a plaintiff establishes substantial control,severe and discriminatory harassment,actual knowledge,and deliberate indifference see,at distiso cook,cir listing three factors,but assuming control,in title ix case.
a school district will be subject to liability for conduct only if it exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the context in which the known harassment occurs.davis,at reasoning that the school must have control over the alleged harassment and authority to take remedial action.a school district,the supreme court noted,exercises substantial control over the circumstances of the harassment when it occurs during school hours and on school grounds.id.at.similarly,a school district authority to take remedial action lies in its longstanding disciplinary oversight over its students.see,new jersey,tinker des moines indep.comm.sch.
even assuming the requisite level of control,not all harassment is actionable.the harassment must be severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive and discriminatory in effect.davis,at see also distiso,at acknowledging severity requirement.discrimination under title vi is not limited to being excluded from,or denied the benefits of,a particular school program.see a.discriminatory actions r estrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service,financial aid,or other benefit under the school system.b iv see also id.g ii.educational benefits include an academic environment free from racial hostility.see hayut,at we also find that misconduct that simply created a disparately hostile educational environment relative to her peers could be construed as depriving the victim of the benefits and educational opportunities available at the school.
in addition,a school district must know of the harassment.constructive knowledge is not enough only actual knowledge is a predicate to liability.see davis,at gebser,at.
finally,only deliberate indifference to harassment can be viewed as discrimination by school officials themselves.gant,at citing davis,at.the school action or inaction must,at a minimum,cause students to undergo harassment or make them liable to or vulnerable to it.davis,at internal quotation and alteration omitted.
a finding of deliberate indifference depends on the adequacy of a school district response to the harassment.see hayut,at.a failure to respond,see id.at,a response that only follows after a lengthy and unjustified delay,id.internal quotation omitted,and a response that amount s to deliberate indifference to discrimination,gebser,at,have all been found inadequate.
nevertheless,a school district actions are only deliberately indifferent if they were clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.davis,at gant,at.thus,when weighing the adequacy of a response,a court must accord sufficient deference to the decisions of school disciplinarians.see davis,at c ourts should refrain from the disciplinary decisions made by school administrators.citation omitted tinker,at.to that end,victims do not have a right to specific remedial measures.see davis,at.
application 
to successfully challenge the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district must demonstrate that no reasonable jury could have found that it had the requisite control,the harassment was severe and discriminatory,it had actual knowledge,and it responded inadequately to the harassment.the district argues that it responded swiftly and unequivocally to each reported incident of harassment its response was not deliberately indifferent merely because it did not implement shadowing or expel the harassers and it never knew that its responses were ineffective or inadequate.we consider these arguments by addressing first,whether anthony was subjected to actionable harassment,and,second,whether if so the district was deliberately indifferent.
actionable harassment 
on the record below,reasonable jurors could have found the harassment anthony suffered to be severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive.davis,at.the evidence presented at trial demonstrated that,from through,many students in the district taunted,harassed,menaced,and physically assaulted anthony.his peers made frequent pejorative references to his skin tone,calling him a nigger nearly every day.they also referred to him as homey and gangster,while making references to his hood and fake rapper bling bling.he received explicit threats as well as implied threats,such as references to lynching.
hence,the jury reasonably could have found that the harassment anthony endured went beyond the simple acts of teasing and among school children.davis,at noting such harassment is insufficient to support a private right of action distiso,at defendants do not and can not dispute that such conduct,particularly use of the reviled epithet nigger,raises a question of severe harassment going beyond simple teasing and.furthermore,the evidence showed more than mere verbal harassment anthony also endured threats and physical attacks.finally,the harassment continued for over years.accordingly,the jury surely could have concluded that the harassment was severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive.see couch,d,ten instances of racial slurs and violence over years could be perceived as sufficiently severe see also davis,at vulgar comments and sexually harassing conduct over five months was sufficiently severe to state a claim doe ex rel.haven bd.of,d,affirming jury verdict against school district where victim was sexually harassed by peers for three months after a sexual assault.
in addition,the jury reasonably could have concluded that as a result of the harassment,anthony was discriminatorily deprived of three educational benefits.first,anthony was deprived of a supportive,scholastic environment free of racism and harassment.see hayut,at creating a disparately hostile educational environment relative to a student peers may be construed as a deprivation of educational benefits or opportunities.
second,anthony accepted an iep diploma rather than pursue further studies at smhs.see trial tr,i could allow anthony to do another two years in that school and be subjected to that abuse.anthony zeno iep,pl.trial ex,at.the iep diploma was less likely to be accepted by employers or colleges.see regs.tit,b iii earning an iep diploma shall not be deemed to be equivalent to receipt of a high school diploma.thus,the harassment effectively deprived anthony of a regents diploma,a benefit provided by the district.
finally,anthony was driven to leave smhs,the high school he had attended for years,without completing his education.where,as here,the decision to withdraw was motivated by a racially hostile educational environment,a strong nexus between the harassment and the deprivation of educational benefits is evident.see hayut,at conduct causing student to withdraw from university could be interpreted as deprivation of educational benefits or opportunities.
thus,the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury conclusion that anthony was subjected to actionable harassment.
knowledge,control,and adequacy of response 
we turn now to the district knowledge of,control of,and response to the harassment.
with respect to the district actual knowledge of the ongoing harassment,the record reflects that it received reports of harassment affecting anthony from many quarters.first,faculty and staff members at the district reported numerous incidents to howe during anthony first two years at smhs.second,anthony also reported racial harassment in the hallways throughout his years at smhs.third,during that same time period,zeno contacted school administrators between thirty and fifty times.fourth,various third parties the dutchess county hrc,the dutchess county,the zenos attorney,and the police raised the issue of students harassing anthony with the district.hence,on this record,the jury easily could have found that the district actually knew of the continuing harassment of anthony.
in addition,the record supports the jury finding that the district had substantial control over the circumstances of the harassment anthony endured.the incidents described above occurred on smhs grounds or its property such as the buses to boces including,for example,shouts of nigger in the hallways,death threats in the classroom or bathroom,and an attempted assault with a chair in the cafeteria.see davis,at school has control over harassment that occurs during school hours and on school grounds.
a reasonable jury could have also concluded that the district exercised the requisite control because anthony harassers were students.because school officials are charged with prescrib ing and control ling conduct in the schools,tinker,at,the district had disciplinary oversight over the harassers.hence,the district had substantial control over the harassment.
the third and principal issue facing the jury was whether the district was deliberately indifferent to the harassment.the district responses to the harassment of anthony took two forms immediate discipline of anthony identified harassers and,later,various responses.
the district argues that its disciplinary response could not constitute deliberate indifference because it immediately suspended nearly every student who was identified as harassing anthony.in addition,it contacted students parents or withdrew privileges such as the right to participate in extracurricular activities.the district notes that only two students were identified as repeat offenders,and reported incidents declined after march.
in some circumstances,prompt disciplinary action against a student identifiable harassers may show that a school district was not deliberately indifferent the sufficiency of a response,however,must be considered in light of the known circumstances,distiso,at internal quotation omitted accord hayut,at gant,at,and as the known circumstances change,the sufficiency of a response may also have to evolve.
here,five circumstances should have informed the district continued response to student harassment of anthony.first,it knew that disciplining anthony harassers through suspensions or not deter others from engaging anthony in serious and offensive racial conduct.during his sophomore year alone,anthony was subject to eight separate incidents of harassment.second,the harassment directed at anthony grew increasingly severe.of the eight incidents that occurred during his sophomore year,two were violent,three were threats on his life,and two resulted in orders of protection against the students involved.third,the disciplinary action had little effect,if any,on the taunting and other hallway harassment,which persisted until anthony left smhs,years after he arrived.fourth,the district knew that the harassment predominantly targeted anthony race and color.and fifth,as early as november,the dutchess county hrc and n.offered the district both a free shadow,to accompany anthony during the school day,and a free racial sensitivity training series.
at the conclusion of the trial,the district court instructed the jury regarding deliberate indifference as follows 
deliberate indifference means that the defendant response or lack of response to the alleged harassment was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.deliberate indifference may be found where a defendant takes remedial action only after a lengthy and unjustifiable delay or where defendant response was so inadequate or ineffective that discriminatory intent may be inferred.in other words,deliberate indifference requires a finding that the district actions or inactions in response to known harassment effectively caused further harassment to occur.
trial tr,the jury was entitled to evaluate the district response in light of this instruction and all the evidence presented.
responses that are not reasonably calculated to end harassment are inadequate.see,vance spencer cnty.pub.sch,cir where a school district has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective,and it continues to use those same methods to no avail,such district has failed to act reasonably in light of the known circumstances.doe sch.bd.of broward,cir endorsing sixth circuit approach.the jury could have found and apparently did find that the district remedial response was inadequate and deliberately indifferent in at least three respects.
first,although the district disciplined many of the students who harassed anthony,it dragged its feet before implementing any remedial action a delay of a year or more while many cases address delays preceding a school initial response,once a school is aware of its ineffective response,a delay before implementing further remedial action is no less problematic.see wills brown,cir e vidence of an inadequate response is pertinent to show fault and causation where the plaintiff is claiming that she was harassed or continued to be harassed after the inadequate response.at some point after anthony first semester,the district should have done more,and its failure to do more effectively caused further harassment see davis,at internal quotation marks omitted.the jury was entitled to find,and the record shows,that the district delay in taking additional action here was unreasonable.
second,the jury could have reasonably found that the district additional remedial actions were little more than measures.for example,it coordinated mediation,but did not inform zeno when or where it would be held.its additional programs either did not focus on racial bias or prejudice,or made attendance optional.this was evident in the district training for students,parents,and teachers it was for one day only and focused on bullying and sexual harassment,rather than racial discrimination.likewise,project wisdom morning announcements were messages meant to inculcate civic and personal values,rather than address racism and discrimination.the district first training the james childs program did not occur until november,nearly months after peer harassment of anthony began.attendance was optional.anthony saw none of his harassers at the event.similarly,although the district reorganized an extracurricular student group stop aimed at addressing prejudice,stop members were a group.
the record indicates that these programs were selected in lieu of the free shadow or racial sensitivity training offered by the dutchess county hrc and in november,almost a year earlier and only nine months after anthony was first harassed.although actually eliminating harassment is not a prerequisite to an adequate response,davis,at purging their schools of actionable peer harassment is not required patterson hudson area,cir same,the district actions could not have plausibly changed the culture of bias at smhs or stopped the harassment directed at anthony.a jury was entitled to compare the alternatives offered by the dutchess county hrc and with the district programs when it evaluated the adequacy of the district ultimate response.thus,we conclude that the record supports the jury finding that the district deliberately indifferent responses effectively caused anthony
