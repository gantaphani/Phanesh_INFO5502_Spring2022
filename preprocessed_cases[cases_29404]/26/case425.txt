plaintiff charles floyd appeals the dismissal of his claims on summary judgment against the amite county school district,the school board and various school board members and employees following his termination as principal of amite county high school.with respect to floyd federal race discrimination claims,we agree with district court that floyd failed to raise a genuine issue of fact that he was discriminated against on the basis of his race.we also find no error in the district court dismissal of floyd state law claims.accordingly,we affirm.
from until the summer of,charles floyd served as both track coach and principal at amite county high school achs in amite county,mississippi.he had a long history as a track coach at the high school prior to that time.achs is a predominantly high school and all of the significant actors in this case,including floyd and the individual defendants,are.on may,the school board of the amite county school district granted floyd permission to operate a private track training program at the achs facilities during that summer.floyd did not inform the school board that,in addition to achs students and in contrast to his practice in previous years of the program,white students from private schools in the community would also be participating in the program.floyd presented evidence demonstrating that john davis,president of the school board,was biased against him for allowing white private school students to participate in the summer track program at achs.
at the regular meeting held following completion of the track program on june,the school board adopted a dual position policy.which restricted administrators from holding more than one position in the district,such as coaching and administration.as a result,floyd elected to resign as track coach in order to keep his position as principal.although there is some question as to the origin of the motion to adopt the dual position policy,the defendants claim and the district court found that the policy was consistent with instructions given to all school board members by the state of mississippi at a statewide conference of the mississippi school boards association held in february.
in the fall of,superintendent mary russ initiated an investigation into alleged irregularities in the manner in which floyd was performing his duties as principal at achs.on october,floyd was suspended from his position as principal pending russ investigation,and on november,russ notified floyd by letter that he was being terminated for the following reasons 
improperly charging students a fee for alleged tobacco violations.further,in addition to the imposition of this punitive fee,the alleged violators have been improperly suspended from school until the fee was paid.additionally,none of the fees have been accounted for to this date to this office after repeated requests.
numerous inaccuracies,additions,in the cumulative records of amite county students which you signed.
removing the physical science course from the curriculum without authorization.
holding track and field events on public school property for private groups without fully explaining to the board the details of these activities.
failure to fulfill your duties as a full time principal by spending an inordinate amount of time on activities unrelated to your contractual responsibilities.
failure to timely complete student schedules for the school year.
pursuant to mississippi code annotated,floyd sought a due process hearing before the school board,which was conducted over the course of several days by an independent hearing officer in march and april of.on july,the school board,after reviewing the hearing transcripts and the hearing officer report,issued a unanimous opinion that floyd dismissal was a proper employment decision and not contrary to law.pursuant to mississippi code annotated,floyd appealed to the amite county chancery court,which ruled on october,that the school board decision was not supported by substantial evidence and therefore reinstated floyd.the school district and the school board appealed to the mississippi court of appeals,which,in an en banc opinion issued on november,reversed the chancery court,finding that there was sufficient evidence to support floyd termination on grounds one tobacco policy,two inaccurate records,and six school scheduling listed in russ letter.floyd filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the mississippi supreme court,which was eventually denied on august.
meanwhile,floyd was also pursuing relief in federal court.on october,while his appeal was pending before the mississippi chancery court,floyd filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc.on november,floyd received a right to sue letter.on february,while his petition for writ of certiorari was pending before the mississippi supreme court,floyd filed the action underlying this appeal in the district court.in his complaint,floyd alleged that his termination was the product of racial animus toward coach floyd resulting from assisting the caucasian in violation of title vii.floyd also asserted the following state law claims breach of contract negligent intentional infliction of emotional and mental distress civil conspiracy defamation tortious interference with contract and trespass to chattels.finally,in his prayer for relief,floyd mentioned,demanding a judgment d eclaring that defendants violation his rights to nondiscriminatory treatment under the fourteenth amendment and,et.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that floyd claims were precluded under the doctrine of res judicata.the district court denied the motion,finding that floyd did not have sufficient opportunity to raise his discrimination claims in the state proceedings.later,the district court granted defendant subsequent motion for summary judgment on the merits.floyd appeals.
the district court decided all issues in this case on the defendants motion for summary judgment we review a grant of summary judgment de novo under the same standard applied by the district court.dutcher ingalls shipbuilding,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.fact questions are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and questions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
floyd first challenges the district court dismissal of his title vii claim on the basis that it was not filed timely.in order to file suit under title vii,requires that a plaintiff file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.russ suspended floyd on october,and sent him the termination letter on november.however,the school board did not affirm that decision until july.floyd filed the charge with the eeoc on october.therefore,floyd charge was timely only if we conclude that the school board decision was the relevant alleged unlawful employment practice for purposes of commencing the limitations period.
the district court concluded that the relevant employment decision was floyd termination by russ on november.because over one hundred and eighty days passed between that date and the date floyd filed the charge with the eeoc,the district court concluded that floyd claim was.the district court relied on delaware state college ricks,in which the supreme court held that the pendency of a grievance,or some other method of collateral review of an employment decision,does not toll the running of the limitations periods,d.under this approach,russ termination of floyd,not the school board decision on appeal,commenced the limitations period.
however,two key factors distinguish this case from ricks.first,the supreme court in ricks carefully examined the plaintiff complaint to specifically identify the unlawful employment practice being alleged.id.at.further,the supreme court acknowledged the possibility that a continuing violation of title vii might delay the running of the limitations period.id.at.in ricks,the plaintiff was denied tenure and terminated as a matter of course over a year later,but he only alleged di
