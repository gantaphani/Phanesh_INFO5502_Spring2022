on behalf of a class of california public school students and their parents,angel appeals from the district court judgment,entered after a bench trial,dismissing plaintiffs claim that california proposition,which replaces bilingual education programs with a curricular program designed to teach students in english,facially violates the equal protection clause of the united states constitution.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
on june,california voters approved proposition by a margin of to percent.declaring that t he government and the public schools of california have a moral obligation and a constitutional duty to provide all of california children with the skills necessary to become productive members of our society,and of these skills,literacy in the english language is among the most important,proposition dismantled california public school bilingual education programs,which taught limited english proficient lep students in their native language.
proposition replaces bilingual education with a system of structured english immersion,in which children are taught english by being taught in english.the initiative provides that lep students of similar english proficiency be taught together and that c hildren who are english learners shall be educated through sheltered english immersion during a temporary transition period not normally intended to exceed one year.once lep students become proficient in english,they are transferred into mainstream english language classrooms.
proposition allows lep students to receive waivers from english immersion in three circumstances i when the student already knows english ii when the student is years old or older and the school agrees that an alternative curriculum would better serve the student english education or iii when the student has tried the immersion program for at least days,the school agrees that the child has special physical,emotional,psychological,or educational needs,and an alternative curriculum would better serve the student educational development.students who qualify for waiver may be transferred to classes where they are taught english and other subjects through bilingual education techniques or other generally recognized educational methodologies permitted by law.under no circumstances,however,can a student receive a waiver without parental consent.
finally,proposition restricts the circumstances in which it can be amended the provisions of this act may be amended by a statute that becomes effective upon approval by the electorate or by a statute to further the act purpose passed by a vote of each house of the legislature and signed by the governor.
the day after proposition passed,plaintiffs filed this action plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin implementation of proposition pendente lite,which the district court denied.valeria wilson,d.after trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants.plaintiffs timely appeal.

iii.discussion 
we must decide whether the elimination of bilingual education in california public schools by proposition,which also mandates that any future change in how english is taught to lep students requires action,violates the equal protection clause.
conventional equal protection analysis focuses on whether the government has classified individuals on the basis of impermissible criteria.while most laws classify individuals in one way or another,legislative classifications typically survive judicial scrutiny so long as they are rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.however,governmental actions that classify persons by race,adarand constructors,pena,d,or that are facially neutral but motivated by discriminatory racial purpose,washington davis,d,are subject to strict judicial scrutiny.
under this conventional approach,proposition easily avoids the application of strict scrutiny.nowhere does the text of proposition explicitly mention racial minorities generally,or any racial minority in particular.rather,the initiative merely provides that children in california public schools shall be taught in english.furthermore,the record is devoid of any evidence that proposition was crafted from racial animus.
plaintiffs,however,assert a constitutional violation grounded in political structure equal protection analysis.relying on the supreme court pronouncements in hunter erickson,d,and washington seattle sch,d,plaintiffs contend that proposition unconstitutionally restructures the political process by placing over bilingual education,and only bilingual education,at the level 
in hunter,the court reviewed an akron,ohio,city charter amendment requiring that housing ordinances,which regulated real estate transactions on the basis of race,color,religion,national origin,or ancestry,be approved by a majority of city voters rather than simply by the city council.at.this law disadvantaged those who would benefit from laws barring racial discrimination in the real estate market as opposed to those who would benefit from other regulations of the real estate market.id.at.in light of this differential treatment,the court concluded that the akron charter amendment embodied an explicitly racial classification treating racial housing matters differently from other racial and housing matters.id.at.absent a compelling state interest,the court held that the state may no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person vote or give any group a smaller representation than another of comparable size.id.at.
the court applied hunter political structure equal protection analysis a decade later in seattle.there,the court examined the constitutionality of washington initiative,a statewide initiative that barred school boards from assigning students beyond their neighborhood schools.while facially neutral,initiative contained several broad exceptions that essentially operated to preclude only desegregative busing.seattle,at.in concluding that initiative was effectively drawn for racial purposes,id.at,the court considered the text of the initiative,the representations of its proponents,the initiative practical effect,and its popular perception.id.the court held that initiative differentiated between the treatment of problems involving racial matters and that afforded other problems in the same area,id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted,and that this differentiation burdened minorities by lodging decisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote level of government.id.at.the court concluded that initiative must fall because it does not attemp t to allocate governmental power on the basis of any general principle.instead,it uses the racial nature of an issue to define the governmental decisionmaking structure,and thus imposes substantial and unique burdens on racial minorities.id.at.citations and internal quotations marks omitted.under this political structure analysis,reallocation of political decision making violates equal protection only when there is evidence of purposeful racial discrimination.be it an overt racial classification or a context of discernible racial animus,constitutional political structure analysis resembles conventional equal protection analysis in that demonstrable evidence of purposeful racial discrimination is required.seattle,at.p urposeful discrimination is the condition that offends the constitution thus,when facially neutral legislation is subjected to equal protection attack,an inquiry into intent is necessary to determine whether the legislation in some sense was designed to accord disparate treatment on the basis of racial considerations.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
