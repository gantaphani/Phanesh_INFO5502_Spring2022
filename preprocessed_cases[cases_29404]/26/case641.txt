this case concerns the corrupt,machiavellian world of permit parking at the university of illinois campus,and the ill fortune of a student who became involved in it.lonnell brewer claims that he was fired from his student job at a university personnel office and subsequently booted from a master degree program because one of his supervisors at the personnel office,kerrin thompson,failed to tell her supervisor that she had given brewer permission to park his car in a certain university parking lot.thompson kept silent about this,says brewer,because brewer is black and she wanted him fired,putting the university in violation of titles vi and vii of the civil rights act of.the university admits that brewer was fired for modifying a university parking tag,but claims that his termination from the master program was only for his poor academic performance and denies that any decision attributable to it was motivated by race.the district court granted the university summary judgment on brewer claims.brewer appeals.we affirm.
background 
we begin by recounting lonnell brewer strange tale of intrigue because he appeals from a grant of summary judgment we resolve all conflicts in the evidence and draw all permissible inferences in his favor.berger axa network llc,cir.brewer career at the university of illinois at started well enough.already armed with a bachelor degree in psychology,he enrolled in the university psychology program in the fall of.after completing two years of study he decided not to pursue the and instead to transfer to the master degree program at the university institute of labor and industrial relations ilir.upon transferring he received financial aid and also an ilir research assistantship under which he would receive a stipend for working ten hours each week at the university personnel services office pso.
brewer alleges a complicated trail of causation that leads back and forth between actors and events at these two institutions.consequently,our tale must jump back and forth between the pso and the ilir to follow his story.
brewer work at the pso in early fall 
brewer claims that his troubles began at the pso with one of his supervisors,kerrin thompson,assistant to pso director denise hendricks both of whom are white.in early september,on the first day of his research assistantship,brewer met with thompson and learned that he would be working on part of a large survey.they discussed the requirements of the assistantship,among them the time and dress expected flexible hours to allow brewer to schedule interviews with prospective employers casual dress,with jeans specifically acceptable.thompson also explained where brewer could park when working at the pso,a topic of eventual great importance.brewer says that thompson gave him a temporary university parking tag and 
kind of gestured you can park here indicating,park there indicating,and,you know,i was in her office so i was really oriented as to where that meant,but basically she pointed to all the different spots in the building,so it was almost a degree kind of gesture,indicating to me that i could pretty much park anywhere at the pso as long as i had my tag on my mirror.brewer dep.at.
trouble began to develop between thompson and brewer on october or,ostensibly when thompson learned that brewer fiancee was white.from that point on,thompson posture became noticeably and increasingly hostile brewer dep.ex.at,and she did things to embarrass brewer and make working at the pso difficult for him.for instance,she would sometimes go around the office asking if anyone knew where brewer was,even on days when he was not supposed to be in the office,and she refused to let brewer work to take advantage of software for the blind and dyslexic that reads words aloud 
on october or,brewer received a warning from elyne cole,the pso director of employment services who is black about a person who you think is your friend who was in fact an enemy.brewer dep.ex.at.brewer pressed for more information.while she was reluctant to talk at first,cole eventually revealed that thompson was a racist and that cole had overheard thompson saying disparaging things about brewer,such as that he lacked urgency about his work.cole warned brewer that thompson had a lot of influence with hendricks and urged brewer to start recording the times he was present and working at the pso,even though there was no formal requirement that he do so.brewer followed her advice,having a secretary verify and sign his record 
brewer studies at the ilir in early fall 
meanwhile,brewer was beginning a very ambitious program of study at the ilir.normally,students would complete the ilir program in three semesters brewer hoped to complete the program more quickly through a combination of an unusually demanding schedule,a waiver of one requirement and summer courses.a student could not enroll in more than four courses per semester without an advisor permission,but brewer persuaded his advisor,michael leroy,to permit him to enroll in five courses for the fall semester.another one of brewer professors,wallace hendricks husband to pso director denise hendricks,urged brewer not to do this,saying that such a hectic schedule would not allow brewer to take full advantage of the program,especially in light of the time he was scheduled to work at the pso.
brewer research assistantship at the pso was awarded and sponsored by the ilir,and throughout the fall semester there were signs that the ilir faculty was aware of brewer performance in the assistantship,and more specifically thompson opinion of it.for instance,professor wallace hendricks once told brewer that thompson thought brewer had missed a day of work and that he should stop wearing jeans at work.
blown pso deadline in late fall 
wallace hendricks warning against the schedule turned out to be.when the fall semester neared its end,the combination of five classes,the pso assistantship and additional extracurricular activity worked brewer to the bone,and the time constraints he faced proved too demanding.when asked early in the semester to pick a deadline for his portion of the survey at the pso,brewer had chosen the final friday before finals week.he had thought that by completing the project on that day he would be free to devote himself to studying before and during his finals.but the deadline came and his project was not quite ready.after speaking with his project supervisor,judy baker,he agreed to complete the project over the weekend and submit it on monday.
that same friday,thompson and hendricks separately spoke to brewer about the missed deadline and what they believed were other performance problems.thompson told brewer that he lacked initiative and motivation and had not been working enough brewer argued with her,showing her his unofficial timesheet and saying he missed the deadline because she did not let him use the dyslexia software.brewer dep.ex at.later,brewer met with hendricks,who said that she had talked with ilir director peter feuille and was considering terminating brewer assistantship with feuille support.she considered the blown deadline serious and further reported that thompson thought brewer was working his ten hours a week.brewer offered to show hendricks his unofficial timesheet but she declined to view it.she stated that she had been excited to have a minority working at the pso,but was disappointed by the blown deadline because the first thing i thought when kerrin thompson told me was what a waste.brewer dep.ex.at.
on monday,brewer submitted his portion of the survey to baker as arranged.when hendricks saw the project she was pleased with it and decided to keep brewer on,saying that she had suspected the project was in worse shape than it was and acted hastily.
ilir finals in late fall 
brewer time crunch was not yet over indeed,brewer had been forced to split his focus between studying and the pso situation in the days before finals.he had to ask leroy for extensions on papers in two different classes leroy assigned penalties on each paper.brewer also received an extension without penalty in a class under professor joseph martoccio.all of brewer final exam grades were quite poor for instance,he wrote the exam in wallace hendricks quantitative methods course.his overall semester grades took a nosedive.
but inadequate preparation time was brewer only problem he received word that his professors graded him down because of his troubles at the pso.one of wallace hendricks ta informed brewer that hendricks had insisted on giving brewer a c because of what happened there brewer dep.ex.at,and leroy told brewer that his was more severe than normal in part because your performance at the pso has somewhat called into question your credibility brewer dep.ex.at.
brewer finished the fall semester with a gpa of.the minimum cumulative gpa expected of ilir students is.if a person goes two semesters with a cumulative gpa of less than,they are generally dropped from the master program.in january,leroy,acting in his capacity as head of the committee,wrote to inform brewer of this danger and recommend that he take a light,schedule next semester to improve his gpa.on january,feuille wrote brewer to express his disappointment at brewer failure to complete the pso project on time and warn him that his work and academic trouble were both caused by his excessive class load.
parking scandal and firing from the pso in spring 
brewer took only three classes in spring.he still suffered at the pso under thompson,but he experienced no major crises like the blown deadline at the end of the fall semester.
nonetheless,brewer job was jeopardized by a strange parking scandal.one day in early april,possibly april,brewer car was ticketed because the temporary parking tag thompson had given him at the start of the fall semester broke and fell off his rearview mirror.the tag was and purported to grant permission to park in either the pso or the ilir lots.brewer basically admits that he wrote the lot permission on the tag himself,without anyone explicit permission to do so brewer took the tag to university parking services to have it replaced,but a clerk looked up the pso application for the tag and discovered that it contained inaccurate information.parking services suspected that brewer was not entitled to park anywhere at all,and issued him another temporary parking tag pending further investigation.
when brewer arrived at work the next day,he went to speak with thompson about the parking tag.as soon as he entered her office she announced i know what you did.brewer dep.ex.at.irate,thompson explained that brewer was indeed not supposed to have a parking tag and that he should not have gone to parking services.she said that the pso trust s me to give parking tags to the type of people that can be trusted brewer dep.ex.at,and that she had lied on the application to get brewer a tag.brewer indiscretion could cost him his job,as hendricks had already talked to the ilir about the incident.
brewer reminded thompson that she had told him to park anywhere and a heated argument erupted,during which thompson became quite upset.she stated that she was through with you people and that brewer was a smart one.brewer dep.ex.at.she ordered brewer to retrieve the troublesome parking tag when he turned to leave her office she yelled,i have had it with you nigger,get my tag brewer dep.ex.at.
some time later,brewer went to speak with hendricks.she told him that i and i alone have decided to terminate your assistantship.brewer dep.ex.at.although the parking tag issue did not merit termination in the abstract,hendricks said the pso had a special relationship with parking services and feared that she would lose parking flexibility unless she fired someone.if the special relationship fell apart,the pso would have to pay an additional one thousand dollars a year for the parking it was currently using.brewer dep.at id.ex.at.
brewer told hendricks that thompson gave him permission to park in the lot.he also said that thompson could not be trusted to confirm this because she was a racist and wanted him fired,relating the things thompson had said in their meeting.hendricks replied that she did know whether thompson had said such things to brewer,but that at any rate it was an issue solely between thompson and brewer.because brewer admitted to taking the altered tag to parking services,he should be fired.
because it will prove important,we also set out hendricks testimony concerning the parking scandal.hendricks claimed she fired brewer for adulterating the parking tag.hendricks dep.at.thompson told her parking services was upset because brewer wrote on the tag,and she decided to fire brewer after inspecting the tag and verifying the addition for herself.she did not talk to brewer before reaching her decision and in fact never talked to him about the parking fiasco at all.she testified that if brewer had told her that thompson told him to add to the tag,that would have led to further conversation.id.at.if brewer had told her about thompson racist language,she would have taken that very seriously.when asked whether such language would give her reason to distrust thompson with regard to brewer,she replied,i think i would have very great difficulty in answering that question.it has too many components to it,and that would be one that i would have to deal with the facts of the situation.id.at.
brewer was fired from the pso effective april.the ilir terminated his research assistantship and the financial aid that went with it that same day.
termination from the ilir program in spring 
although brewer limited himself to three classes in the spring semester,his cumulative gpa at the end of the semester was,still short of the required.ilir policy dictates that students with a cumulative gpa of less than after two semesters should be dropped from the program absent extraordinarily compelling circumstances.brewer dep.ex.at.ilir director feuille applied the rule and gave brewer the boot.leroy later told brewer that the committee recommended to feuille that brewer be retained because his poor grades were the result of his heavy workload rather than a reflection of poor ability however,director feuille rejected its recommendation based on the incident at the pso.brewer dep.ex.at.
legal action 
brewer then brought the present action against the university,arguing,among other things,that he was fired from the pso because of his race,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,that he was dropped from the ilir program because of his race,in violation of title vi,and that pso employees said unfavorable things about him to ilir faculty in retaliation for his complaints about thompson racism,in violation of title vii.the university moved for summary judgment.in response,brewer argued both that the evidence established a prima facie case for all three of his claims under the framework,and that even without the benefit of a jury could still reasonably believe that his firing and termination from the master program had been racially motivated.he noted that hendricks,feuille and others frequently made reference to his race,which he claimed showed that the university held black students and employees to higher standards than others.alternately,he argued,a jury could conclude that thompson failure to reveal that she told brewer to park anywhere was responsible for everything her silence got brewer fired and the firing got brewer dropped from the master program.the district court granted summary judgment to the university.brewer now appeals.

title vii firing from the personnel services office 
first,brewer claims that his firing from the pso violated title vii of the civil rights act of.among other things,title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race.a.acting because of race means acting with a racially discriminatory reason in mind.jordan city of gary,cir hildebrandt.of natural resources,cir.
a plaintiff can avoid summary judgment in two ways the method first established in green,d,often called the indirect method of proof,or the conventional method of presenting a convincing mosaic of direct or circumstantial evidence that could permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the employer acted with discriminatory intent,often called the direct method of proof jordan,at.brewer seeks to proceed using both methods of proof.
indirect method of proof 
under the indirect method of proof,the defendant seeking summary judgment must offer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of discrimination.burks.of,cir.to make out a prima facie case,brewer must show that he was a member of a protected class,he was qualified for his position at the pso and met the pso legitimate expectations,he suffered an adverse employment action that is,an unfavorable material change in the terms,conditions,or privileges of his employment,and members were treated more favorably than he.id.if a prima facie case has been shown and the defendant offers a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the suggested reason is mere pretext for discrimination.id.
in the present case,it does matter whether brewer has presented a prima facie case the university has offered a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for his firing the parking scandal,and brewer argument that this reason was not in fact nondiscriminatory will be addressed below in connection with the direct method of proof.see mary honor center hicks,d holding that once a defendant comes forward with a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions,the framework simply drops out of the picture nawrot cpc,cir king preferred technical group,cir.even if the prima facie case were important,brewer makes no effort to show that any other employee stood accused of anything similar to missing an important deadline or committing a parking indiscretion,and consequently has failed to show that he was treated worse than a similarly situated employee who was not black.humphries cbocs west,cir hull stoughton trailers,llc,cir 
direct method of proof 
because brewer does not succeed under the indirect method of proof,we move on to the direct.brewer first argument here is that hendricks subjected him to heightened scrutiny because he was black,observing that hendricks frequently mentioned brewer race and in particular often noted that he was the first male to hold the ilir research assistantship at the pso.but while superficially neutral comments about an employee race might suggest racial animus in an incriminating context,see,phaup bottlers,brewer offers no reason to think hendricks comments were anything but positive.to the contrary,hendricks said she was excited to have a minority in the assistantship brewer dep.ex.at and wanted to see minorities succeed id.at.brewer also claims that a later remark by feuille that brewer poor performance had ruined it for everyone else indicates that hendricks had decided to never again hire a black research assistant,but it would be pure speculation to conclude that the comment refers to race.brewer dep.at.feuille was concerned that poor student performance might lead the pso to discontinue the research assistantship program as it eventually did,though apparently not because of brewer.no jury could conclude that hendricks was herself biased against brewer because of his race.
this leaves brewer argument that the university violated title vii because thompson,acting for racial reasons,got brewer fired by failing to reveal to hendricks that she told brewer he could park anywhere.thompson remarks to brewer would clearly permit a jury to conclude that she acted as she did for racial reasons.see,hemsworth,cir distinguishing stray remarks from relevant racial comments.thompson did not discharge brewer,so no liability could arise on that score.a.but title vii also prohibits discriminat ing against any individual with respect to his terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.id.courts limit that language to reach only material,sufficiently important alterations of the employment relationship often referred to as adverse employment actions.minor centocor,cir see also city of chicago,cir listing types of adverse employment actions that can give rise to a title vii violation.
in and of itself,whether other employees speak ill or spread rumor about one is not a very important aspect of one employment,so long as such behavior is not severe or pervasive.lucas chicago transit authority,cir city of chicago,cir smart ball state,cir.but in the right performance review,for one employee says or does say about another will control an employee wages and chances for promotion,or may even get an employee fired.consequently,we have held that where an employee without formal authority to materially alter the terms and conditions of a plaintiff employment nonetheless uses her singular influence over an employee who does have such power to harm the plaintiff for racial reasons,the actions of the employee without formal authority are imputed to the employer and the employer is in violation of title vii.rozskowiak village of arlington heights,cir,citing hunt city of markham,cir.in some situations,the influence can be exercised by supplying misinformation or failing to provide relevant information to the person making the employment decision.see,david caterpillar,cir wallace smc pneumatics,cir.
in the present case,a jury could conclude that thompson withheld relevant information from hendricks,and as a result had some influence over hendricks decision to fire brewer.a jury would have trouble doing so if it chose to believe brewer account of the parking scandal.thompson could have told hendricks that brewer modification of the parking tag was an honest mistake,but according to brewer hendricks did not fire him because he was dishonest or broke the parking rules.indeed,the pso itself was cheating university parking services out of a thousand dollars a year.hendricks fired brewer simply because someone had to be fired to keep parking services from looking too closely at the pso tag applications.brewer was the natural choice the incriminating parking tag was his,and as a student research assistant the pso would have to replace him in a few months anyway.given the cynical but motive brewer ascribes to hendricks it was irrelevant where thompson told brewer to park,and thompson failure to reveal the facts did not affect hendricks decision.
ironically,the jury could find thompson affected the decision if it believed hendricks version of events.hendricks claims she fired brewer for dishonestly altering his parking tag and suggested that she might have changed her mind if the alteration were an honest mistake.the jury could believe that the alteration was an honest mistake,that thompson knew it and that she failed to tell hendricks.if that is the case,thompson had influence over brewer firing if she had talked,it might not have happened.
but it is not enough just to have some minimal amount of influence did thompson have the singular influence required by rozskowiak for a nominal influence to put an employer in violation of title vii,the employee must possess so much influence as to basically be herself the true functional.little.of revenue,cir.the nominal must be nothing more than the functional cat paw.shager upjohn,cir.a good example of such a degree of influence and one which will offer a revealing comparison to the present case is where the party nominally responsible for a decision is,by virtue of her role in the company,totally dependent on another employee to supply the information on which to base that decision.in such a case the employee that selects,colors and supplies the information has such power over the nominal decision maker that she is in fact the true,functional decision maker.mere paper review of the informer recommendation will not shield the employer from liability if her recommendation is racially motivated.gusman unisys,cir see also david,at holding that liability can be based on the bias of employees who have the duty to recommend other employees for promotion,where the decision maker said he received the necessary information for decisions from those recommending employees thorn sundstrand aerospace,cir describing perfunctory review by an internal committee that asked limited questions of the recommender and suggesting that the committee was a liability shield invented by lawyers shager,at describing brief,perfunctory deliberations of a committee apt to defer to the judgment of an employee immediate supervisor in making employment decisions.
by contrast,where a decision maker is not wholly dependent on a single source of information,but instead conducts its own investigation into the facts relevant to the decision,the employer is not liable for an employee submission of misinformation to the decision maker.byrd.of public health,cir willis marion county auditor office.it does not matter that in a particular situation much of the information has come from a single,potentially biased source,so long as the decision maker does not artificially or by virtue of her role in the company limit her investigation to information from that source.for instance,we have frequently dealt with employees that claim they were framed for misconduct by a racist coworker or superior,which caused the employee in question to be fired.even though the employer in such situations must often decide what to do based on nothing more than the conflicting stories of two different employees,the employer will not be liable for the racism of the alleged artist so long as it independently considers both stories.lucas chicago transit authority,cir alexander.of health and family,cir eiland trinity,cir willis,at.
in eiland,for instance,the plaintiff nurse was fired after a staff physician reported that she injected a pregnant woman with a vaccine without following proper procedure.the plaintiff sued,claiming that the staff physician had racial animus against her and had made the report to get her fired.we held that even assuming the staff physician had made the story up,there had still been no violation of title vii.the supervisor who fired her acted only after reading the staff physician incident report,speaking with another supervisor and confronting the plaintiff herself with the allegations.the supervisor had thus acted independently and only after she evaluated the circumstances,including the plaintiff version.id.at.
we confronted a similar situation in willis,where the plaintiff willis was fired after tardily processed invoices were repeatedly found in her files.at.willis claimed that her supervisor,conklin,bore racial animus against her and had planted the invoices to get her fired.conklin supervisor,mizen,sent willis a memorandum requesting more detail or other information supporting her claims against conklin.willis did not provide any.she was reprimanded and eventually fired.id.willis sued,claiming that conklin had violated title vii by planting the files.we held that no rational jury could have found that mizen acted as conklin cat paw or rubber stamp.mizen proactive involvement in investigating the circumstances surrounding the invoices,including a serious investigation of willis allegations,were sufficient to absolve the employer of liability for conklin.id.at.
brewer case is not distinguishable from these cases in which an independent investigation absolves the employer of liability.though thompson,as hendricks assistant,might have effective control over some of hendricks decisions,the decision to fire brewer was not one of them.hendricks listened to the information thompson relayed to her but did not simply rely on it.instead,she examined the parking tag herself and confirmed that it had been altered.true,hendricks did not investigate the possibility that thompson was holding back relevant information,but according to hendricks,and unlike in willis,brewer never claimed that thompson was holding anything back.no one has suggested that brewer was unable to bring such a claim to hendricks attention,and until he did so hendricks had no reason to suspect that there were additional relevant facts that she had not investigated.faragher city of boca raton,d holding that an employer is not liable for an employee sexual harassment where the plaintiff failed to take advantage of corrective opportunities,such as a complaint procedure jackson county of racine,cir erickson.of,cir.hendricks therefore conducted an independent investigation that absolved the university of liability for any deception on thompson part.
although brewer has not brought the relevant cases to our attention,our approach to title vii cases involving an employee influence over a decision maker has not always been completely clear.our opinions have sometimes suggested that not only significant influence,but any influence over an employment decision is sufficient to impose title vii liability on an employer.many such instances simply involve imprecise language.see,sun bd.of trustees of of,cir holding that a recommendation can taint multiple levels of administrative review dey colt constr.dev,cir holding that a subordinate discriminatory animus must affect the decision.but a few instances clearly involve more than loose language.for instance,lust sealy openly rejected the view that an employee limited influence is not enough to impute the discriminatory motives of the subordinate to the supervisor,cir.if the would not have turned down the plaintiff for the promotion had it not been for a nominal subordinate recommendation then the nominal subordinate sexism was a cause of the plaintiff injury,whether or not the could reasonably be thought a mere cat paw.id.
these dicta are doubtful.they are at odds with numerous cases in which we have upheld summary judgment despite a racist employee potential but slight influence over an employment decision.see,rozskowiak,at upholding summary judgment where an allegedly biased employee was on a committee that recommended the plaintiff firing cerutti basf,cir upholding summary judgment where two allegedly biased employees were members of an employee selection committee maarouf walker,cir upholding summary judgment where a biased manager was one of several managers reporting unfavorably on the plaintiff work.
even if we were to assume that a lesser degree of influence over an employment decision might trigger title vii liability in other contexts,such as the context of a regularized,formal performance evaluation,we do not think that such an approach can affect the outcome in a case like this that concerns an employee discipline for particular misconduct.the line of cases addressing this particular situation is univocal,and indicates that even where a biased employee may have leveled false charges of misconduct against the plaintiff,the employer does not face title vii liability so long as the decision maker independently investigates the claims before acting.
requiring only an independent investigation of misconduct charges makes good sense in light of the practical realities that an employer often faces when addressing such charges.title vii is informed by traditional principles of agency law,see a,burlington,ellerth,d faragher city of boca raton,d,but those principles should be applied in light of the practical reasons for imposing liability on employers.faragher,at.see also burlington,at.holding that principles may not be transferable in all their particulars to title vii.title vii primary objective is not to provide redress but to avoid harm by giving employers an incentive to control their employees.erickson.of,cir see also burlington,at.title vii is designed to encourage the creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms.consequently,employers should be liable for their employees racism only in the general class of cases in which an employer has the
