byx is a national fraternity founded in.it has chapters in nine states.according to its constitution,it exists for the purpose of establishing brotherhood and unity among college men based on the common bond of jesus christ.byx espouses a strict approach to the christian faith,and membership in the fraternity is contingent upon what the fraternity deems a credible profession of faith in jesus christ.this requires agreement not only with the traditional core christian beliefs and values contained in such ancient expressions as the nicene creed,but adherence to a demanding view of the faith.in its doctrinal statement,byx explains that members must believe that the bible is god written revelation to man,that it is inspired,authoritative,and without error in the original manuscripts.accordingly,byx bars from membership roman catholics,and adherents to the traditional christian orthodoxy taught by the mainline protestant denominations.
byx also demands moral and sexual purity.according to its code of conduct,byx believes that sex is a gift of god to be enjoyed inside the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman.therefore,we will not condone such activity as homosexuality,fornication,or adultery.
persons seeking membership in the fraternity are interviewed by a panel of at least three chapter officers.the officers ask the applicant a series of questions about his christian beliefs and willingness to agree with and adhere to byx statement of faith,purpose,and code of conduct.an applicant is admitted as a pledge only after all presiding chapter officers agree the applicant has demonstrated an agreement with byx viewpoint on the christian faith and a willingness to conform to the organization code of conduct.
after admission into the fraternity as a pledge,the applicant must complete the pledge process.the purpose of the pledge process is to examine the applicant understanding of salvation,his personal relationship with jesus christ,and his willingness to accept and promote byx doctrine.as part of the process,the pledge must participate in byx brother program and is assigned to an active member of the fraternity who serves as the pledge big brother.the big brother is required to watch over the pledge and ensure that he is conducting himself in conformity with the fraternity code of conduct.ideological,theological,and moral purity are central elements of byx foundational purpose,and the big brother program is designed as a safeguard against the pledge going astray.as byx constitution states,
byx has fulfilled its purpose over the years,and satan hates it.he wants to sift this group like wheat and is roaming on campus like a roaring lion waiting for the chance to destroy us.if the devil sifts our group,he will probably do it primarily through alcohol,but also through sexual impurity or lust,pride,laziness,and contention.so be on your guard.
the big brother is the first line of defense against such impurities and influences infiltrating the group.
after completing the pledgeship,the pledge becomes a member of the fraternity.he is then eligible to stand for election to chapter officer positions,vote for chapter officers,serve as a big brother who can mentor and hold others accountable to the moral standards established by the group,and participate in the general business of the organization.
all byx members and pledges participate in cell groups,which are weekly meetings where the members and pledges hold one another accountable to living consistently with byx christian beliefs and values.byx also holds weekly meetings,which include prayer,worship,encouragement of specific members,a testimony or bible message from a fraternity member,and announcements pertaining to fraternity business.
the university of florida permits and encourages student organizations to undergo its registration process and become registered student organizations rsos.according to the student organization handbook handbook,s tudent organizations are an essential part of the university of florida community and are an integral part of the total academic program.such organizations foster valuable experiences for students that lead to significant learning and development and create a sense of belonging.
currently,more than uf student groups are rsos.there are sixty religious rsos,of which are christian.
uf center for student activities and involvement csai is responsible for registering student organizations.to become an rso,a group must complete registration paperwork with the csai and fulfill certain requirements,select a unique name,describe the group purpose and activities,and have at least three members.the primary benefits of rso status are eligibility to apply to the student government for funding and priority use of some facilities.rsos are also afforded a number of channels through which they can communicate with the campus community.these include advertising in the highly trafficked wayne reitz union participating in the annual student organizations fair staffing an information table in front of the union appearing in lists of student organizations in uf publications,including uf website and hard copy publications and establishing an organizational website and address.
a student group may also choose to forego the registration process and exist as a group.while not afforded the full range of benefits of an rso,a group may nevertheless use campus facilities,distribute literature on campus,verbally express its views on campus,and recruit new members.
uf requires that rsos abide by the university nondiscrimination policy,as derived from uf regulation available at.edu chapter.pdf.the policy or handbook policy.the policy states that uf is committed to with respect to race,creed,color,religion,age,disability,sex,sexual orientation,marital status,national origin,political opinions or affiliations,and veteran status and states that t his commitment applies in all areas,including to students.the handbook explains the application of the policy to rsos 
a registered student organization may not discriminate against a member or prospective member on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,national origin,ancestry,age,marital status,disability,unfavorable discharge from the military,or status as a disabled veteran or veteran of the vietnam era,except as specifically exempted by law.likewise,among the individual discrimination prohibited by the university policy,but not by law,is sexual orientation.
unlike groups,rsos must have a constitution to demonstrate compliance with basic registration requirements.as of the academic year,each rso constitution must contain the following statement 
in compliance with the university of florida policy regulation name of organization will not discriminate on the basis of race,creed,color,religion,age,disability,sex,sexual orientation,marital status,national origin,political opinions or affiliations,and veteran status,national origin,political opinions or affiliations,and veteran status as protected under the vietnam era veteran readjustment assistance act.
under the handbook policy,an rso may not exclude a student from membership based upon his or her religious beliefs.however,when an rso selects its leaders it may consider whether the views of an officer candidate reflect those of the organization.uf provides student groups a guidance document,which offers the following as a permissible sample provision that may also be included in an rso constitution only an individual whose interests,views,and knowledge align with our organization religious purpose is eligible to run for office,as specified in our.
on march,byx founded a chapter at and thereafter requested the university to register the chapter so that it could receive the full range of benefits enjoyed by rsos.on may,the university denied byx request on the ground that because the fraternity would not allow women to join,byx was in violation of the policy prohibition against sex discrimination.in response,byx brought this lawsuit on july,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the university under on the ground that its refusal to register byx chapter has denied the chapter rights guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments.
after the university responded to its complaint,byx located and formally affiliated its chapter with a sorority,theta alpha.the university concluded that the affiliation with theta alpha satisfied its concern over sex discrimination but nevertheless denied the chapter registration because byx refused to state in its constitution that it would not discriminate on the basis of creed or religion.the university determined that byx stringent membership requirements amounted to religious discrimination in violation of the handbook policy.
on october,byx amended its complaint to address uf new rationale for denying registration the amended complaint contained five counts,all based on the university refusal to afford the fraternity full rso status and asserting a violation of first amendment rights.count i alleged that the refusal infringed the fraternity right to freedom of expressive association.count ii alleged infringement of the right to freedom of intimate association.count iii alleged infringement of the right to free speech.count iv alleged infringement of the right to free exercise of religion.count v alleged that the university was denying the fraternity equal protection of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment.for relief,in addition to a declaration that uf had infringed its rights as asserted in these counts,byx sought a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering uf to grant its chapter registered student organization status and prohibiting uf from withholding the rights,privileges,benefits,or incidents of registered status from byx and from retaliating against byx and its members directly or indirectly for exercising their constitutional rights.
on october,byx filed a motion for preliminary injunction.in its motion,byx claimed that because uf had denied its chapter rso status during fall rush,it was unable to advertise or host any of its rush meetings or activities on campus.as a result,the chapter was only able to recruit three new pledges,whereas other christian fraternities were able to recruit substantially greater numbers.it asked the court to provide injunctive relief to ensure the fraternity would be able to attain rso status and thereby fully participate in spring rush.as for the legal basis of the motion,byx asserted that it was unconstitutional and illogical to create a public forum that includes organizations organized around specific religious principles but not allow those organizations to accept or exclude members based on that faith.it also claimed that uf enforcement of its nondiscrimination policy was designed to induce byx to alter its membership standards and force it to abandon its core beliefs.this,according to byx,would unduly and unconstitutionally burden its members ability to express their beliefs and give effect to the fraternity stated purpose.
the university opposed byx motion,arguing that byx was not hindered in its recruitment efforts on account of the status of its chapter as an unregistered organization.it claimed that the chapter was able to communicate with uf students during fall rush by advertising itself in student areas and by using online social networking sites like facebook.the university also pointed out that the chapter was able to use the orange and brew coffee shop,located on campus,for its weekly cell groups,and noted that it had held several events around campus and had participated in intramural sports.the university also claimed that byx had mischaracterized the case as a forced inclusion case.it argued that it had not forced byx to include unwanted members instead,uf claimed that it had simply conditioned the fraternity registration as an would allow the chapter to apply for funding and provide it with priority access to facilities and channels of compliance with uf nondiscrimination policy.
on may,over seven months after byx filed its motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court entered an order denying the motion.in its order,the court rejected byx expressive association and viewpoint discrimination claims.the court found no evidence that the handbook policy would significantly affect byx ability to express or privately.machen,d at.the court also found no evidence that the mere presence of in byx will prevent the other members from fostering unity and encouraging each other in their christian walk.id.as for byx viewpoint discrimination claim,the court noted that uf had registered numerous christian organizations,but,unlike byx,these christian organizations had agreed to comply with the university nondiscrimination policy.this fact alone,in the court view,demonstrated that viewpoint discrimination was not the rationale for uf decision.id.at.
on june,byx filed a notice of appeal challenging the district court may order,and moved this court for an injunction pending appeal.on july,a panel of this court entered an order granting byx motion and an injunction issued 
on january,after we heard oral argument,the university announced that it had modified the handbook policy relating to the registration of student organizations and had registered byx as an rso.the handbook policy,as modified,provides 
student organizations that wish to register with the center for student activities and involvement csai must agree that they will not discriminate on the basis of race,creed,color,religion,age,disability,sex,sexual orientation,marital status,national origin,political opinions or affiliations,or veteran status as protected under the vietnam era veteran readjustment assistance act.
a student organization whose primary purpose is religious will not be denied registration as a registered student organization on the ground that it limits membership or leadership positions to students who share the religious beliefs of the organization.the university has determined that this accommodation of religious belief does not violate its nondiscrimination policy.
the modified policy emphasis added.this statement is in effect and is reflected in the csai handbook of activities and csai registration and constitution guidelines and website.
under the modified policy,the byx chapter is considered a student organization whose primary purpose is religious.thus,the fact that byx limits membership or leadership positions to students that share the religious beliefs of the organization is no limitation to registration as an rso.accordingly,the fraternity,having been duly registered as an rso,now enjoys the same benefits offered to all other rsos at the university.given this turn of events,the university moved this court to dismiss this appeal for mootness.
byx is not satisfied with this result,however,and urges us to reach the merits of its constitutional claims.it ardently presses us to retain jurisdiction over this case because the university has failed to change the regulation from which the csai handbook nondiscrimination policy derived uf regulation the regulation.furthermore,byx is troubled by uf timing.it contends that the timing of uf motion to dismiss this appeal indicates that it is motivated not by a genuine change of hear
