the question in this appeal is whether two state local school site councils and advisory committees for certain educational programs to prepare and post an agenda for their meetings and to provide for public comment on agenda a reimbursable state mandate under article xiii b,section of california constitution.we agree with the trial court that these statutes specify a higher level of service under state mandate principles we also agree with the trial court that a state mandate is not limited to situations of legal compulsion.we construe state mandate as also extending to situations where the local governmental entity has no reasonable alternative to the state scheme,or has no true choice but to participate in it.the commission on state mandates the commission did not consider these issues.we will therefore remand this matter to the commission for it to determine whether the test claimants have a reasonable alternative or a true choice not to participate in the educational programs at issue,and thus a reasonable alternative to paying the higher costs associated with the higher level of service specified in the two challenged statutes.in light of this remand,we will reverse the trial court judgment that upheld the commission decision finding a state mandate.
background 
in,california voters adopted proposition,which added article xiii a article xiii a to the state constitution.this measure limits the power of state and local governments to tax in,the state voters added article xiii b to the constitution article xiii b.this measure limits the power of state and local governments to spend these two constitutional measures work in tandem their goal is to protect california residents from excessive government taxation and spending 
article xiii b includes section section or article xiii b,section,which sets forth the concept of reimbursable state mandates.with certain exceptions not relevant here,section provides whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government local government includes school districts,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service section recognizes that articles xiii a and xiii b severely restrict the taxing and spending powers of local governments.citation.its purpose is to preclude the state from shifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions to local agencies,which are ill equipped to assume increased financial responsibilities in light of articles xiii a and xiii 
a reimbursable state mandate does not equate to any additional cost that a state law may require a local government to bear the reimbursable mandate arises only when the state imposes on a local government a new program of governmental services or an increased level of service under an existing program 
in the government code,the legislature has set forth the procedure for determining whether a state law imposes costs on a school district or other local agency under article xiii b,section pursuant to that procedure,two school districts san diego unified and kern high and one county santa clara filed a test claim with the commission kern high and santa clara did not appear in the trial court proceedings,and we will refer to the test claimants as such or simply as san diego unified.
the test claim concerned two statutes government code section,as amended by statutes,chapter this measure operated from april,to july,for the school site councils and advisory committees at issue here and education code section,as added by statutes,chapter,as an urgency measure effective from july,onward,for those councils and committees.these two statutes will be referred to as the test claim statutes or the two test claim statutes.
the amendment to government code section redefined the legislative body that must comply with the open meeting requirements of the ralph brown act the brown act including the requirement imposed by government code section to prepare and post an agenda.as amended by the legislation,section provides in relevant part 
as used in this chapter,legislative body means 
a the governing body of a local agency or any other local body created by state or federal statute.
b a commission,committee,board,or other body of a local agency,whether permanent or temporary,decisionmaking or advisory,created by charter,ordinance,resolution,or formal action of a legislative body 
education code section requires nine designated school site councils and advisory committees to comply with certain notice,agenda,and public comment requirements,but otherwise exempts them from the brown act and other open meeting acts.section specifies in relevant part 
a except as specified in this section,any meeting of the councils or committees specified in subdivision b is exempt from the provisions of this article,the open meeting act,and the ralph brown act 
b the councils and schoolsite advisory committees established pursuant to education code sections,and,subdivision b of section,sections,and,and committees formed pursuant to section or former section of title of the united states code,are subject to this section.
c any meeting held by a council or committee specified in subdivision b shall be open to the public and any member of the public shall be able to address the council or committee during the meeting on any item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the council or committee.notice of the meeting shall be posted at the schoolsite,or other appropriate place accessible to the public,at least hours before the time set for the meeting.the notice shall specify the date,time,and location of the meeting and contain an agenda describing each item of business to be discussed or acted upon.the council or committee may not take any action on any item of business unless that item appeared on the posted agenda or unless the council or committee members present,by unanimous vote,find that there is a need to take immediate action and that the need for action came to the attention of the council or committee subsequent to the posting of the agenda.questions or brief statements made at a meeting by members of the council,committee,or public that do not have a significant effect on pupils or employees in the school or school district or that can be resolved solely by the provision of information need not be described on an agenda as items of business.if a council or committee violates the procedural meeting requirements of this section and upon demand of any person,the council or committee shall reconsider the item at its next meeting,after allowing for public input on the item.
d any materials provided to a schoolsite council shall be made available to any member of the public who requests the materials pursuant to the california public records act 
the nine school site councils and advisory committees specified in education code section,subdivision b,were,save for one,established by statutes enacted in the and as part of the following programs the school improvement plan a general program that disburses money across all aspects of school operation and performance,the native american indian education program,the education act of,the program coordination act to coordinate various categorical aid programs,the mcateer act compensatory education programs beyond regular education program,subd.b the migrant education program,the pupil motivation and maintenance program and dropout recovery act to address truancy and dropout issues,the program to encourage parental involvement,enacted and the federal indian education program see former now see et.
in the test claim,san diego unified alleged that the test claim statutes imposed certain open meeting requirements on these school site councils and advisory committees,constituting reimbursable state mandates.the commission agreed.it found the statutes constituted reimbursable state mandates for the costs of preparing specified meeting agendas,posting those agendas,and providing the opportunity for the public to address agenda items.
pursuant to government code section,the state department of finance the state brought an administrative mandate proceeding to review the commission decision the trial court agreed with the commission,stating two primary issues are raised in this matter.the first issue is whether the amendments to the brown act,to government code section and the enactment of section mandate a new program or higher level of service.the court concludes that they do.the second issue is whether a reimbursable state mandate is created only when an advisory council or committee which is subject to the brown act is required by state law.the court concludes that it is not.the petition for writ of mandate is denied.
these are the two issues before us as well.government code section requires that the trial court review the commission decision under the substantial evidence standard where the trial court applies this standard,we are generally confined to inquiring whether substantial evidence supports that court decision however,we independently review the trial court legal conclusions about the meaning and effect of constitutional and statutory provisions.
discussion 
new program or higher level of service for an existing program 
a reimbursable state mandate is created only when the state mandates a new program or a higher level of service for an existing program on any local government,including a school district program has its commonly understood meaning a program carries out the governmental function of providing services to the public or it is a law which,to implement a state policy,impose s unique requirements on local governments and do es not apply generally to all residents and entities in the state.
in this part of the opinion,we address the issue of whether the two test claim statutes reflect a new program or a higher level of service for an existing program.in the next part,we confront the issue of whether the two statutes mandate the program services.
the parties spend considerable time on whether the school site councils and advisory bodies were legislative bodies subject to the brown act before the test claim statutes,and thus whether the test claim statutes involve a new program.we need not resolve this matter.even assuming the school site councils and advisory committees were subject to the brown act before the advent of the two test claim statutes,these two statutes reflect a higher level of service for existing programs 
as a preliminary matter,we note that we are dealing with programs within the meaning of the state mandate laws.the provision of educational carried out by the school site councils and advisory committees at certainly a governmental program,as that term is commonly understood.the two test claim statutes,as well,set forth unique requirements on local government school districts to further the state policy of open public meetings these requirements do not apply generally to residents and entities in the state.
on the issue of higher level of service,the legislative package that redefined legislative body for brown act purposes in section also repealed a brown act statute that applied to advisory bodies of local agencies,including advisory bodies of school districts the repealed brown act statute was government code section as enacted,it provided in relevant part 
as used in this chapter legislative body also includes any advisory commission,advisory committee or advisory body of a local agency,created by charter,ordinance,resolution,or by any similar formal action of a governing body of a local agency.
meetings of such advisory commissions,committees or bodies shall be open and public,and notice thereof must be delivered personally or by mail at least hours before the time of such meeting to each person who has requested,in writing,notice of such meeting.
if the advisory commission,committee or body elects to provide for the holding of regular meetings,it shall provide by bylaws,or by whatever other rule is utilized by that advisory body for the conduct of its business,for the time and place for holding such regular meetings.no other notice of regular meetings is required 
the state concedes that all of the school site councils and advisory committees at issue here are advisory bodies.this is borne out by their similar treatment as advisory entities within education code section.
the two test claim statutes reflect a higher level of service for the existing programs served by these councils and committees than what former government code section specified.the test claim statutes require that meeting agendas be prepared and posted at least hours before the meeting,and that the public be allowed to address agenda items these requirements are above those specified in the italicized portions of former government code section,set forth ante.no party has disputed that the increased amount of costs involving this higher level of service is significant and surpasses the statutory minimum cost mandate set forth in government code section.
we conclude that the test claim statutes specify a higher level of service for existing programs.we now turn to the thornier issue whether these two statutes mandate a higher level of service.
mandate a higher level of service 
for there to be a reimbursable state mandate here,the constitution and government code require that the test claim statutes mandate a higher level of service 
the state argues that the school site councils and advisory committees referred to in the test claim statutes serve categorical aid programs that school districts participate in either voluntarily or as a condition to receive state or federal funds.from this,the state concludes that,as a matter of law,where a school district participates in a state statutory program voluntarily or conditionally,the state may impose reasonable requirements on the district without providing a reimbursable state mandate,because the state has not legally mandated such program participation.while the state position looks strong on the surface,there are cracks in its foundation.
the state position finds support in a appellate court decision,city of merced state of california the question there was whether a new state statute that required compensation for business goodwill in local eminent domain proceedings constituted a reimbursable state mandate under statutory law.the court said no,reasoning that whether a city or county decides to exercise eminent domain is,essentially,an option of the city or county,rather than a mandate of the state.the fundamental concept is that the city or county is not required to exercise eminent domain thus,payment for loss of goodwill is not a cost.
two months after city of merced,this court,in city of sacramento state of california sacramento i employed similar reasoning.the question in sacramento i was whether a state law requiring local public employees to be covered by the state unemployment insurance law constituted a state mandate under article xiii b,section,and statutory law the state asserted that it was only complying with a federal requirement rather than imposing a state mandate the federal component of the unemployment insurance system induced states to cover local public employees,by making the states incur substantial political and economic detriment for not doing so we looked at the definition of a federal mandate in article xiii b,section,subdivision b,which directs compliance without discretion or which unavoidably make s the provision of existing services more costly costs of federal mandates are not within article xiii b spending limits for state and local governments.a federal mandate,we reasoned,is one in which the mandated governmental entity has no discretion to refuse.we concluded that while it was economically and politically detrimental for the state not to comply with the federal law,the state still had the legal discretion not to do so however,the local government had no discretion whether to comply with the state statute thus,the state statute constituted a reimbursable state mandate.
in,in county of contra costa,this court agreed with city of merced that the state statute requiring the payment of business goodwill in eminen
