the first cause of action alleged in davies sac is breach of contract.he identifies two contracts,and two breaches respondents breached a contract with davies former employer schectman,to which contract davies was a beneficiary and respondents breached the terms of the promissory note governing his student loans.the second cause of action is for a judicial declaration stating davies is the intended beneficiary to an alleged contract between schectman and respondents and a judicial declaration interpreting certain language in the promissory note.the third cause of action is for equitable relief,alleging that his obligation to pay interest on his loans accumulated through june is excusable under legal theories of changed circumstances,impossibility,extrinsic fraud,equitable estoppel and latches.
where a written contract is pleaded by attachment to and incorporation in a complaint,and where the complaint fails to allege that the terms of the contract have any special meaning,a court will construe the language of the contract on its face to determine whether,as a matter of law,the contract is reasonably subject to a construction sufficient to sustain a cause of action for breach.hillsman sutter community hospitals d,fn.omitted.moreover,t he rule on demurrer is simply a variation on the theme that it is solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.citations.id.at,fn.
in his opening brief on appeal,davies concedes that the letters written by schectman to davies student loan providers did not create a contract and,that is no longer an issue in the action.however,in his reply brief,davies addresses the time bar issue surrounding his beneficiary cause of action,and addresses the elements of a contract.regardless,as the trial judge made clear in the hearing on respondent edfund first demurrer,t here nothing on the face of the letter,though,that gives rise to any sort of promise.we agree.none of the letters written by schectman is a contract.they do not fit within the definition of a contract an agreement to do or not to do a certain thing.furthermore,there is no consideration provided for any alleged promises by either party to the alleged contract.schectman promises to do is plain.schectman drafted the letters merely to substantiate davies repeated economic hardship deferment requests.because the letters fail to meet the definition of a contract,the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrers to davies allegation of breach of contract under a beneficiary theory.therefore,we affirm the trial court sustaining the demurrers based on code of civil procedure section,subdivisions e and f.
davies argument for breach of the promissory note contract stems from the language of the default and acceleration clause in that document.acceleration and default at the option of the holder,the entire unpaid balance shall become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any one of the following events iv i default on the loan s.the following events shall constitute a default on a loan i i fail to pay the entire unpaid balance after the holder has exercised its option under the preceding paragraph or ii i fail to make installment payments when due,or fail to comply with other terms of the loan s,and the guarantor reasonably concludes i no longer intend to honor my repayment obligation,provided my failure has persisted for at least days for payments due monthly or days for payments due less frequently than monthly.if i default,the guarantor may purchase my loan,and capitalize all interest into a new principal balance,and collection fees will become immediately due and payable under governing law and notices,the note indicates that it is to be interpreted in accordance with the higher education act of,as amended et,other applicable federal statutes and regulations,and the guarantor policies.the note also states that a pplicable state law,except as preempted by federal law,may provide for certain borrower rights,remedies,and defenses in addition to those stated in this note.
