plaintiff appellant joe klunder was removed from brown and suspended for three semesters after a number of students and staff submitted complaints regarding klunder behavior.in response,klunder filed an complaint against brown university and numerous individuals associated with brown and its police department collectively,appellees.at the heart of klunder complaint are allegations that appellees handling of his disciplinary proceeding and his removal from campus violated both his constitutional rights actionable through and rhode island state law.the district court ultimately entered judgment in favor of appellees on all eleven claims,and klunder now appeals.he contends that the district court erred by finding that brown university was not a state actor subject to suit under allowing appellees motion to amend their answer to include a statute of limitations defense and ignoring a rhode island tolling statute which would have brought klunder claims within the applicable statute of limitations.finding all of klunder arguments meritless,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
in the fall of,klunder traveled from his family home in california to rhode island,where he began attending brown as a freshman.the transition was not an easy one for klunder,who claims to have struggled with underlying emotional conditions,the effects of his medications,and a perceived culture clash between his conservative upbringing in california and the liberal university setting at brown.
during the spring semester of,brown began to receive a number of complaints about klunder behavior towards students and staff.first,carla hansen,an associate dean of student life at brown,reported an incident with klunder in her office in april according to her report,she had a number of concerns about the interaction and was uncomfortable with klunder remarks about her physical appearance and with his intrusive questions about the nature of her physical relationship with her partner 
then,in may of,two brown staff members reported encountering klunder in a restaurant.both women said they felt uncomfortable when klunder interrupted their conversation to ask if they were having man trouble.klunder then reportedly volunteered unsolicited information about a drunken phone call he had made recently to a former girlfriend during which he evaluated her skill at kissing.one of the staffers reported that this was her second with klunder,who had made inappropriate comments on the previous occasion as well.
after receiving these complaints,associate dean of student life terry addison wrote to klunder to notify him that the complaints would be the subject of a hearing upon klunder return to campus in the fall of.klunder,however,elected not to return that fall due to unspecified family matters.he eventually returned to brown in the fall of,at which point brown began to receive new complaints about klunder behavior.
one student employee of brown reported that klunder approached her to describe,unsolicited,his views on the proper subordinate role of women and a maneuver he used to trick women into making out with him.then,on september,four students reported having a particularly disturbing conversation with klunder.according to their reports,klunder approached the unfamiliar students and began by complaining about that black fraternity guy who had been particularly noisy the night before.after admitting to using methamphetamine,cocaine,and adderall,klunder allegedly stated that he did not think that he could control himself if disturbed by noisy students again.he hypothesized that it might be strange to return to campus after a suspension if he were to stab a fellow student,but that he could plead diminished capacity to avoid serious criminal charges.klunder informed the group that he had repeatedly beat the shit out of his father,and he proceeded to advise the students that if they shot someone in california,they should do it on their own property,or drag the body there after the fact,in order to get a reduced punishment.
after receiving these additional complaints,dean addison sent klunder a second notice saying that new complaints had been received and that an investigation would take place.at the same time,margaret klawunn,the associate vice president for campus for student life,issued an emergency letter stating that to ensure the safety of students and the community,klunder would be barred from campus effective september,on an interim basis.
at a meeting with brown administrators on september,klunder was told of his removal from campus.dean addison escorted klunder to his dormitory so he could pack his things.afterwards,the pair were joined by sergeant robert enos of the brown university police department and dean allen ward.klunder alleges that he was ordered into the campus police vehicle driven by enos and was taken to a nearby hotel.he claims that dean ward told him that he could not return to campus or to a public street neighboring brown,and instead that he should remain at the hotel until he could fly home the next day.
brown combined the complaints against klunder from and and scheduled a disciplinary hearing for november.klunder flew back to rhode island for the hearing where he was provided with a advisor to represent him and a package of materials that would constitute the evidence against him.at the hearing,klunder had the opportunity to present evidence and to call and question witnesses.he provided a written opening statement but chose not to present any witnesses in his defense.after the hearing,the hearing officer provided vice president klawunn with his decision.vice president klawunn adopted this recommendation and rendered a formal decision finding that klunder had violated brown standards of conduct and suspending him for three semesters.klunder appealed to brown provost,who affirmed the findings and suspension 
procedural background 
on october,klunder filed an complaint in the district court of rhode island.he alleged,among other things,that brown was a person acting under color of state law within the meaning of,that appellees were liable for failing to train or supervise its employees,and that appellees violated klunder constitutional rights under the first,fourth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments of the constitution.other allegations included claims of civil conspiracy,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,intentional infliction of emotional distress,false arrest,false imprisonment,negligence,and breach of the duty of confidentiality and loyalty.
the parties subsequently filed for summary judgment as to count i of the complaint,which called for a declaratory judgment that brown qualified as a state actor under.on july,the district court denied klunder motion and granted appellees motion for summary judgment in part.the court reasoned that brown university is not a state actor but that it could not grant summary judgment in its entirety because there was insufficient information to determine whether the brown university police force was acting under color of law,thus bringing it under the ambit of.
on october,appellees filed a motion to dismiss eight of the eleven counts,primarily on statute of limitations grounds.because appellees had overlooked the statute of limitations defense when preparing their answer to the complaint,the motion to dismiss was followed three days later by appellees motion to amend the answer to include a statute of limitations defense.over klunder objections,the district court granted the motion to amend.on november,the district court granted appellees motion to dismiss two of the eight counts counts viii and ix,which alleged false arrest and false imprisonment,respectively on statute of limitations grounds.
finally,on may,after additional discovery and substantial briefing from both parties,the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment as to all remaining counts.in a written order,the court explained that klunder remaining claims,his civil conspiracy claim,and his common law breach of the duty of confidentiality and loyalty claim were not timely as they were filed outside of the statute of limitations period.the court also dismissed klunder claim of negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress,as well as his breach of contract claim,reasoning that klunder allegations were not properly supported and that klunder had failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief.as to klunder remaining claims of negligence and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the district court deemed them waived,noting that klunder had failed to respond to appellees arguments and failed to present any argument of his own as to those claims.
the district court denied klunder motion for reconsideration on june,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
klunder first challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on the ground that brown university is not a state actor subject to federal jurisdiction under we review this ruling de novo,scrutiniz ing the facts in the light most agreeable to klunder and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.foote town of bedford,cir.we will affirm only if the record,so viewed,discloses that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.santiago puerto rico,cir.

for brown to have acted under color of state law,its actions must be fairly attributable to the state.estades negroni,at quoting lugar,at.in other words,it must be fair to characterize brown as a state actor.id.while there is no dispute that brown is a private entity,a private party can in rare circumstances be deemed a state actor for purposes if one of three tests is met.id.at.
the first test is the state compulsion test.under this test,a private party is fairly characterized as a state actor when the state has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that the challenged conduct must in law be deemed to be that of the state.id.at alteration in original quoting blum yaretsky.the second test the action test deems a private party a state actor where an examination of the totality of the circumstances reveals that the state has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private party that it was a joint participant in the challenged activity.id.alterations in original quoting bass parkwood,cir.finally,under the public function test,a private party is viewed as a state actor if the plaintiff establishes that,in engaging in the challenged conduct,the private party performed a public function that has been traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.id.quoting blum,at.
though klunder never references it by name,his arguments implicate the public function test.focusing almost entirely on brown charter,klunder argues that brown is a body politic which was delegated governmental power and authority by england,and thus qualifies as a state actor 
klunder is correct that brown charter defines it as a body corporate and politic,but he misunderstands the term import.black law currently defines a body politic as a group of people regarded in a political rather than private sense and organized under a common governmental authority.black law dictionary ed.however,when brown charter was established in the late,the phrase was used to mean corporations,both private and public.will.dep t of state police,see also trs.of dartmouth coll.woodward,wheat,finding that dartmouth college was a private corporation despite being defined in its charter as a body corporate and politic.indeed,rhode island still interprets the term to include private corporations.see,doe gelineau,establishing the roman catholic bishop of providence as a business corporation that subsists as a body politic under a special denomination,which is regarded in law as having a personality and existence distinct from that of its several members pardey boulevard billiard club,a rtificial persons are such as are created and devised by human laws for the purposes of society and government,which are called corporations or bodies politic.quoting blackstone,commentaries wing slater,stating that a corporation is a body politic.
while we assume arguendo that a body politic may be a state actor,we agree with the district court that the designation is not determinative but rather that the facts and circumstances particular to the specific corporate entity determine whether a corporate body politic is a private corporation or a state actor subject to federal jurisdiction under.see also kennelly kent cnty.water,notwithstanding that the statute creating the kent county water authority describes the board as a body politic,and declares that in exercising its powers it will be performing an essential governmental function,such language by itself is not effective to clothe the authority with the distinguishing characteristics of a municipal or corporation.
here,the facts and circumstances make clear that brown university is not performing a public function that has been traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state,thus transforming it into a state actor.brown charter grants brown full liberty,power,and authority to found a college or university within rhode island,for promoting the liberal arts and universal literature.brown university,the charter of brown university with amendments and notes,available at.hereinafter brown charter.education,especially secondary and collegiate education,is not,and never has been,exclusively maintained by the state.see rendell baker kohn,holding that the education of maladjusted high school students,although a public function,is not the exclusive prerogative of the state berríos inter am,cir higher education is not generally regarded as exclusively a function traditionally associated with sovereignty.city of pawtucket sundlun,it is thus clear that the general assembly plenary and exclusive power over public education in rhode island has not changed since the adoption of the state constitution in.emphasis added.
and while klunder focuses on brown authority to legislate,to regulate,order,and govern the same,brown charter at,and to make,enact and publish all such laws,statutes,regulations,and ordinances,with penalties,id.at,this authority is clearly limited to brown to maintain itself as an educational institution.for example,a full reading of the paragraph from which klunder selectively quotes makes obvious that the phrase the same in brown authority to regulate,order,and govern refers to brown full liberty,power,and authority to found a college or university within this colony,for promoting the liberal arts and universal literature.see id.at.moreover,while the charter permits brown to convene two branches in order to make,enact and publish all such laws,statutes,regulations,and ordinances,with penalties,id.at,this ability is limited to the successful instruction and government of said college or university,id.at.
thus,contrary to klunder assertions,the charter does not broadly delegate legislative responsibility to brown.dartmouth,at,finding that dartmouth ability to govern itself and act to promote its educational purpose did not render it a public institution.
klunder related argument that brown disciplinary system was a delegation of judicial governmental functions is likewise faulty.as a general matter,private schools are run privately,without governmental interference in the schools internal administration.see asociación de educación privada de,garcía padilla,cir thus,rule interferes with autonomous decisionmaking by private schools and intrudes upon their freedom to pursue their academic objectives without interference from the government.see also zelman simmons harris,souter,dissenting dissenting on a separate issue and noting without disagreement by the majority that private schools are autonomously managed without any interference from the state.we see no reason that this autonomy should exclude internal disciplinary measures and proceedings.see krohn harvard law,cir finding that the receipt of state financial assistance,the regulation by a public accreditation council,and the authority of that council to oversee disciplinary procedures were insufficient attributes of government involvement to render the university disciplinary proceedings state action for section purposes see also doe heck,cir the right of parents to discipline their children preclude s state officials from interfering with the right of parents to delegate the authority to discipline their children to private school officials albert carovano,cir hamilton decision to suspend the appellants ultimately turn ed on a judgment made by a private part y according to professional standards that were not established by the state.it thus can not be state action.alterations in original internal citation omitted.
thus,brown discipline of klunder in no way qualifies as judicial delegation by the state.
because neither private education,corporate,nor internal discipline qualifies as state action,and because there has been no delegation of any governmental functions to brown either at the time of brown charter or in the last years brown can not be classified as a private party performing a public function that has been traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.see estades negroni,at quoting blum,at.with no action fairly attributable to the state,brown is not acting under color of state law,and thus klunder has failed to show that brown is subject to federal jurisdiction under.see id.at quoting lugar,at.
this conclusion is supported by our decision in krohn,which,contrary to klunder assertions,is highly analogous.in krohn,we were confronted with the question of whether harvard law school was subject to federal jurisdiction under.finding that it was not,we held that 
krohn has failed to show a sufficient present day relationship between harvard and the commonwealth to treat the school as a public institution subject to federal jurisdiction in a suit.to hold otherwise would serve only to disrupt the less anciently established balance of rights and duties harvard assumes as a private educational institution in massachusetts harvard has been for at least one hundred years and continues to be treated as a private educational institution in the whole range of its legal and educational relations and activities by both the private and public sectors in massachusetts.it is considered by all reasonable persons to be a private educational institution 
krohn,at.like harvard relationship with massachusetts,brown relationship with rhode island in no way suggests that brown should be treated as a public institution.brown was founded by private citizens and with private funds,and,like harvard,has historically been and presently is treated as a private educational institution by both the private and public sectors.moreover,harvard,like brown,is defined in its charter as a body politic.compare the charter of,in the development of harvard university since the inqauguration sic of president eliot,samuel eliot morison,available at http one body politique and corporate in lawe,with brown charter at one body corporate and politic.
seeing no meaningful distinction between brown in the present case and harvard in krohn,we agree with the district court that brown university is not a state actor subject to federal jurisdiction under.brown motion for partial summary judgment was properly granted.
b.the statute of limitations 
the district court disposed of the remainder of klunder on statute of limitations grounds.on appeal,klunder raises two arguments.first,he alleges that the district court improperly granted appellees motion to amend the answer to include a statute of limitations defense.second,he argues that even if the answer was properly amended,his claims were not time barred due to the tolling provision in rhode island general laws section.we address each in turn.
the motion to amend 
we review the district court decision to grant appellees motion to amend its answer to include the statute of limitations defense for abuse of discretion.interstate litho brown,cir.that decision will be left untouched so long as the record evinces an arguably adequate basis for the court decision.juárez select portfolio servicing,cir quoting hatch dep t for children,cir.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure governs amendments to pleadings,and it instructs courts to freely give leave to amend.a.as the supreme court explained,
in the absence of any apparent or declared reason such as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,futility of amendment,the leave sought should,as the rules require,be freely given.
foman davis,see also interstate litho,at acosta mestre hilton int l of,cir.
we find no error in the district court decision to permit the amendment.in reviewing a district court decision on whether or not to grant an amendment,we routinely focus our analysis on the prejudice to the party.see,interstate litho,at plaintiff does not identify any prejudice indeed,plaintiff trial preparation on the merits issues could hardly have been much different hayes new eng.millwork,cir c ourts may not deny an amendment solely because of delay and without consideration of the prejudice to the opposing party.most often,this prejudice takes the form of additional,prolonged discovery and a postponement of trial.see,acosta mestre,at t he prejudice to hilton resulting from a of discovery with additional costs,a significant postponement of trial,and a likely major alteration in trial strategy and tactics fully support the district court ruling to deny a motion for leave to amend.stepanischen merchs.despatch transp,cir t he addition of new claims would likely have required additional discovery and caused further delay.johnston holiday inns,cir affirming denial of motion to amend where five years had passed since the complaint was filed,a memorandum opinion and judgment had already been entered,and the defendants would be prejudiced by the difficulty and expense required in locating essential witnesses for trial.
here,klunder fails to establish prejudice.though he claims that knowledge of the defense of statute of limitations would have impacted plaintiff discovery strategy,he fails to explain how.to the contrary,the record suggests the opposite.at the time the motion to amend was filed,discovery was ongoing.klunder had only taken two depositions,and subsequently took others,and thus had ample opportunity almost two months to explore the statute of limitations question.additionally,nothing prevented klunder from utilizing the various discovery tools afforded to all litigants interrogatories,requests for production of documents,subpoenas,to obtain information to rebut the defense.and,if klunder really did feel that he lacked sufficient time to explore the issue,he could have sought extensions of the discovery and summary judgment deadlines.that he declined to employ any of these options is his own decision and not the fault of brown.
given rule liberal policy and the lack of demonstrable prejudice to klunder,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion to amend 
the tolling statute 
klunder next argues that even if appellees answer was properly amended to include the statute of limitations defense,the defense did not bar his claims due to the tolling provision in rhode island general laws section.we review the district court decisions on this issue de novo.see montalvo gonzález amparo,cir lópez gonzález municipality of comerío,cir.
