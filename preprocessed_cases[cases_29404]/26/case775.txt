this appeal arises out of the desegregation of the kansas city,missouri,school district the district or the kcmsd,which began with the filing of a lawsuit in.although the district was declared unitary and released from court supervision in,some parties to the desegregation suit filed a motion in the district court on february,asking the court to exercise ancillary jurisdiction and enjoin the state of missouri and state officials collectively,the state from acting in a manner inconsistent with earlier court orders including an agreement between the kcmsd and the state incorporated in court orders.the movants the kcmsd,a class of plaintiff schoolchildren,and the american federation of teachers local asserted that recent legislative action by the state violated orders issued in the desegregation suit by requiring the kcmsd to use property tax levy proceeds,which were dedicated to the repayment of desegregation bonds,to fund charter schools.the district court agreed,granted the motion,and issued a final order enjoining the state from requiring the kcmsd to divert to the charter schools tax levy funds that were traditionally withheld under section of the missouri revised statutes.the state appeals the district court order.we affirm.
in,the kcmsd,members of the kansas city school board,and four schoolchildren filed suit against the state,suburban school districts surrounding the district,and various federal agencies.the complaint alleged that the defendants caused and perpetuated a racially segregated public school system in the kansas city,missouri,metropolitan area.the district court realigned the kcmsd as a defendant and converted the suit into a class action,making a plaintiff class of all present and future kcmsd students.after a month trial,the district court dismissed the case against the suburban school districts and federal defendants,but found constitutional violations by the kcmsd and the state.jenkins missouri.the court determined that the state had mandated segregated schools for black and white children prior to,id.at,and held that the kcmsd and the state had not met their affirmative obligations to remove all vestiges of that dual school system,id.at.we affirmed this holding in jenkins missouri,cir en banc jenkins i cert.denied.
to address the vestiges of unconstitutional segregation,the district court ordered remedial programs and capital improvements throughout the district.by the summer of,the court had approved a series of capital improvement expenditures totaling approximately million.in september,the district court approved a million capital improvement plan aimed at eliminating the substandard conditions present in kcmsd schools.jenkins missouri.these capital improvement costs were in addition to other desegregation costs.id.at.while the court had deemed the state and the kcmsd jointly and severally liable for desegregation remedies,the court also recognized that the kcmsd lacked the resources to pay its share of the costs and had exhausted all means of raising additional revenue concluding that it was left with no choice but to exercise its broad equitable powers to effectuate a remedy,id.at,the district court directed the kcmsd to issue capital improvement bonds in the amount of million and ordered the property tax levy in the district increased to per of assessed valuation,id.at the court specifically earmarked the proceeds of the property tax increase for the retirement of the capital improvement bonds and ordered that a tax increase in an amount required to pay the interest and principal of the bond indebtedness shall remain in effect until such time as the bonds are retired or until other provisions are adopted to insure their retirement.order of,at.on appeal,we affirmed the issuance of the bonds.jenkins missouri,cir jenkins ii,aff in relevant part,d.we also affirmed the district court action setting aside state law that limited the district ability to increase its tax levy.id.at.we required that in the future,however,the amount of the levy be set by the kcmsd school board rather than by the court,subject to a limit set by the court.id.at.the supreme court then considered the issue and,while holding that the district court abused its discretion by setting the property tax levy itself,agreed with our proposal that the district court authorize the kcmsd to levy property taxes at a rate necessary to fund the desegregation remedy and enjoin state laws that prevent the kcmsd from exercising this power.missouri jenkins,d.pursuant to these orders,in,the kcmsd increased the levy to per of assessed valuation.see jenkins missouri,cir jenkins vi.
the district our to oversee the desegregation efforts.the case came before the supreme court again in.in missouri jenkins,d,the supreme court determined that the district court had exceeded its power in ordering particular remedies.the supreme court found that many goals of the district court quality education plan already have been attained,id.at,and directed that on remand,the district court bear in mind that its end purpose is not only to remedy the violation to the extent practicable,but also to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance with the constitution,id.quoting freeman pitts,d.this order changed the direction of the case,refocusing the court and the parties on the goal of ending court supervision of the district.
in april,the state filed a motion asking the district court to declare the district unitary,to dissolve all injunctions,and to relinquish jurisdiction in the case.less than a month later,the state and the kcmsd entered into an agreement agreement or agreement whereby the state agreed to pay million later increased to million in desegregation funding to the kcmsd over a period.the agreement provided that upon final payment by the state and approval of the agreement by the district court,the state would be entitled to an order releasing it from further desegregation obligations and the jurisdiction of the court.consistent with the state role throughout the remedial phase of the case,the agreement focused only on the amount of funding,not on the use of the funds.the american federation of teachers local aft,an intervener in the case,joined the agreement,but the plaintiffs did not.the state then filed a second motion asking the district court to approve the agreement and dismiss the state from the case.after a hearing on the motions,the district court denied the motion for unitary status except with respect to activities.jenkins missouri.the district court approved the agreement,however,stating that it was reasonable to expect the kcmsd to be unitary within three the time that the state would be making final funding payments.id.at.we affirmed the district court order in jenkins missouri,cir jenkins xiv.the state made final payment to the kcmsd under the agreement on december,and the district court dismissed the state on january.
in,missouri passed legislation authorizing the creation of charter schools,independent,publicly supported school s,in kansas city and louis.charter schools established within the boundaries of the kcmsd are funded by diverting federal,state,and local education funding away from the kcmsd on a basis id.recognizing the kcmsd financial obligations under the desegregation revenue bonds,however,the legislature swiftly amended the statute in so that t he per pupil amount paid by a school district to a charter school was reduced by the amount per pupil needed for repayment of leasehold revenue bonds obligated pursuant to a federal court desegregation action.id.
in march,the district court declared the kcmsd unitary with regard to facilities,budget,transportation,and racial balance.order of,at.with regard to the remaining discriminatory vestige,the student achievement gap,the district court declared the kcmsd unitary and released it from court supervision on august.am.order of,at.the kcmsd unitary status had no immediate effect on its funding.the property tax levy remained in place,the kcmsd continued to make scheduled payments on the revenue bonds,and the state continued to reduce the kcmsd funding obligations to the charter schools under section.
then,in,the state changed the rules of the game.the missouri legislature enacted a new statute that authorized the missouri board of fund commissioners bfc to condition the kcmsd withholding of funds under section on a finding that the kcmsd did not have adequate reserves to satisfy outstanding desegregation bonds 
the bfc shall determine whether any governmental entity has sufficient fund balances to redeem leasehold revenue bonds obligated under a federal desegregation action.if the bfc determines that any governmental entity has sufficient fund balances to redeem or otherwise pay off such leasehold revenue bonds,the state board of education shall certify,under subdivision of subsection of section,rsmo,that no amount is needed by such governmental entity to repay such bonds.
pursuant to the statute,the bfc met in april to determine whether the kcmsd had sufficient funds to redeem the leasehold revenue bonds.at the time,the balance owed on the bonds was approximately million and the last of the bonds was not scheduled to be fully repaid until.nonetheless,the bfc determined that the kcmsd had sufficient funds in its reserves to immediately pay off the bonds.the missouri board of education then certified that the kcmsd was no longer entitled to make reductions in its payments allocated to charter schools pursuant to section.two months later,the legislature repealed section,effective july,reg.sess.senate bill.as a result of the state actions,in july,the kcmsd was forced to begin transferring the full portion of the property tax levy funds to the charter schools 
on february,the kcmsd,the class of plaintiff schoolchildren,and intervenor aft filed a joint motion in the district court asking the court to exercise ancillary jurisdiction and enforce the agreement and court orders that incorporated the agreement and established the terms of the state dismissal from the case.the movants argued that the state dismissal was premised on the maintenance of the property tax levy proceeds to allow the kcmsd to repay desegregation bonds.according to the movants,the state violated the agreement and court orders by enacting section and senate bill,which require the kcmsd to use levy proceeds that are devoted to the repayment of the desegregation bonds to fund the charter schools.jt.motion to enforce judgments at.the movants asked the court to enjoin the state from using any portion of the amount needed for the repayment of leasehold revenue bonds obligated pursuant to this case for the funding of charter schools or any other purpose.id.
the district court granted the motion on june.the court found that the dismissal of the state was granted subject to assurances of the existence of adequate funding for kcmsd operations and the repayment of desegregation bonds,including the million in transition payments and the availability of the entire property tax levy.order of june,at.the court was concerned that requiring kcmsd to transfer these funds to the charter schools will impede its ability to fund its ongoing operations and continue to meet its debt service obligation.id.at.the court concluded that consistent with the eighth circuit opinion approving the dismissal of the state,the state must not alter the financial status quo until kcmsd has fully repaid its bonds.id.at.in an amended order issued on november,the court further clarified that the settlement agreement requires the state to permit kcmsd to withhold local property tax levy funds for repayment of leasehold revenue bonds from transfer to charter schools,pursuant to,through the respective initial retirement dates of each of the leasehold revenue bond obligations.am.order of,at.the court enjoined the state from requiring the kcmsd to divert to the charter schools property tax levy funds that were traditionally withheld under section.the state appeals this order.
before reaching the merits of the district court order,we must address the state argument that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the motion and enjoin the state.the district court addressed this jurisdictional issue and determined that it had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce prior orders in this case.order of june,at citing kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.we review issues of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.myers richland county,cir.
the state argument against jurisdiction has two related prongs,both of which we reject.first,the state asserts that because the district court declared the district unitary and closed the case in,the court had no jurisdiction to impose remedies some three years after such declaration.br.of appellants at.this argument is based on the faulty premise that the district court imposed new obligations on the state.as we discuss in detail below,however,the district court did nothing more than enforce existing obligations created by previous remedial orders in this case while a district court jurisdiction typically ends when a case is closed and judgment entered,a district court retains ancillary jurisdiction to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.kokkonen,at.the supreme court has recognized that w ithout jurisdiction to enforce a judgment entered by a federal court,the judicial power would be incomplete and entirely inadequate to the purposes for which it was conferred by the constitution.peacock thomas,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we affirm the district court determination that it had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce previous orders in this case.
this leads us to the second prong of the state jurisdictional argument.the state asserts that the district court did not have ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement because the agreement was simply a settlement agreement,the terms of which were not made part of a court order.kokkonen made clear that federal courts do not retain authority to enforce settlement agreements unless the dismissal order states that the district court is retaining jurisdiction over the agreement or the court incorporates the terms of the agreement into an order.at.the district court reiterated that it had approved the agreement as part of a modified judicial order and noted that t he eighth circuit has taken the view that the state was dismissed pursuant to an order of the court modifying an earlier remedy and not pursuant to an unincorporated settlement agreement.order of june,at citing jenkins xiv,at.the district court thus concluded that it had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement as incorporated into court orders.we reach the same conclusion.
the opinions of both the district court and this court make it clear that the agreement was incorporated into the district court orders.initially,the district court march,order approving the agreement indicated that the district court was modifying its earlier injunctive decrees.jenkins missouri.at.the district court stated that it would approve the agreement,thereby releasing the state upon the payment of transitional funding,because e quity requires a modification of the earlier remedy.id.in a later ruling on the plaintiffs motion to stay the order approving the agreement,the district court stated,properly understood,the approval of the agreement was a to release the state from liability over the objections of was not a consensual settlement agreement.jenkins missouri.the district court has not varied from this view.in an october,order discussing attorney fees,the district court was called on to defin e the nature of the agreement and the relationship between it and the order of march.order of,at.the court stated the agreement and the order of march,which approved the agreement,modified the court original remedial injunction.id.the court was persuaded to view the agreement as a judicial decree,not a contract,id.at,and to look to law governing judgments,not contract law,to interpret and implement the agreement and the order of march,id.at.the district court concluded that once the court approved the agreement,its terms transformed from a contract into a court judgment.id.at.
our court has also taken the view that the district court approval of the agreement was a modification of the district court earlier orders.in affirming the approval of the agreement,we recognized the equitable power possessed by district courts to modify the remedies ordered in school desegregation cases and stated that the district court amended the remedy in this case.jenkins xiv,at.we rejected the plaintiffs argument that they could not be bound by the agreement,stating that the district court approved the agreement as an exercise of its continuing equitable authority to devise and implement a remedy in this case and that the district court order was not akin to a contract.id.at.finally,we noted that the court could modify the agreement in the future to hold the state responsible for additional funding.id.at.
our review of these orders convinces us that while the district court march,order did not state explicitly that it was incorporating the terms of the agreement,that is exactly what the order did.see schaefer fan j d,a district court need not use explicit language or any magic form of words to effect a valid incorporation of an agreement into an order.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the circumstances here are easily distinguishable from those in kokkonen where the supreme court deemed the district court mere awareness and approval of the terms of the settlement agreement insufficient to support ancillary jurisdiction.at.additionally,as is clear from our discussion below,this court approval of the state dismissal and the declaration of unitary status came only after we were confident that the financial conditions in place at the time would provide adequate funding for the kcmsd to meet its bond obligations.the district court was well within its authority to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the terms of all of its prior orders including the terms of the incorporated agreement,as well as all of the prior orders of this court.
we proceed to consider whether the district court,in exercising its ancillary jurisdiction,acted appropriately in enjoining the state from requiring the district to divert to charter schools the levy funds that had been dedicated to repayment of the district outstanding desegregation bonds.the parties disagree on the standard that we should apply in our review.the state argues that the district court interpreted and modified a settlement agreement and that such action is subject to de novo review.see little rock sch.dist.little rock sch,cir.the movants argue that the district court interpreted its previous orders and that such interpretation is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see steahr apfel,cir ruling that we must defer to a district court construction of its own remand order.neither characterization of the district court actions is completely accurate,however.as discussed above and in more detail below,the district court exercised its ancillary jurisdiction by interpreting and enforcing earlier remedial orders including orders incorporating the agreement of both the district court including orders authored by judge clark and the eighth circuit.vindicating the authority of both courts was an exercise of the district court inherent power.kokkonen,at.in other contexts,we have reviewed a district court exercise of its inherent power for abuse of discretion.see.reade,cir reviewing district court refusal to consider party argument greiner city of champlin,cir reviewing district court award of sanctions.we believe that reviewing for abuse of the district court discretion is appropriate in the context of the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction as well 
in enjoining the state from interfering with the district use of levy proceeds previously withheld under section to repay bonds,the district court indicated that it was enforcing both court orders and the terms of the agreement that were incorporated into court orders.our review of the agreement and the numerous orders in this case leads us to conclude that the district court acted properly.
first,we find that the injunction was necessary to effectuate previous court orders.ensuring the kcmsd ability to repay funding obligations was a priority for both this court and the district court throughout this litigation.implicit in previous orders is a clear understanding that remedies would be fully funded.if we look back to when the district court first ordered the issuance of the capital improvement bonds and the property tax levy increase,we see that the district court specifically required that the revenues from the property tax increase be used to retire the capital improvement bonds.order of,at.the court directed that the portion of the tax increase that is required to pay the interest and principal of the bond indebtedness shall remain in effect until such time as the bonds are retired or until other provisions are adopted to insure their retirement.id.at.although on appeal we stated that the property tax levy should be used to fund other desegregation expenses in addition to retiring the bonds,we did not criticize the district court order regarding the repayment of the bonds.jenkins ii,at.
ten years later,when asked to approve the agreement between the state and the kcmsd releasing the state from the case,the courts again considered the property tax levy and the kcmsd ability to fund its desegregation obligations.in its order approving the agreement,the district court recognized that a ll of the parties agree that removal of the levy would result in fiscal chaos.jenkins missouri.at.while noting that its approval of the agreement would leave in place the levy for the transition period contemplated by the agreement,the district court warned the kcmsd that it was not the court responsibility to ensure funding for the district and directed the kcmsd to plan on being entirely after the period,even if that means regressing to a levy.id.at.the state asks us to consider this dicta as evidence that the dismissal of the state was not contingent on the district continued receipt of levy funds.we decline to do so,however,because the district court order was not the last word on the matter.in addressing two separate appeals of the district court order,our court took a different approach to funding.
first,in an opinion addressing the plaintiffs appeal of the district court approval of the agreement,we stressed that funding at the present level was unquestionably critical to the continuing success of the district programs.jenkins xiv,at.we stated that the continuing operation of the schools was dependent on the levy,which the kcmsd was only able to establish because the court enjoined the enforcement of state laws that set a lower levy limit.id.we noted,however,that the missouri general assembly had recently passed a joint resolution submitting for voter approval an amendment to the missouri constitution that would allow the kcmsd to maintain the levy at the level,thereby providing for a means of continued funding after the district was declared unitary and no longer under court supervision.id.assured of the likelihood of continued funding,we affirmed the district court approval of the agreement.we concluded,however,that should the loss of the level of funding under the current levy occur,it would present a changed circumstance that could call for reconsideration of the agreement.id.
then,in addressing the kcmsd separate appeal of the district court determination that it was not the court duty to ensure funding for the district,we again recognized the kcmsd need for sufficient funds to make payments on the bonds.jenkins missouri,cir jenkins xv.we found,however,that the kcmsd concern that it was on the brink of a funding crisis because it was uncertain whether it would have sufficient funds to retire the bonds was alleviated for the time being because after the appeal was argued the voters of missouri adopted a constitutional amendment that allows the board of the kcmsd to set the tax rate at an amount up to for assessed valuation.id.at discussing amendment to.const.g.based on this constitutional amendment,we stated that i t is now evident that kcmsd can raise funds to reti
