statement of facts 
lomnicki was hired as a fountain elementary school teacher by roseville community schools in.although there is evidence that lomnicki repeatedly molested a young male student in the,the appellee does not claim that the school district was ever made aware of this conduct.the misconduct material to this appeal began in the.
beginning with the school year,several fourth and girls complained that lomnicki had touched their legs when they were wearing dresses and put his hand down the back of their pants and up their dresses.according to one of the girls,when her father discussed the situation with slinde,slinde told him that she did not see how it could be possible.slinde testified that she spoke with lomnicki and warned him to be very careful not to touch any children inappropriately,but she did not follow up with that particular parent,she did not document the incident or report it to anyone,and on her retirement,she destroyed all of her files,including any contemporaneous notes she might have made regarding this incident.
the following year,several girls alleged that lomnicki had put his hands up their shirts and dresses,touched their buttocks,rubbed their backs,and made them sit on his lap during school in front of other children.one of these girls testified that slinde had questioned each of them and told them that she did want to hear anymore talk about it lomnicki touching and that they were to talk about it to anyone,not to tell their parents and if they continued to talk about it,then lomnicki would get in a lot of trouble,go to jail and die there.
other incidents involved two girls,one of whom was in a classroom alone when lomnicki came in behind her,put pieces of candy in her mouth and in each of her hands and then pulled her shirt tight and made comments about how her breasts had grown.the second girl alleged that lomnicki had on several occasions grabbed the inside part of her leg,stuck his hand down her top all the way to her pants and rubbed her vaginal area,and picked her up by the waist,spit the gum he had been chewing into her mouth,and stuck his tongue into her mouth to obtain her gum.it does not appear from the statements and testimony of these two girls that they reported these incidents to anyone.it is undisputed,however,that slinde did not relay the complaints that were reported to her to anyone in the administration of the school district,nor did she discipline lomnicki in any way.
sometime after these incidents,lomnicki was transferred to kaiser elementary school,but the school was not notified of the verbal warning given to him by slinde.in,superintendent mayer was advised that lomnicki had fondled the breasts of four girls.mayer investigated the matter and concluded that lomnicki exercised poor judgment.mayer placed a written a sealed lomnicki personnel file admonishing him and reminding him that you are not to straighten clothing or pick up jewelry from beneath a sweater or blouse or to touch students in a way which could be misinterpreted by them or their parents.lomnicki was warned that f uture instances of poor judgment on your part may result in more severe disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
following this incident,lomnicki was transferred to arbor elementary school,where he was assigned to a federally funded remedial reading program chapter i,in which he taught individual students,one at a time,in a private classroom.the officials at this school were not told of either the warning by slinde or the written reprimand from mayer.there were no reported incidents at arbor elementary school until nine years later when,in,several girls reported to the school principal that lomnicki had been hugging them in front of other students,giving them back rubs,placing his hands in their pockets,and forcibly holding their hands between his.the principal reported the allegations to assistant superintendent leroy herron and superintendent mayer.herron investigated the matter and placed a written in a sealed lomnicki file,classifying the incident as poor judgment and warning lomnicki that he was not to hug or put his hands on students in a manner that may be misconstrued by the students or their parents.because some of the girls were giggling when herron confronted them and did not give concrete answers to his questions,and because lomnicki had plausible explanations for all of his conduct,herron did not think that there was enough evidence for this incident to be considered child abuse.he did acknowledge that this was lomnicki second warning and recommended that in the future,lomnicki should not attempt to straighten out sweaters or blouses of his students.
superintendent mayer sent a confidential memo to the school board members and the school district attorney informing them of lomnicki reprimand and the incident.he advised that herron had met with lomnicki,and that mayer would notify the macomb county child abuse office,place a reprimand in lomnicki file,and immediately transfer lomnicki.lomnicki was indeed eastland elementary again,school officials were not informed of lomnicki history.again,lomnicki was assigned to the chapter i program.
jane,born in,encountered lomnicki when she entered kindergarten at eastland in,and began receiving individualized reading instruction from him.jane claims that on at least five separate occasions,lomnicki sexually abused her.according to jane,lomnicki had a mask,a rope and a small wooden bat on each of those occasions.the abuse included lomnicki removing her clothing touching her private parts with his hands and penetrating her vagina with his fingers taking her into the boys bathroom and,while wearing the mask,tying her wrists with rope,gagging her,hanging her from a hook on the door and hitting her with a small wooden bat time in the again wearing a mask,putting his finger in her vagina and slapping her in the face.jane claims that none of this abuse left any marks or bruises on her body,and that she did not tell anyone about these incidents because lomnicki threatened to kill her if she did.jane was unable to provide even approximate dates for any of the alleged incidents of abuse,and specifically,there is no evidence from any source that lomnicki abused jane during the period from january,when school officials first learned that lomnicki was under criminal investigation,until march,when he was removed from the classroom as we more fully explain below.
in late and early,april stamevski,one of the girls lomnicki had allegedly abused in the,learned that lomnicki was teaching at eastland elementary school,the elementary school for the area in which stamevski lived.outraged,she went to the families with children who lived on her street to warn them about lomnicki.one of the parents whom she told about lomnicki abuse of her was sally,jane mother.although stamevski did not mention the abuse in front of jane,sally questioned jane about whether anyone other than sally or jane sister had ever touched her in her private areas.jane denied that anyone had.
in light of stamevski warning,sally went to the school and questioned principal susan enke about it.enke apparently said that nothing of that sort happened in her school and that she would not remove jane from lomnicki supervision.however,in that meeting,enke alluded obliquely to a current criminal investigation of lomnicki.this investigation was into charges that from until,lomnicki had molested his neighbor,sarah williams,who was then in the fourth and fifth grades.apparently,lomnicki had tutored williams in math in her bedroom with the door closed,and during those sessions,he engaged in conduct ranging from kissing her to performing oral sex on her.although williams mother had on one occasion found williams on lomnicki lap,when williams told her approximately one year of lomnicki tutoring about the abuse,the mother did not believe her and did nothing about her report of abuse.it was not until that williams went to the police about lomnicki.as a result of the ensuing investigation,lomnicki was convicted of criminal sexual conduct and sentenced to to years imprisonment.
sally meeting with enke apparently occurred around the same time that school officials were first becoming aware of sarah williams complaint.while the exact date is not clear from the record before us,it appears that superintendent kment learned that the police were investigating lomnicki when the police requested lomnicki personnel file in january or february of.because lomnicki was a tenured teacher,the school district attorney,ronald greve,expressed reservations about whether the district had authority to suspend lomnicki on the basis of the police report in the williams matter.in early march of,however,lomnicki was removed from direct contact with students and given administrative duties in the school district central office.the investigation into williams charges of sexual abuse became public in.
despite the publicity in,jane did not tell anyone about lomnicki actions until november,when sally again questioned jane about whether someone had touched her.jane initially denied it,but eventually,apparently in a highly agitated state and clutching a book that lomnicki had given her,she told her mother that the man that gave me this book is the man that hurt me.
sally reported jane allegations to school officials in december.director of special education dorothea sue silavs filed a report with the michigan department of social services in which she stated that the alleged perpetrator of abuse was unknown but might possibly be in the household.the report noted further that 
s tudent has recently alleged that a reading teacher abused her two years ago,but circumstances are unlikely and child is inconsistent.investigation reveals child was evaluated and certified emotionally impaired and evaluation revealed reports of chuck norris hurts me when he touches my private parts.concern that child being abused but by whom someone at home 
because of the williams case and jane complaint,emmanuel tanay performed a psychological evaluation on lomnicki in march,at which time lomnicki retired from the school district.the following month,lomnicki was convicted of first and second degree criminal sexual conduct in the sarah williams case.
jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.in johnson jones,d,the supreme court held that the district court denial of summary judgment because the facts material to the defense of qualified immunity were in dispute was not subject to interlocutory review.at.however,the supreme court acknowledged in behrens pelletier,d,that johnson could not be read to mean that every denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.at.rather,johnson reaffirmed that summary judgment determinations are appealable when they resolve a dispute concerning an abstract issu e of law relating to qualified immunity.id.quoting johnson jones,at.moreover,in johnson,the court determined that when a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity involves a legal question,a court of appeals may take,as given,the facts that the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment for that purely legal reason.johnson,at.but if the district court does not identify those facts,the appellate court must undertake a cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the party,likely assumed.id.interpreting johnson,this circuit has held that t he question whether the uncontested facts demonstrated a constitutional violation is a pure question of one from which an immediate appeal can be taken where qualified immunity has been denied.turner scott,cir.further,we have said that t he district court assertion that there were genuine issues of material fact does not,standing alone,destroy the appealability of a qualified immunity ruling.id.
in the case before us,the district court did not identify the facts that it assumed when it denied summary judgment to each of the five defendants claiming qualified immunity.rather,it denied summary judgment because there were underlying factual disputes as to the qualified immunity.accordingly,we may review de novo the district court decision to determine whether,viewing the facts as the plaintiff portrays them,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.
qualified immunity 
this is an interlocutory appeal of the denial of qualified immunity to each of the defendant school officials.because qualified immunity is immunity from suit as well as from liability,we begin our review by determining whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all,and if so,whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.wilson layne,d.here,the plaintiff complaint claims that jane was deprived of her right not to have her bodily integrity violated by physical sexual abuse by a school employee.
this circuit held in doe claiborne county,cir,that a schoolchild right to personal security and to bodily integrity manifestly embraces the right to be free from sexual abuse at the hands of a public school employee.at.in arriving at that holding,we discussed at some length the impressive constitutional pedigree of the right to bodily integrity,including,among other notable precedent,ingraham wright,d,in which the supreme court declared that a mong the historic liberties protected by the due process clause is the right against unjustified intrusions on personal security at the hands of the state.claiborne county,at quoting ingraham,at.we concluded that,although we had not theretofore addressed the precise issue,every circuit to do so had held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the right of a child to be free from sexual abuse inflicted by a public school teacher.id.and we declared that sexual abuse under color of law is so contrary to fundamental notions of liberty and so lacking of any redeeming social value,that no rational individual could believe that sexual abuse by a state actor is
