background 
the hagerstown,indiana high school high school is a public school that serves students in grades through in one building.the high school is part of the nettle creek school corporation school corporation,which is governed by a board of trustees.at all relevant times,joe backmeyer was the superintendent of the school corporation.mark childs was the principal of the high school,and bill bunger was the assistant principal.
in,lucero,a female of hispanic national origin,interviewed for a position in the english department at the high school.lucero was certified to teach english to students in grades through,and during her employment interview childs informed lucero that she could be assigned to teach english in any grade at the high school.childs recommended to the board of trustees that the school corporation hire lucero,which it did.in august,lucero entered into a written teacher contract for the school year.lucero became a member of the nettle creek classroom teachers association.a collectively bargained agreement between that association and the school corporation governs the terms and conditions of lucero employment.
for the school year,childs assigned lucero to teach grade english,yearbook,and newspaper courses.lucero performance review for that year was positive,and the school renewed her contract for the school year.in,lucero taught grade english,yearbook,and newspaper.her performance for that year was reviewed positively as well,and the school corporation renewed her contract for.
for,high school administrators decided to offer for the first time an placement english course to seniors.lucero requested that childs assign her to teach the new course as well as an additional english course.childs granted this request,and for the school year,he assigned lucero to teach english,english,yearbook,and newspaper.in the summer of,in preparation for the course,lucero attended a workshop at ball state university.she also attended a high schools that work conference that summer.
childs commenced teaching english and english in fall.in november,childs observed lucero in the classroom,which was a customary component of the annual teaching performance evaluation.childs included his observations in a teacher visitation report.in his report,childs noted that,in his opinion,lucero did not use her classroom time efficiently.he noted one particular incident in which he felt lucero spent an inordinate amount of time answering a student question,during an interviewing skills exercise,that she share something deep about herself.rather than ask the student a question to more precisely pinpoint the focus of the request,lucero spoke for approximately ten minutes about a incident in which she and her husband were stopped by police.she opined what was that all about to us it was about discrimination.but it could have been due to us having texas plates,and state road being a drug pipeline the cop viewed it one way and we viewed it another.childs met with lucero to discuss his report.during the discussion,childs questioned lucero as to why lucero embarked on a ten minute dialogue.he continued the interviewer asked only one broad question and received much information.to use this as an opportunity to model the assignment you need to make the interviewer ask you more questions in order to get information.most students will not run with one question as you were able to do.during the meeting,lucero alerted childs that two male students had made inappropriate remarks to her,including dirty mexican and is this how they do it in mexico although lucero did not believe that childs adequately addressed these remarks,she did not fill out a disciplinary referral form,and she handled the situation within the classroom.
in december,members of lucero class met with childs to complain that lucero assigned a paper that she required them to complete in a short time period that coincided with several semester exams.childs responded by defending lucero and telling students that they would be able to complete the assignment if they used their time efficiently.
in spring,a parent of a student in lucero class complained to childs about the number of points lucero was attributing to a certain portfolio project.childs suggested that the parent contact lucero directly to try to resolve the parent complaint.lucero and the parent spoke but were unable to reach a resolution to the disagreement,and they ultimately agreed to disagree,according to lucero.also in spring,an entire class of students met with lucero and complained that her instructions were unclear.lucero denied the complaint and stated that she gave clear instructions.in may,some of lucero students and their parents voiced additional concerns to childs regarding lucero teaching practices.
on may,during lucero english class,student jacob brockman held up a photograph of student garrett fisher naked buttocks to the class the incident.lucero immediately wrote a referral regarding the incident to assistant principal bunger.she discussed the referral with bunger on the next day.she told bunger she would try to handle the matter on her own,but she asked if she could turn the referral form into him if she decided she was uncomfortable handling the incident.bunger responded,yes,put them in my mailbox.on may,lucero notified bunger that she wanted him to handle the incident.bunger told lucero he would investigate her referral after he completed some expulsion matters.
on may,childs informed lucero he had received an email alleging that she had allowed a cell phone with a picture of a penis to be passed around her classroom.lucero denied the accusation,and nothing ever came of the incident.
after learning of the cell phone allegation,lucero emailed bunger,stating that she would really like the incident taken care of as soon as possible.she expressed concern that if the administration did not respond soon,those seniors will think that they can get away with anything lucero also sent an email to childs,complaining that the administration had not yet addressed the incident that the credibility of the school corporation policies was at risk and that the school corporation was not supporting her efforts to maintain a classroom environment conducive to learning.lucero sent a email to childs approximately thirty minutes later,in which she again complained about the lack of enforcement of school policy regarding the incident and stated that she wish ed to avoid being accused of allowing sexual harassment to fester in her classroom as well.
on may,lucero was teaching a class in the school computer lab.fisher walked into the lab and informed a friend that lucero had turned him in for his role in the incident.lucero overheard fisher conversation.after lucero asked him to leave her classroom three times,fisher announced,i leaving.the entire incident lasted approximately thirty seconds.lucero referred fisher to bunger office for discipline.
on may,bunger notified lucero by email that students x and y fisher and brockman were suspended from school for two days for their involvement in the incident.
on may,three students placed playboy magazines in lucero classroom.lucero reported the incident to bunger.following the playboy incident,lucero emailed backmeyer,childs,bunger,and deborah brogan,the president of the nettle creek classroom teachers association,noting that she considered the playboy incident to be harassment of a teacher.she stated that pranks are common,but the types of issues that are surfacing condone a negative and hostile environment for women.on that same day,bunger informed lucero that the three students involved in the playboy incident received suspensions.the students then apologized to lucero and told her they did not mean to hurt her.they stated that they only placed the magazines in her classroom because she had been absent from work the day before and they could resist.
on may the seniors last day of school,lucero emailed childs and bunger to inform them that toward the end of class fisher had asked her,how come you turned in my photo it was no big deal.in her email,lucero expressed frustration at what she perceived as the administration failure to view the incident and her subsequent confrontation with fisher in the computer lab as more than mere childish pranks.at the end of the email,lucero stated,i consider what garrett fisher did to me in the computer lab harassing.it is harassment this is a complaint i am submitting to the office and there is only one day left in school to handle it.several days later,bunger informed lucero that he counseled fisher in response to her complaint.
at the end of the school year,childs informed lucero that he was not sure she had the personality to teach english to seniors,and he was considering reassigning her.on june,and,childs,brogan,lucero,and english department chairperson kent gray participated in a series of meetings regarding lucero next teaching assignment.during those meetings,childs informed lucero that her pacing in senior english was problematic and that he had received several complaints from parents and students about problems in her classroom during the school year.childs also told lucero that her personality and teaching style were not conducive to teaching seniors,and that she was better suited to teaching junior high students.lucero responded that childs was moving her because she had asked him to do something about the and playboy incidents.lucero also asked whether bias may be a factor,and reminded him of the derogatory remarks made by two students,including the dirty mexican remark.childs did not respond to her inquiry.childs told lucero that he would not reassign her from teaching seniors unless he could find someone who had advanced placement training or was otherwise more qualified to teach the senior courses.
brogan told childs that if he did reassign lucero,the teachers association and lucero would consider the reassignment a formal reprimand.the collective bargaining agreement provides that r eassignment transfer of an employee shall be made on the basis of qualifications.
superintendent backmeyer then posted a position for an english teacher.childs interviewed aaron chester,a white male,for the position.at that time,chester had never taught a senior english course,and he did not have experience teaching honors or ap courses.on june,childs and backmeyer decided that they wanted to hire chester as an english teacher at the high school because a he had four years experience teaching high students in other indiana high schools and had established a good rapport with those students b he had positive employment references from two other school corporations c he had a passion for british literature d he had a pleasant,courteous,calm,and confident personality and e he was technologically savvy in the classroom.on july,backmeyer recommended to the board of trustees that it hire chester as an english teacher,and the board approved this recommendation.
on the same day that it hired chester,the board renewed lucero teaching contract for the school year.on july,childs informed lucero in writing that he had decided to assign her to teach grade english,as well as yearbook and newspaper,and that chester would teach english and english for the school year.lucero would not lose any pay,benefits,or privileges as a result of her reassignment to grade english.
on july,lucero filed a discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission,alleging gender and national origin discrimination and retaliation.she claimed that she was reassigned from english to english because of her gender and in retaliation for complaining about the alleged hostile work environment created by students in her senior english classes.on september,lucero filed a second charge of discrimination with the eeoc,alleging the school corporation retaliated against her because childs met with her to discuss her tardiness to a meeting and warned her that future attendance issues could result in discipline.the eeoc ultimately dismissed both charges.
on august,lucero,in conjunction with the teachers association,filed a grievance under the school corporation just cause and appeal policy,which prohibited the school corporation from reprimanding a teacher without just cause.lucero sought reinstatement to her position as teacher of english and english.on november,lucero grievance went to an arbitration hearing.the arbitrator dismissed the grievance on the basis that her teaching reassignment was not a reprimand and was not arbitrable.
on november,backmeyer recommended that the school corporation repeal the just cause and appeal policy because he felt the teachers association had misused the policy.prior to making his recommendation,backmeyer discussed the matter with a teachers association discussion team,as required by the collective bargaining agreement.that same day,the board repealed the policy at issue.
in december,lucero received a summative evaluation form from childs.in that document,childs noted that lucero,as primarily a grade teacher,had made progress in many areas,including her use of instructional time and her ability to motivate her students.
on january,lucero filed a civil lawsuit against her employer in the wayne county,indiana circuit court.the lawsuit challenged the decision to reassign her to teach grade english for the school year instead of senior english courses.lucero challenged her teaching reassignment under several legal theories,including retaliation,discrimination,hostile work environment,and breach of contract.lucero alleged that she had incurred about in medical bills since for treatment for physical and emotional stress as a result of defendants retaliatory actions.she alleged she incurred additional financial harm obtaining training to teach seniors.on february,defendants removed the civil rights suit to federal district court in indianapolis,indiana.
on march,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to all of lucero claims.after receiving extensions of time for her to respond to this motion,lucero filed a motion for leave to file brief in excess of pages,which the district court granted.on august,lucero filed a brief that was pages in length.lucero also attached tabbed exhibits to the brief.on december,the district court entered an order sua sponte striking lucero response brief and ordering her to file an amended response brief not to exceed pages in length.on march,lucero filed her amended response brief.on july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of lucero claims.lucero appealed the district court ruling with respect to her claims for retaliation,discrimination,hostile work environment,and breach of contract,and she appealed the district court decision to strike her initial response brief.

retaliation claims 
lucero appeals on her retaliation claims.in her retaliation claims,lucero claims defendants violated title vii of the civil rights act of a and title ix of the education amendments of a by retaliating against her for complaining about alleged discrimination.to prevail on her retaliation claims,lucero must establish that she suffered a materially adverse employment action.burlington northern and santa fe ry.white,d.the district court found that lucero had not submitted sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her reassignment to teach english primarily to grade students,instead of grade students,was a materially adverse employment action.as a result,it granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on these claims.the parties focus their arguments on this dispositive question.
we examine this question in light of the supreme court decision in burlington.in that case,burlington had hired sheila white as a railroad track laborer,a job that entailed removing and replacing track components,transporting track material,cutting brush,and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the.some facets of that job involved operation of a forklift.white was soon assigned to operate the forklift,and while she also performed some of the other track laborer chores,operation of the forklift became her primary responsibility.after she complained to burlington officials about sexual harassment by her male supervisor,however,white was relieved of forklift duty and assigned to perform only other track laborer tasks.id.at.she sued,asserting a claim of retaliation,and a jury found in her favor,concluding that her reassignment was a materially adverse employment action.the district court denied a posttrial motion by burlington for judgment dismissing white claim as a matter of law.white burlington northern and santa fe ry,wl.nov.the sixth circuit initially reversed the judgment,but the full appeals court vacated the panel decision,heard the matter en banc,and affirmed the district court judgment in white favor.white burlington northern santa fe,cir.
the supreme court heard the case to clear up a circuit split as to the standard for when a reassignment of duties is a materially adverse action.the court cautioned that reassignment of job duties is not automatically actionable,and that the standard for assessing such a reassignment is an objective,rather than a subjective,one.id.at.the court stated that materially adverse in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.at.quoting rochon gonzales.p etty slights,minor annoyances,and simple lack of good manners are normally not sufficient to deter a reasonable person.id.the court further stated that whether an action is materially adverse often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectations,and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.id.at.quoting oncale sundowner offshore,d.
applying the law to the case in front of it,the court rejected burlington contention that the reassignment of white could not be considered materially adverse because her former and present duties f e ll within the same job description.id.at.the court concluded h ere,the jury had before it considerable evidence that the track labor duties were by all accounts more arduous and dirtier that the forklift operator position required more qualifications,which is an indication of prestige and that the forklift operator position was objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented white for occupying it.based on this record,a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.id.at.quoting burlington,at internal citations omitted.
turning to our case,lucero argues on appeal that her job reassignment was an adverse action because her teaching reassignment would dissuade reasonable teachers from making or supporting a charge of discrimination and,she argues,her reassignment actually did dissuade other teachers from bringing discrimination charges and teaching english is less prestigious than teaching seniors.to support her argument that her teaching reassignment has dissuaded teachers from making a charge of discrimination,lucero submitted affidavits from colleagues that state that lucero reassignment has dissuaded other discrimination charges.however,the same individuals that filed the affidavits have been involved in making and supporting discrimination charges on lucero behalf since the reassignment,demonstrating that they were not in fact dissuaded.more to the point,unlike the employee in burlington,lucero was not reassigned to a position consisting of objectively less desirable duties.she continued to teach the same academic subject in the same building and under the same conditions after her reassignment.in fact,her reassigned duties were the same teaching duties she successfully performed for all but one year of teaching for the school corporation.she did not suffer a cut in pay,benefits,or privileges of employment when she was assigned to teach english for the school year.
lucero effort to create an issue of fact as to an adverse employment action by asserting that her teaching assignment was less prestigious than her previous assignment fails.the supreme court in burlington did reference prestige once,when it stated the forklift operator position required more qualifications,which is an indication of prestige.here,there no evidence that a grade english teacher has more qualifications than a grade teacher.while lucero may subjectively believe that teaching high school students is more prestigious than teaching junior high students,her personal preference is not sufficient to establish an adverse action.as defendants point out,if personal preference alone was sufficient to establish adverse employment action,the objective requirement for such a finding would effectively be eliminated and federal employment law would become a mechanism for enforcing employee preferences rather than remedying materially adverse treatment.from an objective standpoint,lucero reassignment from grade english teacher to grade english teacher would not dissuade a reasonable teacher from bringing a discrimination charge against defendants,as required by burlington.no reasonable employee would see her reassignment as materially adverse.the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on lucero retaliation claims was proper.
discrimination claims 
in her discrimination claims,lucero alleges that defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her sex,race,color,and natural origin.she brings these claims under title vii,title ix,and.similar to her retaliation claims,to succeed on her discrimination claims lucero must demonstrate a materially adverse employment action that resulted from the alleged discrimination to survive summary judgment.lewis city of chicago,cir.we have noted that materially adverse employment actions that result from discrimination can be categorized into three groups of cases involving the employee current wealth such as compensation,fringe benefits,and financial terms of employment including termination the employee career prospects thus impacting the employee future wealth and changes to the employee work conditions including subjecting her to humiliating,degrading,unsafe,unhealthy,or otherwise significant negative alteration in her work place environment.id.at quoting herrnreiter chicago hous,cir.
lucero argues that she suffered a materially adverse employment action that resulted from the alleged discrimination.while lucero compensation,benefits,and workplace environment remain unchanged,she claims that the reassignment damaged her career prospects because teaching seniors and english requires more training than teaching grade,and because she is now a floater teacher assigned to english and to monitor study halls in addition to teaching english,making her more susceptible to a reduction in force and less attractive to other school districts.
lucero lacks proof for her argument that teaching senior english,including english,requires more specialized training than teaching grade english.in addition to her own testimony,lucero attempts to rely upon the affidavits of her advocates and colleagues.although lucero affiants assert that teaching seniors requires more specialized training,they lack objective evidence to support their opinions.we do not doubt that a teacher,to succeed in teaching graders,must employ different skills than she would employ to successfully teach graders.each grade level calls for certain unique,specialized skills in teachers.we can not conclude that teaching seniors requires more specia
