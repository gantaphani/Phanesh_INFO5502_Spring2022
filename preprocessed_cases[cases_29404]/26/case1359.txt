probationary teacher michael sullivan appeals from a judgment denying his petition for writ of mandamus.the petition sought to compel the centinela valley union high school district the district to reinstate sullivan with permanent status tenure because he alleged the district was one day late in serving him with notice that he would not be reelected for the following school year.
education code section states a teacher on probationary status is deemed to have been reelected for the next succeeding school year unless notified by march of the decision not to reelect him or her.if the governing school board does not meet the statutory deadline,a second year probationary teacher,like sullivan,attains tenure,subd.b.since the statute is silent as to the method to serve notice,hoschler sacramento city unified school dist.th,hoschler held the notification requirement of section,subdivision b contemplates personal service or some other method equivalent to imparting actual notice.hoschler,however,did not discuss whether an exception applies for willful evasion of service.
in this case,we hold a probationary teacher may not assert failure of service under section,subdivision b when the probationary teacher avoids service where,under the circumstances,it reasonably can be inferred the teacher did so with knowledge of the decision.based upon substantial evidence in the record,we invoke the exception here,and affirm on those grounds.we also affirm on the alternative grounds that sullivan had actual notice,as required by hoschler,before the statutory deadline 
factual and procedural background

sullivan called in sick on march and.
on march,sullivan appeared at the board meeting.among the agenda items was the reelection of probationary employees.sullivan and attorney milton kerlan,addressed the board on sullivan behalf and asked the board to reconsider and reelect sullivan.the minutes reflect kerlan spoke on sullivan behalf as his attorney,but kerlan later claimed he spoke as sullivan personal friend.sullivan left the board meeting when the board went into its first closed session,and he did not return until after the meeting had adjourned.

petition for writ of mandamus 
sullivan filed a petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the petition sought to compel the district to reinstate him with permanent status because the district notification letter did not satisfy the service requirements of section,subdivision b,as interpreted in hoschler,supra,th at page.the district answer to the petition raised equitable defenses,including estoppel.
the court denied sullivan petition.the trial court noted that sullivan had been tipped off on march that he would not be reelected.thereafter,his conduct at the board meeting,missing work the next day,and not being home on march strongly suggest ed that he purposely prevented such notice from being given.citing hoschler,the court found it inapposite because the teacher in that case did not willfully refuse to pick up the letter,which informed him that the school board decided not to reelect him.thus,the trial court found the district obligation to personally serve notice on or before march was excused,based upon equitable principles in the civil code

discussion 
standards of review 
contrary to sullivan assertion,this appeal is governed by two different standards of review.we exercise our independent judgment on questions of law.womack san francisco community college dist.th.we apply the substantial evidence standard to the trial court factual determinations.ibid.
sullivan can not evade service to assert the absence of personal service 
sullivan contends the district had to strictly comply with the notice requirement in section,subdivision b as construed in hoschler,supra,th at page.although the letter stating he was not reelected was timely received at his address on march,sullivan maintains he was not personally served within the statutory deadline.sullivan contention overlooks the substantial evidence that he willfully evaded service of the notice not to reelect him.
for the first two years of employment,a certificated teacher in a large school district or more students is a probationary employee,subd.b.as long as the district notifies the teacher on or before march of the decision not to rehire for the next year,the district may release the teacher without a showing of cause or any right to appeal the district decision.see hoschler,supra,th at.section,subdivision b sets forth the notice requirement the governing board shall notify the employee,on or before march of the employee second complete consecutive school year of employment by the district of the decision to reelect or not reelect the employee for the next succeeding school year to the position.in the event that the governing board does not give notice pursuant to this section on or before march,the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.
section,subdivision b is silent as to the method of giving the required notice.hoschler,supra,th at.after reviewing the notice requirements of several dismissal statutes in the education code,along with the legislative history of section,the hoschler court concluded the notification requirement of section,subdivision b contemplates personal service or some other method equivalent to imparting actual notice.hoschler,supra,at.since a probationary teacher has no procedural due process rights under section,notification of the decision is the end of the line for that teacher and gives the teacher time to make alternate plans,apply for other jobs,and have time to relocate if necessary.hoschler,supra,at.
hoschler did not consider an exception to the notice requirement for willful refusal to accept personal service it was undisputed in hoschler that the teacher did not willfully refuse to pick up the letter.hoschler,however,acknowledges that a person may not assert the failure of service when delivery was deliberately prevented and,where it can be inferred the person was aware of the nature of the correspondence.hoschler,supra,th at,fn.see also hankla governing bd.d.hoschler had no occasion to apply this principle to the notification requirement of section,subdivision b.hoschler,supra,at.as the hoschler court reminds us,opinions are not authority for issues not considered.id.at.
in hankla governing,supra,d,the court held that a teacher could not assert failure of service when he willfully disregarded a notice of certified mail delivered to his address where it was reasonable to infer he knew that it was a dismissal letter.id.at.hankla received two notices
