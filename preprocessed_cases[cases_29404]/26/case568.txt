carolyn carter,who is,brought suit against her former employer,the university of toledo,alleging that the university failed to renew her contract as a visiting professor because of her race.the district court granted the university motion for summary judgment,concluding that carter had failed to show any direct evidence of discrimination and had also failed to establish that the legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons given by the university for not renewing her contract were a pretext to disguise racial discrimination.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the university of toledo hired carter in january of as an assistant professor of curriculum and instruction in the university college of education.carter assistant professorship was a faculty position.in october of,the university personnel committee recognized carter as having shown good progress in her teaching,professional activities and service.the personnel committee unanimously recommended that her faculty appointment be renewed.professor james gress,the chairman of carter department,echoed the committee sentiments in his support for carter reappointment.
as a result of these favorable recommendations,the university renewed carter appointment for two years and awarded her a merit pay increase.carter,however,voluntarily resigned from her faculty position in may of to take an administrative position in the jackson,michigan school district.she left the university in july of after teaching the first of the summer school sessions.
due to another change in career plans,carter returned to the university of toledo as a visiting faculty member for the academic year.charlene czerniak,who was then interim dean of the college of education,extended carter an offer for the visiting professorship in the educational administration and supervision edas program in the college of education department of foundations and leadership.carter accepted the appointment in the edas program,as did three other visiting barsi,brenda lanclos,and richard were all caucasian.
the university did not renew carter appointment after the academic year.in july of,carter sent an message to czerniak inquiring about the renewal of her contract with the university for the following year.czerniak responded that the university had met its hiring needs for the year and would not be extending carter appointment.
carter was not the only visiting professor whose contract was not renewed for the academic year.neither john,who like carter was teaching in the edas program,nor mary anne stibbe,a visiting professor in the college of education department of curriculum and psychological studies,were reappointed for.both john and stibbe are caucasian.
barsi and lanclos,the other two edas visiting professors,were rehired for the following academic year,but not in the edas program.three new visiting professors were hired in the edas program for the academic year.one was bunk adams,who is,and the other two were sandra mckinley and robin rayfield,both caucasian.
when she had not heard anything about the renewal of her visiting professorship,carter contacted earl murry,the university vice provost.murry duties as vice provost included acting as chief negotiator for the faculty collective bargaining agreements,coordinating faculty recruiting,hiring,training,and orientation,advising the provost on tenure and promotions,reviewing salary matters,and ensuring compliance with affirmative action requirements.according to carter,murry said that he would investigate the matter and get back to her.when murry did not promptly get in touch with carter,she called him back to ask whether he had any information about the renewal of her contract.
murry told carter that he had not yet discussed the issue with czerniak,and then,according to carter,volunteered that czerniak is trying to whitewash the college of education and i am not going to let her do this.carter also asserts that murry told me that czerniak was trying to get rid of the black professors and that he was in a struggle with her involving the appointment of an additional black professor.when she contacted him a third time to find out whether her appointment would be renewed,carter claims that murry said i do know what going on,they a bunch of racists over there.murry denies making any of these statements.
carter sued the university of toledo in june of.she alleged that the university discriminated against her because of her race in violation of title vii,and ohio revised code and.carter also claimed that the university subjected her to a racially hostile work environment in violation of title vii and ohio law.the university moved for summary judgment,arguing that carter had failed to present either direct or circumstantial evidence of racial discrimination,and asserting that her hostile work environment claims were without merit because she had not presented any evidence supporting these claims.
in june of,the district court granted the university motion for summary judgment.carter filed a timely appeal.in her briefs on appeal,however,carter does not address the district court ruling on her claims of a racially hostile work environment.we therefore consider those arguments waived.see farm labor org.comm.ohio state highway patrol,cir it is well established that an issue not raised in a party briefs may be deemed waived.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,thermoscan,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
direct evidence of discrimination 
we shall consider carter federal and discrimination claims under the title vii framework because ohio requirements are the same as under federal law.see ohio civil rights comm ingram,ohio.to establish a title vii employment discrimination claim,carter was required to either present direct evidence of discrimination or introduce circumstantial evidence that would allow an inference of discriminatory treatment.johnson kroger,cir.carter argues that the alleged comments made by murry constitute direct evidence of discrimination.she points to three comments purportedly made by him that czerniak was trying to whitewash the college of education faculty,that murry was struggling with czerniak to appoint professors,and that the at the college of education are a bunch of racists.
the district court began its analysis by considering whether or not carter would be allowed to testify as to these comments allegedly made by murry.we do not need to address this evidentiary issue with regard to our analysis of the argument,however,because even if murry comments are admissible as nonhearsay,they do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination against carter under controlling sixth circuit precedent.
this court has held that comments made by individuals who are not involved in the process regarding the plaintiff employment do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination.see hopson daimlerchrysler,cir holding that a company manager opinion that race was a factor in the company decision not to promote the plaintiff was not direct evidence for purposes of the plaintiff discrimination claim because the manager had no involvement in the process with respect to the particular jobs at issue.murry was not a with regard to the renewal of carter visiting professorship.his statements therefore can not be considered direct evidence of racial discrimination against carter.
circumstantial evidence 
where a plaintiff fails to present direct evidence of discrimination,the framework first articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and refined by texas d
