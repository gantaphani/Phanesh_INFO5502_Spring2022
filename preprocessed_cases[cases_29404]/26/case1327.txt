vincent deyoung was a tenured teacher with the hueneme elementary school district district.the district governing board voted to dismiss him based on charges he had physically and abusively disciplined his students.the vote occurred after a district representative orally presented the charges to the board in a confidential proceeding.although written charges subsequently were prepared and provided to deyoung,the education code required that the board,prior to initiating dismissal,consider either verified written charges prepared by the district or written charges formulated by the board itself.deyoung contends the board failure to consider or formulate written charges before initiating his dismissal nullified all further proceedings.ibid.because this procedural error was neither substantive nor prejudicial,we conclude deyoung dismissal was proper,subd.c.
the commission on professional competence of the hueneme elementary school district commission upheld deyoung dismissal on the merits.it rejected his assertion the governing board procedural error in initiating dismissal deprived it of jurisdiction to review the board decision.nonsubstantive procedural errors committed by a school district or governing board do not preclude dismissing a teacher unless the errors are prejudicial errors,subd.c.
the trial court denied deyoung petition for writ of mandate.it found,as did the commission,that the governing board failure to consider or formulate written charges before initiating deyoung dismissal was a nonsubstantive procedural error that was not prejudicial.we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
deyoung is a permanent,certificated tenured teacher who began working for the district in.his assignment for the school year was a combination class of second and third graders who were english learners their first language was spanish.on march,deyoung became angry and frustrated with students who were talking and laughing during a classroom movie.he grabbed some of the students,told them to shut up,called them stupid,struck one student in the foot with a chair,hit three students on top of the head with a yardstick or metal desk leg,and threw a pencil or pen at two or three students.his conduct frightened the students and,in some instances,caused physical pain.
the next day,after receiving complaints from parents,the school principal,heidi haines,discussed the incident with deyoung and his union representative.deyoung admitted raising his voice and using the word stupid.he claimed he a child to a different chair,but denied hitting any of the students or throwing chairs.haines discussed the matter with him again the following week and in april.during that time frame,deyoung told a colleague he was being accused of hitting his students.
in late april,the assistant superintendent,deborah desmeth,met with deyoung to discuss the incident.he denied throwing anything,hitting any students or calling them names.district representatives orally informed the governing board of the complaints against deyoung.on may,the district sent a letter to deyoung detailing the charges against him and advising he was being placed on administrative leave.in september,the district held a skelly meeting to allow deyoung and his counsel to respond to the district proposed action to dismiss him.at that meeting deyoung acknowledged that the students misbehavior and laughter frustrated him and caused him to use poor judgment.he also admitted using the word stupid and throwing a pencil at a student.
during a closed meeting in october,the district governing board voted to dismiss deyoung based on charges and information orally presented by desmeth.thereafter,the district sent a letter advising deyoung of the board decision and outlining the specific charges.in december,the district served an amended written accusation proposing to dismiss deyoung on grounds of evident unfitness for service,subd.a,refusal to obey school laws id.at subd.a and immoral conduct,subd.a.deyoung requested a hearing before the commission and actively participated in all phases of the administrative process.
deyoung moved to dismiss the administrative proceeding,citing the governing board violation of section when it failed to consider or formulate written charges before initiating his dismissal.at the start of the evidentiary hearing,the commission chairperson asked deyoung counsel if he had any case law to support any situation where there ever been a decision to dismiss the case because of this type of oversight he responded there no preceden t on that i aware of.the chairperson denied the motion to dismiss.in a unanimous decision,the commission upheld deyoung dismissal based on his evident unfitness for service,violation of school rules and immoral conduct.among other things,it determined deyoung testimony was not credible and that h e appeared to be adapting his testimony to explain the children accounts of his conduct without acknowledging the full extent of his inappropriate actions.
deyoung petitioned for a writ of mandate.he claimed the commission lacked jurisdiction over the proceeding because the district governing board was not acting on written charges presented to it when it authorized the district to terminate his employment,as required by section.he did not contest the merits of the commission decision.the trial court rejected deyoung strict interpretation of section,choosing to apply a less strict construction viewed in conjunction with the allover circumstances which are present.in denying the petition,the court found the failure to prepare written charges as the very first step in the process was error,but it was and.deyoung appeals.

construction of sections and,subdivision c 
the district contends the procedural requirements for initiating dismissal under section are subject to application of section,subdivision c.relying upon the statute plain meaning,deyoung asserts the requirements in section are mandatory and,as a result,the district and governing board failure to strictly comply with the requirements nullified the board decision to dismiss him,depriving the commission of jurisdiction to proceed.
our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citations.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,san leandro teachers governing bd.of san leandro unified school dist.cal th.

we also are not persuaded by deyoung analogies to cases addressing the notice requirements in section.that section applies when a tenured teacher is charged with unprofessional conduct.among other things,it requires the school district governing board to give the teacher at least days written notice before acting upon that charge.the notice requirement is remedial in that it furnish es the employee an opportunity to correct his or her faults and overcome the grounds for the charge,subd.a.in light of its remedial purpose,courts have held that providing written notice under that section is a jurisdictional prerequisite to proceeding with any charges mentioned in that provision.crowl commission on professional competence d,crowl tarquin commission on professional competence d,tarquin woodland joint unified school dist.commission on professional competence th,woodland where a school district seeking the dismissal of a permanent certificated employee on charges of unprofessional conduct fails to comply with the notice provision of section,subdivision a,it lacks jurisdiction to proceed,and any action subsequently taken against the employee is invalid.
