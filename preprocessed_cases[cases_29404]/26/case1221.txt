appellants include an association of emergency coalition to defend educational travel the coalition two college professors,and three undergraduate students.they sued the secretary of treasury and the office of foreign assets control within treasury the office asserting that the amendments to the office regulations governing the cuba trade embargo,which tightened restrictions on study programs,violated the first and fifth amendments of the constitution,as well as the apa.the district court,in a thoughtful opinion,granted the government motions to dismiss.we affirm.
in,president kennedy exercised his broad authority under the trading with the enemy act.b the act,to impose a comprehensive trade embargo against cuba.pursuant to a presidential designation under the act,treasury is the agency responsible for administering the embargo regime,and treasury has in turn delegated the promulgation and implementation of the regulations thereunder to the office.cuban assets control regulations,part.while the regulations were initially issued in order to combat subversive activities undertaken by the castro regime throughout latin america,over the years,their scope and stringency have waxed and waned in response to the shifting foreign policies of succeeding presidential administrations.the essential objective of the embargo,however,has remained the same to isolate the cuban government by depriving the island economy of the benefit of dollars.
under the present regulations,the office authorizes travel to cuba via the issuance of either a general or a specific license.a general license is made available for travel related to official government business and,in certain defined circumstances,for journalistic or professional research activities.specific licenses are dispensed on a basis for all other purposes,including,inter alia,travel connected with familial obligations,religious activities,humanitarian projects,and cultural performances or exhibitions.under the regulations,accredited undergraduate or graduate academic institutions are eligible to obtain a specific license so as to allow qualified individuals to engage in an enumerated list of activities,including participation in a structured educational program in cuba.this limited exemption for selected educational activities has been in effect since.
at immediate issue in this suit are certain amendments to the cuba travel restrictions that resulted in a diminution of this exemption.these amendments were inspired by the recommendations of the interagency commission for assistance to a free cuba,established in by president george bush.secretary of state colin powell chaired the commission,which was composed of representatives from a variety of executive agencies,including the secretaries of treasury,housing and urban development,commerce,and homeland security,as well as the president national security advisor.president bush directed the commission to report to him on how the government might best induce the peaceful fall of the castro dictatorship.among the stated objectives of the commission was to strengthen enforcement of travel restrictions in response to a perception that travel licenses had been abused as a covert means to undertake illegal business or tourist travel.
in may,the commission submitted its report the commission noted that the castro regime has aggressively promoted tourism as an integral part of its strategy for retaining its grip on power.the commission observed that while some participants had used the specific licenses in accordance with their intended academic objective,less scrupulous travelers and universities had circumvented the embargo by using the licenses for improper tourist purposes.and the report was particularly dubious of certain programs of short duration that allowed for minimal interaction with cuban citizens and provided for excessive unstructured time during which participants might pursue purely tourist activities.concern was expressed that such programs were often cynically manipulated by the cuban regime to coat the repressive communist state with a patina of reasonability,openness,and legitimacy.the report concluded that a requirement that specific licenses for educational activities be granted solely to,ten weeks or more programs would retain the benefits of promoting the study of cuba and of diffusing american values throughout the island nation while curtailing abuses.
the amendments to the regulations resulted.first,a durational requirement for educational programs conducted in cuba by academic institutions was added to the travel restrictions whereby any such program must last for at least one full academic term of no fewer than ten weeks.second,the amendments require that any student traveling to cuba under the specific license of an academic institution must be enrolled in either an undergraduate or graduate degree program at such,in a course offered by another university would no longer be permitted.finally,the amended regulations plainly state that any faculty teaching under the auspices of an academic institution license must be permanent employees regularly employed in a teaching capacity at the licensed institution.the coalition claims that this final requirement is new as of the amendments the government disputes this and asserts that the amendments merely clarified requirements contained in the existing regulations.
the coalition is an organization of over four hundred academic professionals employed by accredited colleges and universities,both state and private.the group was formed in response to the amendments,and its sole purpose is to seek rescission of the amendments,or,in the coalition more colorful language,to defend the freedom of professors and students to design,teach,and attend courses in cuba free of government diktat.
appellant wayne smith,is the chairman of the coalition and an adjunct professor of latin american studies at johns hopkins university.he also serves as director of johns hopkins cuba exchange program,and between and,smith taught annual courses to american students enrolled in the program.he asserts that the amendments not only resulted in the cancellation of the exchange program but also bar him personally from teaching in cuba due to his status as an adjunct professor.appellant john walton cotman,is an associate professor of political science at howard university and specializes in the study of international relations and comparative politics in the caribbean region.cotman claims that the amendments prohibit him from teaching courses offered in cuba by other universities.appellant abby wakefield was a johns hopkins sophomore when this suit was filed.she has been informed by smith,speaking in his capacity as head of the cuban exchange program,that the university courses will resume immediately should the challenged rulemaking be rescinded and that she will be accepted into the first such program.
appellants argue that the amendments caused the cancellation of virtually all of the courses offered in cuba by universities.they claim that the ban on the prior practice of aggregating students from a variety of universities into one course offered by a single institution has made it economically infeasible for most universities to continue to offer courses in cuba,given the limited resources available and the relatively small number of students interested in cuba study at any one university.it is also asserted that the requirement that teachers of cuba courses be permanent employees regularly employed in a teaching capacity at the licensed institution has drastically reduced the pool of professors eligible to teach such courses.for example,this restriction,appellants argue,has precluded smith qua adjunct professor and cotman qua guest professor from teaching in cuba.finally,appellants argue that the minimum duration requirement prevents most interested students from studying in cuba,since the standard graduation schedule can not accommodate a semester devoted solely to the pursuit of one course.
the coalition brought a mix of constitutional and statutory claims in the district court.they claimed that the amendments savage restrictions on academic programs in cuba unconstitutionally violate their rights to academic freedom under the first amendment and the fifth amendment substantive due process clause sic and their rights to travel internationally for first amendment purposes under the fifth amendment.appellants claimed,moreover,that the amendments violate the act and the apa.
the government responded that each of the appellants lacks standing to bring the asserted challenges,arguing that appellants had not sustained an of sufficient concreteness or imminence and that appellants had failed to demonstrate that a favorable decision would redress the alleged injury,because any such relief depends on the independent action of universities.on the merits,the government argued i that the amendments are a reasonable interpretation of the act and moreover fall squarely within the executive branch inherent foreign policy powers and ii that the amendments did not deprive appellants of any constitutional right.
the district court rejected the government standing challenge as to smith and wakefield as individuals,as well to the coalition as an association.emergency coalition to defend educational travel dep t of treasury,d,but described the issue as close.id.at.cotman was held to lack standing on the grounds that he had failed to demonstrate sufficiently concrete plans or opportunities for educational travel to cuba.id 
the court also held that even assuming,arguendo,that appellants possess a right to academic freedom,no violation of any such right occurred as a result of the amendments,since the regulations in question are and supported by an important and substantial governmental interest.id.at.appellants fifth amendment arguments were rejected as simply wrong.id.at.finally,the court held that both of appellants statutory the restrictions are not rationally related to the purposes of the act and that the amendments contravene the will of merit.id.at.
this appeal followed.
the government reiterates its contention that none of the appellants has standing and that we therefore lack jurisdiction over the case.of course,if any one of appellants has standing,we have jurisdiction.the government claims that smith is the linchpin of the appellants standing case the standing of both the coalition and wakefield is dependent on him.we therefore address smith claim first.
smith asserts that in each year from until the regulations were promulgated,he had taken fifteen to twenty students for january study programs in cuba.he also frequently took groups of six to eight students for a similar course in june.smith claims to have been injured by each of the three amendments at issue.the faculty requirement most directly affects smith,as he neither holds a position at johns hopkins nor intends to do so in the future.the and minimum duration requirements allegedly injure smith by drying up the funds necessary to support the cuba program at johns hopkins and by driving away the program student clientele,respectively,thus denying smith the opportunity to teach in cuba.despite the success of the cuba courses to date at a university known for its study abroad offerings,the amendments are alleged to have forced johns hopkins to cancel the programs.smith states that he and professor eduardo gonzález had already made concrete plans for the january course and were intent upon continuing the program into the indefinite future.he further indicates that the two professors doubtless would have accompanied the group to havana and shared in teaching the course.the district court thought that appellants had the better argument in that their concrete and definite statements of future plans elevate their claims beyond the realm of hypothetical intentions and suffice to support a finding of.d at.
we agree.although the supreme court has said that some day any description of concrete plans,or indeed even any specification of when the some day will not support a finding of the actual or imminent injury that our cases require,lujan defenders of wildlife,d emphasis in original,the consistent annual repetition of the january program over several years culminating in concrete plans for the content and focus of the program are plainly far more concrete and specific than mere some day intentions.
notwithstanding,the government insists smith can not establish because it reads the regulations as barring faculty from teaching in cuba.thus,according to the government,even were the amendments to be rescinded,he would be ineligible to teach in cuba.the prior regulations were,however,ambiguous 
the organization of and preparation for transactions and activities described in paragraphs a i through a vi of this section by a employee of a academic institution.an individual engaging in such transactions must carry a written letter from the individual academic institution,citing the number of that institution specific license and stating that the individual is regularly employed there 
it is not clear whether this provision meant that those who organize and prepare teaching activities include the faculty who do the teaching.it is evident that the office must have thought the prior regulations did not clearly reach someone like smith,for otherwise the relevant amendment would not have been introduced.in any event,the government is mixing a merits question into the standing analysis,which is improper.in considering standing,we must assume the merits in favor of the party invoking our jurisdiction.see warth seldin,d see also parker district of columbia,aff on other grounds sub nom.district of columbia heller,d city of waukesha epa,am.fed of gov t employees,pierce.therefore,we must assume that the amendments have the legal significance appellants assert.moreover,as the coalition observes,even if the government were correct,smith would still satisfy the element because he would then be asserting that the newly caused his injury.
alternatively,the government challenges redressability,arguing that even if the amendments were voided,it is unlikely that johns hopkins would resume the program.it is clear that the program was discontinued because of the amendments.indeed,the government has conceded causation yet the government insists that smith has provided insufficient indication that the program would be revived by johns hopkins were we to grant relief.to be sure,johns hopkins is not a point emphasized by the no unequivocal statement from the university has been produced indicating an intent to resume the program if appellants prevail.we do,however,have a letter from the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at johns hopkins requesting reconsideration of the regulations so that the university may continue offering the program.and smith has evidently continued as director of the cuba program during the four years that it has remained inactive,which is indicative of the university desire to continue the program.
normally,causation and redressability are overlapping inquiries in standing cases there is generally no real analytic difference between the two concepts.here,however,they do not quite overlap although causation is obvious and conceded,if there were an indication that johns hopkins view had altered,redressability would be doubtful.but the provost letter,which establishes causation,and smith present title strongly suggest a continuing intention on the part of johns hopkins to resume the program once the regulatory obstacles are removed.in fact,we think it is not merely more probable than not that johns hopkins would do so,it is extremely likely that the university would resume the program.we can imagine no reason,given the record before us,why the university would choose not to do so.
to be sure,the government asserts in a bootstrap argument that once johns hopkins learns,as it has through this litigation,that the government now believes that the regulation prevented smith from participation in the program,it will likely acknowledge the government authority and refrain from employing smith in his prior capacity as program director.however,if we were to conclude that the amendments did in fact make the change asserted by appellants and were also unconstitutional,perforce we would conclude the amendments were no bar.or,if we were alternatively to agree with appellants argument that if the amendments were the bar,they were unconstitutional,it could not be expected that johns hopkins would be deterred by a rejected government legal position.
this case,then,is quite distinguishable from our recent decisions in national wrestling coaches association department of education,and renal physicians association hhs.in wrestling coaches,there was reason to believe that universities might well independently implement the title ix policy of equalizing male and female athletic resources by eliminating or restricting wrestling teams of their own accord,even if the court held that the government regulations at issue were illegal.similarly in renal physicians,the disputed government regulations,which set forth a voluntary safe harbor method for calculating fair market value for payments to physicians from clinical laboratories,would not control the laboratories conclusions as to what was fair market value even if declared ultra vires.and the laboratories might well voluntarily adopt the safe harbor method,which the government had concluded to be a reflection of fair value.
finally,in a last gasp,the government essentially argues that appellants lack prudential standing,because,insofar as academic freedom is a constitutional component of the first amendment,it is a right pertaining to universities and not to individual professors.to be sure,when considering prudential standing under the apa,we do peek at the merits,at least insofar as is necessary to determine whether the petitioner has an arguable claim that falls within the protected or regulated by the substantive statute.see muir navy fed.credit union.under a similar analysis,even assuming that academic freedom is a right held by universities alone,smith would still be within the of that constitutional protection for standing purposes.
in sum,we agree with the district court that smith has standing,and we need go no further to satisfy our jurisdiction 
appellants assert that the regulations violate their individual first amendment rights to academic freedom by restricting who may teach and what may be taught in american universities.appellants they the federal government may,under certain circumstances,regulate cuban study programs.nevertheless,they argue that the supreme court case that recognized this government authority,regan wald,d,required a showing of weighty which term appellants understand to mean compelling considerations of national security.
the government responds that even if there is a component of the first amendment that protects academic and apart from the amendment coverage of free is a right that inheres in universities,not individual professors.again,it is emphasized that no university has joined this action.be that as it may,the government claims that if any institution or person holds such a right,it is not transgressed by regulations that are and supported by an important governmental interest.
any substantive governmental restriction on smith academic lectures would obviously violate the first amendment.assuming that the right to academic freedom exists and that it can be asserted by an individual professor,its contours in this case are certainly similar to those of the right of free speech.namely,the right can be invoked only to prevent a governmental effort to regulate the content of a professor academic speech.see of pennsylvania eeoc,d.government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.ward rock against racism,d quoting clark community for creative,d.this inquiry into centers on the purpose of the government regulation,that is,whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.id.where a regulation is held to be,we apply the intermediate scrutiny test set forth by the supreme court in united states,d.w e think it clear that a government regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the government if it furthers an important or substantial government interest if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.id.at.in sum,regulations that have an incidental effect on first amendment rights will be upheld if they further an important or substantial government interest.walsh brady.
the office director has stated that the purpose of the cuban embargo,and therefore also of the office regulations is to deny currency to the government of cuba.our government has long deemed this policy instrumental to the ultimate goal of nudging cuba toward a peaceful transition from the oppressive policies of the castro regime to a free and democratic society.the amendments were specifically designed to curtail tourism,a critical and revenue source for the cuban government.the purpose of the amendments,thus,is.see capital,brady.none of this is remotely related to the suppression of free expression,nor is any restriction whatsoever placed on the subject matter or editorial slant a professor may choose to incorporate into his teaching on cuba.
appellants attempt to show that the amendments eliminate academic content that is exclusively available in situ in cuba,for example,field trips and cultural excursions.we think this notion of content stretches the term beyond all recognition.professors and students of the law may arguably benefit academically from visiting a penitentiary or witnessing an execution that regulations and prison codes may restrict free access to our penal institutions does not,in our view,render them regulations.contrary to appellants implication,there is not the slightest showing that the government sought to suppress the message that cuba warrant s study.indeed,even under the new regulations,professors remain free to teach in cuba so long as they and their institutional employers establish programs in accordance with the regulations.least nothing under american or ever has prevented professor smith from lecturing on his favored topics.see,wayne smith,a trap in angola,foreign policy,spring,wayne smith,lies about nicaragua,foreign policy,summer,wayne smith,the russians are coming new soviet policy in latin america.
appellants contend that we are bound by precedent to apply a particularly exacting form of strict scrutiny to the amendments.they would require a specific demonstration that the amendments are justified by national security concerns.we agree with the district court that strict scrutiny is inappropriate.as noted supra,the intermediate scrutiny test applies to regulations,and so long as the federal government interest in promulgating the regulations at,the denial of currency to the castro deemed important or substantial,the regulations must be upheld.
the supreme court has stated that the denial of hard currency to cuba is justified by weighty concerns of foreign policy.regan,at.in walsh,a case involving a first amendment challenge to the application of the cuba travel restrictions to the activities of an importer of political posters,we held that denial of hard currency to cuba meets the intermediate scrutiny standard.at.our sister circuits have uniformly reached similar conclusions.denial of hard currency to hostile regimes,including cuba,has been described as vital,teague regional comm r of customs,cir,and as compelling,veterans reservists for peace in vietnam regional comm r of customs,cir.further,on numerous occasions,restrictions on travel to cuba and other hostile nations have been upheld in the face of similar first amendment challenges.see,zemel rusk,d passport validation freedom to travel campaign newcomb,cir educational travel clancy ofac,dist.lexis,wl,at.march,travel to iraq as human shield.
even weaker is appellants claim that their right to travel under the fifth amendment has been infringed by the regulations.although kent dulles,d,did recognize the right to international travel as part of a liberty interest,subsequent cases have distinguished the right to travel within the united carries greater international travel.see,haig agee,d.in regan,the court disapproved of kent broad protection of international travel and upheld the very same regulations at issue here in a prior form.at.the court emphasized that the plaintiffs there,unlike in kent,were not denied passports to travel to cuba on the basis of personal characteristics.kent was a member of the communist party.instead,the regulations applied equally to all citizens and were rooted in foreign policy concerns.id.at.appellants insist that regan limited the government ability to enact travel restrictions to those situations in which it can point to weighty that is,on appellants view,compelling considerations of national security.to be sure,as we noted,the regan court did describe the government considerations as weighty,but there is not the slightest suggestion in the opinion that the court was arrogating to the federal judiciary the authority to make determinations as to the importance of competing foreign policy options.indeed,the court made clear that the federal judiciary was obliged to defer to the political branches on such questions.id.at.
we therefore agree with the district court dismissal of appellants fifth amendment challenge 
the district court grant of appellees motions to dismiss with prejudice is affirmed.
so ordered.
the disputed regulations in this case,tightening restrictions on educational travel to cuba,are content neutral and supported by an important governmental interest.therefore,i agree that the regulations do not infringe appellants first amendment rights.appellants have not invoked any right to academic freedom that trumps the government right to promulgate the regulations.we therefore assume that,in this case,the first amendment rights implicated by appellants claims are coterminous with any applicable rights to academic freedom.
the disposition of the first amendment issue in this case on grounds other than academic freedom is relatively straightforward and uncomplicated.therefore,it is unnecessary for us to parse the many difficult issues relating to the concept and scope of academic freedom,including,inter alia whether academic freedom is a constitutional right at all the breadth of academic freedom whether academic freedom implicates additional constitutional interests that are not fully accounted for by the supreme court customary jurisprudence whether a professor may assert an individual constitutional right of academic freedom against a university employer how academic freedom should be enforced in public versus private universities whether and how we distinguish between the and the in assessing the contours of academic freedom and the extent to which professors have rights of academic freedom in university governance.for an excellent discussion of the complex issues surrounding academic freedom,see judith areen,government as educator a new understanding of first amendment protection of academic freedom and governance,geo.forthcoming.
academic freedom is not an easy concept to grasp,and its breadth is far from clear.it has generally been understood to protect and foster the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among teachers and students and the serious pursuit of scholarship among members of the academy.however,as professor areen notes in her article,academic freedom as a first amendment concept may extend beyond writing and teaching and include concepts of shared governance.the supreme court decision in regents of the university of michigan ewing,d noting that university faculties must have the widest range of discretion in making judgments as to the academic performance of students and their entitlement to promotion or graduation gives some life to this idea.in upholding the faculty decision to dismiss a student without permitting a reexamination,the ewing court said 
added to our concern for lack of standards is a reluctance to trench on the prerogatives of state and local educational institutions and our responsibility to safeguard their academic freedom,a special concern of the first amendment.keyishian board of regents,d if a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies,bishop wood,d,far less is it suited to evaluate the substance of the multitude of academic decisions that are made daily by faculty members of public educational that require an expert evaluation of cumulative information and are not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.board of curators,of horowitz,d.
in other words,the four essential freedoms of a enunciated by justice frankfurter in sweezy and cited favorably by the court in a number of decisions loosely come to include notions of shared governance.in grutter bollinger,d,justice,like justice stevens in ewing,pointed to the role of the faculty in shared governance.see id.at.see also nlrb yeshiva,d discussing the value of giving faculty members the principal responsibility for academic matters.but see.state bd.for cmty.colls.knight,d holding that faculty members do not have a constitutional right to participate in academic governance at public colleges and universities of eeoc,d distinguishing between direct and indirect infringements of academic freedom.
in discussing the current state of the law on academic freedom,professor areen notes the evolution of the case law addressing shared governance 
the court in its later decisions has embraced justice frankfurter position in his sweezy concurrence and extended constitutional protection to a number of academic governance matters including admissions policy bakke and grutter,student academic standards ewing,and the tenure process university of pennsylvania eeoc.
the constitutional standard,unlike the professional standard,applies only to public colleges and universities.faculty at public institutions may not have a constitutional right to participate in academic governance but their speech on academic matters such as student academic standards has been granted constitutional protection by the supreme court.lower federal courts have extended constitutional protection to an even broader range of academic governance speech including criticism of a department unsound teaching and administrative practices,discussion of admissions policy and size of the student body,and criticism of the administration at a meeting of the faculty senate.citations omitted.
the protection granted to faculty governance speech has been limited,however,by the increasing application by courts of the speech doctrine to faculty claims.both the pickering balancing test and the connick public concern test in particular have been used to deny constitutional protection to faculty governance speech.connick myers,d pickering bd.of,d.
the supreme court latest words on academic freedom appear in garcetti ceballos,d.in that case,a deputy district attorney filed a complaint against officials in a district attorney office,alleging that he was subject to adverse employment actions in retaliation for engaging in protected speech,that is,for writing a memorandum in which he recommended dismissal of a case on the basis of purported governmental misconduct.the court held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,they are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.the court concluded that the deputy district attorney did not speak as a citizen when he wrote his memorandum and,thus,his speech was not protected by the first amendment.garcetti,at.
in a dissent joined by justice stevens and justice ginsburg,justice souter raised the specter of academic freedom in expressing concern about the potential reach of the majority opinion in garcetti 
consider the breadth of the majority formulation of the speech doctrine 
restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.it simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created,at.
this ostensible domain beyond the pale of the first amendment is spacious enough to include even the teaching of a public university professor,and i have to hope that today majority does not mean to imperil first amendment protection of academic freedom in public colleges and universities,whose teachers necessarily speak and write pursuant to official duties.see grutter bollinger,d we have long recognized that,given the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment,universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition keyishian board of regents of of state of,d our nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom,which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned.that freedom is therefore a special concern of the first amendment,which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of american schools quoting shelton tucker,d sweezy new hampshire,d a governmental enquiry into the contents of a scholar lectures at a state university unquestionably was an invasion of his liberties in the areas of academic freedom and political in which government should be extremely reticent to tread.
garcetti,at.souter,dissenting.
the majority opinion in garcetti responds directly to the possible important ramifications for academic freedom,id.at,raised by the dissenting justices 
justice souter suggests today decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom,at least as a constitutional value.there is some argument that expression related to academic scholarship or classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional interests that are not fully accounted for by this court customary jurisprudence.we need not,and for that reason do not,decide whether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.
the court in garcetti neither refutes the existence of academic freedom as a part of the first amendment,nor rejects the suggestion that academic freedom may extend beyond the court customary jurisprudence.rather,the court simply leaves undecided the many questions relating to the concept and breadth of academic freedom.prudence commands that we do the same,for the dispute in this case does not raise any serious questions about the contours of academic freedom.
the very notion of academic a concept distinct from the actual textual provisions of the first elusive.to be sure,supreme court cases have on occasion referred to academic freedom.see sweezy new hampshire,d keyishian bd.of regents,d of pennsylvania eeoc,d.in sweezy,a plurality of the court said that a state investigation directed against a professor who refused to answer questions concerning his allegedly subversive lectures and political associations had violated due process,because the attorney general of new hampshire had lacked the necessary statutory authority to pursue his investigation of sweezy.at.the court also stated that there unquestionably had been an invasion of sweezy liberties in the areas of academic freedom and political expression.id.at.yet it is unclear what of substance,if anything,the phrase academic freedom added to sweezy protections under the first amendment and it is doubtful that a professor could assert an individual constitutional right of academic freedom against his university employer,whether state or private.for that matter,it is also doubtful that a state legislature lacks authority to oversee the content of a state university offerings.
indeed,in sweezy,the court noted that the supreme court of new hampshire had carefully excluded the possibility that the investigation had been based on the state interest in the state university,id.at,thereby implying that a state interest in the content of sweezy lectures might stand on different footing.this same concern was raised by the supreme court in university of pennsylvania,in which the court distinguished between government attempts to direct the content of teaching at a private university,where the state acts only as a regulator,and similar efforts directed at state schools,where the state acts as a speaker through its faculty employees.at.
in keyishian,another cold war era case,the court held that the first amendment rights of employees of the state university of new york were violated when it was demanded that the employees certify,pursuant to a state statute,that they were not communists.the court stated that our nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom,which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned.that freedom is,therefore,a special concern of the first amendment,which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.at.but the court based its holding on the fact that the statute used the terms treasonable and seditious in a manner that the court found to be unconstitutionally vague.id.at.while keyishian comes closer than sweezy to articulating a separate right of academic freedom,the case nevertheless was decided on grounds that might very well appear in any standard first amendment challenge,even absent the academic context.the court holding,which did not focus on the actual content of the appellant professors lectures but rather on their speech and associations as private individuals,could as well be applied to any state just professors.see urofsky,at.
as the court implied in university of pennsylvania,a state university may well have a even an regulate the substance of professors classroom lectures.at.for example,were a professor of history to adopt in his lectures bizarre theories of holocaust denial or a professor of sociology to claim the inferiority of certain races or ethnic groups,surely a university would not be powerless to prevent such pedagogical perversions.after all,the state can be said to speak through its employees this certainly suggests that the government may well be correct in asserting that academic indeed it is a first amendment concept warranting separate in the university,not in individual professors.it is,furthermore,difficult to see why,if the university has a right to control at least the outer limits of its professors lectures,a state legislature may not assert the same degree of control.i therefore share the doubts of our fourth circuit colleagues as to the notion that academic freedom is a constitutional right at all and that,should it exist,it inheres in individual professors.urofsky,at.i note that the dissent in urofsky never mentions academic freedom.and i further join urofsky in noting that the supreme court has never once invalidated a state regulation on the grounds that it violated a right to academic freedom.id.at.
some have thought that academic freedom would add to the first amendment protection for academic governance.see,garcetti ceballos,d souter,dissenting see also judge edwards concurrence.but recently,the supreme court rather dismissively referred to that notion,stating that there is some argument to support it.id.at.and in university of pennsylvania,the court treated that concept as a ground for deference akin to chevron rather than as a constitutional right.at.with great respect for my colleague,judge edwards and professor judith areen,i do not perceive any principled reason why the first amendment should be thought to protect internal governance of certain academic institutions are think tanks included but not other eleemosynary bodies or,for that matter,trade unions or corporations.

the district court further observed that the claims of appellants jessica kamen and adnan ahmad would be moot if,as anticipated,these two students in f
