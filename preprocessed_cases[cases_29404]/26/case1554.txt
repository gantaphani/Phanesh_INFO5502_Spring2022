apple valley unified school district the district sued vavrinek,trine,day,llp vtd and heidi ross collectively,defendants for accounting malpractice,claiming defendants misrepresentations in an audit report induced the district to provide state funds to a charter school which was not entitled to the funds.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer without leave to amend,based on the statute of limitations.
we conclude the statute began to run when the district learned of the improper payments and incurred expenses in an effort to assess and limit its exposure,notwithstanding the fact it had not been determined at that still has not been the district is legally responsible for reimbursing the state for the funds.since the district did not file suit until more than two years later,the trial court properly sustained the demurrer.
factual and procedural backgrounda.parties 
the district is a california public school district.vtd is a california accountancy partnership,and ross is a member of vtd.
charter schools 
the charter schools act of the act permits public school districts to grant charters for the operation of charter schools,et charter schools are part of the public school system,but operate independently from the existing school district structure,subd.a.they are intended,among other things,to e ncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods and to provide expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available within the public school system,subd.c,e.
charter schools are entitled to receive state and local funding based on average daily attendance ada figures,subd.b.however,the act provides that charter schools must be nonsectarian in their programs and may not charge tuition,subd.d.
allegations of the complaint 
cato i and ii 
in about november,snowline joint unified school district snowline,a california public school district,chartered cato school of reason i cato i.education foundation for ethics and principles efep,a nonprofit public benefit corporation,was the parent of cato 
sometime before june,snowline hired vtd to conduct a special analysis concerning cato vtd report of its special analysis,dated june,concluded that attendance procedures had not been complied with,controls over the system appeared to be weak,and documentation standards were poor.
in january,the district granted a charter to efep for the creation of cato school of reason ii cato ii.in about february,cato i ceased to operate as a charter school and was transformed into cato ii,with the same management and personnel.in april,vtd entered into an agreement with cato ii to audit cato ii financial position as of june.
from to january,cato ii entered into agreements with private schools to convert the schools into satellites of cato ii.both before and after the conversion,the satellites charged tuition,and some of them taught religion,in violation of state and federal law.
alleged wrongdoing by cato ii 
in november,the district learned that congresswoman maxine waters,who represented the district in which cato ii was located,had stated that cato ii had enrolled students from a private school.the district board of education directed its administration to investigate the matter 
in december,congresswoman waters daughter filed a complaint with the state department of education doe alleging suspected misconduct by cato ii efep,in that public funds were being used for a private school.the doe transmitted the complaint to the district in february.
on january,vtd issued its auditors report regarding cato i and ii.the report concluded that the financial statements pertaining to cato i and ii fairly represented their financial position as of june.vtd report also set forth information regarding days of attendance.the report stated the information was fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.the report did not disclose any attendance at schools that illegally taught religion.the district received the report in march.
the district hired james quinn,an accountant,who commenced an audit of cato ii student attendance in march.in april,a former employee of cato provided the district with documentation regarding wrongdoing by cato,including the recruitment of satellite schools which taught religion or charged tuition.
the district received advice from counsel regarding its investigation of cato ii in april and may.the district counsel met with quinn in june.quinn issued a preliminary report regarding his audit of attendance accounting in august.in september,the district accountant and legal counsel met with legal counsel and management and arranged for an audit of records.
in august,the district learned of vtd june,special analysis,which had found cato i documentation and attendance standards to be inadequate.in november,the district revoked the cato ii charter,effective february.
controller audit and the district appeal 
in march,the district reported the facts set forth above to the doe.as a result,the state controller the controller conducted an audit of ada for the cato school or schools for the period january through december.the controller report of the audit stated that the district had received about million more in funding during the audit period than it was entitled to receive,due to improper ada claims for charter school sites converted from private schools,which the act did not permit.the report also stated that cato ii had taught religion at six charter school sites,in violation of the act.the district appealed the controller audit,and the appeal is pending.
defendants alleged negligence 
according to the complaint,the district relied on the false representations of defendants in their january,auditors report that the cato i and ii financial statements fairly represented their financial position and that information regarding days of attendance was fairly stated.as a result,the district was induced to cause the state to issue apportionment funds to cato ii through the district.defendants had no reasonable grounds for believing their representations to be true.
additional facts 
in addition to the facts alleged in its complaint,the district in opposing defendants demurrer submitted documents relating to its appeal of the controller audit,of which the district requested judicial notice.those documents included the january,audit report by the controller the august,proposed decision by the office of administrative hearings administrative law judge alj,issued to the california education audits appeal panel eeap pursuant to section and the february,order of the eeap rejecting the proposed decision and remanding the matter for further evidence.
the record does not reflect whether the court took judicial notice of the documents.but whether it did or not,we may properly consider them as an indication of the facts the district would have alleged had it been granted leave to amend the complaint.see dudley department of transp.th,d rakestraw california physicians service th,d plaintiff may show for first time on appeal how complaint can be amended to state a cause of action.as relevant here,the documents showed the following.
in its appeal,the district contested the controller finding that the district was liable for the overpayment of state apportionment funds to cato ii.the district asserted that liability was inappropriate because it exercised due diligence in its relationship with cato ii.
the alj made the following relevant findings 
the district received daily attendance figures from cato ii on a monthly basis.the district calculated the apportionment due and forwarded the required forms to the doe.upon receipt of the apportionment funds,the district forwarded them,less its processing fees,to cato ii.
after it became concerned that cato ii might have improperly received state funds,the district commenced its investigation and began withholding state apportionment funds earmarked for cato ii in july.the district withheld a total of.
on november,the district and cato ii entered into a settlement agreement.the parties agreed that cause might exist for the revocation of cato ii charter in that cato ii might have received state funds based on ada which did not qualify for such funds.the agreement provided for the parties cooperation in the expeditious reimbursement of any state funds received as a result of ineligible ada.
based on his factual findings,the alj concluded the district was not liable for the overpayments.there was no provision in the applicable statutes for holding a school district liable for acts of its charter school.general principles of tort law did not support liability because there was no evidence the district knew or should have known that cato ii violated the law.contract law did not support holding the district liable because neither the cato ii charter nor the agreement supplementing the charter provided for such liability.
in its february order,the eeap declined to adopt the alj proposed decision.the eeap remanded the matter for additional evidence on,among other issues,the authority by which the district withheld funds from cato ii,its disposition of the funds,and how the district discharged its oversight responsibilities and statutory obligations.
procedural background 
the district brought this action in december,seeking damages for negligent misrepresentation.defendants demurred based on the statute of limitations contained in code of civil procedure section,subdivision.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the district filed this appeal.
discussiona.standards of review 
on appeal from the sustaining of a demurrer,this court assumes the truth of all material facts properly pled.the judgment must be reversed if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.in deciding that question,the court exercises its independent judgment.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.
sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is error if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d.denial of leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.montclair parkowners city of montclair,supra,th at,d.
as the parties recognize,the statute of limitations for malpractice by an accountant is two years.code civ,subd.international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d,feddersen.the statute begins to run when the aggrieved party discovers the negligent conduct causing the loss or damage and the aggrieved party has suffered actual injury as a result of the negligent conduct.feddersen,supra,at,d.here,the trial court ruled that the allegations of the complaint showed the district was aware of the illegal charter schools by april and suffered actual injury when it hired an accountant and attorney at or about that time.
the district contends it did not,and could not,discover defendants negligent misrepresentations until,making its december complaint timely.specifically,the district contends it was not on notice of the misrepresentations until january,when the controller issued its audit report,or at the earliest march,when the district referred the matter to the doe.
we reject the district contention.under the discovery rule,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing,that someone has done something wrong to her a plaintiff need not be aware of the specific facts necessary to establish the claim that is a process contemplated by pretrial discovery so long as a suspicion exists,it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.jolly eli lilly cal d,fn.omitted.these principles apply in accounting malpractice actions.curtis kellogg andelson th,d.
it is clear from the face of the complaint in this case that the district had at least a suspicion of wrongdoing jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d,by defendants more than two years before it filed suit.the district alleged it became aware of defendants audit report,which contained the alleged misrepresentations regarding cato ii ada reporting,in march.the district further alleged that by or before november,more than two years before suit was filed,the following had occurred the district had learned that congresswoman waters had accused cato ii of improperly enrolling students from a private school,and the district had directed its administration to investigate the matter the district had received the complaint filed by congresswoman waters daughter with the doe the district had hired quinn to audit cato ii student attendance a former employee of cato had informed the district that cato ii had recruited ineligible satellite schools the district had learned of vtd june,special analysis,which had found deficiencies in cato i attendance accounting procedures and the district had revoked cato ii charter.these circumstances show beyond dispute that by november the district knew or should have known the alleged misrepresentations in defendants audit report,to the effect that cato ii ada records were accurate,might be incorrect.
the district has not shown it could amend to cure this defect.in fact,the material of which the district requested judicial notice merely reinforces the conclusion that the district was on notice of defendants alleged negligence not later than november.as stated,the alj found the district began withholding state apportionment funds earmarked for cato ii in july because it was concerned cato ii had improperly received such funds.the alj also found the district had entered into an agreement with cato ii in november which provided for the reimbursement of any state funds received as a result of ineligible ada.
the circumstances therefore establish that the district had at least a suspicion of defendants wrongdoing more than two years before it filed suit in december.that suspicion was sufficient to satisfy the discovery element for commencement of the statute of limitations.
actual injury 
the remaining requirement for commencement of the statute of limitations is that the plaintiff have suffered actual injury as a result of the negligent conduct.feddersen,supra,cal th,d.the district contends it did not suffer actual injury until january,when the controller issued its audit report claiming the district was responsible for the alleged overpayments to cato ii.until that time,the district argues,its possible liability for the overpayments was merely speculative and could not constitute actual injury.
the courts,including the california supreme court,have found the question of when professional negligence causes actual injury to be worthy of considerable discussion.see,adams paul cal th,d,conc.opn.of kennard,t his is the third time in the past two years that the court has addressed this question jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,conc.opn.of kennard,t his is the fourth decision in as many years in which this court has addressed the question of what constitutes actual injury from professional malpractice for purposes of applying a statute of limitations.most of the decisions considering the question do so in the context of legal malpractice.feddersen,supra,cal th,d,however,considered the question in the context of accounting malpractice.since this case involves a claim of accounting malpractice,and since feddersen emanates from our supreme court,we consider its possible applicability first.
in feddersen,the court considered what it called a narrow issue when actual injury,caused by an accountant negligent filing of tax returns,occurs so as to commence the running of the statute of limitations period of code of civil procedure section,subdivision feddersen,supra,cal th,d.the court concluded that actual harm occurs on the date the tax deficiency is assessed by the internal revenue service irs.id.at,d.it explained,prior to the penalty assessment,the preliminary findings of the auditor as noted in the audit report are merely proposed findings,subject to review and negotiation.id.at,d,see also,d.
the feddersen court rejected the proposition that actual injury occurred before the audit process was complete,when the client withdrew a settlement offer in an unrelated matter and the client bank reduced its line of credit,both in anticipation that the client would have to pay more tax as a result of the audit.the court stated that an inchoate or potential injury can not give rise to a professional malpractice action until there has been an actual determination that the accountant alleged negligence is related to the deficiency assessment.feddersen,supra,cal th,d.prior to that time,the question whether the taxpayer suffered actual injury as a result of the accountant allegedly negligent preparation of the tax returns is contingent on the outcome of the audit.id.at,d.
feddersen at least arguably supports the district contention that it suffered no actual injury until the controller determined to hold the district liable for the overpayments to cato ii.if a taxpayer suffers no actual injury until the irs finally assesses a deficiency,then seemingly persons injured by accountant malpractice in other contexts should not be held to have suffered actual injury until some claim of legal liability is made against them as a result of the malpractice.however,we are not persuaded feddersen should be applied in that manner in this case,for the following reasons.
first,we note that feddersen did not say there could never be actual injury in fact until the irs assessed a deficiency.to the contrary,the court expressly acknowledged that o bviously,in some cases injury will be clear before the notice of deficiency is given to the taxpayer.feddersen,supra,cal th,d,italics added.notwithstanding that acknowledgment,the court concluded that uniformity in application serves a more important function when interpreting statutes of limitation than does the identification of the precise point at which some harm might be said to have occurred id.at,d.therefore,it held the triggering event should be the deficiency assessment,because use of that date provides the parties with a bright line that,once crossed,commences the limitations period under section,subdivision,and therefore provides certainty in terms of the statute application.id.at,d.
thus,it appears the feddersen court based its holding not on a conclusion that no actual injury occurs until there is a final irs assessment,but on its determination that in the context of negligent tax return preparation,the need for uniformity overrides the usual considerations that dictate when the statute of limitations should be deemed to commence.not surprisingly,therefore,subsequent decisions have given feddersen bright line holding only narrow application.in fact,the same year feddersen was decided,the supreme court stated that feddersen involved very narrowly drawn circumstances and did not articulate a rule for all seasons.adams paul,supra,cal th,d,lead opn.of arabian,more recently,in jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison,supra,cal th,d,jordache,the court again stated that feddersen presented specialized circumstances and did not articulate a rule of broad or general applicability.id.at,d.
the fifth district considered whether to apply feddersen rule to an accounting malpractice claim in van dyke dunker aced th,d van dyke.the plaintiffs in van dyke claimed they donated property in reliance on their accountant erroneous advice that they would receive a full tax deduction.later,the accountant told the plaintiffs they could claim only a partial deduction and filed a return claiming only the lesser amount.the ultimate amount allowed was not determined until still later,as a result of negotiations between the plaintiffs new tax preparer and the irs.
relying on feddersen,the plaintiffs contended they did not suffer actual injury until the irs finally determined the amount of the deduction.id.at,d.the court,however,held that the feddersen rule was expressly limited to a specific type of accountant malpractice,the negligent preparation of tax returns.citation.van dyke,supra,th,d.the alleged malpractice in van dyke was not negligent tax return preparation but the erroneous tax advice upon which the plaintiffs had relied to their detriment.ibid.the court therefore concluded that the plaintiffs suffered actual injury,and the statute of limitations began to run,either when the plaintiffs donated the property in reliance on the erroneous tax advice or when they filed their return and paid taxes in excess of the amount they expected to pay.id.at,d.
van dyke and this case are similar in several respects.as in van dyke,the alleged malpractice in this case was not negligent preparation of a tax return,but a representation which induced detrimental reliance.in van dyke,the reliance occurred when the plaintiffs donated the property.the court held the plaintiffs sustained actual injury either at that point or when they filed their return after discovering the error and suffered losses by paying more taxes than they had expected to pay.van dyke,supra,th at,d.
here,the alleged detrimental reliance occurred when the district,based on defendants audit report,provided state apportionment funds to cato ii.by analogy to van dyke,the district sustained actual injury either at that point or after it suspected the error and suffered losses by paying investigation and legal fees in an effort to determine the extent of the improper payments.in either case,the statute of limitations lapsed.
van dyke does not,of course,bind this court,and its persuasiveness depends on whether it is consistent with the california supreme court decisions which do bind us.we have already noted the supreme court statements in adams paul,supra,cal th,d,and in jordache,supra,cal th,d,to the effect that feddersen did not articulate a rule of broad or general applicability.those statements support van dyke determination that the feddersen rule should not apply outside of the factual context in which it was formulated,negligent preparation of a tax return.
we also believe van dyke conclusion that actual injury can occur before there has been a determination of the aggrieved party liability is consistent with the supreme court analysis in jordache.we turn now to a discussion of that decision.
in jordache,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered the question of actual injury in a legal malpractice case based on a law firm failure to advise its client that it might have insurance coverage for a lawsuit against the client as a result of the firm omission,the client delayed in tendering the defense of the suit to its insurer.the client ultimately settled its coverage claim against its insurer for less than the full amount of the claim.the court of appeal held there was no actual injury until the settlement occurred.
the supreme court,however,concluded that actual injury occurred before the client settlement with the insurer.jordache,supra,cal th,d.the court explained that the determination of actual injury does not necessarily require some form of adjudication,judgment,or settlement.id.at,d.the delay in claiming coverage gave the insurer a potential defense,which increased the client cost to litigate the coverage claim and reduced the settlement value of the claim.the delay also required the client to pay its own defense costs for several years.the fact the client might have recouped its losses had it won the coverage action did not prevent the statute of limitations from starting to run an existing injury is not contingent or speculative simply because future events may affect its permanency or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.citations.id.at,d.
accordingly,the jordache court articulated this test the test for actual injury under code of civil procedure section,therefore,is whether the plaintiff has sustained any damages compensable in an action,other than one for actual fraud,against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission arising in the performance of professional services.although determining when actual injury occurred is predominantly a factual inquiry,when the material facts are undisputed,the trial court can resolve the matter as a question of law.jordache,supra,cal th,d.
jordache strongly supports the ruling of the trial court in this case that the district suffered actual injury as a result of defendants alleged negligence more than two years before december.by that time,according to its complaint,the district had provided state funds to cato ii to which cato ii was not entitled,in reliance on defendants misrepresentations.in an effort to determine the extent of the improper payments,the district was obliged,in march or before,to pay investigation and legal fees.the district also obligated itself,in its november agreement with cato ii,to cooperate in the expeditious reimbursement of any state funds improperly received.
the district situation was analogous to that of the client in jordache,which delayed in tendering coverage to its insurer due to the negligence of its attorneys.the jordache court concluded the delay in tendering coverage injured the client,by increasing its cost to litigate the coverage claim,reducing the settlement value of the claim,and requiring the client to pay its own defense costs for several years.the court noted the established rule that attorney fees incurred as a direct result of another tort are recoverable damages.citations.therefore,under the jordache test for actual the plaintiff has sustained damages compensable in a malpractice attorney fees constituted actual injury which triggered the statute.jordache,supra,cal th,d.
investigation costs,like the attorney fees in jordache,are recoverable tort damages under civil code section.stearman centex homes th,d plaintiffs in construction defect case could recover as damages under section fees paid to professionals who investigated the problems in order to formulate an appropriate repair plan.as in jordache,therefore,the expenses the district incurred when it engaged its accountant and legal counsel,in an effort to determine the extent of the improper payments and arrange for reimbursement of funds improperly received,constituted actual injury for limitations purposes.
at oral argument,the district contended for the first time that,since section,which governs repayment by a school district of apportionment funds improperly received,did not go into effect until july,the district had no liability for repayment and could not have suffered actual injury until at least that date.however,even before section came into effect,the education code provided for recoupment by the state of funds improperly received by a school district.section,enacted in,provides that,if the amount apportioned to a school district exceeds the amount to which the district was entitled,the superintendent of public instruction shall withhold the excess amount from the district apportionment for the next fiscal year,subd.a.in this case,the improper apportionments represented not only money disbursed to cato ii,but also money which the district kept for itself.according to the record,when the district paid state apportionment funds to cato ii,it retained a part of those payments as a processing fee pursuant to its agreement with efep 
the district contends section could not be applied to require withholding in this case because section generally exempts charter schools from the laws governing school districts.we do not think it follows from the fact that a charter school is exempt from laws governing school districts that a school district itself is exempt from any liability for reimbursement when it improperly receives and issues state funds to its charter school.but even if the district is correct,the district still sustained economic loss when it paid expenses to determine the extent of the improper payments.under jordache,those expenses constituted actual injury for limitations purposes.
the fact that the district might have avoided liability to the state for the improper payments if the controller had not pursued the matter,or if the district successfully appealed the controller decision,did not negate the injury.in jordache,the client similarly might have avoided the consequences of its delay in tendering coverage to its insurer if the insurer had not invoked the defense of delay,or if the client had won the coverage action despite the defense.yet the court held that possibility did not prevent a finding of actual injury for limitations purposes.jordache,supra,cal th,d.
several court of appeal decisions in the legal malpractice context,though they predate jordache,anticipated its holding that actual injury can occur without a determination of liability,and therefore are instructive here.in the first case,hensley caietti th,d hensley,the plaintiff claimed she had signed an unfavorable marital settlement agreement on the advice of her attorney.the court held the plaintiff sustained actual injury when she signed the agreement,not later when the ensuing judgment became effective.id.at,d.it reached that conclusion notwithstanding its recognition that the plaintiff might later be able to avoid the effect of the agreement by attacking its validity the consideration that the injury attributable to entry into the contract may be remediable by the attack on the contract does not render the injury harmless.citation.id.at,d.
in foxborough van atta th,d foxborough,the plaintiff claimed its attorney negligently failed to advise the plaintiff it had to exercise a development right within three years,and the time expired.the plaintiff filed litigation against a third party in an effort to revive the development right,but lost.the court of appeal,per justice chin,held actual injury occurred when the development right expired and not when the litigation was resolved.the court reached that conclusion despite the fact the plaintiff could have avoided the effects of the malpractice had it won the litigation.id.at,d.
in radovich th,d radovich,a husband claimed his attorneys negligently caused him to sign documents waiving his community property rights in various assets.the court held the husband sustained damage when he signed the documents,not years later when his wife died and the community property was divided.id.at,d.it further held that the fact the husband remedied some of his losses by filing litigation against third parties did not mean actual injury did not occur when he signed the documents o nce actual injury has been found,the fact the injury is not irremediable is of no consequence to the section issues id.at,d.
the supreme court has given no indication that it disagrees with the analyses in hensley,foxborough,or radovich.in fact,the court has cited all three decisions in its own opinions.see adams paul,supra,cal th,d,citing hensley jordache,supra,cal th,d,citing foxborough samuels mix cal th,d,citing radovich.the decisions are significant because they demonstrate that a party alteration of its legal position in reliance on its counsel can constitute actual injury even though the party may be able to avoid or reduce the injury through subsequent legal action.
here,the district alleged it relied on defendants alleged misrepresentations when it provided apportionment funds to cato ii defendants induced plaintiff to process the attendance apportionment regarding student attendance at cato satellites which taught religion,and caused the state to issue state apportionment funds to cato through plaintiff.the record shows the district took these actions at least as early as.under the authorities discussed ante,actual injury occurred no later than early,when the district recognized the allegedly improper conduct and incurred expenses to determine its extent.that the district may ultimately avoid liability for the improper payments through its pending appeal does not mean it did not suffer injury.
for these reasons,we conclude that under jordache and the court of appeal decisions anticipating its holding,actual injury occurred in this case more than two years before the district filed suit.we therefore must decide whether the analysis employed in those cases,all of which involved legal malpractice,should apply in a case of accounting malpractice such as this one.
application of the jordache analysis to this case 
because jordache was a legal malpractice case,it involved a different statute of of civil procedure section the one involved here.the court did not purport to extend its holding to other types of professional negligence.in fact,the court
