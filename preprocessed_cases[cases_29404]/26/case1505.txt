a public school physical education teacher saw a student acting as a lookout for two classmates attempting to fight.as the teacher approached,the student warned the classmates.the teacher directed the student not to act as a lookout and to move to another area.stepping toward the teacher with clenched hands at his side,the student replied,yell at me again and see what happens.
a juvenile court found true the allegation that the student violated penal code section,which prohibits a person from attempting to cause a public employee to refrain from doing any act in the performance of his duties by means of a threat to inflict unlawful injury.on appeal,the student argues that his words did not constitute such a threat.
we are called upon in this case to interpret the standard of review pursuant to the recent california supreme court decision of in re george cal th,d,george.here,because the minor raises a plausible first amendment defense,we make an independent examination of the record in accord with george,to ensure that the speaker free speech rights have not been infringed by the trier of fact determination that the communication at issue constitutes a criminal threat.id.at,d.having done so,we conclude that the minor made a criminal threat and that his free speech rights were not infringed.
in the remainder of the opinion,we also conclude that there is sufficient evidence to find that the minor made the threat with the specific intent to interfere with the teacher duties,and that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for continuance.thus,we affirm the juvenile court jurisdictional order.
background 
on october,the victim,james lockwood,was teaching a physical education class at soledad high school.at one point during his class,two students attempted to engage in a fight.when he interceded,the students told him they were just playing.nevertheless,lockwood separated them.later in the period,the same two students went to a secluded area out of lockwood sight.the minor,ernesto,had gone with them and was standing near the corner of the building between lockwood and the two students apparently to act as a lookout.the minor was looking at lockwood and looking back inside the secluded area.lockwood believed the students were again attempting to fight.he began walking quickly toward their location,yelling at them to stop fighting.he heard the minor saying maestro,maestro,which means teacher,when he was about feet away from the minor.
when lockwood was about two to three feet away from the minor,in addition to yelling at the students to stop fighting,he informed the minor that being a lookout was not okay.the minor said,do yell at me.lockwood did not recall exactly what else was said,because he was simultaneously dealing with the two students whom he believed to be fighting.lockwood did remember telling the minor in a loud voice to move to another area.the minor apparently moved approximately feet away.the minor then said,yell at me again and see what happens.when the minor spoke,his head was tilted back,and he took a step toward lockwood,and lockwood had a slight recollection that the minor hands were clenched at his sides lockwood asked the minor if he was threatening him.the minor did not deny the threat,as lockwood had hoped he would.although he did not believe the minor was going to hurt him at that moment,he thought the minor might retaliate in the future.lockwood felt threatened.he felt that,at that point,the minor was very upset and was serious about what he was saying.lockwood took the threat seriously and feared for his safety.the minor was sent to the school office,and the police became involved that day.lockwood told the police officer that he feared for his safety.
on october,a wardship petition was filed against the minor,based on allegations that he threatened a public school official in violation of penal code section count and threatened to commit a crime that would result in death or great bodily injury in violation of penal code section count.following a jurisdictional hearing on december,the juvenile court found the allegations in count true and the allegations in count not true.the court explained its reasoning for sustaining the allegations that the minor violated penal code section,as follows all right.the section is aimed at conduct,directed at teachers or employees of schools designed to coerce them into doing things or out of doing things.and in this situation the teacher was trying to prevent a fight,was taking action that he felt was necessary to maintain safety and order on the school grounds whereupon this minor took offense and said,yell at me again and see what happens.do yell at me.yell at me again and see what happens.he was clearly attempting to dissuade the the teacher from taking action.and he threatened him.he said,if you do that again,i going to do something to you.that is the way i interpret that statement under the circumstances,given his stance,his throwing his head back.a dispositional hearing was set for january.
on january,the minor filed a motion to continue the jurisdictional hearing under welfare and institutions code section.the motion was based on the declarations of the minor attorney and james lockwood.the minor attorney declared that,after the jurisdictional hearing,james lockwood approached her and said he did not believe the minor was trying to prevent him from doing his job when the minor stated yell at me again and see what happens.as a result of this statement,she wanted to set the matter for reconsideration of the court finding at the jurisdictional hearing,or set the matter for a motion for a new trial.she finally stated that she had been on vacation until january,and had not had the opportunity to prepare such a motion.
james lockwood declared that,after the hearing on december,he had remained at the juvenile courthouse to speak with the minor attorney.he told the minor attorney that he did not think the minor was trying to prevent him from doing his job when the minor stated,yell at me again and see what happens.lockwood believed the minor was being reactionary because he felt embarrassed and challenged in front of the rest of the class when lockwood yelled at him.lockwood further stated he felt that the minor was interfering with his job as a teacher earlier in the incident by acting as a lookout and calling maestro,maestro when lockwood approached the fighting students.lockwood declaration was executed december.
the juvenile court denied the request for a continuance at the dispositional hearing on january.the court read lockwood declaration but was still convinced that the threatening statement was made with the improper intent to influence lockwood conduct.the court explained i not inclined to continue the matter.in reading lockwood declaration,i find it somewhat troubling.the words spoken are clearly threatening.they are informing you that,if you do something the student does like,he going to do something unpleasant to you or about you.and so i found the comments to be improperly threatening,and i still think they improperly threatening.and i intend to proceed with the dispositional hearing.
the trial court thereafter declared the minor a ward of the court,found the offense to be a misdemeanor,and placed the minor on probation for two years,subject to conditions of probation as recommended in the probation report including time in juvenile hall and standard gang conditions.
the minor filed a notice of appeal on january.
discussion 
ipenal code section of review 
the minor initially contended in his opening brief that,under a sufficiency of the evidence test,the evidence was insufficient to support the juvenile court findings.however,shortly before oral argument,the supreme court decided the case of george,and concluded that a reviewing court should use the standard of independent review wherever a defendant raises a plausible first amendment defense.in oral argument and in supplemental briefing,the minor now contends that the proper standard to review whether his conduct constituted a true threat in this case is the standard of independent review.he urges reversal of the juvenile court finding that he threatened his teacher in violation of penal code section.the attorney general agrees that the independent review standard is appropriate,but insists even under that standard,the minor conduct was a true threat and not protected speech.
violent times heighten our nation awareness of the entitlement of people not only to be safe but to feel safe.in the eagerness to achieve that safety,however,our society must be vigilant to avoid trampling the essential freedoms which make this country unique.george instructs us that our courts must accept their allotted role to insert themselves into the interplay between freedom and safety so as to nurture the one without diminishing the other.
we do this in part through independent review that does not simply the trier of fact,but a review that determines whether a given course of conduct falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,d,citing bose consumers union of,d bose.george,supra,cal th at,d.
in george,our supreme court considered whether a high school student made a criminal threat by giving two classmates a poem labeled dark poetry,which recites in part,i am dark,destructive,dangerous.i slap on my face of happiness but inside i am evil for i can be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school.so parents,watch your children cuz i back george,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the ambiguous nature of the poem,along with the circumstances surrounding its dissemination,failed to establish that the poem constituted a criminal threat.in reaching its conclusion,the supreme court determined that,as in other cases where a defendant raises a plausible first amendment defense,a reviewing court should make an independent examination of the record to ensure that a speaker free speech rights have not been infringed by a trier of fact determination that the communication at issue constitutes a criminal threat.id.at,d.the juvenile petition had alleged that in dark poetry,george had made criminal threats in violation of penal code section.the juvenile court had found the allegations true as to the two students.over a dissent,the court of appeal sixth district affirmed the juvenile court in all respects on the basis of the substantial evidence standard with the exception of remanding the matter for the sole purpose of having that court declare the offenses to be either felonies or misdemeanors.george,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court granted review and then reversed.
nearly half of the discussion of the opinion in george is devoted to the correct standard of review.the supreme court carefully explained its conclusion that the communication at issue there,dark poetry,found by the juvenile court to constitute a criminal threat under penal code section,must be subjected to an independent review by the reviewing court.the minor there and amici curiae had asserted that because first amendment interests are implicated by the determination that the minor poem constituted a threat,the supreme court should employ the independent review standard,which entails an examination of the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see whether they are of a character which the principles of the first amendment protect.communications,connaughton,d,quoting new york times sullivan,d see also bose,supra,d george,supra,cal th at,d.the attorney general disagreed,contending that the court should not depart from the substantial evidence standard because the high court decisions cited by minor are inapposite,and this court has already determined that penal code section is constitutional.ibid.
the court explained that i ndependent review,which assigns to judges a constitutional responsibility that can not be delegated to the trier of fact,whether the factfinding function be performed in the particular case by a jury or by a trial judge bose,supra,at,is a rule of federal constitutional law id.at.it is necessary because the reaches of the first amendment are ultimately defined by facts it is held to embrace and an appellate court must decide whether a given course of conduct falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,supra,d,citing bose,supra,at.george,supra,cal th at,d.
we conclude that a reviewing court should make an independent examination of the record in a section case when a defendant raises a plausible first amendment defense to ensure that a speaker free speech rights have not been infringed by a trier of fact determination that the communication at issue constitutes a criminal threat.bose,supra.george,supra,cal th at,d.the court emphasized independent review is particularly important in the threats context because it is a type of speech that is subject to categorical exclusion from first amendment protection,similar to obscenity,fighting words,and incitement of imminent lawless action.what is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.watts united states,d.george,supra,cal th at,d.
in the case before us,the juvenile court found that the minor had committed a violation of penal code section.that section provides,in pertinent part every person who,with intent to cause,attempts to cause,or causes,any employee of any public educational institution to do,or refrain from doing,any act in the performance of his duties,by means of a threat,directly communicated to such person,to inflict an unlawful injury upon any person or property,and it reasonably appears to the recipient of the threat that such threat could be carried out,is guilty of a public offense 
the purpose of the statute is to prevent threatening communications to public officers or employees designed to extort their action or inaction.people zendejas d.the essential elements under penal code section are a threat to inflict an unlawful injury upon any person or property direct communication of the threat to a public officer or employee the intent to influence the performance of the officer or employee official duties and the apparent ability to carry out the threat.people hopkins d.see also people walker cal d,citing hopkins with approval.
the minor specifically challenges the juvenile court findings regarding two of the four elements of a penal code section violation that he threatened the teacher and that he had the specific intent to interfere with the teacher duties.both the minor and the attorney general agree that,as a reviewing court,we conduct an independent review of the first element to see whether the minor first amendment rights are violated by the juvenile court finding that he threatened the teacher but,as to the second challenged element,the customary standard of review for substantial evidence in support of the juvenile court finding is applicable 
the george court explained independent review is not the equivalent of de novo review in which a reviewing court makes an original appraisal of all the evidence to decide whether or not it believes the outcome should have been different.citation.because the trier of fact is in a superior position to observe the demeanor of witnesses,credibility determinations are not subject to independent review,nor are findings of fact that are not relevant to the first amendment issue.citations.as noted above,under the substantial evidence standard,the question is whether any rational trier of fact could find the legal elements satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt,whereas under independent review,an appellate court exercises its independent judgment to determine whether the facts satisfy the rule of law.accordingly,we will defer to the juvenile court credibility determinations,but will make an independent examination of the whole record citations,including a review of the constitutionally relevant facts de novo,independent of any previous determinations by the juvenile court citations to determine whether minor poem was a criminal threat entitled to no first amendment protection.george,supra,cal th at,d.
the attorney general points to the case of planned parenthood amer.coalition of life cir planned parenthood,as a demonstration of the dual approach,where the reviewing court makes a review of the entire record for substantial evidence supporting the trial court finding,and an independent review of the evidence implicating the first amendment.in planned parenthood,certain abortion providers brought suit against activist organizations under the freedom of access to clinic entrances act face,based on the actions of the organizations in publicly disclosing names and addresses of providers through posters and an internet web site.the district court entered judgment in favor of the providers and granted a permanent injunction.initially,the ninth circuit reversed.then,on rehearing en banc,the court of appeals held that the actions of the activist organizations in publicly disclosing the names and addresses of abortion providers,through guilty posters and an internet web site,constituted true threats of force within the meaning of face,and thus were not protected speech under the first amendment and,the district court would evaluate the punitive damages award and make findings with respect to its propriety.
the court stated construing the facts in the light most favorable to physicians,the verdict is supported by substantial evidence.acla was aware that a wanted type poster would likely be interpreted as a serious threat of death or bodily harm by a doctor in the reproductive health services community who was identified on one,given the previous pattern of wanted posters identifying a specific physician followed by that physician murder.the same is true of the posting about these physicians on that part of the nuremberg files where lines were drawn through the names of doctors who provided abortion services and who had been killed or wounded.we are independently satisfied that to this limited extent,acla conduct amounted to a true threat and is not protected speech.planned parenthood,supra,at.
however,the attorney general then states in his supplemental brief independent review does not the facts as found by the trier of fact those are subject to the deferential standard of review used in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence.rather,what is reviewed independently is whether those to be true and supported by substantial up to a true threat or are instead found to be protected speech under the first amendment.certainly in the case before us,the evidence was uncontradicted and the juvenile court determination as to lockwood credibility is not subject to independent review.george,supra,cal th at,d.however,we do not read george to require us to give deference to the constitutionally relevant facts because they were found to be true and supported by substantial evidence.rather,we will defer to the juvenile court credibility determinations,but will make an independent examination of the whole record citation,including a review of the constitutionally relevant facts de novo,independent of any previous determinations by the juvenile court citations to determine whether minor words were a criminal threat entitled to no first amendment protection.ibid.
the first amendment permits restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,which are of such slight social value as a step to the truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.citations.virginia black,d.t he first amendment also permits a state to ban a true threat.citations.true threats encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.citations.id.at.
threat to inflict unlawful injury 
to determine whether the minor statement to lockwood may be construed as a threat to inflict an unlawful injury upon person or property,we must examine not only the words spoken but also the circumstances surrounding the communication.in re ryan th,d in re ricky th,d.in doing so,we will keep in mind that penal code section is designed to prohibit plausible or serious threats and to ignore pranks,misunderstandings,and impossibilities.people zendejas,supra,d at.there is no case law that defines the nature of the injury to be threatened under penal code section.unlike penal code section,the statute does not define the gravity of the harm threatened.it does require that the threatened injury be of a nature that would be taken seriously and could cause the recipient to act or refrain from acting to avoid the threatened harm.
the minor statement,yell at me again and see what happens,standing alone is ambiguous.the minor contends on appeal,without citing any evidence,that the statement was meant to convey an intention to engage in some nonviolent as blowing off steam or bluffing or trash,if a threat,merely to go to lockwood superiors and lodge a complaint.however,when the statement is put in context,we disagree with the minor contention.the minor was angry and very upset at the time the words were spoken.simultaneously with his statement,he took a step toward lockwood,tilted back his head,and,there was a slight recollection that he clenched his fists when lockwood asked if the minor was threatening him,the minor did not deny it.lockwood felt the minor was very upset and was serious about what he was saying.lockwood told the police officer that he actually feared for his safety and believed that the minor might retaliate against him in the future.under these circumstances,we conclude that the minor communicated a threat of unlawful injury to lockwood within the meaning of penal code section.
the minor points to two cases where threats by a juvenile to a person in authority were found not to constitute statutory violations or true threats.we find the cases distinguishable.
in people tuilaepa cal th,d,during the penalty phase of a capital case,the defendant challenged certain evidence of unadjudicated acts of past misconduct as inadmissible as an aggravating factor.during an earlier california youth authority commitment,when locked in a maximum security cell,the defendant made death threats against female employees and threatened to burn the face of a male employee after he was reprimanded.the people had argued that such evidence was admissible as a violation of penal code section.but the record showed the recipients of the threats reported no actual fear and there was no showing of an intent to interfere with the employee duties.thus,the evidence did not constitute a threat against a public employee in violation of penal code section.people tuilaepa,supra,cal th at,d.
in the case of in re ricky,supra,th,d,the minor became angry at his teacher for accidentally hitting him with a door when the teacher opened it,and the minor retorted,im going to get you.the reviewing court found insufficient evidence to support a finding that the minor had violated penal code section,uttering a terrorist threat.the court noted that,other than the actual words spoken,there were no circumstances to support the requirement that the threat be so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific that it convey a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of threat in re ricky,supra,th at,d.the minor admitted to an investigating police officer that he said,im going to kick your ass,but he told the officer he did not mean to sound threatening.id.at,d.he also admitted his actions were not appropriate and apologized for his actions.although the minor was sent to the school office,the police were not called until the next day,and there was no evidence to suggest a prior history of disagreements or hostile remarks.the court further noted no show of physical force or display of fists.id.at,d.for the same reasons,the reviewing court found the statutory element of sustained fear,whereby the threat has a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat such as to cause the person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety,was not supported by sufficient evidence.
the facts in ricky contrast in many significant aspects to the facts h
