plaintiff william laney brought suit individually and on behalf of his minor daughter,victoria laney,after school officials confiscated her cell phone when it began ringing during a class session and then imposed a,suspension upon her.the only remaining claim,brought pursuant,seeks recovery for failure to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to victoria suspension.the sole remaining defendant,wilson county board of education wcbe,brings this interlocutory appeal of the district court finding that a,suspension implicates procedural due process protection of the due process clause.for the reasons stated below,we respectfully disagree with the district court and reverse.
victoria laney was in the eighth grade at west wilson middle school in juliet,wilson county,tennessee.on september,her cellular telephone began to ring during a class.victoria instructor seized the telephone and delivered it to the school principal,jim farley,along with a partially completed disciplinary office referral form.
the wcbe code of conduct prohibits students personal communications devices such as cellular telephones on school property during school hours.it further requires that violations be reported to the principal that the device be confiscated and returned only to the of the student.the code of conduct states that for a first offense,such a violation will result in confiscation of device and return to parent only after days and day of suspension.the code of conduct further provides 
due imposing consequences,the teacher or principal shall be guided by the principle of fundamental fairness and make at least rudimentary inquiry into the incident to assure that the offense is accurately identified,that the student understands the nature of the offense,and that the student is given an opportunity to present views.before a student is removed from the school setting,shall be given a complete due process hearing by the principal of said school the wilson county schools discipline hearing authority.
on the morning of monday,september,bill laney went to wilson middle school and spoke with jim farley,seeking the return of the cellular telephone.farley refused to return the phone until the expiration of thirty days.that same day,the,laura honeyman,completed the disciplinary office referral form stating that victoria was to serve one day of suspension on september,and that the phone was to be held in the vault for days.parent may pick up on october,in the main office.honeyman further checked boxes on the form that stated a conference had been held with the student and a letter had been sent home.
on september,victoria was home sick from school.when she reported to school for class on the next day,she served her one day of suspension in the school office.she did not confer with anyone at school regarding the cellular telephone incident,its seizure,or notice of the suspension further,victoria did not receive the suspension note to take to her parents until after she had served the suspension.they did not learn of it until informed by their daughter.
on september william laney brought suit individually and on behalf of victoria seeking in compensatory damages and in punitive damages,alleging violations of due process rights under related to the retention of the phone and the imposition of the suspension civil conspiracy under and individual claims against defendants jim farley and laura honeyman.
defendants wcbe,farley,and honeyman moved to dismiss under rule b.the district court referred the motion to the magistrate judge who issued a report and recommendation r r recommending that the motion be granted and the complaint dismissed.after considering all the objections,the district court made a de novo determination of the r r accepting its recommendation to dismiss the due process claim as to the retention of the phone,but found that the sole remaining claim under the procedural due process rights of the daughter in connection with the go forward.the only remaining defendant,wcbe,filed a motion to alter or amend judgment,or in the alternative,application for certification for interlocutory appeal related to the sole remaining due process claim.the district court denied the motion to alter or amend judgment but certified wcbe application for an interlocutory appeal of its due process claim.the wcbe petitioned this court,which granted permission for the instant interlocutory appeal.
we review the district court consideration of a rule b motion for dismissal under a de novo standard.arrow,at.in doing so,we must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all of the factual allegations as true and determine whether the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.id.citations omitted.
claims under can only be brought for deprivation of rights secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.lugar edmondson oil,d.the fourteenth amendment forbids the state from depriving any person of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.plaintiffs argue that because they were given no formal hearing or notification concerning victoria suspension,they were denied a constitutional right in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment 
the starting point for analyzing a school suspension case is goss lopez,d.in goss,the supreme court held that students facing suspensions from public school were entitled to protection under the due process clause.id.at.the court held further that such protection requires schools to provide notice of the charges against the students,an explanation of the evidence the authorities have,and an opportunity to present his or her side of the story.id.at.the court held that the due process clause applied because suspensions from school deprived students of two rights a property interest in educational benefits and a liberty interest in their reputations.id.at.thus,we must determine whether the suspension infringed victoria property or liberty interest.
regarding the property interest,the goss court said that state laws creating free education to all residents between five and years of age coupled with a law create a claim of entitlement to public education.at.having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of appellees class generally,ohio may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct absent,sic fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred.id.at.citing arnett kennedy,d powell,concurring.like ohio,tennessee has created a free education system and requires attendance in school.see ann.thus tennessee students have a legitimate property interest in educational benefits and,therefore,in actually attending school.
whether an suspension deprives a student of that interest in educational benefits depends on the extent of her exclusion from the educational process.in goss,the court viewed a suspension from school as a deprivation of a property right to education because it was a total exclusion from the educational process.id.at.an suspension could,but does not necessarily,deprive a student of educational opportunities in the same way an suspension would 
under certain circumstances,isolation could well constitute as much deprivation of education as suspension.in other words,a student could be excluded from the educational process as much by being placed in isolation as by being barred from the school grounds.the primary thrust of the educational process is classroom instruction in both situations the student is excluded from the classroom.this is not to say that any detention would necessarily be equivalent to a suspension it would depend on the extent to which the student was deprived of instruction or the opportunity to learn.
cole newton special mun.separate sch,aff,cir concluding that there were insufficient facts to determine as a matter of law that the isolation at issue involved sufficient educational deprivation to warrant due process protections.
here,victoria suspension was unlike the suspensions discussed in goss.tennessee students assigned to suspension remain in th
