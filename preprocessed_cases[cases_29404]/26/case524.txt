before us are two appeals challenging a district court order denying intervention under federal rule of civil procedure a and b to the michigan civil rights initiative committee the mcri,the american civil rights foundation the acrf,and toward a fair michigan tafm,collectively,the proposed intervenors each wishes to intervene in an action brought against jennifer granholm,the governor of michigan,and the regents of the university of michigan,the board of trustees of michigan state university,and the board of governors of wayne state university collectively,the universities,seeking to invalidate and permanently enjoin from enforcement a recently enacted amendment to michigan constitution that outlaws,among other things,sex and preferences in public education,public employment,and public contracting.the amendment was the result of the michigan voters approval,in november,of proposal proposal,a statewide ballot initiative.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court denial of intervention to the proposed intervenors.
background 
from approximately july through december,the mcri,with the assistance of paid agents,solicited signatures in support of placing a statewide ballot initiative,which would later become proposal,on michigan november general election ballot.operation king dream connerly,wl,at cir.proposal has been characterized as action,operation king dream connerly,wl,at,because,if approved,it would amend michigan constitution to prohibit the state from granting preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting,see also,operation king dream,wl,at.indeed,proposal path to the ballot was not without controversy.operation king dream,at,wl,at by all accounts,proposal found its way on the ballot through methods that undermine the integrity and fairness of our democratic processes.nonetheless,on november,michigan voters approved proposal,with approximately of voters favoring it.see state constitutional amendment ban affirmative action programs,at.com election results gen.html last visited.after its approval,proposal was scheduled to go into effect on december.see.const.
the day after the election,however,on november,the coalition to defend affirmative action,integration and immigrant rights,and fight for equality by any means necessary,along with other organizations and individuals collectively,the plaintiffs,filed suit in the eastern district of michigan against governor granholm and the universities,seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendment was invalid and a permanent injunction against its enforcement.in their amended complaint,p laintiffs contended that proposal violates two federal constitutional provisions the first and fourteenth amendments,three federal civil rights statutes title vi,title vii,and title ix,and one presidential order executive order.coal.to defend affirmative action granholm,cir.and on december,the universities filed a against governor granholm,seeking a preliminary injunction permitting them to continue using their existing admissions and policies through the end of the admissions cycle.
on december,three days after the universities filed their,the michigan attorney general,michael cox,moved to intervene in the lawsuit.that same day,the mcri and the acrf jointly moved to intervene as well.the district court ruled on only the attorney general motion,granting it that day.
on december,tafm and eric russell,a white applicant to the university of michigan law school,jointly moved to intervene in the lawsuit.that same day,before the district court issued its ruling on the four pending intervention motions the mcri,the acrf,tafm,and eric russell,the plaintiffs in the underlying suit and the three sets of parties to the filed a stipulation with the district court,which read in relevant part 
it is hereby stipulated,by and between the parties that this court may order as follows 
that the application of const,art,to the current admissions and financial aid policies of the university parties is enjoined through the end of the current admissions and financial aid cycles and no later than on july,at which time this stipulated injunction will expire

ii.analysis 
this is but one piece of litigation spurred by the proposal saga.operation king dream,wl,at,at.today,we address only the appeals of the district court order denying intervention as of right and by permission to the mcri,the acrf,and tafm.as discussed more fully below,because none of the proposed intervenors have a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the case,the district court properly denied their motions for intervention as of right.further,the district court acted within its discretion when it denied them permissive intervention.b.
intervention as of right 
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure entitles certain parties to intervene in a lawsuit as of right 
upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
a.we have explained that a proposed intervenor must establish four factors before being entitled to intervene the motion to intervene is timely the proposed intervenor has a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the case the proposed intervenor ability to protect their interest may be impaired in the absence of intervention and the parties already before the court can not adequately protect the proposed intervenor interest.grutter bollinger,cir.acknowledging that rule should be broadly construed in favor of potential intervenors,purnell city of akron,cir,the district court nevertheless held that none of the proposed intervenors met any of the four factors.
we review de novo motions to intervene as of right,except for the timeliness element,which is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.northland family planning clinic,cox,cir citing grutter,at.a district court abuses its discretion only when we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors or where the trial court improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.paschal flagstar bank,cir citations,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
we begin by addressing whether the proposed intervenors have a substantial legal interest in the litigation.because we conclude that none do,we need not address the remaining factors.see,grubbs norris,cir a failure to meet any one of the four factors will require that the motion be denied.
substantial legal interest 
the proposed intervenors must show that they have a substantial interest in the subject matter of this litigation.grutter,at citing jansen city of cincinnati,cir.although we have noted that this circuit has opted for a rather expansive notion of the interest sufficient to invoke intervention of right,michigan state miller,cir,this does not mean that any articulated interest will do.see,northland family planning,at accord glickman,cir t his does not mean that rule poses no barrier to intervention at all.of course,establishing a substantial legal interest is necessarily.miller,at.
a.the mcri and the acrf 
according to the mcri and the acrf,they were at the forefront of the protracted campaign to adopt proposal and are committed to ensuring its constitutionality and timely implementation.the mcri,headed by jennifer gratz,the lead plaintiff in gratz bollinger,d,is registered with the michigan secretary of state as the official committee for proposal,and was,by all accounts,the driving force behind the controversial solicitation of signatures necessary to place proposal on the ballot.see operation king dream,at,wl,at.the acrf is a corporation dedicated to eradicating sex and race preferences throughout the united states.ward connerly,an acrf board member,was instrumental in the passage of proposition in california,which similarly banned preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.coal.for economic equity wilson,cir quoting cal.const.art,a.indeed,by design,proposal tracks the language of proposition.the mcri and the acrf worked together,expending labor and funds,to see that proposal found its way on michigan november general election ballot and to see that the michigan voters approved proposal.the district court recognized that i t would not be unreasonable to posit that proposal would not have reached the ballot without their efforts.coal.to defend affirmative action,at.
both the mcri and the acrf argue that as groups substantially involved in the process leading to the adoption of the challenged amendment,they have a legal interest in the subject matter of this lawsuit.they rely primarily on our decisions in grutter and miller,as well as several ninth circuit decisions that we have cited favorably.see idaho farm bureau fed babbitt,cir sagebrush rebellion,watt,cir state of idaho freeman,cir.we,however,conclude that our precedent requires a contrary conclusion.since the district court denied the proposed intervenors motions back in december,we decided northland family planning,which is directly on point and controls our disposition.
in northland family planning,six facilities and four physicians filed suit against various michigan officials,seeking to invalidate and enjoin the enforcement of the legal birth definition act,which prohibit ed the practice colloquially referred to as abortions.at.like proposal,the legal birth definition act became law after a successful proposal by a citizen initiative petition.id.at.prior to the district court holding the act unconstitutional which we affirmed,a group called stand together to oppose sttop moved to intervene in the litigation under federal rule of civil procedure a and b.id.at.similar to the mcri and the acrf,sttop is a committee,which was formed to promote the passage and continued viability of the legal birth definition act.id.at.the district court denied sttop motion to intervene,and we affirmed.id.at.
in affirming the denial of sttop motion to intervene,we held that an organization involved in the process leading to the adoption of a challenged law,does not have a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of a lawsuit challenging the legality of that law,unless the challenged law regulates the organization or its members.id.in so holding,we drew a distinction between cases involving challenges to the procedure required to pass a particular rule,as opposed to the government subsequent enforcement of the rule after its enactment.id.at second emphasis added.in drawing this distinction,we explained that the public at public interest an interest in the procedure by which a given legal requirement is enacted as a matter of democratic legislative process.id.on the other hand,we further explained,in a challenge to the constitutionality of an statute,as opposed to the process by which it is enacted,the public interest in its enforceability is entrusted for the most part to the government,and the public legal interest in the legislative process becomes less relevant.accord providence baptist church hillandale,cir affirming the denial of a motion to intervene as of right by a committee that existed to support the passage of a local referendum to amend a zoning ordinance.thus,had sttop sought to intervene in a suit challenging the legislative process by which the statute was enacted,then it likely would have had a substantial legal interest in the lawsuit due to its involvement in the passage of the statute.northland family planning,at.but,after that statute enactment,sttop interest in a suit challenging the enforcement of the statute became insubstantial due to the state responsibilities in enforcing and defending it as it is written.id.at.
like sttop relationship to the legal birth definition act,the mcri was created and continues to exist for the purpose of passing and upholding proposal.see id.at.the acrf goals are,of course,more national,but for the purposes of this case,its relationship to proposal and interest in the underlying litigation is identical to the mcri.that is,like sttop,their legal interest can be said to be limited to the passage of proposal rather than the state subsequent implementation and enforcement of it.id.no doubt,each group was instrumental in proposal path to the ballot and ultimate approval.their interest in seeing proposal enforced,however,is greatly diminished due to the state responsibilities in enforcing and defending proposal as written.id.at.therefore,northland family planning compels us to hold that the mcri and the acrf status as organizations involved in the process leading to the adoption of proposal is insufficient to provide them with a substantial legal interest in a lawsuit challenging the validity of those portions of michigan constitution amended by proposal.
this is not to say that all organizations that advocate for the passage of a law lack a substantial legal interest in a suit challenging the government subsequent enforcement of that law.indeed,we have held that where a group is regulated by the new law,or,similarly,whose members are affected by the law,may likely have an ongoing legal interest in its enforcement after it is enacted.id.at accord,grutter,at holding that proposed intervenors,who were applicants to the university of michigan,had a substantial legal interest in the school admissions process miller,at holding that the michigan chamber of commerce had a substantial legal interest where it was regulated by at least three of the four statutory provisions challenged by plaintiffs.where,however,an organization has only a general ideological interest in the seeing that the government zealously enforces some piece of legislation that the organization the lawsuit does not involve the regulation of the organization conduct,without more,such an organization interest in the lawsuit can not be deemed substantial.see northland family planning,at explaining that an organization interest pertaining only to enforceability of a statute in general is not cognizable as a substantial legal interest without the statute also regulating the organization or its members.
here,the mcri and the acrf have only a general ideological interest in seeing that michigan enforces proposal.each group asserts that its mission to enforce laws at all levels of government will be impeded if not granted intervention.to be sure,neither the mcri nor the acrf maintains that it or its members are specifically regulated by those portions of michigan constitution amended by proposal.the most they claim is that proposal naturally affects them because each group has at least a few members that are michigan residents.this,however,amounts to only a generic interest shared by the entire michigan citizenry.an interest so generalized will not support a claim for intervention as of right.miller,at quoting and citing with approval athens lumber federal election comm n,cir.thus,the mcri and the acrf cognizable legal interests extend only to suits challenging the legislative process by which proposal was approved.at this point,the mcri and the acrf interest in the underlying litigation simply pertains to the enforceability of proposal in general,which we do not believe to be cognizable as a substantial legal interest sufficient to require intervention as of right.northland family planning,at.as we aptly explained in northland family planning,w ithout these sorts of limitations of the legal interest required for intervention,rule would be abused as a mechanism for the of the judicial process.id.
the mcri and the acrf point out,however,that in grutter we reversed a district court denial of intervention as of right to the citizens for affirmative action preservation caap,a nonprofit organization whose stated mission was to preserve the opportunities in higher education for and students in michigan.at.in grutter,we held that caap had a substantial legal interest in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the university of michigan admissions policy.id.at.the mcri and the acrf contend that caap,like them,had only an ideological interest in the lawsuit,and because caap was granted intervention as of right,they should be too.
the mcri and the acrf misidentify caap interest in grutter.although caap certainly had a general ideological aversion to the elimination of the university of michigan admissions policy,its members were also directly affected by the challenged policy.at the time of the litigation,caap was a coalition consisting of minority students and groups,among others,premised on preserving affirmative action in higher education.indeed,consistent with the makeup of its members,the district court treated caap interests as identical to the proposed intervenors in that lawsuit,who,like eric russell,no doubt had a substantial legal interest in the litigation.see gratz bollinger,rev by grutter,i t would appear that the proposed student intervenors and caap share the same interest in the preservation of race as a factor in determining admissions t he court will discuss the interests of both groups together.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.moreover,caap was clear in its intervention motion that its members would be directly affected by the outcome of the litigation.see id.caap asserts that its membership consists of individuals,some of whom are parents or grandparents of prospective and latino students in the state of michigan.consistent with this,in grutter,we held that caap,by virtue of its minority members,enunciated a specific interest in the subject matter of th e case,namely its interest in gaining admission to the university of michigan at.here,the mcri and the acrf have made no such specific enunciation.
thus,we hold that the mcri and the acrf lack a substantial legal interest in the outcome of this case and affirm the district court denial of their joint motion to intervene as of right.accordingly,as mentioned,we need not address the remaining elements.
tafm contention that it is entitled to intervene as of right is even less compelling.we have little trouble concluding that tafm is without a substantial legal interest in the outcome of this case.tafm took no position in favor or against proposal before,during,or after the november election,and instead sought only to promote an educated decision on the question by michigan citizens through civil and informed discourse.by all accounts,neither tafm nor its members are regulated by the challenged constitutional amendment.at best,tafm has only an ideological interest in seeing that proposal is enforced.as discussed above,consistent with our holding in northland family planning,this alone does not constitute a substantial legal interest.see at.therefore,the district court also properly denied tafm motion to intervene as of right.
permissive intervention 
under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,a district court may grant intervention to certain interested parties 
upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action when an applicant claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common in exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.
b.the denial of permissive intervention should be reversed only for clear abuse of discretion by the trial judge.purnell,at citing meyer goldberg,fisher foods,cir.
in denying the proposed intervenors permissive intervention,the district court explained that,in cases of this importance,the district courts are mere way stations on the judicial road to resolution by courts beyond,and that granting intervention to the proposed intervenors will inhibit,not promote,a prompt resolution coal.to defend affirmative action,at.the district court expressed further concern that the proposed intervenors would seek to file more claims,amend pleadings even further,and inject issues that may not lead directly to a resolution of the issues circumscribed by the present pleadings.id.this,coupled with the district court conclusions that the proposed intervenors lacked a substantial legal interest in the lawsuit,and that the proposed intervenors were adequately represented by existing parties,was a sufficient analysis of the relevant criteria required by rule b.we can not say that we are left with a definite and firm conviction,paschal,at,that the district court acted outside its discretion when it denied permissive intervention to the mcri,the acrf,and tafm.miller,at the district court must provide enough of an explanation for its decision to enable this court to conduct meaningful review.it is insufficient merely to quote the rule and to state the result.
iii.conclusion 
for these reasons,we affirm.
i concur with the majority disposition with regard to appellant tafm.i can not,however,agree that northland family planning clinic cox,cir,compels us to hold that the mcri and the acrf status is insufficient to provide them with a substantial legal interest in this case,ante at.the majority relies on that opinion to avoid clear prior holdings from both our circuit and the ninth circuit whose holdings we had previously adopted.therefore,because i conclude that mcri and acrf have a substantial legal interest and easily meet the other rule a factors,i dissent.
substantial legal interest 
the majority relies almost solely on northland family planning indeed,it concludes that case compels its holding here.op.at.northland family planning is distinguishable because the challenged state law in that case was enacted by the legislature,rather than by the citizens through constitutional amendment as here,and the groups here have raised reasons why they can not rely on the office of the michigan attorney general to vigorously advocate the constitutionality of proposal.
at the outset,however,i would note that the majority can only rely on northland family planning because that case fundamentally altered the rule a landscape.prior precedent was consistent in holding that interest was to be construed liberally and close cases should be resolved in favor of recognizing an interest under rule a.michigan state miller,cir.while northland family planning ca
