a minor,appeals from the summary judgment entered on her action against the los angeles unified school district for negligent supervision of a teacher who sexually fondled her.because the undisputed facts show that waited too long to file the required tort claim with the school district,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
sued the los angeles unified school district the district for negligence after she was repeatedly fondled by michael mcmurray,her fourth grade teacher at plainview elementary school during the school year.according to,mcmurray would rub her leg from ankle to thigh while kneeling by her desk to answer questions about her schoolwork.this happened regularly during the school year even though she would move her legs away or tell mcmurray to stop.as a result,stopped asking questions about her schoolwork to keep mcmurray away.
the undisputed facts showed that the school year ended on june,that had a different teacher the next school year and had no contact with mcmurray,and that she switched to a different school for sixth grade.testified at her deposition that she felt what mcmurray was doing was wrong,and that his actions made her scared and nervous.therefore,the district contended,her cause of action accrued no later than june,when the school year ended.instead of filing a tort claim by december,however,she did not do so until april,meaning her claim was barred.the district moved for summary judgment on that basis 
was one of several girls who were sexually fondled by mcmurray.acting out of embarrassment and fear they might somehow be blamed,they agreed to keep quiet and not tell their parents what had happened.mcmurray was arrested october,when one of his victims came forward and reported the incident to the police mother learned of the arrest that day,and asked what she knew about it.told mother what mcmurray had done to her,and mother filed a tort claim with the district on april.opposed the summary judgment motion on the ground that her cause of action did not accrue until mother discovered what happened on october.as a result,her tort claim was timely,she argued.the trial court disagreed,and entered judgment for the district.
on appeal,contends her cause of action did not accrue until mother learned what happened.she also raises an issue not raised below that the district is equitably estopped from asserting the statutory time limits because it created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that delayed her from telling her mother what had happened.
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.in doing so,we must strictly scrutinize the moving party papers.the declarations of the party opposing summary judgment,however,are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.while the appellate court must review a summary judgment motion by the same standards as the trial court,it must independently determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented.barber marina sailing,th.

discussion 
cause of action accrued by june,
under the tort claims act,a person may not sue a public entity for personal injury unless he or she first presents a written claim to the entity within six months of the time her cause of action accrues,and the entity then denies the claim.if the public entity does not give written notice that the claim has been rejected,the plaintiff has until two years from the date her cause of action accrued to sue the entity,subd.a arcadia unified school dist.th.the claim filing requirement is not merely procedural,but is instead a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action and is therefore an element of a plaintiff cause of action,at.
the accrual date for presenting a government tort claim is determined by the rules applicable to determining when any ordinary cause of action accrues.that date may be postponed under the delayed discovery doctrine,supra,th at.under this doctrine,a cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.fox ethicon,cal th,fox.a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she has reason to at least suspect a factual basis for its elements.suspicion of one or more of the elements,coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements,will generally trigger the applicable limitations period.ibid.this refers to the generic elements of wrongdoing,causation,and harm and does not require a hypertechnical approach.instead,we look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing has injured them.ibid.
the district contends that because testified she knew what mcmurray did was wrong,her cause of action accrued no later than the end of her fourth grade school year on june.because her claim was not filed with the district until nearly two years later,the district contends her action was barred.
summary judgment opposition did not dispute the content of her deposition testimony.relying on curtis county of los angeles th curtis,she argued that because of her age and inexperience,her knowledge of wrongfulness was irrelevant,and her cause of action did not accrue until her mother learned what happened on october.under that scenario,she contends,her tort claim was timely filed,and her complaint was timely because she sued within two years of the time her cause of action accrued.
to the extent contends curtis holds that a minor sexual molestation cause of action does not accrue until a parent learns of the molestation,she has misread that decision.the plaintiff in curtis was placed in foster care by los angeles county when he became the subject of a dependency proceeding under welfare and institutions code section.curtis,supra,th at.he lived in foster care between the ages of five and eight until october,when the dependency case was terminated and he was returned to his mother.in march,when the plaintiff was,he filed a claim with the county alleging that he was sexually molested by another child while living in the foster home.when the county denied the claim,the plaintiff sued,alleging that his foster parent knew about the molestation but did nothing to stop it,and that his mother did not learn about the molestation until september.id.at.the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer to the complaint because the minor did not file a claim with the county within six months of the time when the molestations ended.id.at.
the curtis court reversed,holding that the delayed discovery rule applied to child molestation cases,and that the plaintiff should have been granted l
