when a school district deprives a disabled child of free appropriate public education in violation of the individuals with disabilities education act,a court fashioning appropriate relief,as the statute allows,may order compensatory education,replacement of educational services the child should have received in the first place.this commonsense by the school district here and supported by the supreme court decision compelling reimbursement for such services in school committee of the town of burlington,massachusetts department of education of massachusetts,d led a hearing officer to award appellant,a with severe learning disabilities,hours of compensatory education,one hour for each day in the years during which the school system denied the student appropriate instruction.pointing out that neither reasoning nor evidence supported this calculation and insisting that relief was instead the child due,the child and his mother argue that the hearing officer abused his authority.they also challenge the officer decision to allow the child individualized education program team to reduce or discontinue compensatory services on the decision of the iep team that minor no longer needs or is not benefitting from this compensatory education.because we agree that the hearing officer mechanical calculation merits no deference and that the iep team delegation violates the statute,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the school district.we reject,however,appellants equally mechanical calculation and instead adopt a qualitative standard compensatory awards should aim to place disabled children in the same position they would have occupied but for the school district violations of idea.
under the individuals with disabilities education act known as idea,states and territories,including the district of columbia,that receive federal educational assistance must establish policies and procedures to ensure,among other things,that free appropriate public education,or fape,is available to disabled children.see a a.premised on congress expectation that w ith proper education services,many disabled individuals would be able to become productive citizens,contributing to society instead of being forced to remain burdens,at discussing predecessor to idea,this requirement furthers our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic for individuals with disabilities,c.school districts may not ignore disabled students needs,nor may they await parental demands before providing special instruction.instead,school systems must ensure that a ll children with disabilities residing in the state regardless of the severity of their disabilities,and who are in need of special education and related services,are identified,located,and evaluated.id.a a.once such children are identified,a team including the child parents and select teachers,as well as a representative of the local educational agency with knowledge about the school resources and curriculum,develops an individualized education program,or iep,for the child.see id.a,d.pursuant to the supreme court decision in board of education of the hendrick hudson central school district,westchester county rowley,d,the iep must,at a minimum,provid e personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.see id.at.in addition,if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system,the iep should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.id.at.if no suitable public school is available,the school system must pay the costs of sending the child to an appropriate private school.jenkins squillacote.
in this case,as two successive administrative hearings established and as the district of columbia,appellee herein,now concedes,the district of columbia public schools dcps failed to meet its idea obligations with respect to appellant mathew reid.a district of columbia resident,mathew suffers from documented learning disabilities,including dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,that affect his auditory memory,formation of grammatical sentences,and articulation of word sounds.though mathew mother had noticed by the fall of her son year that he had difficulty reading,when she contacted a school district counselor,the counselor refused to provide the necessary form for requesting a disability evaluation.the following spring,during a meeting with mathew teacher and school principal,the teacher recommended that mathew be retained in second grade due to behavioral and academic problems.according to reid,however,the principal told her that she did believe that matthew really needed to be kept back.
mathew spent the next year in california and then returned to by that time,test scores placed him in the bottom one percent of his age group for reading comprehension and the bottom five percent for reading overall.nonetheless,without performing any disability evaluation,the school district placed mathew in a regular class.only after a full school year of unsatisfactory grades did dcps recognize mathew disability and develop an iep.
under this iep,mathew was retained in fourth grade and attended ten hours per week of special education instruction plus language therapy sessions and one half hour per week of counseling.in accordance with idea preference for avoiding separate instruction t o the maximum extent possible,see a,mathew spent the remainder of the school day mainstreamed in regular classes,but received accommodations such as preferential seating and extended time for assignments.two years later,dcps revised mathew iep to provide hours of special education services per week.despite these services,testing in november of mathew year revealed him reading at a level,even though six months earlier he had been reading at a level.mathew overall intellectual ability placed him in the ninth percentile for his age.
despite further testing confirming these results,mathew iep team made no change in his program until april of that school year.at that point,presumably because mathew math skills had risen from low level to low level though at the time mathew was entering seventh grade and was old enough to be entering eighth,the team eliminated minutes per week of math tutoring while adding minutes per week of reading instruction and fifteen extra minutes per week of counseling.
objecting to this new iep,mathew mother exercised her statutory right to demand an impartial due process hearing,see b,e,f.she argued that the iep is inappropriate because mathew requires a special education program and the iep calls for a part time special education program.the hearing officer agreed.based on the student serious and extensive needs and the glaring inappropriateness of the iep in terms of placing mathew in a program when he requires a program,the officer ordered the school district to place mathew in a special education program with a low student teacher ratio and intensive work in reading with the other related services,designating one such program,the accotink academy,as mathew placement at least on an interim basis.this is a student who is capable of doing better,the hearing officer wrote,and as he approaches adolescence,the likelihood of his remaining interested in staying in school will decrease if his reading level stays at a second grade level.
to make up for deficiencies in mathew prior education,reid also sought extra instruction beyond his accotink academy other words,compensatory education.in separate proceedings related to that claim,a second hearing officer heard expert testimony indicating,among other things,that in struggling to read,mathew had learned compensatory strategies that are counterproductive,that there was a gap in between what mathew was capable of,and actually what he was performing,and that because of academic and interpersonal difficulties,mathew had grown significantly depressed.three psychologist,a speech language,and an educational testified that the school district should have known mathew was disabled in second grade or earlier.based on this evidence,and building on the earlier hearing,the hearing officer concluded that dcps had denied mathew fape for roughly years,from midway through second grade until the accotink placement at the end of sixth grade skipping mathew year in california and counting both years.
as a remedy,the officer ordered hours of compensatory education,a figure he derived by awarding hour for each day of special education services not provided.indicating neither why he chose this formula nor what specific services should be provided,the officer empowered mathew iep team to direct implementation of the award.the services are to be reduced or discontinued,he added,on the decision of the iep team that minor no longer needs or is not benefitting from this compensatory education.the team decision that mathew no longer needs or is not benefitting from this award of compensatory education services will terminate this award.the team decision and reasoning in this regard are to be fully explained in the iep meeting notes.
under idea,parties aggrieved by an administrative decision may sue in either state or federal court.see i a.the court then i shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings ii shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party and iii basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.see id.i b.seeking such review in the district court for the district of columbia,mathew and his mother challenged both the number of hours awarded as compensatory instruction and the allowance for reduction or termination by the iep team.on for summary judgment,the district court rejected the reids two claims as well as a third argument not renewed here and affirmed the administrative award.see reid district of columbia,d.the reids now appeal.
we begin with our standard of review.though conceding that judicial review under idea is more rigorous than in typical agency cases,the school district argues that both our review of the district court and the district court review of the hearing officer should be deferential.we disagree on both counts.
to start with the standard applicable in the district court,it is true that under our precedent a party challenging the administrative determination must at least take on the burden of persuading the court that the hearing officer was wrong,and that a court upsetting the officer decision must at least explain its basis for doing so.see kerkam mckenzie,kerkam i.but we have also made clear that given the district court authority to hear additional evidence at the request of a party and bas e its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,see i b ii,iii,idea plainly suggest s less deference than is conventional in administrative proceedings.see kerkam i,at.moreover,a hearing decision without reasoned and specific findings deserves little deference.see kerkam superintendent,pub,kerkam ii internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,although the hearing officer made express findings regarding dcps denial of fape,he set forth the award in a ipse dixit.at rate of hour for each day of special education services not provided,he wrote,dcps is to provide hours multiplied by school days of compensatory education services to mathew as his iep team directs.the officer order contains neither reasoning to support this formula nor factual findings showing that the result satisfied mathew needs.accordingly,the district court,obligated by idea to ensure that relief set forth in the administrative award was appropriate,could not simply rely on the hearing officer exercise of discretion.instead,the court had to examine the record itself.nor,regarding the other issue in this case,could the court defer to the officer decision to delegate authority to the iep team,for the officer implicit ruling on that idea permits such an issue of statutory construction,a pure question of law that courts review de novo.thus,on neither issue in this appeal could the district court presume the validity of the hearing officer action.
we reach a similar conclusion regarding the standard governing our review of the district court decision.as noted above,trial judges in idea cases may hear additional evidence and fashion appropriate relief.see i b ii,iii.these powers of and,the supreme court has explained,entail broad discretion and implicate equitable considerations.see florence county sch.dist.four carter,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,had the district court actually exercised those powers,our review would be error as to any factual findings and abuse of discretion as to the remedy.see patricia bd.of educ.of oak park,cir parents of student puyallup sch,cir remedial discretion.in this case,however,the district court granted summary judgment based simply on the administrative record.applying the familiar rule standard,the court took no additional evidence,but viewed the record in the light most favorable to see reid,d at,applying standard of review based on.on appeal,therefore,we find ourselves in exactly the same position as the district court.accordingly,we review its decision de novo as in an ordinary summary judgment case,see,maydak united states,and apply the same standard the district court should have applied to the hearing decision.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the disputed issues the compensatory education amount and the iep team delegation.
compensatory award 
under the theory of compensatory education,courts and hearing officers may award educational services to be provided prospectively to compensate for a past deficient program.see ex rel.rg fort bragg dependent,cir.embraced in some form by several circuits,see,id.at ridgewood bd.of educ.ex rel,cir bd.of educ.of oak park river forest high sch.dist.state bd.of,cir parents of student,at pihl.dep t of,cir miener missouri,cir see also diatta district of columbia,d,this theory builds on the supreme court holding in burlington that appropriate idea relief may include reimbursement for parents who place children in private school rather than accept a deficient public school iep,see at.if idea permits reimbursement for educational services,courts have reasoned,then it must also allow awards of the services themselves.see,bd.of educ.of oak park river forest high,at pihl,at miener,at.based on such logic,courts have upheld awards requiring,among other things,special programs to make up for prior deficiencies,see,diatta,d at westendorp indep.sch.dist,d,ex rel.rg,at,remanding claim of,and instruction beyond age ordinarily the limit of idea coverage,see a a,see,ridgewood bd.of,at pihl,at.
in our view,this extension of burlington to cover services as well as payments makes eminent sense.given the availability of reimbursement for compensatory instruction,were it impossible to obtain an award of the instruction itself,children access to appropriate education could depend on their parents capacity to front its result manifestly incompatible with idea purpose of ensur ing that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,d a emphasis added.even worse,students who remained in public school would lack any effective redress for fape denials,even those extending over many years,as in mathew case.to be sure,such students could seek prospective correction of a deficient iep,as the reids did in the first administrative proceeding described above.but because the rowley standard requires only that schools provide some educational benefit,see rowley,at.standard that looks to the child present iep conforming to that standard carries no guarantee of undoing damage done by prior violations.as this case demonstrates,moreover,that damage may be quite severe according to expert testimony,mathew not only failed to keep pace with his peers under the school district iep,but actually learned counterproductive compensatory techniques that he must now unlearn before he can advance.consistent with congress stated aim of ensur ing that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected,see d b,we therefore join
