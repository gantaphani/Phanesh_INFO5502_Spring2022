factual and procedural background 
appellant john david stoner brought this qui tam action in the united states district court for the northern district of california against the santa clara county office of education sccoe,his former employer,the east side union high school district esuhsd,and three sccoe employees,colleen wilcox,joe fimiani,and david wong.in the proceedings before the district court,stoner appeared pro se.although stoner is a licensed attorney,and has been admitted to practice before this court,see fed.proc.a,he is not a member of the state bar of california,and consequently could not be admitted to membership before the district court for the northern district of california,see northern district of california,civil local rule.stoner complaint alleged that defendants presented various fraudulent claims for payment or approval to the united states in violation of the false claims act fca.specifically,he claimed that defendants falsely certified compliance with the individuals with disabilities education act to induce the government to disburse more money for certain educational programs.stoner complaint also raised a number of state law claims,including alleged violations of the california false claims act.
as required by the fca,stoner filed his complaint under seal and served it on the united states.see b.after the united states declined to intervene,the complaint was unsealed and served on the sccoe.the sccoe immediately moved to dismiss the claims against it,arguing,among other things,that it was not a person subject to liability under the fca.the remaining defendants joined in that motion.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss after determining that the complaint failed to state a claim under the fca.see.b.the court held that the fca did not provide a cause of action against the sccoe and the esuhsd because each entity is a state agency,and thus not a person subject to liability under the fca.see.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d holding that the fca does not subject a state or state agency to liability in a qui tam action brought by a private relator.relying on united states ex rel.mcvey board of regents of the university of california,d,the court also held that stoner could not sue the individual sccoe employees in their personal capacities under the fca for actions committed in the course of their official responsibilities.in addition,the court sua sponte raised the issue of stoner authority to prosecute a qui tam action on behalf of the united states in propria persona and held that stoner could not proceed pro on the fca claims.the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over stoner remaining state law claims and dismissed stoner complaint in its entirety.stoner filed this timely appeal.see arpin santa clara valley transp.agency,cir noting that a motion to dismiss becomes a final appealable order within the meaning of when the district court order disposes of all claims against all parties

discussion 
we first address the question whether school districts in california,including county offices of education,are subject to qui tam liability under the fca.we begin our analysis with the language of the statute itself.the fca subjects to liability any person who,among other things,knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a.section does not define the term person.however,stevens held that a state or state agency is not a person for purposes of and,therefore,not subject to liability in qui tam suits brought by private parties.at.
in light of stevens holding,we must determine whether the sccoe,a california county office of education,and the esuhsd,a california school district,are state agencies.although we have not yet considered this issue in the context of the fca,we previously determined that a california school district and county office of education were state agencies for purposes of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.belanger madera unified sch,cir eaglesmith ward,cir.the district court looked to these cases in ruling that neither the sccoe nor the esuhsd was a person within the meaning of.
we agree with the district court approach.as explained below,stevens teaches that our eleventh amendment case law should guide our determination of whether an entity is a state agency and thus not a person for purposes of.stevens analysis of the word person in was driven by canons of statutory construction relating to protection of the state sovereign immunity.see stevens,at.specifically,stevens based its holding that neither a state nor a state agency were persons within the meaning of on the following canons of statutory construction related to state sovereignty the presumption that the term person does not include the sovereign,id.at.the rule that congress must clearly state its intention to subject states to liability,id.at.the presumption against imposition of punitive damages on governmental entities,id.at.and the ordinary rule of statutory construction that if congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between states and the federal government,it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,id.at.applying these canons,the court observed that far from providing the requisite affirmative indications that the term person included states for purposes of qui tam liability,congress expressed a contrary intent.id.this conclusion was buttressed by the doctrine that statutes should be construed so as to avoid difficult constitutional questions.id.with respect to this last point,the supreme court explained that there was a serious doubt on the question whether an action in federal court by a qui tam relator against a state or a state agency would be consistent with the eleventh amendment,id.quoting ashwander tva.brandeis,concurring,although the court was careful to express no view on this issue.id.in effect,the court presumed that in enacting the fca,congress intended not to infringe on a state sovereign immunity and therefore did not make states subject to suit under the fca.
to effectuate congress presumed intent,we must interpret the term person under in a way that avoids suits against state instrumentalities that are effectively arms of the state immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.see also will.dep t of state police,d instructing lower courts to refer to the eleventh amendment analysis in determining whether an entity is an agency of the state and thus not a person for purposes of citing healthy bd.of educ.doyle,d.our conclusion that we must rely on our eleventh amendment jurisprudence to determine whether an entity is a person within the meaning of is further underlined by our holding that states and state agencies enjoy sovereign immunity from liability under the fca.california,cir see also united states ex rel.ali daniel,mann,johnson mendenhall,cir.both and ali implicitly recognize that eleventh amendment principles guided the supreme court decision in stevens.
we thus look to our eleventh amendment case law in determining whether the sccoe and the esuhsd are state agencies not subject to fca liability under stevens.we have held that a california school district and county office of education are arms of the state for purposes of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.belanger,at eaglesmith,at.accordingly,we must conclude that neither the sccoe nor the esuhsd is a person subject to liability under of the fca.stevens,at.by the same reasoning,stoner qui tam action against the sccoe and the esuhsd is barred by the eleventh amendment.ali,at,at.
stoner asks us to revisit belanger and eaglesmith in light of regents of the university of california doe,d,which was decided by the supreme court five years after belanger.he contends that after regents,a state agency is not shielded by the state sovereign immunity unless the state is directly liable for any money judgment rendered against the agency.we disagree.regents holds that the eleventh amendment may bar a lawsuit against a state agency in circumstances where the state is legally liable for a judgment against that agency,even if the state is indemnified against that liability by a third party.id.at.but nothing in regents requires us to depart from the eleventh amendment principle that a governmental entity may be an arm of the state protected by sovereign immunity where the state is functionally liable,even if not legally liable,on money judgments against the state entity.see,hess port auth,d where an agency is so structured that,as a practical matter,if the agency is to survive,a judgment must expend itself against state treasuries,common sense and the rationale of the eleventh amendment require that sovereign immunity attach to the agency.internal quotation marks omitted lake country estates,tahoe reg l planning agency,d the eleventh amendment protect s the state treasury from liability that would have had essentially the same practical consequences as a judgment against the state itself.emphasis added.in decisions issued after regents,we held that california school districts and county offices of education are entitled to the state eleventh amendment immunity,due in part to their statutorily mandated relationship with the state,which among other things makes the state treasury unconditionally liable to make up any budgetary shortfall encountered by either entity as a result of an adverse judgment.see beentjes placer county air pollution control,cir holz nenana city pub.sch,cir savage glendale union high sch.dist,cir eason clark county sch,cir.these cases make clear that belanger and eaglesmith remain binding authority of this circuit following regents.
following belanger and eaglesmith,therefore,we hold that the sccoe and the esuhsd are arms of the state,and therefore not persons subject to qui tam liability under the fca.stoner thus has no statutory authority to bring an fca claim against the sccoe and the esuhsd.see a stevens,at.by the same token,the eleventh amendment poses an independent bar to qui tam action against either entity,at.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed stoner fca claims against both entities.
we next turn to the district court dismissal of the fca claims asserted against the three individual sccoe employees named in stoner complaint.while stoner complaint does not specify the capacity in which he was suing wilcox,fimiani,and wong,t he course of proceedings in this case indicates that stoner was suing these employees in their individual,as well as official capacities.see kentucky graham,d in many cases,the complaint will not clearly specify whether officials are sued personally,in their official capacity,or both.the course of proceedings in such cases typically will indicate the nature of the liability sought to be imposed.quoting brandon holt,d.with respect to the official capacity claims,the district court held that the individually named defendants could not be sued for damages in their official capacities because such a suit would,in effect,be against the state.see will,at.concluding that a state official sued in his or her official capacity for money damages is not a person subject to suit under because a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official office,and for this reason is no different from a suit against the state itself.the parties do not challenge this ruling and we express no opinion on the merits of the district court conclusion.
the district court also held that stoner failed to state an fca claim against the individual defendants in their personal capacities because stoner could not allege that the defendants actions exceeded the scope of their official responsibilities.as explained below,this was an error.the plain language of the fca subjects to liability any person who,among other things,knowingly submits a false claim or causes such a claim to be submitted to the united states.although the fca does not define the term person,the supreme court has made clear that the term includes natural persons.cook county united states ex rel.chandler,d see also defining the term person for purposes of determining the meaning of any act of congress as including an individual.therefore,state employees sued in their personal capacities are persons who may be subject to liability for submitting a false claim to the united states.hafer melo,d concluding,in context of case filed pursuant to,that a government official in the role of defendant fits comfortably within the statutory term person.
to state a claim against wilcox,fimiani,and wong in their personal capacities,stoner need show only that the individual employees knowingly present ed,or cause d to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a.stoner complaint alleged that wilcox,fimiani,and wong knowingly presented or caused to be presented false or fraudulent statements to the united states department of education to obtain federal funds for various educational programs.if true,these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for personal liability under a.stoner need not allege that the individual defendants personally profited from such false submissions.nothing in a requires the person knowingly making a false submission to obtain a personal benefit from the wrongful act.
in dismissing the fca claims against wilcox,fimiani,and wong,the district court relied on mcvey,d at,which held that u nder the fca,a state official is immune from suit for actions taken in his position,even where it is alleged that the official abused his authority.id.at see also united states ex rel.gaudineer comito,iowa,cir holding that state official could not be sued under the fca in his individual capacity unless he was acting outside his official duties when he took the action alleged to violate the fca quoting,at.we disagree with mcvey and gaudineer to the extent the reasoning of these cases can not be reconciled with the plain language of the statute.
our conclusion is supported by the supreme court decision in hafer,which rejected the argument that state officials may not be held personally liable under for actions taken in their official capacities.at.the court reasoned that to hold otherwise would,in effect,absolutely immunize state officials from personal liability for acts within their authority and necessary to fulfilling governmental responsibilities.id.at.the court noted that such absolute immunity extends only to a very limited class of officials,including the president of the united states,legislators carrying out their legislative functions,and
