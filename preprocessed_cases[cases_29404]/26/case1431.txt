plaintiff james patterson was injured while participating in a truck driver training course.defendant sacramento city unified school district district offered the course as part of its adult education program.patterson sued the district for negligent supervision.the trial court granted the district motion for summary judgment,ruling that the doctrine of primary assumption of risk barred patterson negligence claim.
on appeal,patterson contends judgment must be reversed because the court improperly overruled a finding of duty in the district first summary judgment motion assumption of risk does not apply in the circumstances of this case and even if the assumption of risk doctrine applies,there are triable issues of fact on whether the district acted recklessly.we agree with plaintiff that assumption of the risk does not apply in these circumstances and shall reverse the judgment.
factual background 
in spring,patterson enrolled in the district california heavy duty truck driving program.the truck driving course provided students with the training and experience they needed to become professional truck drivers.it consisted of three segments classroom instruction training and experience.in order to pass the course,students were required to participate in community service projects as part of their training and experience.
the district assigned credentialed truck driving instructors to teach each segment of the course.joe arcuri and ward allen taught the second and third segments.allen also served as field instructor and supervisor for the community service projects.
on may,during the first week of the segment of the training course,patterson and several other students participated in a community service project which involved picking up bleachers from several locations,loading them onto a flat bed trailer attached to a tractor,and transporting them to the site of a rugby tournament.the classroom curriculum covered freight loading in a basic sense,but did not cover the specifics of loading flat bed trucks or trailers.according to the instructors,a primary goal of the community service assignment was to teach students how to load the trailers safely.the instructors described the loading of cargo as a kind of thing that involved common sense.the instructors typically critiqued the students after they loaded the cargo.
allen was responsible for instructing patterson and the other students on loading the bleachers on the flat bed trailer.the bed of the trailer was between and inches wide and approximately five feet off the ground.allen was present when the students picked up aluminum bleachers at the first location and loaded them on the trailer without incident.he told the students to pick up the bleachers at the second location on their own.allen did not know how much prior training or experience his students had in loading trailers.
the bleachers at the second location were made of heavy wood.allen had not seen the wooden bleachers before assigning the students to pick them up.because there were no teachers present,and none of the students was considered to be in charge,the unsupervised students decided as a group how to load the wooden bleachers.it took six students to carry each section of wooden bleachers.patterson and a student named don cruse stood on the trailer bed.patterson had never climbed on the flat bed trailer before he and the other students arrived at the second location.patterson and cruse pulled on the wooden bleachers while the remaining students pushed the bleachers from below.patterson cautioned the students who were pushing to slow down when he recognized that he was running out of room at the edge of the trailer.instead,the students gave the bleachers one big push,and patterson fell backward off the trailer.
discussion 
the trial court shall grant defendant motion for summary judgment if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that defendant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action by showing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action,subd.p.once the defendant has made the required showing,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or defense.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
when a defendant moves for summary judgment on the basis of implied assumption of the risk,he or she has the burden of establishing the plaintiff primary assumption of the risk by demonstrating that the defendant owed no legal duty to the plaintiff to prevent the harm of which the plaintiff complains.citation.determining whether the primary assumption of risk doctrine applies is a legal question to be decided by the court.knight jewett cal th,d,knight citation.moser ratinoff th,d.
on appeal from the entry of summary judgment,we review the record de novo to determine whether the moving party was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law or whether genuine issues of material fact remain.citation.campbell derylo th,d.
the second motion for summary judgment 
judge cecil heard the district first motion for summary judgment in september.at that point in the proceedings,the district argued that there was no statutory basis for imposing liability for negligent supervision,training,and instruction of adult students and general negligence as a matter of law judge cecil denied the motion in a ruling that referred to government code sections and and read in part the facts are sufficient to show there was a duty on the part of the school district employees to properly supervise and instruct plaintiff on the loading of wooden bleachers on a flat bed trailer.patterson argues that by considering and granting the district second motion for summary judgment in march,judge chang improperly overruled judge cecil earlier ruling.there is no merit in this argument.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision f states that a party may not move for summary judgment based on issues asserted in a prior motion for summary adjudication.to determine whether a second summary judgment motion is proper,courts consider whether it involves newly discovered facts or circumstances or a change of law.schachter citigroup,th,d see bagley trw,th,d bagley second motion showed no new law and listed no new material facts in the separate statement.
although patterson is correct that both motions for summary judgment involved duty in a general sense,the district two motions were not identical and involved different legal theories.the first motion focused on whether there was a statutory basis for imposing a duty the second motion focused on whether the common law defense of assumption of risk applied to negate any claim of duty.a comparison of the arguments and material facts shows that the district second motion for summary judgment is not simply a reformatted,condensed,and cosmetically repackaged version of its first motion.bagley,supra,th at,d.
moreover,we note that there was a change in the law following the court september,ruling on the first summary judgment motion.on october,this court filed its opinion in saville sierra college th,d saville,which applied the doctrine of assumption of risk in the context of an adult education class at a public college.the district relied extensively on saville in its second motion for summary judgment.for these reasons,we conclude that there was no procedural bar to the court consideration of the district second motion.
duty of care and assumption of risk 
patterson complaint alleges that the district had a duty to supervise,train,educate,instruct,and oversee the conduct of its truck driver training students on proper techniques for loading and unloading flat bed trucks and trailers and to exercise ordinary care to protect students from the type of injury that patterson suffered.the district maintains that under the doctrine of assumption of risk,it owed patterson no duty of care.
historically,the concept of duty developed in the late century as a legal device was designed to curtail the feared propensities of juries toward liberal awards.dillon legg cal d,dillon.the essential question in a duty analysis is whether the plaintiff interests are entitled to legal protection against the defendant conduct duty is a shorthand statement of a conclusion,rather than an aid to analysis in itself but it should be recognized that duty is not sacrosanct in itself,but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.citation.accord,avila citrus community college dist.cal th,d,avila.
in deciding whether to depart from the general principle that a person is liable for injuries caused by his or her failure to exercise reasonable care,courts balance the now classic list of policy considerations which include the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.rowland christian cal d,see stockinger feather river community college th,d stockinger.
this case presents competing policy considerations.on one hand,as an adult student at a public school,is patterson entitled to legal protection against the alleged negligence of the district employees in failing to supervise and instruct him on how to load wooden bleachers on a flat bed trailer as we explained,the court denied the district first summary judgment motion on grounds it owed patterson a duty of care under statutory law.on the other hand,does the doctrine of assumption of risk relieve the district of any duty of care based on the nature of the class activity and the potentially chilling effect of imposing a duty of care on the district truck driving instructors although this case may not fit neatly into either line of authority,we conclude that patterson was not engaged in an inherently dangerous activity as a matter of law.nor do policy considerations favor application of the doctrine of assumption of risk.accordingly,the court erred in ruling that assumption of risk barred patterson negligence claims.
a.the district owed patterson a duty of care 
we begin by explaining more fully the legal basis for patterson claim of negligent supervision against the district.public entities such as the district are not liable for injury arising from negligence except as provided by statute,subd.a stockinger,supra,th at,d.two statutes define the scope of negligence liability in the context of this case.government code section,subdivision a expressly provides a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.section,subdivision a adds that,a public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.
public school districts enjoy certain immunities from actions for negligence.relevant to this case is education code section which reads 
notwithstanding any other provision of this code,no school district,city or county board of education,county superintendent of schools,or any officer or employee of such district or board shall be responsible or in any way liable for the conduct or safety of any pupil of the public schools at any time when such pupil is not on school property,unless such district,board,or person has undertaken to provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises,has undertaken a activity off the premises of such school,has otherwise specifically assumed such responsibility or liability or has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.in the event of such a specific undertaking,the district,board,or person shall be liable or responsible for the conduct or safety of any pupil only while such pupil is or should be under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board.
section mirrors the immunity provisions in section,the immunity statute applicable to community college districts together,and with specific exceptions,sections and immunize school districts and community college districts from liability arising from the activities of students of any age.one or both statutes apply in this case because the district operated its truck driver training course at the charles jones skills and business education center as an adult postsecondary educational and vocational school.
under sections and,an exception applies,a duty of care exists,and the school or community college district is subject to a student negligence claim if the district has undertaken a activity off the premises of such school and the student is or should be under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board.for purposes of sections and the identical section,a activity is one that requires attendance and for which attendance credit may be given wolfe dublin unified school dist.th,d.t he test is not really whether the student participation is voluntary or not,but whether the activity is part of the school curriculum.barnhart cabrillo community college th,d.
here,the evidence is undisputed that patterson was required to participate in the community service project,which involved loading the wooden bleachers onto the flat bed trailer.the goal of the community service project was to teach students how to load the trailers safely.based on this record,we conclude the community service project was a activity within the meaning of section and.
the second prong of the exception to the immunity provisions of sections and draws a line between activities requiring additional supervision and control over the students when they travel,and the multitude of activities for which liability can not be imposed.stockinger,supra,th at,d.and while those statutes indicate that school personnel may have a duty to supervise public school students,case law recognizes that the presumed maturity of college students warrants different treatment in terms of duty of supervision.id.at,d.we will assume that the same considerations apply to adult education students.
in crow state of california d.crow,we rejected an adult college student claim that the university was liable to him for negligently operating,maintaining and supervising the dormitory where he was beaten by a fellow student.in crow,we specifically found that the plaintiff affiliation with the university as a student did not create a special relationship imposing a duty of care on the university.unlike high school students,whose attendance is compelled and over whom school officials have direct responsibility while the students are at school,adult college students attend school and participate in school activities voluntarily.ochoa california state university,sacramento th,d ochoa,overruled in part on another ground in avila,supra,cal th at,fn,d,and citing crow,supra,d at.here,in contrast,plaintiff was an adult college student voluntarily participating in drinking beer at the dormitory.crow,supra,at.
in ochoa,we held that the university owed no duty to protect a student from criminal assault by an opposing player in an intramural soccer game under the circumstances of that case.ochoa,supra,th at,d.we expressly rejected the student claim that the university created a special relationship and duty to supervise by organizing and sponsoring the intramural activity.id.at,d.
finally,in stockinger,we concluded that the section immunity applied to shield the public community college from liability for injuries plaintiff suffered when she was thrown from the back of a pickup truck while traveling on an assignment for a course on planning pack trips.plaintiff rode unrestrained in the open bed of the truck knowing that it was dangerous to do so.stockinger,supra,th at,d.although we assumed for purposes of the appeal that the assignment was a activity,we applied the classic duty analysis and rejected plaintiff claim that she was or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board for the assignment.accord,stockinger,supra,at,d.specifically,we found that although it was arguable that the harm to plaintiff was foreseeable,the connection between defendants alleged conduct negligent failure to ensure safe travel and plaintiff harm was not particularly close,nor was defendants conduct morally blameworthy,given that the students were college students training to assume leadership roles in pack trips,and plaintiff admitted she did not need to be told by the instructor that her actions were dangerous.it is unclear how the policy of preventing future harm would be fostered by finding liability in this case.the extent of the burden on defendants,created by a requirement that it protect every college student from reckless driving by fellow students during performance of what amounts to homework assignments,would be extraordinary,as would be the likely increase in the college district insurance premiums.citation.stockinger,supra,at,d.
although crow,ochoa and stockinger demonstrate that the school and community college districts did not owe a duty to supervise their adult students in the circumstances of those cases,they do not hold that school or community college districts never owe a duty of care to their adult students.see also avila,supra,cal th at,fn,d,disapproving ochoa to the extent it suggests always immunizes universities against liability for injuries sustained by their adult.here,the instructors expressly and properly undertook supervision of the community service project.the classroom part of the district truck driver training course covered general principles of freight loading,but did not address the specifics of how to load flat bed trucks or trailers.the specific goal of the community service assignment was to teach students how to load the trailers safely.consequently,the instructors typically critiqued the students after they loaded the cargo.indeed,it appears to have been important to the success of the community service project that the instructors be present to share their experience and expertise with the students.the record clearly demonstrates that patterson was or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board within the meaning of sections and.accordingly,the district is not immune from suit for negligence.
the factors set forth in rowland christian support our conclusion that a duty of care should be imposed on the district in the circumstances of this case.rowland christian,supra,cal d at.the harm to patterson was foreseeable given the size and weight of the wooden bleachers,the height of the flat bed trailer,and the teachers presumption that the students lacked experience in loading flat bed trailers.it is undisputed that patterson suffered injury when he fell backwards off the trailer during the loading of the bleachers onto the flat bed trailer.there was also a direct connection between the instructor absence from the loading of the bleachers at the second location and the injury patterson suffered.the community service project provided patterson and the other students with experience on how to load the flat bed trailer safely.although the loading of cargo involved common sense,the instructors presumed that students lacked prior experience.they routinely instructed and critiqued students at the loading site.while no moral blame attaches to the alleged negligence in this case,holding the district liable would help prevent future harm by ensuring that the instructors were on site to supervise the community service projects.any increased burden of providing supervision for future community service projects was minimal because the instructors were already tasked with teaching the hands on segment of the class and had already provided the students with some level of instruction,supervision and critique.finally,we assume that the district already carries liability insurance and is in the best position to ensure against the risk created by lack of supervision in these circumstances.
the conclusion that the district owed patterson a duty of care leaves a triable issue whether the district breached that duty of care.on the day of the incident,allen was responsible for instructing patterson and the other students on how to load the bleachers on the flat bed trailer.he was unaware of how much prior training or experience that patterson and the other students had in loading trailers.allen was present when the students picked up and easily loaded the aluminum bleachers at their first stop,but directed them to pick up the bleachers at the second stop on their own.allen had not inspected the wooden bleachers before assigning the students to pick them up in his absence.whether the district breached its duty of care is a question for the at trial.
primary and secondary assumption of risk 
in knight,the supreme court reconciled the doctrine of assumption of risk,which completely bars a plaintiff recovery in a negligence action,with comparative negligence principles announced in li yellow cab cal d,li knight,supra,cal th at,d.the discussion in knight provides the necessary background for our decision that assumption of risk does not apply in this case.we quote knight at length.
in li,our court undertook a basic reexamination of the common law doctrine of contributory negligence.as li noted,contributory negligence generally has been defined as conduct on the part of the plaintiff which falls below the standard to which he should conform for his own protection,and which is a legally contributing cause cooperating with the negligence of the defendant in bringing about the plaintiff harm.li,supra,cal d at,quoting rest d torts.prior to li,the common law rule was that e xcept where the defendant has the last clear chance,the plaintiff contributory negligence bars recovery against a defendant whose negligent conduct would otherwise make him liable to the plaintiff for the harm sustained by him.li,supra,at,italics added,quoting rest d torts.
in li,supra,cal d,we observed that i t is unnecessary for us to catalogue the enormous amount of critical comment that has been directed over the years against the approach of the doctrine of contributory negligence.the essence of that criticism has been constant and clear the doctrine is inequitable in its operation because it fails to distribute responsibility in proportion to fault the basic objection to the in the primal concept that in a system in which liability is based on fault,the extent of fault should govern the extent of irresistible to reason and all intelligent notions of fairness.at,italics added.after taking additional note of the untoward practical consequences of the doctrine in the litigation of cases and the increasing rejection of the doctrine in other jurisdictions,the li court concluded that w e are likewise persuaded that logic,practical experience,and fundamental justice counsel against the retention of the doctrine rendering contributory negligence a complete bar to that it should be replaced in this state by a system under which liability for damage will be borne by those whose negligence caused it in direct proportion to their respective fault.at.
after determining that the contributory negligence doctrine should be replaced by a system of comparative negligence,the li court went on to undertake a rather extensive discussion of the effect that the adoption of comparative negligence would have on a number of related tort doctrines,including the doctrines of last clear chance and assumption of risk.li,supra,cal d at.
with respect to the effect of the adoption of comparative negligence on the assumption of risk issue before the knight court the li decision,supra,cal d,stated as follows as for assumption of risk,we have recognized in this state that this defense overlaps that of contributory negligence to some extent and in fact is made up of at least two distinct defenses.to simplify greatly,it has been observed that in one kind of situation,to wit,where a plaintiff unreasonably undertakes to encounter a specific known risk imposed by a defendant negligence,plaintiff conduct,although he may encounter that risk in a prudent manner,is in reality a form of contributory negligence other kinds of situations within the doctrine of assumption of risk are those,for example,where plaintiff is held to agree to relieve defendant of an obligation of reasonable conduct toward him.such a situation would not involve contributory negligence,but rather a reduction of defendant duty of care.citations.we think it clear that the adoption of a system of comparative negligence should entail the merger of the defense of assumption of risk into the general scheme of assessment of liability in proportion to fault in those particular cases in which the form of assumption of risk involved is no more than a variant of contributory negligence.citation.li,supra,cal d at,original italics.
as this passage indicates,the li decision,supra,cal d,clearly contemplated that the assumption of risk doctrine was to be partially merged or subsumed into the comparative negligence scheme.subsequent court of appeal decisions have disagreed,however,in interpreting li,as to what category of assumption of risk cases would be merged into the comparative negligence scheme.
a number of appellate decisions,focusing on the language in li indicating that assumption of risk is in reality a form of contributory negligence where a plaintiff unreasonably undertakes to encounter a specific known risk imposed by a defendant negligence cal d at,have concluded that li properly should be interpreted as drawing a distinction between those assumption of risk cases in which a plaintiff unreasonably encounters a known risk imposed by a defendant negligence and those assumption of risk cases in which a plaintiff reasonably encounters a known risk imposed by a defendant negligence.see,ordway superior court d.
in our view,these whether they reached the correct result on the facts at misinterpreted li by suggesting that our decision contemplated less favorable legal treatment for a plaintiff who reasonably encounters a known risk than for a plaintiff who unreasonably encounters such a risk 
indeed,particularly when the relevant passage in li,supra,cal d at pages,is read as a whole and in conjunction with the authorities it cites,we believe it becomes clear that the distinction in assumption of risk cases to which the li court referred in this passage was not a distinction between instances in which a plaintiff unreasonably encounters a known risk imposed by a defendant negligence and instances in which a plaintiff reasonably encounters such a risk.rather,the distinction to which the li court referred was between those instances in which the assumption of risk doctrine embodies a legal conclusion that there is no duty on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from a particular category of assumption of risk that the legal commentators generally refer to as primary assumption of risk and those instances in which the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff but the plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk of injury caused by the defendant breach of that most commentators have termed secondary assumption of risk.properly interpreted,the relevant passage in li provides that the category of assumption of risk cases that is not merged into the comparative negligence system and in which the plaintiff recovery continues to be completely barred involves those cases in which the defendant conduct did not breach a legal duty of care to the plaintiff,primary assumption of risk cases,whereas cases involving secondary assumption of risk properly are merged into the comprehensive comparative fault system adopted in li.
although the difference between the primary assumption of risk secondary assumption of risk nomenclature and the reasonable implied assumption of risk unreasonable implied assumption of risk terminology embraced in many of the recent court of appeal decisions may appear at first blush to be only semantic,the significance extends beyond mere rhetoric.first,in primary assumption of risk the defendant owes no duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk of plaintiff who has suffered such harm is not entitled to recover from the defendant,whether the plaintiff conduct in undertaking the activity was reasonable or unreasonable.second,in secondary assumption of risk instances in which the defendant has breached the duty of care owed to the defendant is not entitled to be entirely relieved of liability for an injury proximately caused by such breach,simply because the plaintiff conduct in encountering the risk of such an injury was reasonable rather than unreasonable.third and finally,the question whether the defendant owed a legal duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk of harm does not turn on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the plaintiff conduct,but rather on the nature of the activity or sport in which the defendant is engaged and the relationship of the defendant and the plaintiff to that activity or sport.for these reasons,use of the reasonable implied assumption of risk unreasonable implied assumption of risk terminology,as a means of differentiating between the cases in which a plaintiff is barred from bringing an action and those in which he or she is not barred,is more misleading than helpful.knight,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
in our view,the case before us involves classic secondary assumption of the district owed a duty of care but,at most,patterson may have unreasonably encountered the risk of climbing onto the flat bed truck to load the wooden bleachers.as we shall explain,the record and the policy reasons underlying primary assumption of risk demonstrate that the doctrine should not be applied in the circumstances of this case.accordingly,patterson negligence claim survives the district motion for summary judgment.
assumption of risk does not trump the district duty 
the supreme court observed in knight that,the phrase assumption of risk traditionally has been used in a number of very different factual settings involving analytically distinct legal concepts.knight,supra,cal th at,d.two different species of assumption of risk are candidates for application in the case before us.one type of assumption of risk arose in the context of active sports and evolved to include similar activities in the school and employment setting.the other type of assumption of risk,more commonly known as the firefighter rule,arose and developed in the context of the public service professions.as we shall explain,neither species of assumption of risk applies here.
the firefighter rule 
the firefighter rule is a variation on the doctrine of primary assumption of risk based on different policy concerns than those found in the sports context.in its most classic form,the firefighter rule involves the question whether a person who negligently has started a fire is liable for an injury sustained by a firefighter who is summoned to fight the fire the rule provides that the person who started the fire is not liable under such circumstances.citation.although a number of theories have been cited to support this conclusion,the most persuasive explanation is that the party who negligently started the fire had no legal duty to protect the firefighter from the very danger that the firefighter is employed to confront.citations.knight,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also,priebe nelson cal th,d,employee of boarding kennel calatayud state of california cal th,d,police officer calatayud.
in calatayud,the supreme court discussed the policies underlying the firefighter rule.first,in terms of duty,it may be said there is none owed the fireman to exercise care so as not to require the special services for which he is trained and paid.citations.calatayud,supra,cal t
