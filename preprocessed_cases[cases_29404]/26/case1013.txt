anna hood and her parents hereinafter appellants or the hoods brought this claim alleging that the encinitas union school district hereinafter appellee or the school district violated the individuals with disabilities education act idea,by refusing to provide anna with special education services.this claim seeks reimbursement for private school education that the hoods obtained for anna after withdrawing her from the public school system.a california special education hearing officer denied the hoods relief,and the district court affirmed.
on appeal,the hoods offer two grounds under which anna should be categorized as a child with a disability per and is therefore entitled to special education.first,they assert that anna has a specific learning disability because she exhibits a severe discrepancy between her achievement and intellectual ability in one or more of the academic areas enumerated in cal,as calculated per the formula provided in regs.tit,j a,and the discrepancy can not be corrected through other regular or categorical services offered within the regular instructional program.second,they assert that anna has other health impairments under a and regs.tit,f.the hoods argue that anna,by reason of either her specific learning disability or her other health impairments,needs special education and related services.they seek to obtain reimbursement for the expenses they incurred for private school education,which the hoods commenced during anna fifth grade school year following the school district determination that anna was ineligible for special education,as well as recoupment of fees and costs related to this action.
after reviewing the evidence before the hearing officer and additional evidence submitted to the district court,we find that the district court acceptance of the hearing officer determination that anna was not legally entitled to receive special education was not in clear error.as a result,we affirm.
background 
at the time the california special education hearing officer issued a decision,anna hood was years old and,according to her report cards,was performing at or above average levels in the public school classroom while anna second,third,fourth,and fifth grade reports chronicle her consistent difficulties completing tasks,turning in homework on time,and keeping her belongings organized,anna scores on the stanford achievement test have placed her above the fiftieth percentile with near uniformity.
meanwhile,anna performance on various intelligence tests indicates high intellectual ability.anna scores on the test of,administered by resource specialist patricia hotz,measured anna achievement in eleven different areas,and in all but one area,anna scores were average or better.one writing sample was in the very superior range,eight were in the high average range,one reading fluency was in the average range,and one math fluency was in the low average range.she received a wechsler intelligence scale for verbal score of,performance score of,and full scale score of,as reported by school psychologist susan jordan.anna consulting neuropsychologist nancy markel administered the comprehensive test of nonverbal intelligence,which produced a geometric score of,a pictorial score of,and a nonverbal score of.these scores place her ability above average.
anna has been the subject of a number of medical assessments.she was born following a difficult pregnancy and has a significant medical history,which includes multiple ear infections that required tube placement,as well as farsightedness and strabismus.in january,joseph gleeson,a pediatric neurologist,upon reviewing the results of a previously administered electroencephalogram,interpreted anna condition as consistent with a possible seizure disorder and prescribed medication accordingly.his letter also noted a significant family history of seizures.after examining anna,gleeson suspected that anna had the same condition as her older brother,though he expressed that it was not entirely clear that anna was having seizures.gleeson viewed such a seizure disorder as an explanation of anna apparent spells of distractibility and tendency to miss things that had happened.
after a subsequent visit with anna in april,gleeson stated unequivocally that anna had an eeg that had significant abnormalities consistent with epilepsy and observed that anna suffered from increasing distractibility and difficulty staying on task that appeared to come in spells.he recommended that anna be evaluated for a possible attention deficit disorder because of her reported difficulties staying on task and her increased distractibility.anna eventually began taking medication for the attention problem.
prompted by the receipt of gleeson initial report,the school district instituted an accommodation plan in accordance with section of the rehabilitation act of,in february the plan included preferential seating in the classroom,use of a graphic organizer and alphasmart keyboard,directions,visual support for instruction and concepts,frequent prompts and checks for understanding,and daily teacher checks for homework assignments.
on may,anna advocate,sara frampton,wrote to the district to request a special education evaluation.in this letter,frampton acknowledged that anna ha d recently been offered a plan but expressed her concern that the plan had not been based on a thorough assessment in all areas of potential or suspected disability.the district assessment,performed by resource specialist patricia hotz and school psychologist susan jordan in august and september,included a battery of tests and classroom observations.jordan and hotz ultimately issued a report explicitly stating that anna has been diagnosed with a seizure disorder for which she takes medication and anna seizure disorder adversely affects her ability to focus and pay attention in the regular classroom.however,jordan and hotz concluded that b ased on state and federal guidelines,anna does not qualify for special education services at this time,as she is performing at least in the average range academically,both in the classroom and in testing.additionally,the report noted anna eligibility for a section accommodation plan to assist anna functioning in the regular classroom and advised that the iep team consider all information when determining eligibility,class placement,and goals for anna.
on october,jordan and hotz convened with anna general education teacher,advocate,and mother for an iep meeting.the school district determined that anna did not qualify for special education services,specifically concluding that anna does not have a learning disability.
in december,the school district reevaluated the section plan in place and determined that it should be continued,changing it only to add an accommodation addressing anna mother concern about her daughter.dissatisfied with the school district provision of services,anna parents withdrew their daughter from the school district in february,enrolled her in the winston school,a private school for children with learning differences,and appealed to the california special education hearing office,seeking to recover the amounts expended for tuition and assessments 
procedural history 
on february,a hearing commenced before an officer of the california special education hearing office.there,the officer placed the burden of proving compliance with idea on the school district.seattle sch,cir.after presiding over four days of the presentation of oral and documentary evidence,the hearing officer was persuaded that anna impairments did not necessitate special education or related services.the officer determined that the school district did not violate idea and denied reimbursement to anna parents for their child private placement.the hearing officer found that,in general,the results of anna testing did not reveal a discrepancy equal to or greater than standard deviations,the regulatory measure of a discrepancy that is severe.see regs.tit,j a.while he did find that a particular math fluency score might support the finding of a severe discrepancy,he dismissed the issue based on section j a instructions that no single score or product of scores shall be used as the sole criterion and that a discrepancy may only be considered a severe discrepancy when it is corroborated by other assessment data.ultimately,the hearing officer concluded that the totality of the evidence,including anna work samples,scores from other tests,and classroom observations,provided a reasonable basis for the school district to determine that anna specific learning disability did not require special education.the hearing officer also found that anna did not have any other health impairments to potentially qualify her for special education services under a,concluding that anna evidence of seizure disorder or attention deficit disorder did not bring her under the auspices of the statute.while the officer noted that anna exhibited difficulty organizing and focusing on her work,he expressed that i t was not clear from the evidence whether anna difficulties with attention and organization were due to the seizure disorder,an attention deficit disorder,or something else.additionally,he felt he could not conclude whether the seizure disorder attention deficit disorder actually caused anna to have limited strength,vitality or alertness,as required by regulation.see regs.tit,f.based on these deficiencies,the hearing officer determined that the district had met its burden of proving idea compliance because the evidence did not establish that anna met the eligibility criteria for possessing any other health impairments,and accordingly,he denied relief.
pursuant to i,the hoods sought to enforce their idea rights in federal court.the burden of proof in the district court rested with the hoods as the party challenging the administrative decision.clyde puyallup sch,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,individuals with disabilities in education act,stat,as recognized in fed.way sch,cir.the district court upheld the california special education hearing office decision that the school district refusal to afford anna special education did not violate the law.the court based its decision on the conclusion that the hoods had not shown that anna discrepancy could not be corrected through other regular or categorical services offered within the regular instructional program,rejecting the hoods argument that the hearing officer employed the incorrect standard to determine whether the discrepancy could be corrected.see cal.c.it found that the hearing officer explicitly cited section c and stated that he was not convinced that the discrepancies could not be corrected through the services offered within the regular instruction program.in deciding the issue of the specific learning disability on those grounds,the court refrained from determining whether anna exhibited a discrepancy between her ability and performance that rose to the level of severe under the calculations prescribed in j a and accepted appellee assertion that anna learning disability could be addressed with modifications to the regular classroom programming.
the district court also approved of the hearing officer conclusion that the hoods had not shown that anna discrepancy,even if severe,was beyond correction in the normal classroom.the district court emphasized that the language of the statute necessitates measurement of the discrepancy between ability and achievement over time,and thus an isolated assessment of the difference between anna ability and achievement could not suffice.
the district court also rejected the argument that anna experienced some other health impairment that would qualify her for special education under a.it explained that the hearing officer conclusion that anna was not eligible under the other health impairments provision was supported by record evidence and the testimony of witnesses.

discussion 
specific learning disability 
upon review of the record,hearing officer opinion,and appellate briefs,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that anna was not legally entitled to special education based on a specific learning disability.idea provides qualified disabled children with access to a free appropriate public education that includes an individualized education program tailored to the child unique needs section defines,in relevant part,a child with a disability to include a child i with other health impairments,or specific learning disabilities and ii who,by reason thereof,needs special education and related services.section of the california education code clarifies specific learning disability as follows 
a pupil shall be assessed as having a specific learning disability which makes him or her eligible for special education and related services when it is determined that all the following exist 
a a severe discrepancy exists between the intellectual ability and achievements in one or more of the following academic areas 
oral expression.
learning comprehension.
written expression.
basic reading skills.
reading comprehension.
mathematics calculation.
mathematics reasoning.
b the discrepancy is due to a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes and is not the result of environmental,cultural,or economic disadvantages.
c the discrepancy can not be corrected through other regular or categorical services offered within the regular instructional program.
title,section j a of the california code of regulations provides the calculation relevant for determining whether a discrepancy is severe 
when standardized tests are considered to be valid for a specific pupil,a severe discrepancy is demonstrated by first,converting into common standard scores,using a mean of and standard deviation of,the achievement test score and the ability test score to be compared second,computing the difference between these common standard scores and third,comparing this computed difference to the standard criterion which is the product of multiplied by the standard deviation of the distribution of computed differences of students taking these achievement and ability tests.a computed difference which equals or exceeds the standard criterion,adjusted by one standard error of measurement,the adjustment not to exceed common standard score points,indicates a severe discrepancy 
however,section j a avoids total reliance on a mathematical calculation by immediately adding to the above passage that the calculation indicates a severe discrepancy only when such discrepancy is corroborated by other assessment data which may include other tests,scales,instruments,observations and work samples,as appropriate.
the federal district court,the hearing officer,and the school district itself each based its decision regarding the severity of the discrepancy on factors other than the section calculation.the district court expressly stated that f ortunately for this court,this court need not attempt to assess the accuracy of either side j calculation because both sides ultimately focus on the last part of the test,that is,whether the discrepancy could be corrected in the general classroom.the hearing officer examined the correctability issue and also looked to the need for corroborating evidence to support the raw mathematical data.according to the hearing officer opinion,the school district denial of anna eligibility for special education was justified because anna overall performance,including classroom achievement,grades and testing,not only failed to provide the necessary corroboration,but also demonstrated that she did not require special education.
the school district appellate brief takes issue with aspects of the calculation,essentially arguing that the appellants oversimplified the regulation prescribed computation by failing to consider the degree to which students scores generally differ between the ability and achievement tests employed,that is,the success of the intelligence test at predicting actual performance.however,because the school district asserted agreement at oral argument that anna scores satisfied the mathematical standard for a severe discrepancy,we will interpret their argument to concede this issue.
we need not consider whether anna satisfies the calculation.our decision hinges upon appellants failure to satisfy the second requirement of the specific learning disability qualification for special education eligibility,that being whether any existing severe discrepancy between ability and achievement could not be corrected through other regular or categorical services offered within the regular instructional program.cal.thus,even assuming the existence of a severe discrepancy,the law does not entitle anna hood to special education if we find that her discrepancy can be corrected in the regular classroom.
the hoods argue that the hearing officer employed the wrong standard for assessing correctability and claim that the district court language to justify a conclusion that he applied the correct legal standard.on appeal,the hoods cite district court cases from other circuits to argue that the ability to pass from grade to grade,or progress in the general curriculum,or exhibit average performance relative to peers is not sufficient to render a child ineligible for idea benefits.but these cases do not address california correctability prong and thus offer limited guidance regarding whether a student severe discrepancy is correctable in the regular classroom environment.moreover,even the cases the hoods cite permit districts to consider a student relative performance as one factor in an eligibility inquiry.see,corchado bd.of educ.rochester city sch,d.however,the hoods brief offers no case law in support of the standard that it proposes for judging correctability,that is,whether instruction offered in the general classroom will narrow the mathematical discrepancy between the student own achievement and intellectual potential.
classic idea jurisprudence and administrative decisions prove useful when contemplating the standard appropriate to assess correctability and factors informative to the determination of whether the standard is satisfied.for example,in rowley,the paradigm idea case,the supreme court determined that the state satisfies the requirement to provide a handicapped child with a free appropriate public education by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.rowley,at.emphasis added.while it is true that the rowley case dealt with the level of services that must be provided to a student already deemed eligible for special education,rather than special education eligibility itself,the ninth circuit ha s applied the rowley framework in numerous cases.van duyn baker sch.dist,cir.this court has emphasized that states are obligated to provide a basic floor of opportunity through a program individually designed to provide educational benefit to a handicapped child,rather than education.ash lake oswego sch,cir citing gregory,at.the supreme court explicitly stated in rowley that idea does not contain a requirement that the services so provided be sufficient to maximize each child potential commensurate with the opportunity provided other children.rowley,at.internal quotations omitted.just as courts look to the ability of a disabled child to benefit from the services provided to determine if that child is receiving an adequate special education,it is appropriate for courts to determine if a child classified as is receiving adequate accommodations in the general thus is not entitled to special education the benefit standard.accordingly,the district court used the correct standard of review when it considered the benefit anna received in the regular classroom as part of its eligibility analysis.
the supreme court in rowley elaborated that if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system,an iep should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.id.at.the court was careful to provide in a footnote that it did not intend to suggest that advancement from grade to grade was always dispositive.id.at.however,in the case before it,the court found the child academic progress,when considered with the special services and professional consideration accorded by the school administrators,to be dispositive.id.
california special education hearing office opinions also indicate the importance of grades and educators assessments when determining whether a child with a severe discrepancy between his ability and achievement is reaping some educational benefit in the general classroom.the hearing officer in student sunnyvale elementary school district examined as evidence passing or average grades earned without the benefit of special education and gave credence to the opinion the resource specialist and school psychologist provided that any weakness that the child exhibited could be corrected within the regular education program.student sunnyvale elementary sch.dist.sn.similarly,in student long beach unified school district,the hearing officer considered the testimony of teachers and looked at the student ability to continue maintaining grades sufficient to remain enrolled in an accelerated program as indicative of his ability to benefit from education in the regular classroom.student long beach unified sch.dist.sn.
application of this benefit standard to the facts presented in this case indicates that anna does not qualify for special education due to a specific learning disability because any existing severe discrepancy between ability and achievement appears correctable in the regular classroom.as the hearing officer noted,i t is virtually undisputed in this case that anna has been progressing in the general curriculum along with her peers.she received nearly uniformly average or above average grades.at the hearing,michelle dennis,anna fourth grade teacher,testified that anna was a highly proficient student.according to the hearing officer,dennis was adamant that she would not have considered referring anna for special education because she was working at or above grade level.sidney sickels,anna teacher for approximately a month immediately preceding her withdrawal from the school district,testified that anna was capable of producing work at grade level and that he did not believe that anna needed to be referred to special education.dennis rota,anna fifth grade science teacher,agreed.beverly barrett,director of pupil personnel services for the school district,testified that the iep team did not feel that anna conditions had a significant impact on her performance necessitating special education,as she was not performing below grade level.according to this evidence,it appears that the hearing officer was justified in concluding that anna is receiving the requisite benefit from her education such that the school district is in compliance with the law.
the school district acknowledges in its brief that there will always be some private school that can at great education that is better than the education that can be provided by some other less expensive private school,or perhaps the public school.school districts must function within budgetary constraints that are often quite burdensome.in essence,the hoods assert that the law guarantees a child of superior ability enough individ
