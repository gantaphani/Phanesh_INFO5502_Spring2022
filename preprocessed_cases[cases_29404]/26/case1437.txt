introduction 
if a local public entity desires to issue a bond to be repaid by taxes on real property it must generally obtain approval of of its voters.cal.const.art.xiiia,subd.b.proposition reduced the approval requirement to percent for bonds issued by school districts,community college districts,and county offices of education to pay for certain types of projects.the percent approval applies only if the bond proposition submitted to the voters meets the accountability requirements specified by proposition,as approved by voters,art.xiiia,subd.b.
on june,voters in foothill community college district district approved a school bond proposition measure c by a vote of percent.the district promptly filed an action to validate its resolutions implementing the measure.code civ,et defendants melvin emerich and aaron katz opposed the district action,arguing that measure c did not meet the proposition requirements for approval by percent of the voters.since the measure had fallen short of a vote,defendants maintained that it had not been approved.katz also argued that the voting scheme,which excluded nonresident property owners from voting on the measure,was unconstitutional,amend.xiv,cal,art.i,subd.a.the trial court rejected both arguments and validated the measure.we shall affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
on february,the district governing board passed a resolution calling for an election to approve the issuance of up to million in general obligation bonds.the bonds were to be repaid by a new ad valorem tax levied upon all nonexempt real property within the district geographical boundaries.the registrar of voters labeled the bond proposal measure c.the full text of the measure was included in the sample ballot and voter information pamphlet mailed to all registered voters in the district prior to the election.
on june,the day after measure c was approved by percent of voters,the district passed resolutions calling for the issuance of million in bonds.on the same day,the district filed this action to validate the issuance of the bonds called for in the resolutions.
defendants emerich and katz answered and filed.both defendants claimed that measure c did not include the accountability provisions required by proposition.katz also alleged that the election scheme,which enfranchised only natural persons who resided within the district geographical boundaries,was unconstitutional as applied to him,a nonresident who would be indirectly liable for any new taxes approved by the vote 
the trial court rejected katz constitutional arguments,concluding that neilson city of california city th,d neilson,was dispositive.the court also concluded that,although measure c did not set forth proposition accountability provisions verbatim,the information it did supply was sufficient.the court entered judgment for the district,validating measure c and the district related resolutions,and awarding costs to the district of.both defendants have appealed.
iii.issues 
did measure c meet the requirements of proposition such that only a percent vote was required for its approval 
was the district voting scheme,which enfranchised only natural persons residing within the district geographical boundaries,a violation of equal protection principles 
did the trial court err in awarding costs to the district in light of code of civil procedure section hereafter section,which provides that a summons in a validation action must include a notice stating that persons who contest the validity of a matter will not be subject to punitive action 
iv.discussion 
measure c included all of proposition accountability.standard of review 
defendants first argue that measure c did not include the accountability requirements mandated by proposition.the pertinent facts are not in dispute.there is no question about the contents of the bond proposal that was set forth as the full text ballot measure and submitted to the voters along with a sample ballot in the voter information pamphlet.our task is to determine whether the bond proposal met the requirements of proposition.thus,our review involves only a question of law on which we are not bound by the trial court analysis.lazar hertz th,d.
to the extent our review requires interpretation of proposition or the related statutory provisions,we are guided by settled principles.in interpreting a voter initiative,we apply the same principles that govern our construction of a statute.citation.we turn first to the statutory language,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.if the statutory language is not ambiguous,then the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if,however,the statutory language lacks clarity,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet,and the ostensible objects to be achieved.people lopez cal th,d.
constitutional and statutory requirements 
the usual method of funding new school construction in california has been for school districts to obtain voter approval for the issuance of general obligation bonds the bonds are repaid by an annual levy of an ad valorem tax on real and certain personal property located within the area of the district.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d.prior to november,article xiiia,section provided that taxes or special assessments levied to pay the interest and redemption charges on any bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property must be approved by of the voters voting on the proposition.proposition,passed by the voters in,amended article xiiia,section,reducing the required approval to percent when the indebtedness was to be incurred by a school district,community college,or county office of education for the construction,reconstruction,rehabilitation,or replacement of school facilities,as approved by voters,art.xiiia,subd.b.the percent standard applies only if the proposition approved by the voters and resulting in the bonded indebtedness includes all of the following accountability requirements 
a a requirement that the proceeds from the sale of the bonds be used only for the purposes specified in article xiii a,section b,and not for any other purpose,including teacher and administrator salaries and other school operating expenses.
b a list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded and certification that the school district board,community college board,or county office of education has evaluated safety,class size reduction,and information technology needs in developing that list.
c a requirement that the school district board,community college board,or county office of education conduct an annual,independent performance audit to ensure that the funds have been expended only on the specific projects listed.
d a requirement that the school district board,community college board,or county office of education conduct an annual,independent financial audit of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds until all of those proceeds have been expended for the school facilities projects.art.xiiia,subd.b.
education code sections through implement the initiative.education code section provides in addition to the ballot requirements of section for bond measures pursuant to this chapter,the ballot shall also be printed with a statement that the board will appoint a citizens oversight committee and conduct annual independent audits to assure that funds are spent only on school and classroom improvements and for no other purposes.education code section is a global savings provision no error,irregularity,or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the taxpayers within the district or the electors voting at any election at which bonds of any district are authorized to be issued shall invalidate the election or any bonds authorized.
the ballot 
a sample ballot and voter information pamphlet was mailed to all eligible voters prior to the election.the ballot itself contained the following information 
anza college training measure to foothill and de anza colleges,improve job transfer,
upgrade electrical,heating,ventilation systems,safety,
repair leaky roofs,
improve disabled access,
classrooms for,
upgrade technology,
repair,construct,acquire,equip buildings,classrooms,libraries,sites,labs,shall the district issue million in bonds,at legal rates,with mandatory audits,citizen oversight and no money for administrators salaries 
the full text ballot measure 
the full text of measure c,set forth in the voter information pamphlet,included the language that appeared on the ballot and also a lengthy description of the projects for which the bond revenue would be used in pertinent part,the measure stated 
the board of trustees of the district,to be responsive to the needs of students and the community,evaluated the district urgent and critical facility needs,including facility maintenance,safety issues,class offerings,energy cost reduction and information and computer technology,in developing the scope of projects to be funded,as outlined in facilities master plan,the information technology strategic plan and the renovation master plan,as shall be amended from time to time the board conducted facilities evaluations and received public input and review in developing the scope of college facility projects to be funded,as listed in the foregoing planning documents 
the facilities master plan,the information technology strategic plan and the renovation master plan are on file and available for review at the district chancellor office among other locations.italics added.
the text describes the projects planned for foothill and de anza colleges and for the district as a whole.the foothill college projects are divided into six categories upgrade,maintain,equip,replace obsolete classrooms,science and computer labs,library,instructional facilities,sites and utilities meet demands of changing workforce improve disabled access,upgrade technology,repair,replace and upgrade electrical and mechanical systems to reduce energy consumption and utility bills and accommodate computer technology,internet access and communications systems,install solar panels to reduce energy consumption and utility bills,improve safety and disabled access remove asbestos,expand classroom and facility capacity,construct science center,upgrade for nursing and emergency medical services,and improve emergency access and evacuation routes.
except for the third category on the list,each category is followed by a paragraph further explaining the projects contemplated.the explanation attached to the first category is typical.this category of projects would provide computer technology capability for students,repair,build,upgrade replace leaky roofs,decaying walls,old ceiling tiles and flooring wire classrooms for computers and other technology,increase energy efficiency,acquire equipment,increase safety,reduce fire hazards with alarms,smoke detectors,fire safety doors and sprinklers.the de anza and project descriptions are similar.
following the list of projects is this paragraph 
fiscal accountability.the expenditure of bond money on these projects is subject to stringent financial accountability requirements.by law,performance and financial audits will be performed annually,and all bond expenditures will be monitored by an independent citizens oversight committee to ensure that funds are spent as promised and as specified capitalization and bold type omitted.
board certification,performance and financial audits 
in order to qualify as a proposition school bond measure,the bond proposition must include a certification that the district board has evaluated safety,class size reduction,and information technology needs in developing its list of projects.art.xiiia,b b.defendants argue that measure c omitted this certification.not so.the district proposition clearly states that the district board evaluated the district facility needs,including facility maintenance,safety issues,class offerings,energy cost reduction and information and computer technology in deciding upon the scope of the projects to be funded.defendants do not describe what they claim was omitted.accordingly,we reject the argument.
proposition also demands that a school bond proposal include the requirement that the district conduct an annual,independent performance audit and an annual,independent financial audit.art.xiiia,b c,d.defendants claim the measure c omitted these requirements.again,we disagree.the proposition meets the constitutional requirements in that it states by law,performance and financial audits will be performed annually.true,the statement does not say who will perform the audits,but the constitution does not require the district to identify the auditor.it is also true that the statement does not say that the audits will be independent.this omission is insubstantial.the word audit connotes an independent inspection.see,concise oxford english dict.ed,which defines audit as an official inspection of an organization accounts,typically by an independent body.
list of projects 
a large part of defendants appeal is directed toward the list of projects the bond proceeds are intended to fund.defendants claim that list of projects included in the full text ballot proposition merely sets forth categories of projects and is not specific enough to meet the requirements of proposition.we must first decide what level of specificity proposition requires.
the plain language of the constitutional provision added by proposition is that the bond proposal must contain,a list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded and certification that the school district board has evaluated safety,class size reduction,and information technology needs in developing that list.since this language sheds no light on just how specific proposition expects the list to be,we turn to the publisher historical note for article xiii a,section,which contain the purpose and intent of the proposition ballot initiative.
the overall purpose of the initiative was to prepare our children for the century,to implement class size reduction,to ensure that our children learn in a secure and safe environment,and to ensure that school districts are accountable for prudent and responsible spending for school facilities note,deering ann.cal.const.supp.foll.art.xiii a,see art.xii a.the initiative was to accomplish the first three of these purposes by allowing for a less than approval of bond measures to fund school projects.the type of projects the initiative was intended to encourage is revealed by its requirement that school district evaluate safety,class size reduction,and information technology needs in developing the list of projects to present to the voters for approval.the accountability goal is achieved by requiring that,before they vote,voters will be given a list of specific projects their bond money will be used for,and by requiring annual,independent financial and performance audits.id.at subds.a d.in other words,the initiative was intended to make it easier to pass school bonds,the proceeds of which would be used to upgrade school facilities,reduce class size,and improve safety,and to ensure that district boards actually spent the bond proceeds on the projects the voters approved.that means that the list of projects submitted to the voters must be specific enough that the voters know what it is they are voting for and the auditors know how to evaluate the district performance.as the trial court summarized so articulately,the critical factor in assessing whether the project list complied with proposition is whether it allows for meaningful approval and oversight of the bond expenditures thus,if the list defines or identifies the projects in a manner that clearly apprises the voters,the auditors,and the public oversight committees of the types of projects for which the money is intended to be used,that is sufficient.
the list of projects set forth in measure c clearly identifies the types of projects to be funded.for example,it is clear that among the projects to be funded are repair or replacement of leaky roofs,wiring classrooms for computers and other technology,and installation of fire safety doors and sprinklers.this is sufficiently specific for meaningful approval and oversight.defendants urge a level of specificity that is impractical and unnecessary.surely it is unnecessary to inform the voter which buildings will receive new fire safety doors or which roofs will be replaced and which will be repaired.that is minutiae that the voter has no expertise or need to consider.furthermore,requiring such minute detail as defendants propose would be impractical.by the time the district is assured of the bond proceeds,the roof that might have been repaired may now need to be replaced or safety and accessibility renovations may need to be revised to comply with changing regulations.it is sufficient that the district clearly identified the particular types of projects,such as roof repair or installation of safety equipment.those are the projects the voters approved and those are the projects any overseer will look for in determining whether the district is using the bond funds as proposed.
defendants claim that the list places no limits on the types of projects because the list allowed for future changes.defendants also contend that the actual list of projects the district plans to implement with bond money is that contained in the bond measure cost summary,which was an exhaustive list of projects the district used in planning the bond proposal.defendants maintain that this list was not available to the voters and that it includes projects that are not proper subjects of a proposition bond and projects that were not listed in the bond proposal.these arguments are beside the point.the voters approved the bond proposition that was printed in the voter information pamphlet.any future changes would have to be consistent with the projects specified in the proposition the voters approved.in the event the district exceeds the authority granted by the voters approval,the legislature has provided a separate remedy.
b.the voting scheme was constitutional 
katz had argued below that the voting scheme the district used was unconstitutional as applied to him,amend.xiv,cal,art.i,subd.a.katz does not live in the district but he is the general partner of a limited partnership that owns real property in the district.the vote on measure c was limited to registered voters residing in the district and,therefore,katz was precluded from voting.he claimed this was an equal protection violation because he will be indirectly liable for any tax the voters approve.
prior to trial,the district made an in limine motion,seeking exclusion of all evidence challenging the voting scheme validity.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that neilson,supra,th,d,was dispositive of the question.katz challenges this ruling on appeal,urging this court to disagree with neilson.we agree with neilson and find no error in the trial court ruling.
in neilson,a nonresident landowner challenged a city parcel tax approved by the city registered voters.like katz,neilson claimed that excluding him from the vote was a denial of equal protection.neilson,supra,th at,d.neilson noted that,in general,residency is an acceptable restriction on the franchise.id.at,d,quoting the discussion in hoffman state bar of california th,d.neilson also cited holt civic club city of tuscaloosa,d holt,in which the united states supreme court rejected an equal protection challenge to a city residency requirement by nonresidents who were subject to certain city regulations and licensing requirements.neilson,supra,th at,d.in rejecting the challenge,holt summarized prior cases that had found other types of voting qualifications to be unconstitutional the challenged statute in each case denied the franchise to individuals who were physically resident within the geographic boundaries of the governmental entity concerned.citations.no decision of this court has extended the one man,one vote principle to individuals residing beyond the geographic confines of the governmental entity concerned,be it the state or its political subdivisions.on the contrary,our cases have uniformly recognized that a government unit may legitimately restrict the right to participate in its political processes to those who reside within its borders.holt,supra,at.
after reviewing holt and other pertinent united states supreme court authority,neilson rejected the plaintiff contention that strict scrutiny should apply,concluding that strict scrutiny applied only to protect the right to vote of those who are otherwise qualified to vote.someone otherwise qualified to vote could be characterized as having a fundamental interest in the right to vote,which may not be infringed absent a compelling state interest.but strict scrutiny is not used to create a right to vote in nonresidents who are not otherwise qualified.neilson,supra,th at,d.
like the plaintiff in neilson,katz is not an otherwise qualified voter in any district election.a person qualifies generally as a voter if he or she is a united states citizen at least years of age residing in the state.cal,art.ii.if such a person complies with the registration requirements of the elections code he or she may vote at any election held within the territory within which he or she resides and the election is held,italics added.since katz does not reside in and is not a registered voter of the district,he is not otherwise qualified to vote there.article xiiia,section,subdivision b supports this conclusion as it applies to the district school bond elections in that this subdivision allows for approval of school bonds by percent of the voters of the district.italics added.thus,the district voting scheme did not deprive katz of a fundamental right warranting strict scrutiny review.
citing california.industry governing bd.d.california,katz argues that qualified electors are the persons who,like him,are going to actually pay the tax.katz misreads the case.in california,the electorate of a school district voted to impose a tax upon building permits issued within the district.the tax was purportedly approved pursuant to article xiiia,section,which provides that cities,counties and special districts,by a vote of the electorate,may impose special taxes on such district.california,supra,d at.the court held that the constitutional requirement that the tax be imposed on such district meant that the voters approval was limited to taxes they themselves would have to pay,either directly or indirectly.id.at.allowing an electorate to approve a tax to be paid by someone else entirely,such as builders seeking permits to build within district boundaries,would make the constitutionally imposed difficulty of a vote meaningless.ibid.in contrast,requiring the tax to be imposed directly or indirectly on the electorate to whom the tax was submitted will give effect to the limitation on new taxes which the supermajority requirement seeks to insure.ibid.california did not suggest that the electorate must include every person who will be affected by the tax.the case does not alter our conclusion that katz was not otherwise qualified to vote in the district election at issue.
applying the rational basis test,neilson concluded that the residency requirement used to define the electorate in that case did not offend equal protection principles.in so doing,the court cited a discussion from an analogous case,massad city of new london.in massad,nonresidents who owned property in the city challenged a residency requirement pertaining to a referendum to approve a budget and tax rate ordinance.the court determined that there was a rational basis for excluding nonresidents,which was that local residents had a greater knowledge and interest in local affairs,while nonresident property owners would mainly be interested in lower taxes.neilson,supra,th at,d,citing massad city of new london,supra.at,at.the same rational basis exists here.the voting scheme did not offend katz right to equal protection.
following trial the district moved for an award of costs.defendants challenged the motion and the trial court taxed some of the costs requested but allowed a total of.defendants argue that this was error.defendants contend that the trial court erred in awarding costs against them because section requires that the summons in a validation action shall also state that persons who contest the legality or validity of the matter will not be subject to punitive action,such as wage garnishment or seizure of their real or personal property.defendants claim that the cost award is punitive action and,therefore,it is prohibited by section.defendants also argue that the district is estopped from seeking a judgment allowing it to garnish or seize their property since they relied to their detriment upon the advisement in the summons,which said that they would not be subject to punitive action,such as wage garnishment or seizure of their real or personal property.
we do not agree that a judgment awarding costs to a prevailing party is a punitive action against the loser.a cost award is not imposed as a punishment.in general,the loser in any civil action is liable for costs,notwithstanding the good faith of his or her claim or defense.code civ,subd.b.a cost award does,however,result in a judgment in favor of the party to whom the costs were awarded,which presumably could be enforced by wage garnishment or other seizure mechanisms.to that extent,section might be read to preclude an award of costs against the challenger in a validation action.if it does,it conflicts with code of civil procedure section hereafter,section,which provides the costs of any proceeding or action pursuant to this chapter validating proceedings may be allowed and apportioned between the parties or taxed to the losing party in the discretion of the court.the issue,therefore,is whether an award of costs against persons who contest the validity of a matter is prohibited by section or allowed under section.
the issue requires our interpretation of the law,a core judicial function to which we apply our independent review.mcclung employment development cal th,d.in so doing,we rely upon settled rules.our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.people connor th,d.we do that by first examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity the plain meaning governs.ibid.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,we may resort to extrinsic aids,including the rules of statutory construction and consideration of the evils to be remedied by the statutory scheme at issue,to help us select the interpretation that comports most closely with the lawmakers intent.ibid.a specific provision should be construed with reference to the entire statutory system of which it is a part,in such a way that the various elements of the overall scheme are harmonized.bowland municipal court cal d.furthermore,statutes are to be interpreted by assuming that the legislature was aware of the existing law at the time of the enactment and to have enacted a statute in light thereof.people mcguire th,d.
section plainly states that the summons shall inform interested persons that they will not be subject to punitive action such as wage garnishment or seizure of their property.we have no doubt that the legislature intended,by requiring this notice to be included in the summons,to assure interested persons that they could challenge the action of a public entity without fear of incurring a liability they did not intend.but the legislative history,of which we have taken judicial notice,provides no insight into whether the legislature intended to immunize interested persons from having costs awarded against them in the event they lose their challenge.see assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess,judiciary com.on assem.bill reg.sess.july,rules com.on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july.
defendants cite city of long beach bozek cal d,bozek,in support of their contention that a cost award is inconsistent with a public policy of encouraging citizens to speak out about government action.bozek does not support the point.bozek held that governmental entities may not sue private citizens for malicious prosecution.in so holding,the supreme court discussed the paramount importance of protecting the constitutionally guaranteed right to petition the government for the redress of legitimate grievances,first cal,art.i,and concluded that the risk of having to defend a malicious prosecution action would chill that right.the court did not prohibit an award of costs.indeed,the court noted there were remedies other than a malicious prosecution suit,such as code of civil procedure section,which allow governmental entities to regain costs and expenses expended in defending baseless claims.bozek,supra,cal d at.the existence of these other remedies weighed against approving the use of a malicious prosecution action.thus,the case does not hold that taxing costs to the individual challenging the public action is inconsistent with any public policy or constitutional right.
there is one situation where the challenger in a validation action can not be liable for costs and that is when the action may be characterized as a challenge to an eminent domain proceeding,such as a landowner challenge to redevelopment plans that would condemn the landowner property.in re redevelopment plan for bunker hill cal d,bunker hill.that rule is based upon the challenger right to just compensation under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.san francisco collins cal.but where there is no issue of the right to take private property for public use,this rule does not apply.crum shasta power.
turning back to the statutes at hand,we note that section was in effect in when the legislature amended section.we presume,therefore,that the legislature was aware when it added the advisement to section that the trial court had discretion to tax costs to the losing party under section.the legislature must also have been aware of the judicially created rule preventing costs to be taxed to the challenger in certain validation proceedings.bunker hill,supra,cal d at.if the legislature had intended to extend that prohibition to all challengers in validation actions,it could have revised section to do that.since the legislature amended section without amending section,we are persuaded that the legislature did not intend to change the plain meaning of the latter section,that the court may award costs in its discretion.
finally,defendants argue that even if costs may properly be taxed to them,the trial court abused its discretion in awarding nonrecoverable costs.in ruling upon a motion to tax costs,the trial court first determination is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face.if so,the burden is on the objecting party to show the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.nelson anderson th,d.where costs are not expressly allowed by the statute,the burden is on the party claiming the costs to show that the charges were reasonable and necessary.id.at,d.whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.ladas california state auto.th,d.
defendants challenge in witness fees for the district vice chancellor brandy and chancellor kanter,arguing that these witnesses were,in effect,parties,and that kanter never actually testified.the claim is meritless.trussell city of san diego d,held that,although mileage and witness fees are not allowable to parties to the action,there is no authority to deny fees to individuals not shown to have any private interest in the litigation,merely because they are directors or employees of a corporate party.county of kern ginn d,applied the same rationale to governmental litigants.brandy and kanter were not parties,they were employees of district and entitled to fees.it is immaterial that kanter did not actually testify.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides that ordinary witness fees pursuant to section of the government code are recoverable as costs in a civil proceeding.government code section provides fees for witnesses legally required to attend a civil action or proceeding in the superior courts.kanter was legally required to be present due to defendants
