background 
is the youth education branch of the cooperative extension service,a program of the united states department of agriculture.the purpose of the program is to assist children in developing as community leaders and involving themselves in action in positive ways.in california,the program is part of the university of california division of agricultural and natural resources anr,and is administered by the university of california cooperative extension.surls is the county director of the university of california cooperative extension for los angeles county.as county director,surls is responsible for administration of,among other programs,the program in los angeles county.
in and,several members of a club in los angeles county,known as the eastside kids club the club,participated in a film making project.the members,working with an adult advisor,wrote,acted in,and filmed a video in which two teenagers,who had been picked on and teased by other teenagers,go to a party attended by the other teenagers and kill them with knives.carl and andy,who were high school students and members of the club,participated in the film making project their mother,mary,who was a community leader of the club,had no involvement in the project.the members submitted the video to the san fernando valley fair for judging.
in early june,the board of the san fernando valley fair board notified that some members had submitted a video that the board refused to judge due to the video violent content.the board released a copy of the video to surls on june.after viewing the video,surls became concerned that the members who made the video may be risks for committing actual violent behavior,and she arranged a conference call on june with four other anr officials to discuss her concerns.the other officials concurred that immediate action had to be taken given the violent nature of the video.
on june,surls wrote to the members involved in the project,the adult project leader,and two adult community leaders of the club,notifying them that they were suspended pending an investigation into the making of the video.that investigation included interviewing those members who agreed to be interviewed,consulting with a psychologist who specializes in workplace and youth violence and who had consulted on the highly publicized columbine school shooting of april in littleton,colorado,and other cases,and consulting with the juvenile division of the local police department.the interviews with the involved members began the week of june,and by july,the suspensions of all members who came forward to be interviewed had been lifted.
carl and andy did not come forward to be interviewed before july.instead,on june,mary filed the complaint in this action alleging on behalf of herself and carl and andy a cause of action for injunctive and monetary relief under section of title of the united states code section on the ground that the regents violated their rights to freedom of expression,freedom of association,and due process under the federal constitution,amends.on that same day,mary individually and on behalf of carl and andy brought an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.the trial court continued the hearing on the ex parte application to july,at which time it denied the application,stating,i am not persuaded that the plaintiffs will win this lawsuit.in fact,i am persuaded that the plaintiffs are likely to lose the lawsuit.on july,carl and andy were interviewed as part of the investigation,and their suspensions were lifted.mary suspension was lifted on july.
on october,the trial court sustained the regents demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the regents is not a person and thus is not subject to a claim for relief under section.surls,who remained as a defendant,filed a motion for summary judgment on october,to be heard on january,in which she asserted that the complaint fails as a matter of law because she is entitled to qualified immunity.the motion was supported by surls declaration,in which surls described how she learned of the film making project,what actions she took after viewing the video,and her reasons for taking those actions.five weeks after the motion was served,plaintiffs served a notice to take surls deposition on december.on december,surls objected to the notice and refused to appear at the deposition,on the ground that she was entitled to have her qualified immunity defense determined before she had to submit to discovery.plaintiffs did not move to compel surls to appear.instead,on january,plaintiffs filed with their opposition to surls summary judgment motion an objection to surls declaration,on the ground that surls refused to appear at her deposition.plaintiffs also purported to dispute most of the facts set forth in surls separate statement of undisputed facts in support of the motion,based solely on their objection to surls declaration.plaintiffs did not cite to any evidence to raise disputed issues with regard to the facts set forth in surls separate statement.
the summary judgment motion was heard on april,after numerous continuances,at which time the trial court overruled all of plaintiffs objections to surls declaration and granted surls motion,finding there was no evidence of a violation of any constitutional right.the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants,and defendants moved under section of title of the united states code section for the attorney fees they incurred after plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction was denied and carl and andy suspensions were lifted.the court granted the motion and awarded surls and the regents fees in the amount of.plaintiffs appeal from the judgment and the order awarding attorney fees.
discussion 
plaintiffs objection to surls declaration 
plaintiffs contend they were denied due process when the trial court overruled their objection to surls declaration and considered the declaration in granting surls summary judgment motion,because plaintiffs were denied an opportunity to test by discovery the evidence presented against them.plaintiffs forfeited this assertion of error.
the code of civil procedure provides that a plaintiff may serve a notice of deposition on a defendant who has appeared in the action,and if the defendant fails to appear,the plaintiff may move to compel the defendant to appear for deposition.code civ,subds.b,j.the code of civil procedure also provides that a party opposing a summary judgment motion may file an application to continue the motion to obtain discovery necessary to oppose it,subd.h.
during the four months that elapsed between surls refusal to appear for deposition and the hearing on surls summary judgment motion,plaintiffs did not move to compel surls to appear for her deposition or move for a continuance of the summary judgment motion for the purpose of conducting further discovery.plaintiffs do not offer any explanation for their failure to move to compel or to move for a continuance for further discovery.because they did not take advantage of opportunities to avoid in the trial court the problem about which they now complain on appeal,they have forfeited any claim of a due process violation.bartold glendale federal bank th,d see also zamudio city and county of san francisco th,d.
propriety of summary judgment 
surls sought summary judgment on the ground that,as a government official,she was entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiffs claim against her.see harlow fitzgerald,d government officials are entitled to some form of absolute or suits for damages.the trial court agreed that surls was entitled to immunity,finding there was no evidence of a constitutional violation and even if there was such a violation,it was not one of clearly established law,by virtue of lavine,supra,a case the trial court found was virtually indistinguishable from the present case.plaintiffs contend the summary judgment was improper because qualified immunity does not bar actions for injunctive relief,and their complaint sought injunctive relief as well as damages,and because there were triable issues of fact precluding summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.because we hold the undisputed facts establish there was no constitutional violation as a matter of thus no basis for injunctive relief under section need not address whether qualified immunity precludes plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief.
standard of review 
f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,italics and footnotes omitted.if the moving party carries that burden,the burden of production shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.ibid.on appeal from a summary judgment,we make an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.iverson muroc unified school dist.th,d.
the united states supreme court has instructed that a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the government official conduct violated a constitutional right if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquires concerning qualified immunity.on the other hand,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.this inquiry,it is vital to note,must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition and it too serves to advance understanding of the law and to allow government officials to avoid the burden of trial if qualified immunity is applicable.saucier katz,d.
in the present case,the answer to the threshold question is no the facts plaintiffs allege do not show that surls conduct violated their constitutional rights.although the answer is the same regardless of which plaintiff is at issue that is,mary in her individual capacity,or mary as guardian ad litem of carl and andy,the analysis differs depending upon the identity of the plaintiff.
plaintiffs allege that surls punished mary,carl,and andy for exercising their constitutional right to free,creating a video as part of a film making suspending them from participation in activities but plaintiffs admit in their opening brief on appeal that mary had no part in the film making project.thus,plaintiffs admit that if surls punished mary at all,the punishment was unrelated to any speech or other expressive act by mary.accordingly,the section claim alleged on behalf of mary in her individual capacity does not allege a violation of mary constitutional right to free speech.
although there is no dispute that carl and andy participated in making the video,and that expression by means of motion pictures is included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the first and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution joseph burstyn,wilson,it does not follow that,in the context of this case,surls violated carl and andy free speech rights when she suspended them while she investigated the making of the video.
to determine whether surls violated carl and andy free speech rights,we must determine what those rights are.we are guided in this determination by the ninth circuit decision in lavine,supra,a case in which a high school temporarily expelled a student after the student wrote a violent poem,while the school determined whether the student posed a threat to the safety of himself or others at the school.the ninth circuit began its analysis by noting that we live in a time when school violence is an unfortunate reality that educators must confront on an all too frequent basis.the recent spate of school shootings have put our nation on edge and have focused attention on what school officials,law enforcement and others can do or could have done to prevent these kinds of tragedies.id.at.the court explained,however,that the constitution sets limits as to how far schools can go and that schools must achieve a balance between protecting the safety and of their students and respecting those same students constitutional rights.ibid.
the ninth circuit examined the line of united states supreme court cases defining the scope of students first amendment right to free speech.the court explained that under those cases,the students first amendment rights are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.lavine,supra,at,quoting hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d hazelwood bethel sch.dist.fraser,d fraser and tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch.dist,d tinker.the court identified three different kinds of student speech,each of which is governed by different supreme court precedent vulgar,lewd,obscene and plainly offensive speech is governed by fraser speech is governed by hazelwood and speech that falls into neither of these categories is governed by tinker.lavine,supra,at.
finding that the student speech at issue fell into the third category,the ninth circuit explained that,under tinker,supra,d,school officials must justify their decision to temporarily expel the student by showing facts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.lavine,supra,at.the court listed several facts that supported the school decision,but the court found the most important fact was the student poem itself.id.at.the poem was filled with imagery of violent death and suicide.at its extreme it can be interpreted as a portent of future violence,of the shooting of james fellow students.even in its most mild interpretation,the poem appears to be a cry for help from a troubled teenager contemplating suicide.taken together and given the backdrop of actual school shootings,we hold that these circumstances were sufficient to have led school authorities reasonably to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school,that james was intending to inflict injury upon himself or others.ibid.the court noted that the school allowed the student to return to school as soon as he was evaluated by a psychiatrist and found not to be a threat to himself or others,and thus,the court held that the school did not violate the first amendment by temporarily expelling the student.ibid.
in the present case,as in lavine,supra,the person who made the decision to temporarily suspend plaintiffs was shown an expressive work of lavine it was a poem,and here it was a raised c
