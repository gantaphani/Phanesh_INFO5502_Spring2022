a developmentally disabled student,had several sexual encounters with another developmentally disabled student in a school bathroom.her mother alleges these encounters were the result of the school failure to properly supervise.we must decide whether the mother,individually and on behalf of,has a cognizable fourteenth amendment due process claim against teacher.the district court found she did not and granted summary judgment to the teacher.we agree and affirm.
the fourteenth amendment due process clause generally does not require government actors to protect individuals from third parties.as we hold below,neither of two exceptions to this general rule the special relationship exception or the danger exception applies here.if and her mother have viable claims,those claims arise under state tort law,not the federal constitution.
is a former student at kentridge high school khs in the kent school district kent,washington.her mother is madhuri patel.at age three,was diagnosed with developmental disabilities,including cognitive and intellectual delays.she is classified as mildly mentally retarded.spent her entire school career in special education within the kent school district.
during the relevant time,disabilities affected her life in various ways she was sometimes unable to complete basic tasks like holding her eating utensils correctly,blowing her nose,and zipping her clothes.socially,had difficulty maintaining an appropriate physical distance from other people,refraining from talking about personal or embarrassing things,and conveying an understanding of etiquette.patel alleged that her daughter frequently was not aware of the potential danger of situations and did not necessarily use caution when encountering risky social situations.patel also worried that would often attempt to fit in with her peers by allowing herself to be easily manipulated or mistreated.
in april,freshman year at khs,patel discovered a series of troubling emails between and three other students.patel learned the students were coercing to steal money from patel purse.the emails also contained several graphic sexual references,particularly between and a boy named eric.patel gave the emails to school administrators,who concluded after investigation that eric was extorting money from but no sexual encounters had occurred at school.the three students were suspended,and eric never returned to khs.
a month after patel discovered the emails,khs established an individualized education plan iep for was put in a classroom taught by francine wilhelm,a teacher.the school invoked a no contact order to prevent any further physical contact between and other students.school staff were required to escort to wilhelm classroom when she arrived in the morning,to any classes outside wilhelm classroom,and to the bus at the end of the day.at a staff meeting discussing the iep,wilhelm said she was closely monitoring with regards to the young men in the class.wilhelm also said she was k eeping an eye out for social concerns for the iep continued for the remainder of freshman year.
when began her sophomore year in fall,khs did not immediately resume the iep.in an email to school administrators,patel said she was quite disappointed that the school would drop the ball on the previous arrangement of safety plan without including me or my permission.she asked the school to resume the iep.
in response to patel concerns,khs held a meeting in september.wilhelm attended this meeting.a representative from kent youth and family services informed school officials that safety might be compromised if she was left in any unsupervised times.this included lunch,passing times,and especially bathroom time.after the meeting,the school agreed to resume the iep and drafted a written agreement to that effect.according to patel declaration,had the school not done so,she would have removed her daughter from khs.
the incidents leading directly to this lawsuit occurred the following semester,spring.although khs principal,mike albrecht,believed was under complete adult supervision throughout the entire day,that semester wilhelm had been allowing then age sixteen to go on her own to a bathroom immediately adjacent to wilhelm classroom.at least five times during these unsupervised trips to the bathroom,had sex with a boy named matt,another developmentally disabled student in wilhelm class.a counselor determined the sex might be consensual even though both students were developmentally disabled.
despite her recognition that the iep called for constant supervision,wilhelm believed allowing to use the bathroom on her own as a sophomore was an important step in fostering her development 
our primary charge is to prepare our students for transition when they age out or graduate.will be a junior next year,and allowing her to use the restroom would be considered a step toward full transition and toward more independence.
according to wilhelm,because the bathroom was to her classroom,she could hear students inside talking and the toilets flushing.wilhelm also claimed she would watch the clock to make sure did not take too long.under these circumstances,wilhelm considered it appropriate to allow to make quick trips to the bathroom without an escort.
wilhelm did not know was having sex with matt in the bathroom,but she was aware the two potentially had some type of relationship.on matt first day at khs in march,another teacher had emailed wilhelm to tell her that was very interested in matt,talking and laughing with him during class.wilhelm asked the other teacher to document the behavior and send it to her.wilhelm also relayed this information to patel via email.then,about two months later,a vice principal told wilhelm that she had seen the two students hugging in the hallway.wilhelm spoke separately with each student about the incident.
a few days later,wilhelm saw matt leave her classroom just a few seconds after had gone to the bathroom.wilhelm raced out of the room,called to from outside the bathroom,and escorted her back to class.wilhelm said was very angry with wilhelm for interfering with her.at the school direction,wilhelm again emailed patel to explain the incident.a school official later thanked wilhelm privately for her vigilant efforts.
as it turned out,this second email from wilhelm to patel may have been the catalyst in revealing sexual relationship with matt.after receiving the email,patel asked her daughter whether she was having a relationship with another student.admitted she and matt had sex in the bathroom at least twice.having heard this,patel sent two emails to khs,one to wilhelm and one to principal albrecht.these emails disclosed sexual relationship with matt and expressed patel anger about the situation.in the email to wilhelm,patel wrote,francine i am in shock,will not come back to school till these issues are worked out.likewise,in the email to principal albrecht,patel wrote that the school had not provided the supervision needs.
patel email to principal albrecht also revealed for the first time that,contrary to the results of the school previous investigation,and eric had sex in a different school bathroom during her freshman year.patel email ambiguously claimed school officials knew this all along she had sex with eric on the bathroom floor in the new building last year school knows about this as they did their investigation last year.
but as the district court correctly noted,there was no evidence school officials knew that had sex at school her freshman year until patel told them so in these spring emails.rather,the school prior investigation had concluded that eric exploited for money,but no sex occurred on campus.in an internal email,a school official said,we have met with patel numerous times,she would not tell us what happened last year,and we had no knowledge of having sex.similarly,wilhelm herself stated that she and other teachers knew had done something inappropriate in the bathrooms her freshman year,but they did not know exactly what had happened.
after sending the two emails,patel removed from khs.she reported the sexual encounters to the king county sheriff department.the sheriff office took a statement from matt,who admitted he had sexual relations with at least five times.this lawsuit followed.
patel filed suit in washington superior court,individually and on behalf of.she brought a variety of claims against the school district and wilhelm,including negligence and failure to protect.patel also brought a federal civil rights claim under u.the claim,which underlies this appeal,was against wilhelm only.without further elaboration,patel complaint alleged wilhelm had violated fourteenth amendment rights.defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of washington on the basis of this federal claim.
in the district court,wilhelm moved for partial summary judgment on the claim.she argued patel complaint did not explain how wilhelm had deprived of her fourteenth amendment rights.in response,patel countered that wilhelm had violated due process right to bodily integrity by failing to supervise her trips to the bathroom,causing her to be repeatedly raped.
the district court granted wilhelm motion and dismissed the claim,finding as a matter of law that wilhelm had not deprived of any federally protected right.the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over patel remaining claims.see united mine workers of am.gibbs,d.the court dismissed the state claims without prejudice,leaving them for resolution by the king county superior court.
patel now appeals.we have jurisdiction under.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.dietrich john ascuaga nugget,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.
the district court correctly granted partial summary judgment to wilhelm.although patel may still have viable claims against the defendants,her claim against wilhelm fails as a matter of law.deshaney winnebago cnty.dep t of soc,d t he fourteenth amendment does not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.
to succeed on a claim,a plaintiff must show that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law and the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.tatum,at.here,the parties do not dispute that wilhelm was acting under color of state law.the sole issue is whether wilhelm deprived of any federally protected right.
t he general rule is that a state is not liable for its omissions.munger city of glasgow police dep t,cir.in that vein,the fourteenth amendment due process clause generally does not confer any affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests.deshaney,at.as a corollary,the fourteenth amendment typically does not impose a duty on the state to protect individuals from third parties.morgan gonzales,cir.
there are two exceptions to this rule when a special relationship exists between the plaintiff and the state the exception,deshaney,at and when the state affirmatively places the plaintiff in danger by acting with deliberate indifference to a known or obvious danger the danger exception,grubbs,cir.if either exception applies,a state omission or failure to protect may give rise to a claim.
because patel claim is based on an omission by wilhelm her alleged failure to properly supervise patel can establish a due process violation only if one of these two exceptions applies.to survive summary judgment,then,patel must raise a material fact question on either exception.she has not done so.
we begin with the exception.the supreme court formally established this exception in deshaney,at.the exception applies when a state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will.id.at.the types of custody triggering the exception are incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal liberty.id.at.when a person is placed in these types of custody,we allow due process claims against the state for a fairly simple reason a state can not restrain a person liberty without also assuming some responsibility for the person safety and.id.at.
under this exception,the state constitutional duty arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him,but from the limitation which the state has imposed on his freedom.id.at.in other words,the person substantive due process rights are triggered when the state restrains his liberty,not when he suffers harm caused by the actions of third parties.id.at.
the exception does not apply when a state fails to protect a person who is not in custody.see id.at.in deshaney,for instance,a boy was brutally and repeatedly beaten by his father.id.at.the abuse was reported to the county department of social services.id.at.while monitoring the situation over the following months,social services saw voluminous evidence suggesting continued abuse.during her monthly visits,the boy caseworker observed several suspicious injuries on his body.id.at.on her final two visits,the caseworker was told the boy could not see her because he was too ill.id.social services twice received calls from the hospital saying the boy had been admitted for injuries doctors believed were caused by abuse.id.through all of this,social services never took any action.id.
soon after,the boy was beaten to by his father and suffered severe brain damage.id.the supreme court rejected the boy due process claim,holding the exception did not apply because the boy was in the custody of his father,not the state.id.at.even though the state had extensive information strongly suggesting abuse,the boy due process rights were not triggered because he was not in state custody.id.at.
here,patel argues was in state custody while she was at school.patel emphasizes that washington requires mandatory school attendance,and that khs had a duty to protect during school hours under the state in loco parentis doctrine.this state tort doctrine requires schools to anticipate dangers which may reasonably be anticipated and then take precautions to protect the pupils from those dangers.mcleod grant cnty.sch.dist.patel argues this duty created a special relationship under deshaney,thus permitting her federal claim.
although we have not yet applied deshaney to the context of compulsory school attendance,every one of our sister circuits to consider the issue has rejected patel argument.at least seven circuits have held that compulsory school attendance alone is insufficient to invoke the exception,hasenfus lajeunesse,cir doe hillsboro indep.sch,cir en banc sargi kent city bd.of,cir graham indep.sch.dist.no.i,cir dorothy little rock sch,cir middle bucks area vocational tech,cir en banc alton cmty.unit sch.dist,cir.our sister circuits have reasoned that,unlike incarceration or institutionalization,compulsory school attendance does not restrict a student liberty such that neither the student nor the parents can attend to the student basic needs,sargi,at citing cases.even when school attendance is mandatory,the parents not the state remain the student primary caretakers,id.
going a step further,most of these circuits have expressly held that combining in loco parentis duties with compulsory school attendance still does not create a special relationship,hasenfus,at doe claiborne,cir dorothy,at middle bucks,at.these decisions have emphasized that a obligation does not necessarily create a duty of care under the fourteenth amendment,claiborne cnty,at see also deshaney,at.applying this bedrock principle,our sister circuits uniformly hold that requiring school attendance does not sufficiently restrict a student liberty under deshaney to transform the school in loco parentis duties into a constitutional obligation,claiborne,at citing cases.
we find particularly instructive the third circuit analysis of this issue in middle bucks,as it involved facts somewhat similar to ours.see at.in that case,one plaintiff was a female student with communicative disabilities.id.at.she claimed multi
