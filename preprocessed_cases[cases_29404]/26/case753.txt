donna humphries brought this action against the pulaski county special school district district alleging that the district breached its employment contract with her and that it unlawfully used race in its hiring practices in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,and,and the arkansas civil rights act.the district court granted the district motion for summary judgment with respect to the federal claims and dismissed humphries state law claims without prejudice.both parties appeal,and for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
humphries,a white female with a doctorate degree in elementary education,has been employed with the district since and has worked as an elementary school counselor since.since,humphries has applied for virtually every elementary school assistant principal position that has been available in the district,including two such openings in august.in,humphries also applied for a director of counseling services position with the district.in each instance,humphries asserts that the district preferentially hired black applicants.
in august,humphries filed a claim with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that the district repeatedly denied her an assistant principal position based on her race.after receiving a notice from the eeoc regarding her right to sue,humphries filed suit in the district court on may,contending that the district discriminated against her based on her race when it failed to promote her to the assistant principal positions and that the district breached its contract with her by failing to give priority consideration to current employees when filling the assistant principal positions humphries filed an amended complaint on september,which added the allegation that she was denied the director of counseling services position because of her race.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment.in her motion for summary judgment,humphries contended that direct evidence supported her discrimination claims,including the district policy of using biracial interview committees,the district announced preference to employ and advance blacks,the district published racial quotas and goals for hiring black administrators,the district practice of hiring assistant principals such that at least one assistant principal is of a different race than that school principal,and statistical evidence establishing that the district favors black applicants in its hiring of administrative personnel.
in its motion for summary judgment,the district argued that its policies for employment and promotion were promulgated in response to court orders requiring the district to desegregate and implement procedures that would make the district attractive to minority students,teachers,and administrators.the district has a lengthy history of involvement in desegregation litigation.see little rock sch.dist.little rock sch,cir summarizing the district history of involvement in federal desegregation litigation.in,the little rock school district sued the district,the north little rock school district,the state of arkansas,and the arkansas state board of education,seeking consolidation of the three pulaski county school districts as a remedy for allegedly unconstitutional efforts to maintain racially segregated schools.see little rock sch.dist.pulaski county spec.sch.dist,cir en banc.this court affirmed the district court finding that the district acted to perpetuate segregation by,among other things,failing to meet staff hiring goals.id.at.in response to our decision,the district negotiated a settlement agreement with the other school districts,which we eventually ordered the district court to approve.see little rock sch.dist.pulaski county spec.sch.dist,cir.we also ordered the creation of the office of desegregation monitoring odm to assist the district court in its supervision of the school districts.see id.the district operated under that settlement agreement until march,when the district court approved a new plan submitted by the district called plan.little rock sch.dist.pulaski county spec.sch.dist,case,doc,at.
regarding staffing,plan requires that the district recruit applicants for each available administrative position in a manner designed to communicate,broadly,its availability and to develop a racially diverse pool of applicants.it also requires the district to allocate teachers and other professional staff in a manner which avoids the racial identification of schools.the district assistant superintendent for desegregation has the authority to direct that additional recruitment take place prior to the offering of the position to a particular applicant.further,the district compliance with plan is subject to continuous monitoring by the odm 
the district court granted summary judgment to the district,holding that humphries failed to set forth direct evidence of unlawful discrimination because she presented no evidence that the affirmative action plan played any part in the district decisions not to promote her.the court further held that even if humphries could establish that the district followed its affirmative action plan in failing to promote her,humphries could not establish that its plan was invalid.the court also dismissed humphries state law claims without prejudice.humphries appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the district and denial of her motion for summary judgment.the district the district court dismissal of humphries state law claims without prejudice.

humphries claims may survive the district motion for summary judgment in one of two ways.first,humphries may present admissible evidence directly indicating unlawful discrimination,that is,evidence showing a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision,sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.see fields shelter mut.ins,cir.in the alternative,humphries may present evidence creating an inference of unlawful discrimination under the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see fields,at parallel citations omitted.
under the mcdonnell douglas framework,humphries can establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that she is a member of a protected class that she was meeting her employer legitimate job expectations that she suffered an adverse employment action and that similarly situated employees outside the protected class were treated differently.see id.at.if humphries meets her burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,the burden then shifts to the district to establish a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for taking the allegedly discriminatory action.see hammer ashcroft,cir.if the district puts forth such a reason,humphries must then show that the district proffered explanation is pretextual or her claims will fail.see id.
assistant principal positions 
humphries first contends that the district court erred by finding that she presented no direct evidence of unlawful discrimination.in particular,she points to evidence of the district affirmative action policies.the district does not dispute that it has affirmative action policies.for example,the district does not dispute that its policy is to use biracial committees to conduct interviews when filling positions,and it concedes that it used biracial committees to select the candidates for the assistant principal positions sought by humphries.the district also does not deny that its job postings for the two assistant principal positions announced in august included the following language the district will make special efforts to employ and advance women,blacks,and handicapped persons.further,the district published hiring goals include having at least one minority administrator at each elementary school and attain ing a ratio of black administrators in the district in proportion to the ratio of black certified personnel in the d istrict in the preceding year.members of the biracial interview committees are trained to abide by the district racial equality policies.
the district does,however,dispute humphries assertion that it has a policy of hiring assistant principals such that at least one assistant principal at each school is of a different race than that school principal.humphries contends that she presented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact about whether the district has such a policy.she points to evidence that from october to august,black applicants were hired for twelve out of fourteen assistant principal openings and,in eleven of those instances,the principal at the school was white.in the twelfth instance,the school principal was black,but the school already had one white assistant principal.the two white assistant principals were hired at schools where the principals were black.humphries expert concluded that a statistical analysis of this evidence showed that the district has a policy of biracially pairing principals and assistant principals because black applicants were selected at schools with white principals in excess of standard deviations above what would have been expected in the absence of such a policy,based on the relevant labor market.hazelwood sch.dist.united states,d suggesting that standard deviations between and constitute acceptable statistical proof of discrimination.
the district argues that humphries statistical evidence is unreliable,challenging several aspects of her analysis,particularly whether humphries expert used the appropriate applicant pool.humphries expert used the number of certified teachers in the district as the comparative applicant pool.the district expert used the number of applicants for each job as the comparative pool and concluded that the statistical evidence did not support the proposition that the district had such a policy.as the supreme court has noted,when a job requires special qualifications,comparisons to the general population rather than to the smaller group of individuals who possess the necessary qualifications may have little probative value.id.at.humphries argues that all certified teachers possess the necessary qualifications for an assistant principal job,while the district asserts that only certain teachers possess the necessary administrative certification.the parties different methods of analysis create an issue of fact,and the determination of the appropriate comparative figures in this case will depend upon further evaluation by the trial court.see id.at.statistics come in infinite variety.their usefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.only the trial court is in a position to make the appropriate determination after further findings.internal citation and alterations omitted.the district court made no findings regarding humphries statistical evidence.it did not,for example,conclude that humphries expert analysis was flawed because the analysis failed to control for relevant variables.el deeb of,cir affirming the district court grant of summary judgment where the district court found that the plaintiff statistical analysis was insufficient as a matter of law because it failed to control for relevant variables.we can not say as a matter of law whether one analysis is superior to the other.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to humphries,a reasonable jury could conclude that the district has a policy of pairing assistant principals with principals of different races.
the district next argues that each of its affirmative action policies was properly promulgated in response to various court orders requiring the district to implement procedures to desegregate and make itself attractive to minority administrators.while this court has not addressed the issue of whether reliance on a affirmative action plan may be direct evidence of discrimination,several of our sister circuits have suggested that an affirmative action plan may be direct evidence of discrimination if the challenged employment action resulted from the employer acting in connection with that plan.see frank xerox,cir also requiring a showing that the plan is invalid bass bd.of county comm rs,cir same mcgarry bd.of county comm rs,cir brown mclean,cir cerrato cmty.coll,cir.
we now join our sister circuits in concluding that evidence that an employer followed an affirmative action plan in taking a challenged adverse employment action may constitute direct evidence of unlawful discrimination.if the employer defends by asserting that it acted pursuant to a valid affirmative action plan,the question then becomes whether the affirmative action plan is valid under title vii and the equal protection clause.see bass,at,ricci destefano,d holding that a city making promotion decisions based on race would violate title vii without a valid defense donaghy city of omaha,cir holding that satisfaction of the mcdonnell douglas test will not necessarily show a prima facie violation of in a reverse discrimination case where the employer was acting pursuant to a bona fide affirmative action plan,but not discussing whether evidence of an employer acting pursuant to the affirmative action plan would constitute direct evidence of unlawful discrimination.
because the district does not dispute the existence of several of its affirmative action policies,humphries must next show that the district acted pursuant to those policies in failing to promote her to the assistant principal positions.see fields,at requiring a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision.we conclude that humphries has raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether there was a specific link between the district decision not to promote her and the district various affirmative action policies.humphries presented evidence that the district interview committees are instructed to abide by the district affirmative action policies.the district published hiring goals include hiring at least one minority administrator at each school and attaining a ratio of black administrators in proportion to the number of black certified personnel in the district.and,as explained above,humphries created a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the district has a policy of hiring assistant principals who are of a different race than the principal at a particular school.a reasonable jury could conclude that interviewers,who had been trained in the district racial equality policies,effectuated those policies through their scoring and ranking of applicants and that the district therefore acted pursuant to its affirmative action policies when it failed to promote humphries to one of the assistant principal positions.see bass,at frank,at finding direct evidence of unlawful discrimination where the employer explicitly identified racial goals and managers were evaluated on how well they complied with the affirmative action policy objectives.
the district argues that humphries can not show that she was adversely affected by its affirmative action policies because her low scores during her initial interviews precluded her from reaching the final stage of interviewing.the district relies on donaghy,in which we held that the plaintiff,a white male,did not have standing to challenge his employer decision to interview and promote a black applicant because the plaintiff scores on a multiple choice test left him ranked below several other applicants.donaghy,at.however,there was no allegation in donaghy that the multiple choice test was biased against whites or subjective in any other way.by contrast,humphries asserts that the district interviewers were influenced by the district affirmative action policies and that their rankings were therefore biased by their desire to comply with those policies.thus,donaghy
