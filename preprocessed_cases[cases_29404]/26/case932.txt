we hold as a matter of california law that the california agency responsible for funding a special education student education at an residential treatment facility is the school district in which the student parent,as defined by california education code section,resides.we hold that,the student whose education is at issue,had no parent under the version of section.thus,from july,when was placed at the facility,until october,when an amended version of section took effect,california law did not designate any educational agency as responsible for education.the california department of education cde was therefore responsible by default.we hold that did have a parent under the and versions of section.cde therefore was not responsible for education after october,when the version of section took effect.we accordingly affirm in part and reverse in part the district court judgment.the district court properly held cde responsible for education from july,to october.the district court erred,however,by holding cde responsible for education between october,and april.

in october,filed a request for a special education due process hearing.after mediation resolved all other issues,the only issue for the hearing was which public agency was responsible for funding placement at cinnamon hills.because of various placements orange county,los angeles unified school district,charter oaks unified school district and cde were all identified as agencies possibly responsible for educational funding.in october,the california office of administrative hearings oah issued an administrative decision naming orange county the responsible agency.see student orange cnty.dep t of,at cal.office of admin.hearings,
orange county appealed that decision to the united states district court for the central district of california,arguing that cde is responsible for education.the county argued that california law failed to make any public agency responsible for providing special education programs to children like,who have no parents and are placed in residential treatment centers outside california.the county therefore argued that cde should be held responsible by default.
cde moved to dismiss the action under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied that motion in a published decision,orange cnty.dep t of educ,d,and then granted orange county motion for summary judgment.the court agreed with the county that california law failed to make any public agency responsible for education and deemed cde responsible by default.cde timely appealed to this court.
after oral argument,we certified the following question to the california supreme court under rule of the california rules of court 
whether under california law the school district responsible for the costs of a special education student education while the student is placed at an residential treatment facility is the district in which the student de facto parent,who is authorized to make educational decisions on behalf of the student,resides.

we must decide,as a matter of california law,which california agency is responsible for funding educational placement in an residential treatment facility.we first address whether the responsible agency is the school district in which the student parent,as defined by california education code section,resides.we then address whether hardy,as de facto parent and the person authorized to make educational decisions on behalf,falls within the definition of parent under the,and versions of section 
whether section definition of parent applies to section 
background 
the parties agree that california education code section establishes the general rule under california law that the school district responsible for the education of a child between the ages of six and is the district in which the child parent or legal guardian resides.see katz los gatos saratoga joint union high sch,th,d,section embodies the general rule that parental residence dictates a pupil proper school district.the parties disagree,however,about how california law defined parent for purposes of section while orange county was fronting the costs for placement in cinnamon hills.
in,when orange county began fronting those costs,no provision of the california education code specified that it provided the definition of parent for section,either for students as a whole or for special education students in particular.in january,the california legislature amended section of the california education code to provide that,i f a judicial decree or order identifies a specific person or persons under education code section a of part special education programs to act as the parent of a child or to make educational decisions on behalf of a child,then that person or persons shall be determined to be the parent for purposes of article commencing with section of chapter of part.cal.b.thus,beginning in,the definition of parent in section indisputably applies to section,at least under some circumstances.for purposes of this appeal,the parties agree that,as of january,the agency responsible for funding placement was the school district in which parent resided,see cal,as parent was defined under section the parties dispute,however,whether section supplied a definition of parent for section before january.if section does not specify the governmental entity responsible for a special education student education,we must identify,under california law,the proper alternative method for determining the responsible entity.
we have found no controlling authority addressing this issue,and what authority exists is in conflict.in orange county department of education student,cal.office of admin.hearings may,the oah ruled that section does provide the definition of parent for section with respect to students enrolled in special education programs.see id.section,which is found in the section of the code regarding special education,sets forth definitions of parent that must be read in conjunction with section when there is a question regarding which agency is responsible for providing special education to a particular child.see also id.the oah has taken this position in a number of related proceedings,and cde urges its adoption here 
on the other hand,a federal district court in california has issued multiple decisions that have rejected,at least in part,the proposition that section supplies the definition of parent for purposes of section.in newport mesa unified school district,cv.may,the district court concluded that the current version of section applies to section,but found no basis to conclude that section definition of parent applied to section before.the court noted that cde does not directly explain in its briefing the basis for its position that section,prior to the amendment,supplied the definition of parent for section,adding that the oah decisions also fail to explain why section unique definition is applicable to section.id.at.the court found the oah decisions unconvincing 
the court is persuaded for two reasons that,before the amendment,section definition of parent was not applicable to determinations of residency under section.first,section is within the definition section of the part of the california education code dealing specifically with special education programs.see cal.to apply a special education provision to the determination of residency is inconsistent with the instruction in union school district smith,cir,to use ordinary means of determining residency for special education students.moreover,it seems illogical to apply a definition promulgated under a specific and distinct part of the california education code to other unrelated sections.second,finding that section already applied to section prior to the amendment conflicts with the legislative counsel digest of the amendment.the amendment to section explicitly expanded the applicability of section definition of parent beyond the special education provisions to various other statutes,including section.compare cal.b with cal.b.the legislative counsel digest explained that the amendment to subsection b would broaden the purposes for which the definition of parent extends if a judicial decree or order identifies the person who is defined as a parent.cal.legis.serv.ch.west.this indicates that the change to subsection b was not a mere clarification of the definition applicability,but rather a broadening of its applicability beyond the special education provisions of the california education code.
id.at.the district court reached a similar conclusion in orange county department of education,cv,at.may.appeals from those decisions are currently pending in this court.
the definitions of parent in the and versions of section apply to section 
whether the definitions of parent in the and versions of section apply to section with respect to special education students is a close question.there are several reasons to believe that these definitions of parent do not apply.first,section is found in part of the education code,whereas section is located in part of the code.the primary purpose of section is to provide a definition of parent for part.see cal.as used in this part,the definitions prescribed by this article apply unless the context otherwise requires.emphasis added second,if section supplies a definition of parent for section,but only with respect to special education students,then the term parent in section has one meaning for students in special education programs the definition supplied by section and another meaning for other students.absent a statutory basis for holding otherwise,we would expect the term parent,as used in section,to have a uniform meaning for all california students.union sch.dist.smith,cir agreeing with cde contention that residency for special education coverage purposes is measured by the normal standards.third,we find no explicit statutory basis for applying section to section before.
on balance,however,we are persuaded that the california legislature intended the definition of parent in the and versions of section to apply to section for students receiving special education.although section is found in the special education programs part of the education code and section is found in the general education part of the code,not using section definition of parent for all aspects of a special education student education would lead to nonsensical results.for instance,if section does not apply to section,then a student may have a parent for special education purposes but not for residency purposes under section.the legislature,which aimed to implement the special education programs consistent with the idea and sought to place the educational decisionmaking and funding responsibility at the local level,presumably did not intend such a result.
this conclusion is bolstered by section of the education code.section deals expressly with the question of which public agency is responsible for providing an education to a special education student between the ages of and.it provides that,for students between ages and,the school district responsible for providing an education is the district in which the student parent resides.see cal.a.because section is located within part of the code,section necessarily incorporates section definition of parent,as all parties agree.see id.
on its face,of course,section applies only to students between the ages of and,not younger students.but section demonstrates the legislature intent that the school district responsible for a student special education is the district in which the student parent as defined in section resides.holding otherwise with respect to younger pupils would produce inconsistent and even absurd results,because section would determine the agency responsible for a special education student over,but not for one under.it is highly improbable that the california legislature intended that,when a student turned,a different agency would suddenly become responsible for the student education.see in re conservatorship of whitley,cal th,d,a statute should not be literally construed if to do so would lead to absurd results or defeat the statute evident purpose.
such a result is not only improbable but also inconsistent with the purposes of section.the legislature designed section to ensure funding continuity the public agency responsible for a student special education before and after the child reaches the age of should be the same,unless the student parents relocate.as the california superior court has explained,the purpose of section is to require the local school districts where the pupils parents reside to remain responsible for the pupils special education after the student turns.sierra sands unified sch.dist.cal.state bd.of,no.s cv,idelr.may,emphasis added.section is a provision to maintain funding responsibilities for the adult student education with the california school district within which the parents reside.sierra sands unified sch.dist.student,office,emphasis added see also student berkeley unified sch,office,section is a provision to maintain funding responsibilities for the adult student education with the california school district within which the parents reside.emphasis added the legislative priority of funding continuity can be achieved only if section definition of parent applies to section for special education students under the age of.
thus,although a close and difficult question,we hold that the and versions of section supplied the definition of parent for section for purposes of determining the agency responsible for providing a student special education.this interpretation of the education code is consistent with the decisions of the office of administrative hearings.see,orange cnty.dep t of,supra,at 
whether hardy meets the definition of parent 
the remaining issue is whether lori hardy,as de facto parent under rule e of the california rules of court and the person authorized to make educational decisions on behalf,satisfied section definition of parent from july,when placement at the residential treatment facility began,through april.during that time,three different versions of section were in effect.the version of section was effective from october,to october.the version was in effect from october,to the end of.the and current version has been in effect since january.we address the three versions of section in turn,beginning with the most recent iteration of the statute.
the version of section 
the parties do not dispute that,for purposes of this case,section supplies the definition of parent for section as of january.we therefore must decide whether hardy qualifies as a parent for under the version of section.under the version of section,parent means 
a biological or adoptive parent of a child.
a foster parent if the authority of the biological or adoptive parents to make educational decisions on the child behalf specifically has been limited by court order in accordance with section b or of title of the code of federal regulations.
a guardian generally authorized to act as the child parent,or authorized to make educational decisions for the child,including a responsible adult appointed for the child in accordance with sections and of the welfare and institutions code.
an individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent,including a grandparent,stepparent,or other relative,with whom the child lives,or an individual who is legally responsible for the child welfare.
a surrogate parent who has been appointed pursuant to section or of the government code,and in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations and section a of title of the united states code.
hardy does not meet the first of these definitions.she is not biological or adoptive parent.nor does she meet the second definition.although hardy at one time served as foster parent,she ceased serving in that capacity in,two years before placement at cinnamon hills.
hardy also does not satisfy the fourth definition,although this subsection perhaps presents a closer question.the california rules of court state that a de facto parent is a person who has been found by the court to have assumed,on a basis,the role of parent,fulfilling both the child physical and psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period.cal.here,hardy has in some respects act ed in the place of a biological or adoptive parent.but cde does not contend and the record does not show that hardy actually assumed the role as parent in the comprehensive sense suggested by section during the period in question.hardy also is not relative,and does not reside with her.she therefore does not fall within the fourth definition.
nor does hardy fall within the fifth definition.under both federal and california law,a surrogate parent perhaps should have been appointed for see requiring a public agency to appoint a surrogate parent to represent a child in all matters relating to the identification,evaluation and educational placement of the child and the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child when n o parent can be identified or t he child is a ward of the state cal.gov t code implementing the requirements of.as a practical matter,moreover,it appears that hardy fulfilled many of the functions that would have been performed by a surrogate parent had one been appointed.it appears from the stipulated facts,for instance,that hardy participated in special education planning,including the decision to place at cinnamon hills.joint statement of stipulated facts.had a surrogate parent been appointed,hardy likely would have been chosen.but hardy was not actually appointed as surrogate parent under california government code sections and or in accordance with.she was not,therefore,a surrogate parent for purposes of the version of section.
we hold,however,that hardy was a parent for purposes of the version of section because she was a guardian authorized to make educational decisions for the child.cal.a.that conclusion is consistent with the plain language of section.under california law,we give the words of a statute their ordinary and usual meaning.see city of santa monica gonzalez,cal th,d.the dictionary defines guardian as o ne that guards,watches over,or protects,or,in law,as o ne who is legally responsible for the care and management of the person or property of an incompetent or a minor.american heritage dictionary of the english language ed see also webster third new international dictionary defining guardian as including one who has or is entitled or legally appointed to the care and management of the person or property of another as a minor or person incapable of managing his own affairs.black law dictionary defines guardian as o ne who has the legal authority and duty to care for another person or property,esp.because of the other infancy,incapacity,or disability.black law dictionary ed.black adds,a guardian may be appointed either for all purposes or for a specific purpose.id.emphasis added.here,hardy was appointed by the juvenile court to have legal authority for making educational decisions on behalf.that made her a guardian as that term is commonly understood hardy thus was a parent for purposes of section on january,when the version of section took effect.
the version of section 
under the version of the statute,parent means any of the following 
a biological or adoptive parent of a child.
a foster parent if the authority of the biological or adoptive parents to make educational decisions on the child behalf specifically has been limited by court order in accordance with section b or of title of the code of federal regulations.
a guardian generally authorized to act as the child parent,or authorized to make educational decisions for the child.
an individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent,including a grandparent,stepparent,or other relative,with whom the child lives,or an individual who is legally responsible for the child welfare.
a surrogate parent who has been appointed pursuant to section or of the government code,and in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations and section a of title of the united states code.
we hold that hardy was a parent for purposes of the version of section.this is so because,like the version of the statute,the version includes a guardian authorized to make educational decisions for the child.id.a.hence,hardy was a parent for purposes of section from october,to the end of,when the version of section was in effect.
the version of section 
under the version of section,a parent includes 
a person having legal custody of a child.
any adult pupil for whom no guardian or conservator has been appointed.
a person acting in the place of a natural or adoptive parent,including a grandparent,stepparent,or other relative with whom the child lives.parent also includes a parent surrogate.
a foster parent if the authority of a parent to make educational decisions on the child behalf has been specifically limited by court order in accordance with subsection b of section of title of the code of federal regulations.
hardy did not fall within any of these categories.she did not have legal custody of was not an adult pupil.and,for the reasons already given,hardy was not a person acting in the place of a natural or adoptive parent,an appointed parent surrogate or,during the relevant time frame,a foster parent.hardy was therefore not parent for purposes of section or section from july,when placement at cinnamon hills began,until october,when the version of section superseded the version.
cde concedes that hardy does not fall within any of the specific definitions of parent included in section a,but argues on policy grounds that the version of section should be read to cover any adult who makes educational decisions for the child because an inclusive definition of parent is consistent with the overall policy objectives of special education law.cde,however,has not pointed to anything in the language,context,purpose or legislative history of the version of section that supports such a broad reading.cde argument,moreover,is difficult to reconcile with the subsequent history of the statute.the statute identifies specific categories of persons categories that the legislature has seen fit to add to in ensuing years.were cde construction correct,those later amendments would have been unnecessary 
cde similarly presents no authority for the proposition that the revisions merely clarified the version of the statute.the b
