backgrounda.
jerica king was a student at east louis senior high school.at the end of the school day on may,jerica went to see nave,a guidance counselor.she had no appointment,but wanted to discuss her grades and credits toward graduation.in the course of the meeting,nave noticed that jerica appeared upset and asked what was troubling her.jerica explained that she was having trouble with another student and proceeded to discuss the problem with nave.the meeting lasted less than an hour.however,as a result of the meeting,jerica missed the school bus.before leaving nave office,jerica stated that she had missed her bus and would need to call her mother.however,jerica did not request to use the phone at that time,and nave did not offer jerica the use of his phone.
although jerica had missed the school bus,there was a public bus stop in front of the high school and a metrolink station a couple of blocks from the school.after her meeting with nave,jerica exited the school building and checked to see if a public bus was waiting.when she did not see a bus,jerica attempted to reenter the building to call her mother,but the school doors were locked.an unidentified woman,to whom we shall refer,for the sake of simplicity,as the hall monitor,met jerica at the door.jerica informed the hall monitor that she wanted to reenter the school to call her mother.the hall monitor denied jerica reentry,allegedly stating that reentry was against school policy.
jerica then headed toward the metrolink station.as she approached the metrolink station,jerica was abducted at by two men.the men took her to a house where she was raped.jerica was released the following morning.
king originally brought suit in june on behalf of jerica.the action named as defendants the district,bluette and anderson.king contended that the district defendants had created a danger to jerica when she was left stranded outside of the school as a result of an official policy prohibiting students from reentering the school after school hours without supervision by a school employee.king asserted that jerica substantive due process rights were violated when she was injured as a result of the school failure to protect her from this danger.king also contended that the district should have trained its employees to ensure that a student leaving the school after missing her school bus had transportation home.king asserted that,given the high crime rate in the area surrounding the school,the district failure to train its employees in this manner evinced a deliberate indifference to the safety of its students.
in november,after the close of discovery,king moved for voluntary dismissal of the action the court granted the motion.king then filed this action in april.
the complaint asserted the same claims against the district defendants and,invoking the district court supplemental jurisdiction under a,added state negligence claims against.the district defendants immediately moved for summary judgment.following oral arguments on the district defendants motion for summary judgment,king moved to amend her complaint to add nave as a defendant in his individual capacity.king alleged that nave had created a danger to jerica by keeping her in their meeting until after the school buses had left for the day and that he had violated jerica substantive due process rights when he failed to ensure that she had transportation home.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the district defendants.it concluded that king had failed to raise a genuine issue of fact with respect to the existence of a school policy or custom that could provide the basis for holding the district liable under monell department of social services,d.the court further concluded that,because there were no allegations that bluette and anderson had been involved personally in the alleged constitutional violation,there was no basis upon which to establish their individual liability.the court also held that king had not established that the district had acted with deliberate indifference to jerica constitutional rights by its failure to train its employees.thus,the court concluded,king could not establish liability on the part of the district under city of canton harris,d.the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over king claims against.the district court also denied king motion for leave to amend her complaint the court concluded that,because there was no evidence that nave had exercised his authority to cause jerica to remain at school,nave had not created a danger to jerica which would be actionable under.
discussion 
king contends that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of the district defendants.she asserts that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the existence of an official policy that would give rise to liability on the part of the district defendants under monell.king also contends that the district court erred when it concluded that the district defendants could not be held liable for failing to train its employees to ensure the safety of students who had missed their buses.king further asserts that the district court erred in denying her motion to amend her complaint because nave had exercised his authority by meeting with jerica after school

king contends that she has met her burden by coming forward with evidence that,when taken in the light most favorable to her,raises a genuine issue as to the existence of an official policy prohibiting students from reentering the school after school hours without official supervision.the record reflects that,on the day following jerica abduction,king met with nave.when he was told that jerica had been denied reentry into the school,nave allegedly stated that it was not policy to allow students to reenter the school after school hours.further,in his deposition testimony,bluette stated that,although he was unaware of any written policy regarding the presence of students in the school building after hours,the practice at east louis senior high school was that students present at such times were required to be under a staff person supervision.
taken in the light most favorable to king,this evidence raises a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the hall monitor act
