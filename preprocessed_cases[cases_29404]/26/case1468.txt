plaintiff teri lackner lackner appeals from the summary judgment entered in favor of defendants cassidy bodine north north,a member of the chico high school ski and snowboard team,darryl bender bender who was north coach,chico unified school district chico,oroville union high school district oroville,and mammoth mountain ski area mammoth.
lackner brought this action to recover for personal injuries sustained at mammoth while she was standing in a largely deserted area at the base of an advance run used by skiers and snowboarders to stop and rest.as lackner was conversing with her husband,north,who had just sped down the run on his snowboard,headed directly towards her at a high rate of speed and crashed into her,causing her severe injuries.
the trial court granted defendants summary judgment finding,inter alia,that primary assumption of the risk bars their liability to plaintiff and that punitive damages are not recoverable against north.
on appeal,lackner contends the trial court erred by granting north motion for joinder,summary judgment,and summary adjudication because his motions were untimely and triable issues of fact remain as to whether his conduct was reckless and whether he acted with malice warranting punitive damages.lackner also contends the trial court erred in granting the remaining motions for summary judgment because primary assumption of the risk is inapplicable to the other defendants,and chico and bender are not immune from liability under government code section.
we find there are triable issues of fact on the question whether north conduct was reckless.we shall therefore reverse the judgment in favor of north.because lackner does not raise any claim of error as to oroville,we shall dismiss that portion of her appeal.we shall affirm the judgments in all other respects.
factual and procedural background 
a.the parties 
mammoth hosted the california nevada ski and snowboard federation state high school championships championships from march,through march.the event brought approximately high school participants.race participants were supposed to train for their respective events on the training courses designated for their event,although mammoth granted the participants unrestricted access to the entire mountain for free skiing and snowboarding.
north,an senior at chico high school and a member of the chico high school ski and snowboard team team,was a participant in the snowboarding championship.he was ranked in the top three on his team and was entered in the slalom and giant slalom events.this was his first visit to mammoth.bender was employed by chico as the head coach of the team and accompanied the team to the championship.
lackner and her husband were skiing at mammoth on sunday,march.lackner was an expert skier who had been skiing for years and had skied at mammoth over times.no public announcement was made about the championship and the lackners were unaware training activities were taking place that day.
sunday,march was designated as a training day for the championship participants.at approximately,bender told the team to go up and take several warm up runs,take it slow and easy and report down to the top of terry and fascination,where the actual race courses began.
the team took a gondola to the top of the mountain.north and three team members decided to begin their warmup by riding their snowboards down cornice bowl,which was not one of the designated training runs.the foursome chose this run because it was the highest one on the mountain and they wanted to check out mammoth from the top and have some fun.north had never been down cornice bowl before.
cornice bowl is a very steep run for advanced skiers.the bottom of the run flattens out into a natural gathering area,which leads to two other runs and a precipice referred to as hair jump.while the flat area of cornice bowl is not marked as an official rest stop,skiers and snowboarders frequently gather there to rest and regroup before continuing their descent to the bottom of the ski area where the ski lifts are located.
north and tyler frank began their descent about the same time,but north took the lead,coming down the run extremely fast and in a controlled tuck position.he appeared to be racing his other teammates,looking back more than once to see where the others were positioned,noting that frank was close behind him.
meanwhile,lackner and her husband had just completed a run down cornice bowl,which lackner had been down several hundred times.her husband completed the run ahead of her and was waiting for her in the flat area to the side of the run just above hair jump.when lackner reached the bottom,she traversed over to her husband and was standing there talking to him when north collided with her.at that time,she was facing away from the run and did not see north until he hit her.there was plenty of open space around her and the visibility on the mountain was clear.there were no obstacles between the lackners and someone descending cornice bowl.
north did not see lackner until he was about to feet away from her.at that time he attempted to swerve,lost control and crashed into her,catapulting the two of them feet into the air.the force was so great that lackner husband heard her bones crush.north and lackner slid down the mountain together,coming to rest in a gully at the bottom of hair jump.
north was not injured.lackner on the other hand,suffered severe injuries.the impact shattered her ankle and broke her lower leg into pieces.her right tibia and pelvis were fractured,the muscles and tendons in her thigh were torn,and she was bruised throughout her body.the surgeon who operated on her equated her bone fractures with those suffered in a car or motorcycle accident.
mammoth revoked north lift ticket pursuant to its policy to revoke a lift ticket when a skier or snowboarder engages in reckless conduct or fast skiing,or collides with another skier.north was also suspended from the championship.
lackner filed suit against north,bender,chico,oroville,and mammoth to recover damages for personal injuries.she alleged negligence and battery against north and seeks punitive damages from him.she alleged that bender,chico,and oroville negligently supervised north,and that mammoth negligently supervised the sports premises.
mammoth,bender,chico,and oroville moved for summary judgment.north moved to join their motions and filed a separate statement of undisputed facts and a separate motion for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim.the court granted all motions finding the primary assumption of the risk bars liability against all named defendants.additionally,the court found bender,chico,and oroville were immune from liability,and did not owe lackner a duty of care because north had no known propensity to ski recklessly or out of control and he was an adult.additionally,the court found no factual basis to show oroville was associated with or responsible for the team,north,or bender.
judgment was entered in favor of all defendants and lackner appeals from the judgment as to each defendant

istandard of review 
the standard of review for summary judgment is well established.the motion shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a moving defendant has met his burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit by establishing that one or more elements of a cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.

primary assumption of the risk 
the operative complaint alleges that north engaged in reckless conduct totally outside the range of ordinary activity involved in snowboarding and the remaining defendants were negligent in protecting lackner from the risk of harm that resulted in her injuries.on appeal,she contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against her because triable issues of fact remain as to whether defendants owed her a duty of care under the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk.defendants contend their liability to lackner is barred by that doctrine.we therefore turn to the general principles governing primary assumption of the risk.
general principles of law 
to establish a cause of action for negligence,plaintiff must prove defendants owed her a duty of care.wattenbarger cincinnati reds,th,d.the general rule of duty is that each person has a duty to use due care to avoid injuring others by their careless conduct,knight jewett cal th,d,knight and the duty owed by a property owner is to use due care to eliminate dangerous conditions on his or her property.rowland christian cal d.any exception to the general rule must be based on a clear public policy or statute.id.at,knight,supra,cal th at,d.the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk is one such exception.hamilton martinelli associates th,d.
with respect to that doctrine,the court in knight,supra,cal th at pages,d,explained that by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties relationship to the activity,the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the doctrine operate s as a complete bar to the plaintiff recovery.the court made clear that the question whether the defendant owes a legal duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk of harm does not depend on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the plaintiff action or on the plaintiff subjective knowledge of the specific risk of harm posed by the defendant conduct.id.at,d.rather,it turns on the nature of the sport and the defendant role in or relationship to the sport.id.at,d.
in knight,the plaintiff sued for injuries sustained in an informal game of touch football when one of the other players collided with her and stepped on her hand.the court held that the game of touch football comes within the primary assumption of the risk doctrine because the risk of colliding with another player resulting in injury is inherent in the game.the court noted that in the active sports setting,conditions or conduct that might otherwise be viewed as dangerous are often an integral part of the sport.although a defendant has no legal duty to eliminate or protect a plaintiff against risks inherent in the sport,the defendant owes a duty of due care not to increase the risks inherent in the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d.for example,while a ski resort has no duty to eliminate moguls because they are part of the sport of skiing,it has a duty to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe,working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm.knight,supra,cal th at,d.
the duty of care owed by participants in an active sport is to avoid intentionally injuring another participant or engaging in reckless conduct totally outside the range of the ordinary activity in the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d.the court in knight noted that in the heat of an active sporting event a participant normal energetic conduct often includes accidentally careless behavior.knight,supra,cal th at,d.as a result,careless conduct is treated as an inherent risk of the sport.id.at,d.the primary policy consideration of this limited duty of care is to avoid discouraging vigorous participation and fundamentally altering the nature of the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d,kahn east side union high sch.dist.cal th,d.
because the duty owed by a coparticipant under primary assumption of the risk is not necessarily the same as that owed by a resort owner,a coach,or a school district knight,supra,cal th at,d,galardi seahorse riding club th,d ratcliff san diego baseball club d,we separately examine lackner claim as to each defendant.
with sparse argument and little citation of authority,north contends he is not liable to lackner because he was only snowboarding down an advanced run at a fast but controlled rate of speed,which does not constitute reckless or intentional conduct.we disagree and find there is a triable issue of fact as to whether north conduct was reckless.
as stated,north is liable to lackner if he intentionally injured her or engaged in reckless conduct totally outside the range of the ordinary activity in the sport,so that a prohibition of the conduct would not deter vigorous participation or fundamentally alter the nature of the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d,freeman hale th,d bush parents without partners th,d.
primary assumption of the risk has been applied to a variety of active knight,supra,cal th,d,and sports alike ford gouin cal th,d,including football,baseball,hockey,snow skiing,and snowboarding,to name a few.see cases collected in moser ratinoff th,d.under primary assumption of the risk,an injured plaintiff was barred from recovering from a coparticipant after being hit by a carelessly thrown baseball ratcliff san diego baseball club,supra,d at,mann nutrilite,d,a carelessly extended elbow during a basketball game knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d,citing thomas barlow misc,and a swinging sail during a course change.stimson carlson th,d.
inadvertent collisions with coparticipants who carelessly cross paths are an inherent risk of many sports.cheong antablin,supra,cal th at,d,skiers mastro petrick th,d snowboarder and skier moser ratinoff,supra,th at,d bicycle racers distefano forester th,d motorcyclists staten superior court th,d ice skaters.
not all conduct engaged in during an active sport is excused under the doctrine,however.thus,primary assumption of the risk was not applied to bar the liability of a discus thrower who threw a discus into a playing field before determining that the target area was clear of another participant and warning her that he was about to throw.yancey superior court th,d.in yancey,the plaintiff was still on the playing field retrieving her own discus when her classmate,who was throwing next,threw his discus,which struck her in the head.in reversing summary judgment,the court found that unlike football or baseball,discus throwing is not a contact sport that requires that a ball or other article be propelled towards other participants.nothing about the inherent nature of the sport requires that one participant who has completed a throw and is retrieving his or her discus should expect the next participant to throw without looking toward the landing area.ibid fn.omitted.
in north view,this was a collision,the type inherent in the sport.we disagree.according to section of the restatement second of torts,one acts with reckless disregard for the safety of another if the actor does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do,knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize,not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another,but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.comment a to that section describes two types of reckless conduct.in both types,the actor knows or has reason to know of facts which create a high degree of risk of physical harm to another and deliberately proceeds to act or fail to act.however,in one type the actor proceeds in conscious disregard of,or indifference to,that risk.in the other the actor does not realize or appreciate the high degree of risk involved,although a reasonable man in his position would do so.an objective standard is applied to him,and he is held to the realization of the aggravated risk which a reasonable man in his place would have,although he does not himself have it.id.at,d.
north was an accomplished skier and advanced snowboarder who came to mammoth to participate in an interscholastic snowboarding championship.consistent with the skier responsibility code,he was taught that skiing is a dangerous sport,so he should stay in control,to give downhill skiers the right of way,to beware of skiers from above whenever merging or traversing,and to observe all signs and warnings.safety was always stressed.he was therefore aware that he was supposed to be looking for skiers downhill of him,as lackner was,and knew that colliding with another skier or snowboarder while going at a high rate of speed carries a high degree of risk of serious physical injury.
on the morning of the collision,he and his three teammates decided to go down cornice bowl,a run that north had never been down before and that was not a designated training run.he took the lead and came down the run at an extremely fast pace,maintaining a controlled race position,while looking back more than once to check the position of his teammates.
meanwhile,lackner had just completed her run down the cornice and had traversed over to her husband,who was standing to the left of the run in a flat area used by snowboarders and skiers to rest and regroup before taking off on a connecting run.visibility was good and there was nothing blocking north view of lackner.lackner was at a virtual standstill and conversing with her husband while north rode directly towards her with increasing speed,making no effort to alter his course until he was too close to avoid hitting her.the fact lackner husband heard her bones being crushed,and her massive injuries,is evidence of the tremendous force of the impact and the speed north was traveling when he hit her.
under these circumstances,there is a triable issue of fact as to whether or not the collision was inadvertent and unavoidable because north lost control of his snowboard as a result of a risk inherent in snowboarding.lackner evidence shows that the collision occurred because north was racing his teammates and was preoccupied with his position.as a result,he rode his snowboard into a rest area at a high rate of speed without looking where he was heading and despite the fact he was unfamiliar with the terrain and the ski area in general.however,visibility was excellent and the area was wide open.had he been paying attention to his surroundings and the few people standing in the area,he had the skill,and would have had the time and the space to avoid hitting lackner.
while racing down an advanced run is part of the thrill of snowboarding,intentionally speeding into a flat area at the base of an advanced run where people have stopped to rest,when one is unfamiliar with the area,without looking where one is going is not an integral and unavoidable part of the sport.north conduct is analogous to a freeway driver who exits the freeway without slowing down or looking for other cars that are also exiting.as a result,he crashes into one that has stopped and is waiting to turn onto a connecting street.lackner has therefore raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether north was reckless.
lackner contends mammoth breached its duty of care by creating a dangerous and defective condition that increased the risks inherent in skiing.it did this by failing to enforce and supervise the race participants use of ordinary ski runs and by failing to warn its patrons that race participants were permitted to train on ordinary ski runs 
in her complaint,lackner alleged that mammoth negligently operated,maintained,and controlled the slopes so as to create a dangerous condition.it did so by permitting race participants to practice on runs not designated for training or racing,failing to warn its other patrons that participants were authorized to train on ordinary runs,and failing to take other precautions for the safety of persons using the slope.
mammoth argues that because it has no duty to eliminate or protect lackner from a collision with a snowboarder,it did not owe her a duty to supervise racing participants such as north or to warn of their use of the slopes.we agree with mammoth.
duty to supervise race participants 
as stated,defendant has no legal duty to eliminate or protect a plaintiff against risks inherent in the sport.a defendant does have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d,solis kirkwood resort th,d.
the risks inherent in snow skiing have been well catalogued and recognized by the courts.those risks include injuries from variations in terrain,surface or subsurface snow or ice conditions,moguls,bare spots,rocks,trees,and other forms of natural growth or debris.they also include collisions with other skiers,ski lift towers,and other properly marked or plainly visible objects and equipment.danieley goldmine ski associates,d.connelly mammoth mountain ski area th,d bear mountain ski resort th,d.as a downhill snow sport,snowboarding shares these same risks.
owners and operators of recreational resorts and facilities also have a duty to warn their patrons of dangerous conditions the owner is aware of,but are not apparent to the patron.solis kirkwood resort,supra,th at,d harrold rolling ranch th,d operator of riding stable has a duty to warn patron if a horse has evidenced a predisposition to behave in ways that add to the ordinary risk of riding.
lackner cites no authority requiring a ski resort to personally supervise skiers who use their ski runs.in knight,supra,cal th at page,d,the court cited with approval several cases involving the duty owed by a stadium owner to a spectator.in those cases,the court defined the inherent risks,by looking not only to the nature of the sport,but to the steps the sponsoring business entity reasonably should be obligated to take in order to minimize the risks without altering the nature of the sport.quinn recreation park cal d,discussing separately the potential liability of a player and a baseball stadium owner for injury to a spectator shurman fresno ice rink d.thus,stadium owners have a duty to provide a certain measure of protection from errant balls by erecting screens that provide protection for a certain number of seats.quinn recreation park,supra.
however,as stated,the operator of a ski resort is not an insurer of its patron safety and has no duty to prevent or protect a skier from inherent risks of the sport.collisions with other skiers and snowboarders are one of those risks.mammoth can not be required to provide close supervision of skiers and snowboarders in order to protect other skiers from the risk of ordinary collisions.just prior to the collision,north was lawfully snowboarding down a black diamond run,conducting himself no differently than any other expert snowboarder descending an advanced run.because mammoth does not prohibit racing on its advanced runs and the run was largely deserted an employee on ski patrol would have had no duty to warn him to slow down while he was descending the run itself.that he may have been reckless at the bottom of the run does not alter mammoth duty of care in the absence of evidence mammoth knew or should have known north or other race participants were reckless harrold rolling ranch,supra,th at,d and no such evidence was presented moreover,because the area was largely deserted,there was no need for or duty to provide additional ski patrols at that time.
duty to eliminate or warn of a dangerous condition 
lackner also argues that mammoth created a dangerous condition by hosting the championship,which brought teenage skiers and snowboarders to the mountain,and allowing them to train on ordinary runs without providing additional ski patrols.this claim is based upon facts not supported by the evidence.
it is undisputed that mammoth hosted the championship event and that there were participants in that event.however,because the slope was largely deserted at the time of the collision and lackner injuries did not result from overcrowded conditions on the slope,any potential risk created by the championship in that regard can not provide the basis for recovery.
nor is there any evidence mammoth allowed race participants to train on ordinary runs or that north was in fact training on cornice bowl just prior to the collision.according to mammoth race director,the participants could train on a race course set up in an area designated for that purpose or they could go out and use whatever part of the mountain they would like to,but that would be considered training because there is no course set up.everybody free skis or boards outside of the race area.the cornice run was open to everyone and,as an advanced run,racing was not prohibited.
moreover,bender instructed the team to take a couple of warmup runs and meet him at the top of the training course.thus,formal training was to take place on the designated training courses.when north and his teammates descended cornice bowl,their instructions were to warm up.their own stated goal was to have some fun.however,aggressive play and rules violations are inherent in the sport.allan snow summit,th,d.because there is no evidence to show that allowing race participants access to ordinary runs increased the risk of injury on the slopes and that mammoth was aware of such increased risks,it was under no obligation to warn its patrons that race participants had free access to all of the runs.
bender and chico 
lackner contends genuine issues of material fact are in dispute as to whether bender and chico negligently supervised north because bender failed to accompany him on his warmup run.bender and chico contend they did not owe lackner a duty to supervise north because he was an adult at the time of the collision and he was not under their direct supervision they also argue that under the primary assumption of the risk doctrine,they owed no duty of care to lackner because they neither knew nor had reason to know that north had a tendency to snowboard in a reckless manner.we agree with defendants on the latter point and find that bender and chico had no duty to personally supervise north warmup run.
at the time of the collision,bender was the head coach of the team and was employed by chico.as a public entity,chico is not liable for injuries arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute,subd.a hoff vacaville unified sch.dist.cal th,d,hoff.by statute,a public entity is vicariously liable for any injury caused by its employee,subd.a and an employee of a public entity is liable for his torts to the same extent as a private person,subd.a hoff,supra,at,d.
thus,a school district is vicariously liable for injuries proximately caused by the negligence of school personnel responsible for student supervision.hoff,supra,cal th at,d,quoting dailey los angeles unified sch.dist.cal d.because chico liability is dependent upon bender liability,we next consider whether bender owed lackner a duty of care.
under primary assumption of the risk,coaches and instructors,like owners and operators of commercial recreational activities,are not insurers of an athlete safety.the duty owed by a coach to a student in his charge is to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d,balthazor little league baseball,th,d fortier los rios community college dist.th,d.
however,lackner was not in bender charge and she has cited no authority holding that a coach duty to his charge includes a duty to supervise the charge in order to protect a third person from injury.nor do we find any such duty.
under the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk,bender had no duty to protect lackner from the inherent risk of colliding with a member of his team and there is no evidence bender increased the risks inherent in the sport.his instructions to his team sunday morning to take several warmup runs slow and easy,and report to the top of the training courses can hardly be said to have increased the risk of collision with other skiers and snowboarders.nor did bender have a duty to expressly advise the team to confine their racing activities to racing and training courses and to refrain from racing on courses.as we have found,north was not formally racing or training on cornice bowl.to the extent lackner reference to racing means speeding,an instruction to refrain from racing or speeding was implicit in bender instruction to take it slow and easy.
lackner relies on hoyem manhattan beach city sch.dist.cal d,lehmuth long beach unified sch.dist.cal d,and leger stockton unified sch.dist.d.as authority that bender had a duty to supervise north.these cases are inapposite because they do not involve a injured by a student.
as a general rule one has no duty to control the conduct of another,and no duty to warn those who may be endangered by such conduct.citations.a duty may arise,however,where a a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person conduct,or b a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives the other a right to protection.rest d torts,citations.hoff,supra,cal th at,d.
a special relationship exists between a student and a school district that gives rise to a duty to supervise at all times the conduct of the children on the school grounds and to enforce those rules and regulations necessary to their protection.hoff,supra,cal th at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.t he amount of care due to minors increases with their immaturity and consequent heedlessness to danger.satariano sleight d.no supervision is required where the school has no reason to think any is required.leger,supra,d at.
however,in hoff,supra,cal th at page,d,the court held that a school district duty to supervise its students does not extend to protect a from injuries caused by a student.in so holding,the court concluded that school officials who neither know nor reasonably should know that a particular student has a tendency to drive recklessly owe no duty to.id.at,d.
hoff is dispositive.bender had no reason to think north required close and direct supervision of his warmup.north was an old high school senior who was an expert snowboarder,participating in the state championships.he had no known history of collisions or reckless conduct on the slopes and was well regarded as a responsible team member.bender never saw north engage in skiing or snowboarding activity bender considered reckless or unsafe,nor was he aware that reckless activity took place bender gave clear instructions to north and the rest of the team to take a couple of slow and easy warmup runs before reporting to the training course.under these circumstances and having given these instructions,bender had no duty to personally supervise north on his warmup and can not be faulted for failing to instruct the team to confine their racing activities to the training course.
punitive damages 
lackner contends her claim for punitive damages against north should be reinstated because his motion for summary adjudication was untimely and triable issues of fact remain on this claim.north contends his motion was timely because it was at least days prior to the continued hearing date.he does not respond to the merits of lackner claim.
we agree with north that his motion was not untimely.we also find the trial court properly found the evidence does not support a claim for punitive damages 
timeliness 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a requires that notice of a motion for summary judgment and the supporting papers must be served on all other parties to the action at least days before the time appointed for hearing.however,if the notice is served by mail,the required period of notice shall be increased by five days if the place of address is within the state of california we shall refer to this rule as the requirement.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision f authorizes a party to move for summary adjudication of one or more claims for damages and such motions are subject to the same procedural requirements governing motions for summary judgment.code civ,subd.f.north was therefore authorized to move for summary adjudication of lackner claim for punitive damages de castro west chodorow burns,superior court th,d and was subject to the notice requirement.
north motion for joinder and summary adjudication is dated august.the record does not include proof of service.the hearing on the motion was originally set for september.however,on august,lackner moved to continue the hearing date to january,on the grounds she needed additional time to conduct discovery and prepare her opposition to north motions.she did not identify north motion as a ground for her request.the court granted her motion in part and continued the hearing to october.north filed his motion days before this rescheduled hearing date.it was therefore timely,even if we allow an additional five days to account for service by mail.code civ,subd.a.
nevertheless,lackner contends,without citation of authority,that her motion to continue the hearing is separate from the requirement and therefore has no effect on the date the motion must be served.we disagree.
the purpose of the service requirement is to allow the parties time to prepare their opposition and replies and to prepare for the hearing.prior to,the time for serving notice of a motion for summary judgment was days before the hearing on the motion.code civ,subd.a stats,ch.in,section was amended by senate bill to increase the time for service of notice to days prior to the hearing.stats,ch.
the legislative history discloses that the purpose of this amendment was to provide the responding party with adequate time to conduct discovery that may be necessary to fully respond to the motion assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,and to ensure that all evidence is before the court before it rules on the motion.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august.
here,plaintiff,as the responding party,requested and was granted a continuance of the hearing date in order to complete discovery and prepare her opposition.this request clearly falls within the purpose of the requirement.we therefore conclude the notice requirement is measured from the date notice is served to the date of the actual hearing,and not the originally scheduled hearing.
this conclusion is consistent with cases applying a related time requirement.in addition to the requirement,subdivision a of section also requires that the motion be heard days before trial.in applying that requirement,the courts have held that it is satisfied if the hearing is held days prior to the actual trial date rather than the originally scheduled trial date.soderberg mckinney th,fn,d trial court may properly hear summary adjudication motion after first trial date where matter continued several times see also green bristol myers d.
because the effect of the continuance was to give lackner at least days to prepare her opposition,we are satisfied the rule was met.nor does she claim she was prejudiced by north late filing.beroiz wahl th,fn,d responding party must show prejudice from late service.although she raised the issue of timeliness in her opposition papers,she did not allege then that she was prejudiced by the late filing of the motion.because it appears she fully responded to north motion for summary adjudication of her punitive damages claim,we reject her claim of error.
north conduct was not despicable 
lackner contends the evidence raises a triable issue of fact as to whether north acted with malice or oppression under civil code section hereafter section.we disagree and conclude no reasonable juror could find his conduct was despicable.lackner claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law.
in north statement of undisputed facts he relied on three facts to support his motion for summary adjudication on the question of punitive damages north did not intentionally try to run into plaintiff,north attempted to avoid the accident,and north was in control as he descended the run.the undisputed evidence also establishes that just prior to the collision,north threw his snowboard in a very aggressive sideways turn in an effort to slow down as quickly as possible,but was unable to do so and collided with plaintiff.
although lackner disagrees with north characterization of the evidence,she does not actually dispute these facts.in her supplemental separate statement,she sets forth additional facts north traveled straight down the cornice at an extreme rate of speed in a tuck position,north looked several times during his descent to see whether his teammates were behind him,north crashed directly into her,causing her severe injuries,the collision occurred while lackner and her husband were resting at the bottom of cornice bowl right above hair jump,an area used by many people to rest.on appeal,lackner argues that these facts raise an inference that north conduct prior to the time he saw her created a probability of danger,but he proceeded with his conduct nonetheless.we do not disagree with this statement.by itself,however,it is insufficient to show malice.
section,subdivision a authorizes an award of punitive damages in noncontract actions where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression or malice
