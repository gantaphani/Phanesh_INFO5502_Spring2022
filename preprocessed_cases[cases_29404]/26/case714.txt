in these two cases,which we have consolidated solely for the purpose of issuing our opinion,certain parties are seeking to enjoin the illinois state board of education isbe from promulgating and implementing new rules on special education teacher certification.the reid parties are minor children enrolled in illinois public schools outside of chicago they all have been classified by their respective school districts as having disabilities,within the meaning of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.the corey parties are their counterparts within the city of chicago.
after a great deal of litigation,which we describe below,the district court entered a remedial decree designed to bring the illinois system of special education teacher certification into compliance with various requirements of the idea,particularly its directive that students be educated in the least restrictive environment,see a.the two appeals before us represent the efforts of the reid parties to prevent the new rules developed pursuant to the district court order from entering into effect or,if necessary,to roll them back.the reid appeal arises from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the rules from going into effect on july.the reid parties and certain teachers also tried to intervene directly in the corey litigation the corey appeal is brought by the intervenors to challenge the denial of their motions to intervene.we conclude that the district court did not err either in refusing to enjoin the new rules or in denying the reid parties attempt to intervene in the corey case we therefore affirm.
in order to place the present dispute in context,we must look back a quarter of a century to the way in which children with disabilities have received their education in the chicago public schools.in,congress passed the education for all handicapped children act,which for the first time required that children with disabilities be educated with the least restrictive accommodations possible.in,congress replaced that statute with the idea.in the meantime,however,chicago had done little to change the way in which it handled the education of the affected students.briefly put,it relied heavily on categorization of both students and teachers,and had little flexibility for or individualized arrangements.
on may,the corey plaintiffs and their parents,acting on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated disabled students attending the chicago public schools cps,filed an action in federal court against the board of education of the city of chicago,the superintendent of the board,and the illinois state board of education,claiming that the defendants had failed to provide students with disabilities who attended the cps with a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment,as mandated by the idea,a and.the chicago board and the isbe opposed class certification,but the district court disagreed and certified the corey class on february,at the same time denying the defendants motion to dismiss.
four years later,on february,the corey plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,in which they alleged that the isbe violated the idea by failing to ensure that an adequate supply of qualified special education teachers and related personnel was available and properly trained.on july,joint experts hired by all the parties in corey issued a report.their report concluded that the current certification system for special education teachers was in part responsible for the failures in the education of the affected children.that system employed eight disability categories learning disabilities,disorders,educable mentally handicapped,trainable mentally handicapped,physically handicapped,impaired,of hearing,and speech language handicapped.the report described this system as archaic and asserted that the current certification system results in categorical service delivery,limits the way staff can be used and limits involvement in general education the experts reported also that the certification system improperly supported the segregation of students with disabilities according to their disability category and unlawfully limited the educational environment in which they were placed.
in september,the corey plaintiffs and the chicago board reached a settlement,which the district court preliminarily approved on october.the district court ordered the parties to provide notice of the settlement,and it then held a fairness hearing on january.that settlement was finally approved on that day,and its terms are not part of the present controversy.
what continued after that settlement was the question of the isbe liability.as to that part of the case,the corey parties and the isbe proceeded to trial on october.see corey board of education of the city of chicago.on february,the district court found in favor of the plaintiffs on the liability question,holding that the isbe had violated the least restrictive environment mandate of the idea.id.the court findings specifically singled out the categorical system of special education teacher certification as a contributing factor to the violation.accordingly,the court ordered the isbe to develop rules and regulations for teacher certification that would bring the state into compliance with the statute.
rather than appealing the liability decision,the isbe and the plaintiff parties entered into settlement discussions with respect to remedies.their efforts bore fruit a year later,and on march,the district court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement,and ordered notice and a public hearing which was scheduled for june.the notice was disseminated widely throughout both chicago and the state it elicited hundreds of written comments on the settlement.importantly,people from throughout the state of illinois responded,many with objections.among the responders was the illinois education association iea,the principal teachers organization in illinois,which submitted a letter through its president,bob haisman.
although the corey litigation concerned only the chicago public schools,it was obvious that the teacher certification issue would affect the entire state.illinois has long since done away with separate teacher certification standards for chicago and the rest of the state,and thus to fix matters for chicago inevitably meant a change in statewide standards.see ilcs no person shall be employed to teach any class or program authorized by this article children with disabilities unless he has had such special training as the state board of education may require.at the start of the hearing,in fact,the district court advised the participants that if they had wished to have a more formal voice in the content of the settlement agreement,they should have moved earlier either to intervene or to submit a brief amicus curiae.nevertheless,there was extensive testimony from interested parties.
on the same day that the fairness hearing was held,june,the district court entered an order approving the settlement between the corey plaintiffs and the isbe.the settlement agreement covered a number of topics,including monitoring procedures and policies,services,funding policies,and,central for present purposes,teacher certification.instead of having the court draft the detailed remedial plan,the parties agreed that isbe would have the primary responsibility to develop special education teacher certification rules,in cooperation with the cbe and the plaintiffs.any such rules were subject to the court retained jurisdiction to ensure that any plan eventually adopted was consistent with the permanent injunction the court had already entered against isbe forbidding further violations of the idea.see corey.at.
the isbe set out to do just that.even before the settlement agreement had been approved,in,the isbe began working with illinois parents,advocates for students with disabilities,and educators,to revamp these teacher certification rules.it created two advisory panels,which conducted a dozen public statewide hearings on the issue.the panels also sent proposed certification standards to numerous outsiders,including teachers,universities,and professional associations,for their comments.in october,the panels submitted their report to the isbe,recommending that the existing eight categories be reduced to five.because opinions still conflicted so strongly on the best way to achieve the goals of the idea,however,the isbe then convened another blue ribbon task force,which met in february to develop recommendations for certification of special education teachers.that task force suggested combining the five categorical certificates learning disability,disorder,educable mentally handicapped,trainable mentally handicapped,and physically handicapped into two new for learning behavior specialist adapted curriculum focus,and the other for learning behavior specialist modified curriculum focus.in addition to these two recommendations,the iea and the illinois special education coalition submitted a proposal recommending retention of the eight categorical certificates and adding a new certificate.
at this point,the isbe realized that it was decision time.the diversity of views that were before it made it clear that the board was not likely to find a consensus solution that made everyone happy.in coming up with its final proposal,it took a number of factors into account,including the fact that many students disabilities touch several of the old categories,the need to train teachers properly for any new system that was implemented,the impact of any new system on the supply of special education teachers,the impact of any new system on the ability of local school districts to deliver services to disabled students,the length of time needed to implement any new system,and the effect of a new system on existing teachers.the isbe staff accordingly developed its own option,which contemplated one certificate learning behavior specialist,or for all the former categorical certificates learning disability,as mentioned above,and separate certification for specialists in teaching students who have vision impairments,hearing impairments,or early childhood or disorder.this was the proposal the isbe submitted for the approval of the district court.
the court had appointed a monitor to assist it in overseeing both the chicago board and the isbe compliance with their respective settlement agreements.the monitor accordingly submitted comments on the isbe proposed certification rules on june.in those comments,the monitor suggested that the certification rules should be submitted as peremptory rules to the joint committee on administrative rules jcar in the illinois general assembly a legislative support services agency created under illinois law,see ilcs.see also ilcs describing peremptory rulemaking.on september,the district court accepted the monitor recommendation and ordered the isbe to file its proposed certification rules as peremptory rules under the illinois administrative procedure act.it concluded that this was proper because these rules were required as a result of federal law,federal rules and regulations,or an order of a court,see ilcs,not as a consent order or other court order adopting settlements negotiated by the agency,see id.isbe never would have taken action had it not been for the court february decision on liability and the remedial order that followed.
on october,the isbe published the certification rules under its peremptory rulemaking authority.the rules identify specific common standards that all special education teachers must master,as well as standards for those who want the certificate.at that point,however,a at the state level emerged.in january,jcar suspended the rules,claiming that they constituted a serious threat to the public interest and welfare.the district court judge then met with the corey parties and certain members of the illinois general assembly to decide what to do.these efforts at consensus also failed,however on february,jcar again announced that the rules were suspended.on february,exercising the power to act independently of the isbe altogether that it had reserved in both the ruling on liability and in the settlement agreement,the court ordered the isbe to implement the rules immediately without referral to jcar.the illinois general assembly also attempted to stop the implementation of the rules,voting to continue indefinitely the suspension of the rules and passing a joint resolution of both houses on may.
at the same time,the court ordered the isbe to conduct public hearings on another set of rules,the rules for transition to the new special education certification structure transition rules.the transition rules outlined the procedure for teachers holding certificates under the old system to become requalified as holders of the certificate.essentially,they created a grace period for such teachers,giving them time to acquire any additional training they might need.during that interim period,no illinois school district would be permitted to assign a transitional teacher to teach students outside his or her prior categorical certificate.as ordered by the court,the isbe held public hearings on the transition rules in march.it received extensive comments.as a result of those comments,isbe proposed splitting the certificate into two general curriculum and differentiated curriculum,but the district court refused to do so.
on june,the court ordered the isbe to implement the transition rules.we now turn back to the parties who are attempting to challenge these results from the corey case the plaintiffs in the reid litigation who are also the proposed intervenors in the corey case,which allows us to refer to them simply as the reid parties.on may,the reid parties a group of special education teachers and students who live outside the boundaries of the chicago public school district,and are hence nonmembers of the corey class filed a motion to intervene in the corey litigation.their motion alleged that the isbe had violated the idea,the and amendments to the constitution,and the illinois administrative procedure act when it promulgated both the certification rules and the transition rules.on august,the district court denied the reid students motion to intervene on august,it denied the reid teachers motion to intervene.appeal is from those orders of the district court.
meanwhile,on june,the reid parties filed a separate action for declaratory and injunctive relief c in the district court.the complaint in the injunction action contained exactly the same allegations as the motion to intervene.the district court denied the reid parties request for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order on june,appeal in this court concerns that order.we consider first the reid parties arguments with respect to their motions to intervene we then turn to their effort to obtain injunctive relief.
in remarks delivered in open court,the district court gave several reasons for denying the motions to intervene,either of right or permissively.first,he found that the reid parties filed their motion too late the individual named intervenors knew about the case for a long time.the case has been extensively publicized throughout the state.i can certainly take notice of that,because it all came out in the fairness hearing back in june of,more than two years ago.timing alone,the district court found,was enough to deny the motion.in that connection,the court also noted the active role that the iea was playing in the reid effort and commented that had they tried to intervene back before all the work was done,they would have had a better argument.the court expressed concern for the finality of its order and found that to allow the proposed intervention would unravel results that had been reached since february of,the date of its original decision on liability and its general injunction against the isbe.at that early date,the court had identified the need for certification of special education teachers in order to comply with the idea and its least restrictive environment mandate.
in addition to these central concerns,the court also indicated that it did not believe that the proposed intervenors had shown that they had standing to sue,in that they were asserting only a generalized interest in a sound educational system.next,it stated that the intervenors had failed to demonstrate that their interests had not been adequately represented by an existing party,namely,the isbe which,the court noted,had opposed the corey plaintiffs on the liability merits,and then opposed them at the remedies stage for a long time.finally,the court found that the intervenors had failed to show that their rights or interests would be impaired by anything in the corey settlement.placement decisions for students would continue to be made on a basis,pursuant to each child individual education plan and teachers had no interest in refusing to tailor their continuing educational training to the requirements of the new system,which ensured that no one would be decertified.
intervention of right 
there are four requirements for intervention of right under.a,in the absence of a statute giving an absolute right to intervene timeliness,an interest relating to the subject matter of the main action,at least potential impairment of that interest if the action is resolved without the intervenor,and lack of adequate representation by existing parties.see commodity futures trading comm heritage capital advisory,cir.the burden is on the party seeking to intervene of right to show that all four criteria are met.keith daley,cir.if not,then the district court must deny intervention of right.see united states acres of land,cir.
here,the principal ground on which the district court relied to deny the motion is expressly recognized by the rule timeliness.as it had long since entered its decree,the court relied on people who care rockford bd.of,cir,to find that the presumption against intervention at that late date was sufficiently strong to defeat the effort of the reid parties to do so.the reid parties take exception to the court characterization of them as latecomers to the event.they insist that they acted as soon as they realized that the certification rules were indeed going to be applied on a basis and that the legislature would not be able to protect their interests.they point to february,as the critical date,because it was then that the district court ruled that the illinois general assembly could not nullify its remedial order.they also point out that the rules had not yet been implemented at the time of their intervention motion.
we see no flaw in the district court conclusion that the reid parties waited too long before attempting to intervene.timeliness is fundamental not only to intervention,but to the overall conduct of a lawsuit,and it is a clearly spelled out requirement of rule.the purpose of the timeliness requirement is to prevent a tardy intervenor from derailing a lawsuit within sight of the terminal.sokaogon chippewa community babbitt,cir internal quotations omitted.in order to decide whether a motion to intervene was timely,we look at factors like the length of time the intervenor knew or should have known of her interest in the case,the prejudice caused to the original parties by the delay,the prejudice to the intervenor if the motion is denied,and any other unusual circumstances.ragsdale turnock,cir.
these motions were filed nine years after the corey litigation began more than two years after the district court opinion finding the isbe liable and singling out the teacher certification standards as a particular violation of the least restrictive environment rules and more than ten months after the court approved the settlement agreement that formed the basis for the work leading up to the certification rules and the transition rules.these events provided ample notice to the reid parties that their interests might be implicated in the isbe response to the court orders.to the extent that they are arguing that the standard requires that their interests have been impaired beyond any remedy,they are wrong.indeed,just as we rejected this kind of argument in sokaogon chippewa,we reject it here.see at.the time to intervene was,at the very latest,when the remedial process began,ten months before the actual motion.that was when the rules were being drafted and publicly discussed that was when their input could have been received without undoing the long and difficult process that all other parties to this litigation had been pursuing in good faith.even if we were to consider the ten months to be the only relevant delay,we could find no error in the district court determination,as a decision about timeliness is reviewed for abuse of discretion.vollmer publishers clearing house,cir.the supreme court in new york,d found that even a delay made the motion untimely as it was incumbent upon the appellants,at that stage of the proceedings,a critical stage to take immediate affirmative steps to protect their interests.at.
the district court conclusion that the other parties to the litigation would suffer prejudice if the reid parties were entitled to intervene is also well supported on this record.this case is close to completion,after a decade of litigation in the federal courts.if the reid parties were allowed to enter now,everyone would be forced to return to square one,with the same old certification rules in place,the same old problems under the idea,and no remedy in sight.the district court correctly noted that our decision in people who care strongly discourages such measures.see also united states south bend community school,cir.this is true notwithstanding the fact that the reid parties will be disadvantaged to the extent that they will have lost the chance to urge isbe to implement a system more like the old one they are losing.but any such loss is of their own making it is perfectly clear that they knew about this litigation and were content to participate on the sidelines for a long period of time.theirs is not the kind of prejudice that should weigh in favor of a motion for intervention.since there are no other unusual circumstances counseling in favor of intervention,we conclude that the district court was justified in denying the motion on the ground of untimeliness.
even assuming that untimeliness was not enough to bar the claim,intervention as of right would still not be appropriate.the reid parties argue that they have asserted the kind of substantial interest in the new certification rules that would justify intervention,claiming that their interest is exactly the same as that of the corey plaintiffs themselves an interest in the most effective system for teaching children with disabilities consistent with the idea.at that level of generality,of course,they are correct.but the new element the seek to introduce into the case is more parochial they wish to urge that the new rules will force them to change in ways that they regard as undesirable.the students among the reid group wish only to argue that a different solution to the proven violation would have been preferable.the teachers interest is far afield from the core concerns of the idea,which as we have already said are to assure the best appropriate education for students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment.as for the students,while they may have had a valid interest while the new rules were being drafted,now that the rules have been embodied in a decree the picture is different.once the new rules are implemented,the violation of the idea should be redressed.at that point,the reid students have merely a disagreement about pedagogical theory with the corey plaintiffs.such a vague concern is not enough to support intervention of right.thus,at either a high or low level of generality,the reid students claim for intervention fails if it is a general interest in illinois compliance with the idea,that is taken care of by all the parties in the corey litigation already if they are concerned only with the specifics of the new certification rules,they have no independent interest in the details of their teachers certification,once the remedial order brings such certification in compliance with federal law.
we also see no independent interest the reid intervenors can assert in the specific procedures that were used to develop the new rules it is plain on th
