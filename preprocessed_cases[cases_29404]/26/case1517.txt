aaron katz owns property that straddles two school districts.one of them,the los joint union school district district,refused to enroll children living at katz property.that prompted this legal action by katz.at the pleading stage,the district successful demurrer was followed by katz successful appeal to this court.following our remand,katz prevailed at trial.the district now appeals.
at issue is whether the education code requires a school district to admit children who live on property that lies only partly within the district geographic boundaries.the question is one of first impression.
based on our interpretation of the governing statute,we conclude that the district must enroll pupils residing at the property.we therefore affirm the judgment.
katz owns property at bonnet way in saratoga,which is improved with a single family home.the katz property straddles the school district boundary line,with most of it lying in the neighboring campbell union high school district.only about percent of the property and three percent of the home are located within the district boundaries.
katz property has been assigned two different parcel numbers for tax assessment purposes parcel and parcel.the two assessor parcels that comprise the property are divided by a tax rate area line,which forms the district boundary with the neighboring campbell school district.parcel lies to the east of the line,in the campbell school district.it includes most of the house and it has been assigned all of the assessed valuation for improvements.parcel is located to the west of the line,within the district boundaries.the district receives a portion of the real property taxes generated from the smaller parcel.under the applicable school funding formula,the district depends on local property taxes for most of its funding.
in july,katz then tenants attempted to enroll their son in one of the district high schools,but the district denied their application.this action ensued.
procedural history 
in august,katz petitioned the superior court for a writ commanding the district to admit to its schools children currently and subsequently living at his property.in addition to the writ,katz sought a judicial declaration of eligibility for admission.katz also alleged estoppel against the district,based on its history of enrolling high school age children living at the katz property.finally,katz sought monetary damages for negligence.
the district demurred,katz filed an amended petition,and the district demurred again.katz declined to amend further.
the trial court sustained the district second demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that katz had not exhausted available administrative remedies for boundary changes.the court entered a judgment of dismissal in october.
on appeal by katz,we affirmed the dismissal as to two causes of action but reversed as to the other two.katz los union high school district,nonpub.opn.
in our partial affirmance,we concluded that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action,which asserted the right to declaratory relief on the ground of estoppel.we reasoned that katz had failed to state an estoppel claim because the district has discretion to change its interdistrict transfer policy.katz los union high school district,supra,at nonpub.opn.we also affirmed the judgment of dismissal as to the fourth cause of action,which sought damages for negligence.as to that cause of action,we determined that katz had failed to present the district with an adequate claim for damages before filing suit,as required by the government tort claims act,et.katz los union high school district,supra,at,nonpub.opn.
we reversed the judgment dismissing katz education code claims for writ and declaratory relief.with respect to the second cause of action,which sought a declaration of eligibility for enrollment under the education code,we observed that katz had not sought a boundary change.we concluded that katz was entitled to a judicial determination of whether children residing in his its current entitled to attend district schools.katz los union high school district,supra,at,fn.omitted nonpub.opn.we also said depending on how the trial court answers this question,katz first cause of action seeking a petition for writ of mandate may also remain viable.we express no opinion on how the trial court should fulfill its obligation to interpret the statute,at,fn.we remanded the matter to the trial court to make that determination,at.
after the case was returned to the superior court,katz filed a second amended petition.the petition contained causes of action for declaratory and writ relief under the statute.the petition also sought statutory attorney fees,based on allegations that the district had abused its discretion in refusing his property residents admission to its schools.
in june,the trial court conducted a bench trial.the court received testimonial and documentary evidence and entertained written and oral argument before taking the matter under submission.the court rendered its decision shortly thereafter,granting katz most of the relief he sought.
in its statement of decision,the court identified education code section,former subdivision d d,as the applicable statute that section reads in part as follows notwithstanding section,a pupil shall be deemed to have complied with the residency requirements for school attendance in a school district,provided he or she is d a pupil who lives in the home of a caregiving adult that is located within the boundaries of that school district.d.the court found the language of that provision clear and unambiguous.nevertheless,the court stated,to the extent it is susceptible of two interpretations,the court must construe section d liberally in favor of petitioner.under the court construction of the statute,children living at katz property are within the district boundaries and thus have the right to attend district schools.consequently,the court concluded,katz is entitled to the relief he seeks by way of declaratory judgment and a writ of mandate from the court.
with respect to other issues raised at trial,the court found that katz had not proved either that the district acted arbitrarily and capriciously or that it should be equitably estopped.katz was awarded his costs of suit as the prevailing party,but no attorney fees.
in july,the court entered judgment in accordance with its statement of decision.
the district filed this timely appeal from the judgment.katz did not appeal.
issues,contentions,and standards of review 
interpretation of the education code 
the sole issue raised by the district appeal is whether katz property is located within its boundaries for purposes of enrollment under the education code.
based on its reading of the statute,the district contends that it has no duty to admit children living at the katz property,because both the land and the residence lie mostly in the neighboring school district.katz disagrees.he maintains that the education code mandates enrollment so long as any part of his property lies within the district boundaries.
the interpretation of statutes presents a question of law for our independent review.burden snowden cal th,d.as the matter is a question of law,we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court interpretation.citations.ibid.
ii.attorney fees 
katz seeks remand to the trial court for its consideration of an award of attorney fees under the private attorney general theory.code civ.the district argues that katz is barred from presenting that request here,and it maintains that the fee request has no merit in any event.
the threshold determination of katz right to remand on the fee question is one of law.the decision concerning timeliness of the request turns on an interpretation of the governing statute.see marini municipal court d.but the ultimate determination of entitlement to such fees is left to the trial court discretion.see,woodland hills residents,city council cal d,austin board of retirement d.lack of entitlement decided as a matter of law.
discussion 
education code analysis 
we first consider the statutory question presented by the district appeal.we begin our analysis by setting forth the familiar rules of statutory construction.we then review the statutory background,giving particular attention to those provisions of the education code that govern this controversy.finally,we apply the principles of statutory interpretation to the governing law.
principles of statutory construction 
the rules governing statutory construction are well established.our objective is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.city of huntington beach board of administration cal th,d,accord,mejia reed cal th,d.
in determining legislative intent,we first look to the statutory language itself.mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature lungren deukmejian cal d.but the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose ibid.furthermore,where a word of common usage has more than one meaning,the one which will best attain the purposes of the statute should be adopted,even though the ordinary meaning of the word is thereby enlarged or restricted and especially in order to avoid absurdity or to prevent injustice.citation.people ex rel.bay.com.town of emeryville cal d.
the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations,fair employment housing com.cal d.thus,every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and have effect.moore panish cal d,see also mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d,city of huntington beach board of administration,supra,cal th at,d.where several codes are to be construed,they must be regarded as blending into each other and forming a single statute.citation.accordingly,they must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.citation.tripp swoap cal d,overruled on another point in frink prod cal d,accord,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.
when an examination of statutory language in its proper context fails to resolve an ambiguity,courts turn to secondary rules of interpretation,such as maxims of construction,which serve as aids in the sense that they express familiar insights about conventional language usage.singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed,fn.omitted see,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.courts also may turn to the legislative history of an enactment as an aid to its interpretation.see,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d,halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d see generally singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,supra,extrinsic history,ch.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at,accord,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.
if ambiguity still remains after resort to secondary rules of statutory construction,courts cautiously take the third and final step in statutory construction and apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.halbert lumber,lucky stores,supra,th at,d see also,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.as both parties observe,a statute should be interpreted to produce a reasonable result the consequences of any particular interpretation must be considered.citation.anderson union high sch.dist.schreder d.absurd results are to be avoided.day city of fontana cal th,d,see also,interpretation must be reasonable.
with the foregoing principles in mind,we turn to the issue at hand.to establish the proper framework for our analysis,we begin with an overview of the education code,briefly describing its development and structure.
b.the statutory background 
development of the education code 
the education code was derived from the school code.see historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.preceding.that predecessor code was enacted in to provide for the establishment,government,maintenance and operation of the public school system of the state of california.stats,ch.it collected most of the existing law relating to schools,which until then had been scattered in several codes and in various uncodified session laws.historical and statutory notes,west ann,supra,preceding.the school code remained the basis of school law until when its provisions were recodified into the education code.ibid.subsequent recodifications followed in and again in,citing stats,ch,stats,ch,as amended by stats,ch.the changes to the code were effective april.
structure of the education code 
the education code is organized into three titles.see west ann,supra,education code analysis,xxiii.title of the code contains its general provisions.the parties cite only one provision from title section,which deals with changes to school district boundaries.title addresses elementary and secondary education.title is organized into three divisions state administration,local administration,and instruction and services.the latter division contains the provisions whose meaning is contested here.title concerns education and has no relevance to the question before us.
applicable provisions 
in support of their respective statutory construction arguments,the parties cite numerous sections of the education code as well as several provisions from other codes two education code sections are of particular importance here.
section is part of the compulsory education law.see.it requires each parent,guardian,or other person having control or charge of a pupil to send the pupil to school for the full time designated as the length of the schoolday by the governing board of the school district in which the residence of either the parent or legal guardian is located.
section embodies the general rule that parental residence dictates a pupil proper school district.by the terms of education code section,a pupil is eligible to enroll in a public school maintained by the governing board of a school district in which the pupil parent resides.anselmo glendale unified school dist.d.section generally requires that children attend school in the district where the residence of either the parent or legal guardian is located,supra,at a pupil whose parents live in one school district may not attend school in another district by living with friends.
section applies notwithstanding the provisions of.
the section as a whole thus embodies exceptions to the general rule of parental residence as the determinant of school district enrollment.see,supra,at,fn.subdivision d of section establishes one such exception for a pupil deemed residency in the home of a caregiving adult that is located within the boundaries of that school district.
governing provision 
throughout this litigation,the parties have focused on section d as the provision that governs this controversy.following the parties lead,the trial court did so also.in the first appeal,we did the same.
now,however,we question the assumption that section d applies to the question presented here as we explain,on closer analysis,it does not appear that the legislature intended the phrase caregiving adult to include parents.we draw that conclusion principally from the history of section.
the amendment to d added the caregiving adult language.from its legislative history,it appears that the amending legislation was intended to facilitate a form of limited purpose guardianship,which is created by a nonjudicial process designed to be less costly and cumbersome than the judicial process required to establish full guardianships.see generally,review of selected cal.legislation pacific law journal,review of selected legislation relative caregiver care authorization guardianship of th,d there is no statutory authority for a limited guardianship providing for visitation rights to a nonparent.the same legislation that amended d also added two family code sections.stats,ch,adding.with the addition of those provisions,the family code permits caregiving adult relatives to seek medical attention for children in their care.upon compliance with the statute affidavit requirements,the caregiver shall have the same rights to authorize medical care and dental care for the minor that are given to guardians,subd.a,italics added.the statute thus recognizes a category of caregivers other than guardians.the section goes on to provide that a caregiver decision to consent to or to refuse medical or dental care for a minor shall be superseded by any contravening decision of the parent or other person having legal custody of the minor,subd.c,italics added.the significance of that provision here lies in its implication that not in the category of caregivers.to the same effect,a notice in the caregiver affidavit form advises that the declaration does not affect the rights of the minor parents or legal guardian regarding the care,custody,and control of the minor,italics added.just as caregiving adults may authorize medical care under the family code,so too may they enroll their charges for school under the education code.d.the effect of that education code provision is that a child is a resident of a school district if the home of the caregiver is in the district.review,supra,pacific law journal at,citing d,fn.omitted.given the history,purpose,and content of the legislation that simultaneously introduced the phrase caregiving adult into the education code and the term caregiver into the family code,it is clear that the statutory reference is to persons other than parents and guardians.that conclusion is further borne out by an examination of the earlier version of d.
the amendment to section d replaced the original version of that subdivision.the earlier version provided for deemed residency in a district for any pupil whose parent or legal guardian has established the residence of the pupil in a home located within the boundaries of that school district,provided such home is properly licensed as required by law.former d see stats,ch.juxtaposed against the general rule of school attendance in the district of the parents residence,that section provided t he only possible exception that would relate to a voluntary placement of a child in a home other than the home of the parents.but there the home would either have to be licensed by,as a foster home or be exempted from such licensure,supra,at,fn,italics added.thus,even the earlier version of the statute addressed situations where pupils were residing with persons other than their parents or guardians,even though those persons were not then called caregiving adults.
to sum up,we conclude that the phrase caregiving adult in section d means persons other than parents and guardians.since this case involves children living with their with d does not govern here.instead,the applicable provision is section,which ties school district enrollment to parental residence.
harmonizing the provisions 
notwithstanding our conclusion that section governs this controversy,section d nevertheless bears on our analysis.as a matter of statutory construction,when possible,sections of the education code bearing on the same subject must be read and construed together.citations.santa barbara federation of teachers santa barbara high sch.dist.d.sequoia union high school dist.aurora charter high school th,d the foregoing rule of construction does not apply to an unambiguous statute.
both sections concern residence within a school district for purposes of admission.section makes a somewhat oblique reference to residency,strongly not directly the proper school district for enrollment is that in which the parent residence is located.despite its obliquity,the wording of the section citations thus defines the school district to be attended by that in which the parent resides.citation,supra,at.section d addresses residency more directly.it establishes deemed compliance with a school district residency requirements for a pupil who lives in the home of a caregiving adult that is located within the boundaries of that school district.d.
as relevant here,there are two linguistic differences between the two sections residence versus home and in versus within a district.section speaks to whether the parent residence is located in the district.section d is concerned with whether the caregiver home is located within the boundaries of the district.
we find those linguistic differences to be insignificant in the context of this dispute.it is a rule that the legislature will not be presumed to have used inconsistent provisions as to the same subject in the immediate context.in re irr.dist.d.thus,as a matter of statutory construction,if the terms we are considering have similar meanings which may be applied to them without doing violence to the language of the statute we should adopt those definitions so as to do away with apparent inconsistencies in the act.southern pacific riverside d,legislature intended to use statutory terms land,real property,and property synonymously.we therefore construe section and section d as consistent provisions.for purposes of resolving this controversy,we disregard the minor differences in word usage between the two provisions that relate to residence within a school district.
analysis construing the statute 
applying the rules of statutory construction described above,we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d,accord,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt,or uncertainty,then the language controls.citations.there is nothing to interpret or construe.citations.halbert lumber,lucky stores,supra,th at,d.the first question,then,is whether the statutory language is ambiguous.
the parties disagree on the question of ambiguity.consistent with katz view of the statute,the trial court found it clear and unambiguous.however,the court added,if it is susceptible of two interpretations,the court must construe section d liberally in favor of katz.the district takes issue with that determination.the district first argues that the trial court erred to the extent it liberally construed the statute in katz favor.the district also maintains that the trial court conclusion that the statute is not ambiguous contradicts the law of the case established by our prior opinion.
the law of the case doctrine cited by the district precludes a party from obtaining appellate review of the same issue more than once in a single action.when a reviewing court states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision,that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress,both in the lower court and upon subsequent appeal,tally ganahl cal,see also people stanley cal th,d,accord,people shuey cal d.
in order for the doctrine to apply,the point of law involved must have been necessary to the prior decision and the matter must have been actually presented and determined by the court,citations.people shuey,supra,cal d at.for that reason,the first logical step is to identify what we did and did not decide in the first appeal.ibid.
in our prior decision,we did not analyze section at all.with respect to section d,we observed by his declaratory relief action,katz asks the court what the words a pupil who lives in the home of a caregiving adult that is located within the boundaries of that school district means.does within mean entirely within partially within more than percent within does home mean that the home is within the boundaries or that the property upon which the home is located is within the boundaries in the annotated codes,there are no reported cases interpreting this statute,ascertaining its meaning.katz los union high school district,supra,at nonpub.opn.although our questions suggest that we found section d ambiguous,we did not actually decide that issue.to the contrary,we stated we express no opinion on how the trial court should fulfill its obligation to interpret the statute.katz los union high school district,supra,at,fn.nonpub.opn.
we now decide that both section and section d are ambiguous.first,the words in and within as used in those provisions are susceptible of more than one meaning.the word within is not a word of art with but one has a variety of meanings according to the connection in which it is used.town of alexandria clark county.as used in this context,it reasonably could mean either entirely within or only partially within school district boundaries.citizens for hatton canyon california of trans.th,d phrase in the coastal zone could mean either partly or entirely within.furthermore,the statutes use of the terms residence and home likewise render them reasonably susceptible of several meanings.does the statute require the residence itself to lie entirely or partially in the district or is it sufficient that some part of the land on which the residence sits is within the district boundaries 
because the statutory language is ambiguous,we are called upon to construe it.our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d,accord,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.
statutory purpose 
the education code does not explicitly set forth its overall purpose,which set forth the state policy against discrimination.but it does state the code establishes the law of this state respecting the subjects to which it relates,and its provisions and all proceedings under it are to be liberally construed,with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice.
as the cases recognize,the code primary aim is to benefit students.in interpreting legislation dealing with our educational systems,it must be remembered that the fundamental purpose of such legislation is the welfare of the children.citations.santa barbara federation of teachers santa barbara high sch,supra,d at.
interpretation 
we interpret the disputed language of the statute,keeping in mind its overriding purpose of serving the welfare of the state children through compulsory education.
a.the meaning of in and within 
as the trial court construed section d,the katz home is within the district boundaries,even though most of the house lies in the neighboring school district.
we similarly construe section.we conclude that the legislature intended that section use of the word in to include a residence that is even partly within school district boundaries.we therefore reject the proposition that a residence must lie entirely or even mostly within the district boundaries as a predicate for mandatory enrollment.
first,we believe,it is untenable to construe in as meaning entirely within,since any residence that straddles two school district lines can not be wholly within either.the statute commands that all children who are subject to compulsory education shall attend school in the district where their parents reside.given that legislative mandate,all pupils must be located within one school district or another if there is one.any person who is eligible to attend high school and who does not reside in a high school district or in a unified school district may attend high school in any high school district or unified school district in the county in which he or she resides or in another county.
moreover,in our view,it is equally untenable to adopt the district preferred construction that in means mostly within.citing the principle of harmonious construction within the statutory scheme as a whole,the district urges us to construe the relevant enrollment provisions with reference to section.that section provides in part where boundary lines are corrected or relocated,the relocation of the new lines shall be made in such a manner that the majority of the area of the parcel or property affected determines the district in which the parcel or property is located.
according to the district,section identifies the legislative intent that a property is deemed to be located within a school district boundary where the majority of the property lies.we disagree.while section may reflect the legislative purpose underlying boundary changes,it does not necessarily reflect the legislative purpose underlying compulsory education mandates.although the two sections are part of the same code,they are not part of the same title.the boundary change law is contained in title of the education code,among its general provisions.the compulsory education provisions are found in title.more importantly,although section and section both allude to school district boundaries,the two provisions address fundamentally different concerns.the establishment or relocation of a district territorial subject of section largely a local political question,whose resolution is left to the county board of supervisors.and,town of alexandria clark county,supra,at territorial limits of a political subdivision is a political question.by contrast,compulsory subject of section a matter of constitutional magnitude with statewide implications.since,the california constitution has provided a general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people,the legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual,scientific,moral,and agricultural improvement.cal.and as our high court observed nearly years ago the public schools of this state are a matter of statewide rather than local or municipal concern their establishment,regulation and operation are covered by the constitution and the state legislature is given comprehensive powers in relation thereto.hall city of taft cal d,see also piper big pine school dist.cal,dawson east side union high school dist.th,d recognizing substantial local control over curriculum and incidental matters city of santa clara santa clara unified sch.dist.d.under,school districts must comply with local zoning ordinances that provide for the location of public schools.in short,section and section do not address the same primary concerns.for that reason,we do not ascribe the assumed policy underlying the boundary change provision to the provision embodying the mandate for compulsory education.
moreover,adopting the district position would require us to add words to the statute.our function in construing section is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,code civ.we may not insert words into a statute under the guise of interpretation citation.schroeder irvine city council th,d.the statute uses the word in without any qualifier it does not say mostly in.of course,neither does the statute say partly in.town of alexandria clark county,supra,at.but in this case,liberally interpreting in to mean partly within results in a construction that is most faithful to the overriding legislative policy that all children enjoy the benefits of free public education.citizens for hatton canyon california of,supra,th at,d consistent with the legislative objective of protecting the coast,in the coastal zone means partly within people mejia,supra,th at,d consistent with legislative intent underlying criminal statute,in the school zone means partly within.
under our construction,then,even though only a small part of the house lies within district boundaries,the katz residence is located in the district for purposes of school enrollment under section.contrary to the district arguments regarding residency,the statute does not require us to inquire which part or how much of the house lies within the district.gray,absent more satisfactory proof,voting residence is where one sleeps east montpelier city of barre,situs of residence is determined by the location of that part of the structure most closely connected with the primary purposes of a dwelling teel regional school dist,despite the general rule that one resides in the jurisdiction in which he sleeps,pallet and intent did not control,given that only a small triangle of the house where the children rotated sleeping was within the defendant school district turner city bd.of ed.of city of mayfield,affirming that defendants whose houses are more than half and as much as within the city are city school district residents.for purposes of construing the statute before us in the factual context presented,it is sufficient that some part of the place where the parent resides is located within the geographic territory of the district beyond that,we are not called upon to interpret the word residence as used in the statute or to consider whether it means the same thing as domicile,dwelling,abode,or habitation.
avoiding absurd consequences 
resisting our chosen interpretation of the statute,the district first cites the principle that courts must select a construction that avoids absurd consequences.see,day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d.the district asserts that the chosen interpretation leads to absurd results,in that katz property tax dollars fund a different district residents of the katz property have no right to vote in the district elections and the majority of the katz home and property lie in another district.
with respect to the property tax issue,while we are sympathetic to the district economic plight,we do not agree that adverse funding consequences render the construction absurd.our high court long ago confirmed that lack of available funding for students with a right to admission is a consequence for which courts are not responsible.the economic question is no doubt an important matter to the district,but it may very properly be addressed to the legislative department of the state government.piper big pine school,supra,cal.at,indian child entitled to attend state school.furthermore,implicit in the provisions permitting interdistrict transfers is the understanding that a school district may be required to educate certain students even without receiving corresponding property tax revenue.see,subd.e,which permitted the admission of students residing in state hospitals located within a school district,subd.f,which permitted a district to refuse to accept pupils whose parents are employed by the district if the additional cost of educating the pupil would exceed the amount of additional state aid received as a result of the transfer turner city bd.of ed.of city of mayfield,supra,at the solution of the question of residence of a child for purpose of attending school is not to be found always in the site of the property for taxation,either generally or for school purposes.
nor do we find that any deprivation of district voting privileges renders the construction absurd.again,implicit in the statute permitting interdistrict transfers is the contemplation that pupils may be educated in a particular school district,even though their parents do not have suffrage rights in that district.see,subds.b interdistrict transfer,c emancipated pupil,f parent employed in the district turner city bd.of ed.of city of mayfield,supra,at place of residence for school district attendance does not mean legal domicile in the technical and narrow sense of residence of a person for purpose of taxation or suffrage.
we likewise disagree with the district final claim of absurdity,which is based on the fact that the majority of the katz home and property lie in another district.we have already explained our determination that in means partially within for purposes of this statute.as we recently recognized in another context,that is not an absurd construction.citizens for hatton canyon california of,supra,th at,d same construction with respect to the coastal zone is neither absurd or against all common sense see also people mejia,supra,th at,d same construction is a commonsense application of penal code provision.
administrative interpretation 
at trial,the district offered an opinion authored by counsel for the santa clara county office of education,which addressed the question of the proper interpretation of section.that opinion states although the education code does address the determination of legal residence under split parcel circumstances,we believe that school districts and county offices of education are required,as a matter of common sense if nothing else,to make such a determination of legal residency.when making this determination we look at criteria such as the district in which the registrar of voters determines the residents vote the district in which the house is sited and the district in which the greatest portion of property or assessed valuation is located.with respect to the katz property,the opinion concluded,according to our criteria,the address is within the campbell union high school district.on appeal,the district argues that the opinion is entitled to great weight,as an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering.katz disagrees.as a factual matter,he contends,the county office of education is not charged with administering the enrollment statute.as to that point,katz cites trial testimony from a district employee as to her belief that the county office of education does not determine the property boundary lines but only the changes to those lines.as a legal matter,he argues,the opinion improperly usurps the judicial imperative of statutory interpretation.
we must determine what legal effect to give the opinion.for purposes of resolving that question,we will assume without deciding that the county office of education opinion constitutes an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering.as we explain,however,we conclude that the opinion is not entitled to any deference by this court.
an agency interpretation of the meaning and legal effect of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts however,the binding power of an agency interpretation of a statute or regulation is contextual its power to persuade is both circumstantial and dependent on the presence or absence of factors that support the merit of the interpretation.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,italics omitted.unlike rules,an agency interpretation does not implicate the exercise of a delegated lawmaking power instead,it represents the agency view of the statute legal meaning and effect,questions lying within the constitutional domain of the courts.but because the agency will often be interpreting a statute within its administrative jurisdiction,it may possess special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues.it is this expertise,expressed as an interpretation,that is the source of the presumptive value of the agency views.id.at,d.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.citation.id.at,d.
in this case,we find the county office of education opinion to be of little worth.two of the three criteria on which it resident voting precinct and the property ratio of assessed no support in the statute.because it effectively alters or enlarges the terms of the statute,the opinion does not govern the decision here.traverso people ex rel.of transportation th,d.nor do we find it persuasive.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
d.other authority 
finally,we are not persuaded by the district citation of secondary sources and authority from other jurisdictions.as we previously explained,given the legislative policy underpinning the compulsory education statute,we need not consider what percentage or which rooms of the katz house are situated within the district territory.thus,for purposes of interpreting section,we do not subscribe to the view that a home location is determined by where its inhabitants sleep.gray,supra.at,teel regional school,supra,at.nor do we agree with the district that conformity with case law and common sense demands application of the restatement rule for split parcel cases,which usually assigns legal situs where the major portion of the dwelling place is located rest d conf.of laws,com.h.giving the compulsory education law the liberal co
