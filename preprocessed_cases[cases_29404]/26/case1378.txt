the petition also alleges that,on august,the union filed a grievance against the district.the grievance alleged that the district had violated article,sections and of the collective bargaining agreement in connection with the locke high school conversion.the grievance asserted the district had violated the collective bargaining agreement by not presenting the complete charter to employees not giving ample time to permit affected employees and the community a reasonable opportunity to review and discuss the plan not giving the union a copy of the proposed charter for review and not clearly and fully disclosing the conditions of employment with the charter school.the district denied the union grievance on december.to comply with step of the grievance procedures,the union sent a letter dated january,to the district.the union subsequently requested arbitration of the dispute by letter dated january.the district refused to submit to arbitrate the controversy.the union points and authorities argued government code section,which is part of the educational employment relations act,permits an aggrieved party to an arbitration clause to file a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to code of civil procedure section there was no dispute about the validity of the collective bargaining agreement the trial court jurisdiction was limited to determining whether there was an arbitration agreement,a refusal to do so or an exception to the duty to arbitrate and the arbitrator must decide the substantive merits of the dispute.

iii.discussion 
the district asserts the union lacks standing to pursue the grievance because neither the charter school operator nor locke high school staff are parties to the collective bargaining agreement.the determination of standing to compel arbitration of a controversy is a legal question.bouton usaa,cas.ins.th,d smith microskills san diego th,d.we conclude the union had standing to file the petition to compel arbitration.
code of civil procedure section provides that the court should compel arbitration o n petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate subject to specified exceptions.code of civil procedure section,subdivision e states in part party to the arbitration means a party to the arbitration agreement who seeks to arbitrate a controversy pursuant to the agreement.the general rule is that a party or signatory to an arbitration agreement may seek to enforce it.bouton usaa cas.ins,supra,th at,d city of hope bryan cave,th,d.it is undisputed that the district and the union are both parties to the collective bargaining agreement.the union is seeking to enforce provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.the union and the district are in a dispute about a provision of the collective bargaining agreement.thus,one party to an agreement to arbitrate is seeking to enforce the arbitration clause against another signatory.code civ,subd.e,melander hughes aircraft d.see also bouton usaa cas.ins,supra,th at,d.
the district nevertheless argues that the union has no standing to compel arbitration.the district argues neither the charter school nor the union members are a party to the collective bargaining agreement.government code section,which is part of the educational employment relations act,provides in part,any employee organization shall have standing to sue in any action or proceeding heretofore or hereafter instituted by it as representative and on behalf of one or more of its members.government code section confers standing on a labor union to represent its members.professional fire fighters,city of los angeles cal d,disapproved on a different point in bishop city of san jose cal d,fn,labor union has standing to represent members california school employees tustin unified school dist.th,d union had standing to seek relief on behalf of employees other than the specific aggrieved employee anaheim elementary education board of education d.standing to sue extends to former members even if the union is no longer the exclusive bargaining representative international union of auto.workers of human resources dev.d.union had standing to represent its members in an action which is inseparably founded upon its members employment california school emp.sequoia union high school dist.d.union had standing to sue on behalf of cafeteria employees who were dismissed after cafeteria operation discontinued california school employees.willits unified school dist.d,et gave union standing to sue to enforce employment rights of its members including formerly employed janitors.thus,the union has standing to pursue the claims raised by the petition to compel arbitration.

the present dispute arises in the context of an arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement.as such,the controlling statute is government code section which states,where a party to a written agreement is aggrieved by the failure,neglect,or refusal of the other party to proceed to arbitration pursuant to the procedures provided therefor in the agreement or pursuant to an agreement made pursuant to section,the aggrieved party may bring proceedings pursuant to title commencing with section of part of the code of civil procedure for a court order directing that the arbitration proceed pursuant to the procedures provided therefor in such agreement or pursuant to section.san mateo city school dist.public employment relations bd.cal d,south bay union school dist.public employment relations bd.d,fn.government code section is part of the educational employment relations act which was originally adopted in.stats,ch,et see pacific legal foundation brown cal d.code of civil procedure section states,a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the trial court has authority to compel arbitration pursuant to code of civil procedure section which provides in part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement code of civil procedure section further provides in part,if the court determines that a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy exists,an order to arbitrate such controversy may not be refused on the ground that the petitioner contentions lack substantive merit.the statutory provisions set forth in this paragraph control the outcome of this case.
doubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute should be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,vianna doctors management th,d.however,the right to compel arbitration depends upon the existence of a valid contract between the parties.county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d marsch williams th,d.the question of whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists is determined by reference to state law applicable to contracts generally.doctor associates,casarotto,d engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.california has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street cal d.but there is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which parties have not agreed to arbitrate.freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,cione foresters equity services,th,d.the moving party has the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration clause and the dispute is covered by the agreement.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d,rosenthal great western financial securities cal th,d.if the moving party meets the foregoing burden,the opposing litigant has the responsibility to prove by a preponderance of the evidence any defense to the petition.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d,rosenthal great western financial securities,supra,cal th at,d.in the absence of any disputed historical facts,we review the order denying the petition to compel arbitration de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,valentine capital asset management,agahi th,d.
the district contends the trial court properly concluded that the article of the collective bargaining agreement was preempted or invalidated by section,subdivision e.the district asserts that the collective bargaining agreement provision governing the charter school petition process can not be reviewed by an arbitrator.therefore,the district argues the arbitration agreement can not be enforced.in this vein,the district argues an arbitrator can not enforce article of the collective bargaining agreement,which delineates the procedures to be followed in the case of a charter school conversion,because of section,subdivision e.we respectfully disagree.
the district is arguing the union position concerning its members rights under the collective bargaining agreement has no merit because of the dispositive effect of section,subdivision e.but the merits of a dispute,such as the effect of section,subdivision e,must be resolved in the first instance by the arbitrator.whether there is a meritorious defense to the enforcement of the article was not properly raised as a defense to the petition to compel arbitration.code civ,california correctional peace officers state of california th,d see service employees international union,local department of personnel administration th,d.and the arbitrator is authorized to decide the merits of the district section,subdivision e defense.
rather,at this stage,our determination and that of a trial court is limited to whether there was a valid agreement to arbitrate.code civ,california correctional peace officers state of california,supra,th at,d see also engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d,rosenthal great western financial securities,supra,cal th at,d.arbitrators are authorized to resolve statutory claims.this includes interpreting statutes and considering statutory defenses.broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,moncharsh heily blasé,supra,cal th at,d,california correctional peace officers state of california,supra,th at,d.this includes the district section,subdivision e defense.
the present case is similar to the scenario in california correctional peace officers state of california,supra,th at pages,d.in california correctional peace officers,the union asserted that could participate in meet and confer sessions involving supervisors and.when management refused to permit negotiations to occur in the presence of others,the union filed a petition to compel arbitration.id.at,d.management resisted the petition arguing that government code section,subdivision c excluded supervisors from participating in meet and confer meetings with employees and.id.at,d.the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration because the dispute was governed in its view by government code section,subdivision c.ibid.
our colleague,associate justice sandra lynn margulies,held the petition to compel arbitration should have been granted.associate justice margulies explained p arties to a dispute have agreed to arbitrate the dispute,section requires arbitration unless the agreement is revocable or arbitration has been waived.further,there is a strong public policy favoring arbitration.citation.there is no statutory exception for arbitrations presenting issues
