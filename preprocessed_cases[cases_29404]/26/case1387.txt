in this case we hold that education code section undesignated statutory references are to the education code renders null and void the last chance agreement agreement under which community college faculty member sam farahani waived his statutory due process rights relating to faculty discipline.the san diego community college district district terminated farahani after he allegedly violated his agreement with the district.the trial court granted farahani petition for writ of mandate code civ,ruling that the agreement violated the education code and farahani due process rights.the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section directing the district to reinstate farahani with full back pay,interest and benefits and require its governing board to determine whether farahani should be terminated,all in compliance with the requirements of the education code,including appropriate notice and opportunity to be heard.the district appeals.
in addition to concluding that farahani purported waiver of the right to a hearing in the agreement and attached general and special release and settlement agreement release were unenforceable under section,we also reject the district claim that farahani petition was barred by laches,unclean hands,and the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
farahani was a tenured professor of international relations and public policy at mesa college.he had worked for the district for years prior to his termination in june.
beginning in,the district received complaints from female students and staff about what they described as unwanted sexual and social advances.in october,after investigating some of these complaints,the district gave farahani a written reprimand advising him that continued misconduct would result in discipline up to and including termination.
on september,the district sent farahani written notice of hearing suspension.the notice cited the basis for the recommended suspension without pay as a continuing pattern of inappropriate behavior toward students and employees over several years.the notice informed farahani that he had the right to respond to the proposed discipline either orally or in writing or both.
the matter did not proceed to the hearing stage.in november,the attorney for the american federation of teachers guild,california federation of teachers local union presented farahani with the agreement,and told him that the district would suspend him for a year without pay unless he signed it.among other things,the agreement and release provided that farahani accept a reduction of pay equivalent to one month salary and for a period of months agree to refrain from conduct that constituted sexual harassment,including any verbal,physical or visual conduct on campus,and from personal contacts communications with students off campus.the agreement stated that if farahani failed to comply with its provisions,he could be terminated at the chancellor discretion,without the issuance of charges under the education code or district policies and without right of appeal the release included the following provision farahani waives any and all appeal rights he may otherwise have to challenge the discipline or otherwise pursue any appeal relating to the notice.
district faculty members are covered by the collective bargaining agreement between the district trustees and the union.article xiv,section of the collective bargaining agreement provides that all faculty are eligible for a hearing prior to any disciplinary action involving loss of pay.when encouraging farahani to sign the agreement,the union attorney told farahani that although the agreement was probably not legal,it would be best to g ive your months and get it over with.although farahani believed that the charges were baseless,he stated he was compelled to sign by two bad options.
while the agreement was in effect,the district received new complaints about farahani from female employees.constance carroll,the chancellor,concluded that farahani conduct towards these women constituted unwanted social advances which could create an uncomfortable work environment conduct which could be considered sexual harassment.she terminated farahani effective june,pursuant to the agreement.the termination letter stated,since you are being terminated from employment because of a violation of the agreement,you do not have a right of appeal.
farahani wrote members of the district governing board,requesting reinstatement and an opportunity to meet.he received no response.farahani attorney wrote carroll on july,demanding farahani reinstatement plus backpay and benefits.the district response reiterated that farahani was not entitled to the issuance of formal charges or right to appeal his termination under the provisions of the agreement.
farahani filed his petition for writ of mandate on march.

ii.the agreement 
the district argues that the agreement and release included all the elements of a valid contract,farahani signed them voluntarily on advice of counsel,and neither document was unlawful or against public policy.we begin with the dispositive question whether the agreement and release were invalid and unenforceable,as found by the trial court.
the education code sets forth due process rights granted to community college faculty members in disciplinary matters,including the right to notice,opportunity to object,a hearing before an arbitrator or administrative law judge,and a decision by the governing board.the first paragraph of section expressly provides except as provided in section,any contract or agreement,express or implied,made by any employee to waive the benefits of this chapter or any part thereof is null and void.the district contends that section is inapplicable to the agreement and release signed by farahani,which it describes as a waiver in response to discipline.we conclude that the district interprets section too narrowly and there was no error in the trial court ruling.
