parents who unilaterally remove their child from public school because they believe that the special education services provided for the child are inadequate are entitled to tuition reimbursement for the costs of the private school placement under some circumstances.under the amendments to idea,such parents generally should give prior notice to the school system of their rejection of the proposed iep and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at public expense,or,failing that,must meet one of the four exceptions to the notice requirement.a c iii iv.here,the notice requirement was not met,but claims that she falls within two different involving illiterate parents and the other involving the school system failure to meet its own notice obligations.id.a c iv i iv.the due process hearing officer found as a matter of fact that did not come within either exception and so denied the claim for tuition reimbursement.the hearing officer did allow her to receive reimbursement for the costs of an evaluation and tutoring during fifth grade year those costs are not at issue.on appeal by from the hearing officer adverse tuition reimbursement holding,the district court agreed with the hearing officer that she was not entitled to tuition reimbursement because she had failed to give notice and that failure was not excused.we too agree and affirm.

in,enrolled her son,at longfellow school.had completed his kindergarten year at his previous school,but repeated it at longfellow because he exhibited significant speech,language,and attentional deficits.in his second year at longfellow,while he was in first grade,teacher became concerned that was still making inadequate progress and referred him to a pupil evaluation team pet.that team consisted of mother and grandparents,teacher,the principal of longfellow school,a psychological examiner,a special educator,and a speech therapist.the pet identified a large gap between intellectual abilities and his academic performance and concluded that suffered from a learning disability and was eligible for special education services.
the pet developed an iep for second grade year,which provided for to be taught in a regular classroom and to receive eight hours a week of supplemental special education services.over the course of the next few years,the pet gradually increased the amount of special education services that received his third grade iep provided for eleven hours of special education support a week,his fourth grade iep for fourteen hours a week,and his fifth grade iep for nineteen hours a week.despite the school focus on his learning problems,continued to struggle academically throughout his time at longfellow.in third grade,a learning strategist observing in the classroom noted that had difficulty with reading skills and needed direct instruction.his tutor concluded that,at the end of third grade,reading comprehension was greatly limited and was an initial stage reader.at the start of fourth grade year,the school determined that reading and writing skills remained only at first and second grade levels.it also found that had delayed language and phonological processing skills.later that year,failed to meet three of the five benchmarks on a maine standardized test,and only partially met the other two.
in november of,during fifth grade year,and her brother,tom,presented the pet with a written statement of concerns about progress was assisted by her brother because she suffers from a learning disability similar to her son.following the meeting,obtained the assistance of donna verhoeven,an educational advocate with the disabilities rights center in maine,who supplemented earlier list of concerns with a written request for a publicly funded independent evaluation of.the pet reconvened in january,and again in february,to discuss concerns.the pet,which included,tom,and donna verhoeven,decided to increase special education services to over twenty hours a week,provide him with homework assistance at before school started,and start planning educational services for over the summer.the team also agreed to have independently tested by,a psychologist,as had requested.finally,the pet briefly discussed the educational services that would be provided to in his sixth grade year.
