iii.discussion 
liberty motion 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting liberty motion to quash service of summons because liberty purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in this state,and plaintiff cause of action would not have arisen but for liberty contacts with this forum.
standard of review 
when a defendant moves to quash service of summons for lack of specific jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of demonstrating,by a preponderance of the evidence,facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.once the plaintiff meets this initial burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.when the evidence is not in conflict,whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.snowney harrah entertainment,cal th,d,snowney.
california courts may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitutions of the united states and california.code civ.federal constitutional due process requirements dictate that a foreign defendant must have minimum contacts with the forum state such that maintenance of suit against the foreign defendant in the forum state would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citations.international shoe washington.if a defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum state,it may be subject to suit there on all claims,wherever they arose general jurisdiction.if the defendant contacts with the forum state are not sufficient to support general jurisdiction,the defendant may nonetheless be subject to special jurisdiction,which depends on an assessment of the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d see also vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons.
plaintiff does not contend that liberty contacts with the state of california were sufficient to confer general jurisdiction over liberty.we therefore examine whether liberty contacts with the state were sufficient to establish special jurisdiction.
a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits citation the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum citations and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice citations.citation.snowney,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiff argues that his case is governed by state of oregon superior court th,d state of oregon,overruled in vons,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d.in state of oregon,the court found specific personal jurisdiction over the state of oregon,oregon state university osu based on osu head coach having visited a basketball player at his high school campus in california to recruit the player for osu team.as a result of the recruitment efforts,the player decided to attend osu.id.at,d.he returned to california because of academic ineligibility,and he suffered a stroke while playing a game.he was treated in california and was advised to refrain from athletic activity until he was medically cleared.ibid.the player mother spoke with osu trainer,who gave assurances that if the player returned to osu,he would be given the best available medical care,and osu would find out the underlying problem because it had the best doctors and best treatment.id.at,d.when he returned to osu,his anticoagulant medication was reduced,making him eligible to play.ibid.while in los angeles to play against ucla and usc,the player suffered a stroke while playing basketball and died.id.at,d.the court applied a but for test to analyze the nexus between osu contacts with california and the injury suffered.id.at,d.the court held that because osu had undertaken recruitment activities directed at a specific california resident,and therefore could reasonably expect to be subject to liability in california for injury resulting from those activities.due process demands no more.ibid.
state of oregon is easily distinguishable on its facts.the alleged injury in that case was directly related to the university contact with california,and the plaintiff was in fact injured in california.state of oregon,supra,th at,d.
more importantly,the california supreme court overruled state of oregon in vons.the vons court stated,w e are not persuaded that the but for test provides an appropriate general standard,and consequently the reasoning of state of oregon and other cases is disapproved to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.vons,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
plaintiff contends,however,that state of oregon was overruled only in the context of ongoing franchise relationships,and its but for test remains good law in other contexts.the court stated in vons,we are not persuaded it is productive to focus upon whether the injury would have occurred but for the forum contacts,at least when an ongoing franchise relationship is the forum contact.vons,supra,cal th at,d.
the california supreme court has more recently clarified that it intends to broadly apply the test announced in vons.in snowney,supra,cal th at page,d,the court stated that after reviewing case law and policy considerations in vons,it had adopted a substantial connection test and held that the relatedness requirement is satisfied if there is a substantial nexus or connection between the defendant forum activities and the plaintiff claim.citation.we therefore conclude that state of oregon no longer is good law with respect to its but for test for personal jurisdiction.
we first examine whether liberty purposefully availed itself of the benefits of doing business in california such that it could expect to be subject to the jurisdiction of california courts.snowney,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiff argues that not only did liberty recruit plaintiff in california and offer him a scholarship,the agreement for which plaintiff executed in california,but also liberty recruited defendant lancaster in california to play football for liberty.in addition,liberty routinely recruits student athletes in california,and there are seven male students from california playing sports at liberty.finally,plaintiff argues that liberty web site advertises an online degree program that allows students from any state to take courses.
plaintiff has provided no evidentiary support for his contention that lancaster was recruited in california plaintiff cites only to his own argument in opposition to liberty motion to quash to support that contention.moreover,liberty having seven california students on its team rosters provides no basis for special jurisdiction over liberty in california because no showing was made that those students were recruited in california.plaintiff has provided no evidence that liberty has enrolled any california residents in its online degree program.thus,the only conduct plaintiff has established was that liberty recruiting coordinator visited plaintiff in california to recruit him to play football for liberty,and thereafter,liberty mailed plaintiff a scholarship agreement and amended scholarship agreement that plaintiff executed in california.that conduct does not establish purposeful availment.
in examining the second prong of the test for specific jurisdiction,the relatedness requirement snowney,supra,cal th at,d,we find that the controversy is unrelated to and does not arise from liberty contacts with california.plaintiff claims are for personal injuries based on alleged activities that took place entirely within virginia.
plaintiff argues,however,that snowney supports a finding of jurisdiction.however,like martin and state of oregon,snowney is distinguishable on its facts.snowney was a class action brought by a california resident against a group of nevada hotels alleging causes of action for fraudulent business practices,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and violations of business and professions code section et,based on the conduct of the hotels in failing to provide notice of an energy surcharge imposed on hotel guests.snowney,supra,cal th at,d.although the hotels did not conduct business in california and had no bank accounts or employees in california,they advertised heavily in california and received a significant portion of their business from california residents.id.at,d.the court held both that the conduct of the hotels established that the hotels purposefully and voluntarily directed their activities toward california such that they should expect to be subject to california courts jurisdiction based on their
