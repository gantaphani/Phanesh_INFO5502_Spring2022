calworks,which stands for california work opportunity and responsibility to kids welf,is the renamed and otherwise amended version of california former aid to families with dependent children afdc program.stats,ch,legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.see arenas san diego county bd.of supervisors th,d.like the former state afdc,calworks is funded in part by its federal counterpart et,now known as temporary assistance for needy families tanf.
calworks is administered by the department of social services the department.calworks provides aid and services to families with related children under whose parent or parents can not support them due to death,incapacity,incarceration,unemployment,or continued absence from the home,subds.a c.section is the only exception to the cutoff of aid at age.
section provides 
aid may not be granted under the provisions of this chapter to or in behalf of any child who has attained the age of unless all of the following apply a the child is less than years of age and is attending high school or the equivalent level of vocational or technical training on a basis.b the child can reasonably be expected to complete the educational or training program before his or her birthday.italics added.
section,subdivision b hereafter b is commonly known as the completion rule.
defendant department paid benefits under calworks to plaintiffs william fry,marie labrash,and audrey griffin and their disabled children who were high school students.after the children turned without having completed high school or appearing likely to do so within a year,the department discontinued benefits based on the completion rule,because it was unlikely that each child would complete high school by age.
plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of ordinary mandamus code civ,and administrative mandamus code civ,seeking a declaration that welfare and institutions code section b is unlawful as applied to disabled children and an order reinstating benefits.
plaintiffs alleged the only reason their children can not be expected to finish high school before their birthday is because the children are disabled.plaintiffs averred that,as applied to their disabled children,the completion rule violates the americans with disabilities act ada et,the rehabilitation act of et hereafter rehabilitation act,and california law requiring programs to comply with those federal statutes.according to plaintiffs,the completion rule unlawfully discriminates against these disabled children by depriving them of a benefit available to similarly situated children who are not disabled.
following a hearing,the trial court denied the petition and plaintiffs timely appealed.
we agree with plaintiffs that application of the completion rule to their children unlawfully denies them the benefits of the calworks program on account of their disabilities.we shall therefore reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for the taking of evidence as to the department current ability to pay benefits to plaintiffs and others in the state similarly situated.
factual and procedural background 
at all relevant times,plaintiffs children were under age and enrolled full time in high school.
the parties have stipulated that the children are disabled within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act and that only their disabilities appeared likely to prevent them from completing high school by the age of.thus,there is no dispute that their benefits were cut off solely due to disability.
plaintiffs timely appealed the termination of benefits.plaintiff labrash termination was rescinded and labrash withdrew her appeal after her daughter high school principal informed the department that the child could be expected to graduate by age after administrative hearings on the remaining appeals,defendant saenz in her capacity as director of the department upheld the terminations under the completion rule.we shall refer to defendants as the department for convenience.
plaintiffs thereafter filed their writ petition in sacramento county superior court.in a declaration filed in support of the petition,plaintiff griffin averred that her child had received per month in supplemental security income ssi benefits up until november and per month thereafter,amounts in excess of the per month griffin had received under calworks as the child caretaker parent.the other plaintiffs declared that their children received no benefits other than the discontinued calworks benefits.
after a hearing on the merits,the superior court denied the writ and issued judgment on all claims for defendants.the court found the provisions of section b constitute an essential eligibility requirement,within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act.the purpose of the calworks program is to provide a nurturing,supportive home for a needy child.the point of demarcation between a child and an adult defines the basic program eligibility parameter with substantive financial consequences.the relief requested by petitioners would constitute a fundamental alteration of the calworks program within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act.
discussion 
ithe trial court erred in concluding that the completion rule was an essential eligibility requirement of calworks 
as the essential facts are undisputed,we have only questions of law before us.in reviewing the denial of a petition for writ of mandamus,whether under code of civil procedure section or section,we review questions of law de novo.county of sonoma commission on state mandates th,d silver los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d.
government code section currently provides in part a no person in the state of california shall,on the basis of disability,be unlawfully denied the benefits of,or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under,any program or activity that is funded directly by the state,or receives any financial assistance from the state.b with respect to discrimination on the basis of disability,programs and activities subject to subdivision a shall meet the protections and prohibitions contained in section of the americans with disabilities act of,and the federal rules and regulations adopted in implementation thereof,except that if the laws of this state prescribe stronger protections and prohibitions,the programs and activities subject to subdivision a shall be subject to the stronger protections and prohibitions.the ada and the rehabilitation act apply to any program or activity which receives tanf funds,such as calworks.d.
the ada provides in part subject to the provisions of this subchapter title ii,et,no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.see also a.similarly,the rehabilitation act provides in part a no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the united states,as defined in section shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance b for the purposes of this section,the term program or activity means all of the operations of a department of a state government or the entity of such state government that distributes such assistance and each such department to which the assistance is extended,in the case of assistance to a state government see also a.
under both the ada and the rehabilitation act,a person qualified to receive government benefits or services or to participate in a government program or activity is one who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices,meets the essential eligibility requirements for such benefits,services,or participation.ada see also implementing ada b implementing rehabilitation act.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the completion rule an essential eligibility requirement of calworks.plaintiffs are correct.
under tanf,a minor child qualified to receive benefits is an individual who a has not attained years of age or b has not attained years of age and is a student in a secondary school or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training.italics added.tanf does not require an eligible child to complete high school by age plaintiffs children,who were under and enrolled in high school when plaintiffs calworks benefits were cut off,therefore met the essential eligibility requirements of the federal statute for receiving tanf funds.
the department asserts that the completion rule is essential to calworks because,by enacting that rule in a state statute b,the legislature showed that it thought the rule essential.indeed,the department says the completion requirement was designed by the california legislature to be an essential component of calworks,and that decision is controlling.italics added.the department is wrong.
a program eligibility requirement which could discriminate against the disabled may be deemed essential only if the program purposes could not be achieved without the requirement.see alexander choate,d,pandazides virginia bd.of educ.cir,strathie department of transp.cir.if a requirement is not essential in that sense,the fact that it is embodied in a statute rather than a regulation makes no difference.i n virtually all controversies involving the ada and state policies that discriminate against disabled persons,courts will be faced with legislative or executive agency deliberation over relevant statutes,rules,and regulations.crowder kitagawa cir,italics added.the courts have a duty to see that the mandate of federal law is achieved ibid,and statutes are no more immune to judicial scrutiny for ada compliance than are rules or regulations.ibid.
disabled plaintiffs have often brought challenges in federal court to government entities decisions to deny benefits or services in reliance on rules alleged to be essential eligibility requirements for receiving the benefit or service.the federal courts have taken two different approaches to such challenges.some have looked first to the general purposes of the program and how the rule serves those purposes,while others have looked first to the characteristics of the individual plaintiff seeking exemption from the rule.under the former approach,even if waiver of a rule would be reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case,the waiver would not be required if the rule itself is generally an essential or necessary eligibility requirement.washington indiana high school athletic ass n,cir,washington.under the latter approach,the court asks whether waiver of the rule in the particular case at hand would be so at odds with the purposes behind the rule that it would be a fundamental and unreasonable change in the government program.ibid.in some contexts,the choice of approach will decide the outcome.compare pottgen missouri state high school activities ass cir,pottgen cutoff was essential eligibility requirement of high school sports program because it served program general purposes with id.at dis.opn.of arnold,opining waiver of cutoff for plaintiff would not fundamentally alter program.
although the court in washington indiana high school athletic ass n,supra,held the approach to be the better view id.at,the federal courts have more often chosen the approach.see,mcpherson michigan high school athletic ass n,cir,does chandler cir,sandison michigan high school athletic ass n,cir,easley snider cir.one reason for this choice may be the courts fear that under the approach a public entity could never know the outer boundaries of its services,programs,or activities.a requirement could be deemed essential for one person with a disability but immaterial for another similarly,but not identically,situated individual.pottgen,supra,at.recognizing the validity of this concern,we shall follow the majority approach and look to the general purposes of calworks,rather than to the individual plaintiffs characteristics,to determine whether the completion rule is an essential eligibility requirement of the program.
the legislature has defined the purposes of calworks as follows the legislature finds and declares that the family unit is of fundamental importance to society in nurturing its members,passing on values,averting potential social problems,and providing the secure structure in which citizens live out their lives.each family unit has the right and responsibility to provide its own economic security by full participation in the work force to the extent possible.each family has the right and responsibility to provide sufficient support and protection of its children,to raise them according to its values and to provide every opportunity for educational and social progress.with these aims in mind,e very county shall administer this chapter in such a manner as to achieve the greatest possible reduction of dependency and to promote the rehabilitation of recipients.
nothing in these legislatively declared purposes of calworks requires the completion rule as a condition of eligibility for benefits.on the contrary,cutting off benefits under this rule tends to undermine these purposes.
depriving a family of benefits because a disabled child is not expected to complete high school or job training by age obviously does not enhance the family right and responsibility to provide sufficient support and protection of its children.similarly,the cutoff of benefits for this reason does not promote the family right and responsibility to provide its own economic security by full participation in the work force to the extent possible ibid.a disabled with schooling or job training unfinished is to work,and having to care for the child without calworks aid may impede the parents participation in the work force.barring a family from receiving benefits because a disabled will not complete high school within a year patently detracts from the family right and responsibility to provide every opportunity for educational and social progress.ibid.finally,cutting off benefits under these circumstances does nothing to reduc e dependency or promote the rehabilitation of recipients it leaves disabled children more dependent than before,thus discouraging the rehabilitation of all aid recipients.
though the completion rule is unnecessary to any calworks purpose expressly defined by the legislature,the department asserts that the rule is nevertheless essential because calworks is purposefully targeted to serve needy families with children.similarly,the trial court thought the rule essential within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act because t he purpose of the calworks program is to provide a nurturing,supportive home for a needy child.the point of demarcation between a child and an adult defines the basic program eligibility parameter the department argument and the trial court ruling are untenable.
by enacting section,the legislature has established the point of demarcation between a child and an adult under the statute as age a child who comes within section is a child for purposes of calworks up to that age.plaintiffs seek benefits for their children only until each child reaches age.we do not see why an who can complete schooling or job training by age should be deemed a child up until then,but one who can not do so because of disability should not be.that distinction has no more bearing on the general purpose of serving needy families with children than on any specific purpose stated in sections and.
the department cites legislative history related to congress enactment of the completion rule in the former afdc,apparently to show that congress thought the rule essential to that program.but if congress thought so,its failure to reenact the rule in tanf shows that congress has changed its mind.if the department means to argue that our legislature was bound by congress earlier finding,the department fails to explain why the legislature is not bound by congress later implied finding that no completion rule is appropriate 
finally,the department relies on a federal district court decision holding that the completion rule as enacted in a washington statute was an essential eligibility requirement of that state afdc program.aughe shalala.aughe.we find aughe unpersuasive.
the court in aughe first reasoned that the state could not waive the completion rule because the federal afdc required it,a rationale which no longer applies.aughe,supra.at.the court then stated the afdc is designed to help children,those under eighteen years of age and their families.as we have explained,this rationale does not justify a rule that distinguishes between two classes of year old children.finally,the court asserted citing no evidence by cutting off aid to those over eighteen the fiscal viability of the afdc can be maintained.the court assumption that the fiscal soundness of the afdc in washington state depended on the completion rule has no bearing on whether that rule is essential to calworks.as we shall explain in a moment,the fiscal consequences to calworks of eliminating the completion rule for disabled students is a matter that should be tried upon evidence upon remand.
for all the above reasons,we conclude that,on the record before us,the completion rule is not an essential eligibility requirement of calworks.
the trial court erred in ruling that it would fundamentally alter the calworks program to abrogate the completion rule for disabled students.however,we shall remand to the trial court for the taking of evidence on the state current ability to meet the increased costs of funding benefits to disabled students caused by abrogation of the completion rule 
the trial court concluded,t he relief requested by petitioners would constitute a fundamental alteration of the calworks program within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in concluding it would fundamentally alter calworks to abrogate the completion rule as to them.for reasons that follow,we agree that the trial court conclusion is legally erroneous on the record presented.
however,the department asserts that to grant relief to plaintiffs and those similarly situated would jeopardize the program fiscal soundness.as we shall explain,we can not ascertain on this record whether that is so.moreover,recent events have dramatically altered our state economic outlook.therefore,we shall remand for the taking of evidence on this point.
considerations other than fiscal considerations 
a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the services,program,or activity.b implementing ada.under this guideline,an otherwise qualified handicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers.the benefit can not be defined in a way that effectively denies otherwise qualified handicapped individuals the meaningful access to which they are entitled to assure meaningful access,reasonable accommodations in the grantee program or benefit may have to be made.alexander choate,supra,at.at,d at.
plaintiffs children are otherwise qualified handicapped individuals for purposes of the ada,and the completion rule deprives them of a benefit available to children in a program to which the ada applies.thus,the department must show that it can not accommodate plaintiffs children and those similarly situated by permitting them to obtain that benefit because to do so would fundamentally alter calworks.the department failed to meet its burden in the trial court.
relying on aughe,supra.at page,the department asserts that plaintiffs remedy would essentially rewrite the statute,which apparently by definition would fundamentally alter calworks.we find aughe no more persuasive on this point than on those discussed in part i,ante.
the court in aughe based this part of its analysis solely on pottgen,supra,which upheld a school sports program age cutoff against a challenge by an athlete whose disability had kept him in school past the cutoff age.pottgen held that it would fundamentally alter school sports programs to waive the age limit,which serves essential purposes of scholastic athletics to protect younger athletes and to discourage coaches from seeking unfair advantage by using older athletes,among others.id.at.the only possible accommodation for the waive the age therefore not reasonable.id.at.
pottgen analysis,which aughe simply parrots.at,is inapplicable to section b.unlike the rule in athletics,which prevents older youths from competing unfairly with younger youths,elimination of the completion rule in this case would not result in disabled students competing unfairly in academics with younger students.as shown in part i,ante,the department identifies no essential purpose of calworks incompatible with paying benefits to otherwise qualified children whose disabilities may keep them from completing high school by age.it does not rewrite the statute to refuse effect to an inessential condition which unlawfully discriminates against the disabled.
the department next asserts that plaintiffs remedy would fundamentally alter calworks by expanding its coverage.see bay area addiction research and treatment,city of antioch cir,baart.the department is mistaken and its reliance on baart is misplaced.
in baart,the court held that a city zoning ordinance which barred methadone clinics within feet of residential areas discriminated on its face against persons who came within the ambit of the ada and the rehabilitation act.baart,supra,at.explaining that the reasonable modifications requirement under code of federal regulations section b did not apply,the court stated the only possible modification of a facially discriminatory law that would avoid discrimination on the basis of disability would be the actual removal of the portion of the law that discriminates on the basis of disability.however,such a modification would fundamentally alter the ordinance.as applied to this case,for example,the urgency ordinance could only be rendered facially neutral by expanding the class of entities that may not operate within feet of a residential neighborhood to include all clinics at which medical services are provided,or by striking the reference to methadone clinics entirely.id.at italics added.
without discussing baart subject or holding,the department quotes only the portion of baart language we have italicized.in context,that language does not support the department proposition that a reasonable accommodation which expand s coverage under a facially neutral program,so as to avoid discrimination against qualified individuals,fundamentally alters the program.nor does any other decision the department cites.
to the extent that baart might suggest that a court may not order a public program that unlawfully excludes the disabled to disregard exclusionary language in a statute or ordinance,we respectfully decline to follow it.it remains true that whenever a public program is altered to embrace the disabled who have been excluded on account of their disabilities,the program is expanded.that is no reason to refuse to apply the mandates of the ada or the rehabilitation act.indeed,to accept the department argument would eviscerate remedies for disability discrimination under those acts.
the department further asserts t he present rule contained in section b sic b is itself a reasonable accommodation for all children who have reached the usual graduation cutoff age of,but need additional time to complete school for whatever reason,including disability.not only does this conflict with the department position that no reasonable accommodation for plaintiffs children is possible,but it misuses the term reasonable accommodation.by definition,that term means an accommodation offered to disabled persons.alexander choate,supra,at.at,d at b.nondisabled year olds who need additional time to complete school do not require reasonable accommodation under the ada.thus it makes no sense to describe section b as a reasonable accommodation for in general.
we therefore conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law by conc
