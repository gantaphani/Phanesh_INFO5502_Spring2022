gloria henderson appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained a demurrer to her complaint without leave to amend.henderson,a teacher,sued newport mesa unified school district and its governing board the district,alleging claims for damages based on the district failure to accord her first priority when they elected to fill a vacant position in the subject matter she had previously taught,as required by education code section unless otherwise specified,all further statutory references are to this code and the district discrimination against her on the basis of her race,in violation of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et.
the trial court sustained the district demurrer to both causes of action on the basis henderson claims were barred by res judicata,because she had participated in an administrative proceeding which adjudicated her rights in connection with the district decision to layoff a large number of teachers at the end of the prior school year,and she later voluntarily dismissed her petition for writ of mandate challenging the adverse result of that proceeding.additionally,with respect to henderson claim for violation of section specifically,the court concluded the statute did not give rise to a private right of action for damages and that whatever right henderson had to enforce the statute by way of a writ of mandamus had been rendered moot by her failure to pursue that relief in a timely manner.we reverse the judgment.
section imposes a mandatory duty on the district to accord temporary teachers such as henderson first priority in hiring under the specified circumstances,and we can discern no rationale for imposing such a duty other than the desire to provide those temporary teachers with some protection against the risk they will be permanently relegated to temporary status,while others with no greater qualifications are hired to fill positions which offer the potential of achieving employment security.whether the district alleged failure to fulfill that duty was a proximate cause of the damages henderson alleges is a matter of proof at trial,but for pleading purposes it is sufficient that she has alleged facts suggesting it was.
the court determination that both causes of action were barred by res judicata was similarly flawed.the earlier administrative hearing addressed only the district decision to layoff a large number of certificated employees for economic reasons at the end of the school year,and resolved claims affecting the order in which that layoff would impact individual employees.with respect to henderson specifically,it appears the hearing resolved only her contention she had been improperly classified as a temporary employee a classification which effectively guaranteed the layoff would impact her personally.there is no indication the administrative hearing addressed henderson distinct right,as a temporary teacher,to be accorded priority if the district chose to fill a vacant position in the subsequent school year,or her right to be free from discrimination on the basis of her race.consequently,the court erred in concluding henderson current claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
for purposes of analyzing the district demurrer,we generally assume that all facts pleaded in the complaint are true.cantu resolution trust th,d.
according to the complaint,henderson is a first generation chinese american.she holds california teaching credentials qualifying her to teach several subjects.she also holds masters degrees in both english and psychology.in january of,while henderson was employed as a tenured teacher in another school district,she was offered the opportunity to take over the advanced placement english program at corona del mar high school,a school within the district.
henderson was classified as a temporary teacher,but was told it was the district policy to initially classify all new teachers as temporary,and she could expect to be reclassified as a probationary teacher after a few months.prior to the end of the school year,the district notified her she would be rehired for the school year,but again as a temporary teacher.
during the school year,henderson was assigned to teach the same advanced placement english classes she had been hired to teach the prior year,plus an advanced placement psychology class.at the end of that school year,henderson was released by the district pursuant to section,but was once again rehired as a temporary teacher for the school year and assigned to teach the same advanced placement courses she had taught the prior year.
at the end of the school year,the district again notified henderson she was being released pursuant to section.but the district also decided to eliminate approximately full time equivalent positions from its payroll due to a cut in state spending.thus,on or about march,the district sent out layoff notices to probationary and permanent certificated teachers,plus related notices to all temporary teachers employed by the district.these related notices offered the temporary teachers an opportunity to participate in a hearing held pursuant to sections and,to contest the district decision.
henderson was among potentially affected teachers who elected to contest her proposed layoff at the administrative hearing,which took place in april and may of.of those teachers,henderson was the only one who employed private counsel to represent her at the hearing.all the other teachers were represented by counsel provided by the union.at the hearing,the district employee who was responsible for supervising the layoff process testified the district was not seeking to actually terminate the employment of any high school teacher who held probationary status or higher.henderson,in turn,relied on evidence suggesting she had been improperly classified as a temporary employee when others with lesser qualifications and less seniority had been classified as probationary or permanent.
on may,at the conclusion of the hearing,the administrative law judge alj ruled in favor of the district on all issues.the alj concluded the district had good cause for its decision to terminate each of the employees who elected to contest the layoff decision.the alj decision was approved by the district governing board on may.
over the course of the summer of,the district made no offer to reemploy henderson for the subsequent school year,as it had done in each of the prior two summers.instead,the district advertised to fill certain positions for which henderson was both qualified and entitled by law to be given first priority.
henderson did apply for these available positions,but despite her qualifications and statutory priority,she was neither offered the positions nor asked to submit to an interview for them.three positions for which henderson was qualified were instead offered to caucasian women.in december of,henderson applied for a position at estancia high school,another school within the district.after she interviewed with estancia principal,he told her she was his top choice for the position,although the final selection would be made by human resources personnel at the district level.henderson was not offered the position.
as of the school year,approximately percent of the district students allegedly as asian.in the two years henderson was employed by the district,however,the percentage of certificated staff who as asian was reduced from percent to just percent,while the percentages of asians in orange county as a whole remained steady.
henderson claims the district refusal to rehire her for the school year was based on both a desire to retaliate against her for the vigorous defense she waged at the administrative hearing and a desire to systematically reduce the number of certificated employees who as asian.
in january,henderson filed a claim against the district pursuant to sections and of the government code,seeking an award of damages stemming from its wrongful refusal to rehire her.henderson claim was denied by the district in february of.in june,henderson sought and obtained a right to sue letter from the department of fair employment and housing pursuant to government code section.
based on the foregoing facts,henderson complaint alleged two causes of action one for violation of section requirement she be accorded first priority if the district chose to fill any vacant positions teaching the subjects she had previously taught and a second for wrongful discrimination against her on account of her chinese heritage,in violation of feha.
the district demurred to henderson complaint,arguing that both of her causes of action were barred by the earlier administrative proceeding,in which the alj purportedly found there was good cause to not reemploy her,because henderson had failed to exhaust her judicial remedy in connection with it.the district also argued henderson claim for damages based on the alleged violation of section failed to state a cause of action because the statute did not give rise to a private right of action for damages and that henderson sole remedy was a petition for writ of mandate to compel its compliance with the statute.in support of its demurrer,the district also asked the court to take judicial notice of henderson petition for writ of mandate challenging the result of the earlier administrative hearing,filed on june,and of her request for dismissal of that petition,with prejudice,filed on december.
henderson opposed the demurrer,arguing the district preclusion argument was based on a misconstruction of both the allegations of her complaint and the scope of the earlier administrative proceeding.she pointed out the complaint alleged only that the administrative proceeding had addressed the propriety of the district decision to layoff a large group of employees at the end of the school year,and made no reference to whether there were grounds for not rehiring her specifically for the school year.
henderson explained her participation in the administrative proceeding had been for the limited purpose of challenging her classification as a temporary employee,which afforded her the lowest level of job security in the implementation of the district planned layoffs.henderson also noted that as long as she remained classified as a temporary employee,the district had absolute discretion to terminate her services without cause,and consequently the existence of good cause for terminating her employment was legally irrelevant,and thus could not have been adjudicated in the proceeding.in support of her contention about the limited scope of the administrative hearing,henderson requested the court take judicial notice of the notices served on her by the district,which reflected she had been invited to participate in the statutory procedures for certificated layoffs if you desired to challenge your classification as a temporary certificated employee,and the district resolution adopting the alj decision,in which it specifically resolves that all the temporary teachers were properly classified,and that all were released from employment pursuant to section.
henderson also disputed the district claim she had no private right of action for damages under section,arguing the statute imposed a mandatory duty specifically designed to protect the employment rights of temporary teachers,and thus recognition of a private right of action in members of that affected group was necessary to further the statutory goal.alternatively,she claimed that even if the court determined there was no private right of action,the district had expressly conceded that a petition for writ of mandate would be an appropriate remedy,and her cause of action alleged all the necessary facts to warrant such relief.
on october,the date originally scheduled for the demurrer to be heard,the court issued an order soliciting additional briefing on several issues.first,the court asked the parties to assume henderson right to preference in rehiring for the school year had not been addressed in the earlier administrative proceeding,as she claimed,and to explain what obligation,if any,she had to exhaust administrative remedies for that claim prior to seeking relief in the court.second,the court asked the parties to address whether henderson eligibility for first priority under section was dependent upon her serving two consecutive years as a temporary teacher after she had been released pursuant to section.and third,the court asked the parties to address the extent to which government code section bears on the analysis of whether henderson has a private right of action under section.
the parties provided the court with additional briefing,with the district adopting the court suggestion that henderson would not qualify for first priority in rehiring under section,because she could not allege she had been retained as a temporary teacher for two full years after she was released pursuant to section.the district also offered additional arguments supporting its contention henderson had no private right of action under section in any event,and reasserted its claim that henderson causes of action were barred by the earlier administrative proceeding,but this time stated in terms of a primary rights analysis.specifically,the district argued the primary right at issue in both the administrative proceeding and this lawsuit was henderson alleged right to employment in a position with the district for the school year.
henderson disputed each of the district new points,arguing there was nothing in the language of section requiring a temporary teacher completion of two consecutive years be subsequent to her release pursuant to section,and reasserting her contention the statute gave rise to a private right of action.henderson also claimed the district had improperly characterized the purported primary right at issue in this case,because her right to be properly classified as a teacher was distinct from her right,as a temporary teacher,to be accorded statutory priority in rehiring,and both of those rights were distinct from her right to be free from racial and ethnic discrimination.
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.in doing so,the court accepted the district primary rights analysis,and characterized the single primary right at issue in both the administrative proceeding and in the causes of action asserted in this lawsuit as henderson alleged right to be reemployed for the school year.the court also noted that all of the facts underlying henderson current claims were in existence by september of,a full three months prior to the voluntary termination of the underlying proceeding.the court thus concluded the adverse ruling in that administrative proceeding effectively subsumed henderson current claims,and barred her from asserting any separate claim based upon the district failure to reemploy her.
the court also concluded,with respect to henderson claim for violation of section,that the statute provided no private right of action for failure to reemploy a temporary teacher section does not provide for any specific remedy or penalty,and does not actually provide for reemployment instead,it provides for nothing more than consideration amongst other teachers for whatever vacant spots if any exist for that particular school year.a private right of action under does not arise since is not intended to protect the financial of temporary teachers.finally,the court reasoned that while a mandamus remedy would be available to enforce the district compliance with section,such an option had been rendered moot by the time henderson filed this lawsuit in august of,since by that date the school year the one for which henderson might have claimed first priority to fill a vacant position had already been completed.
following its order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend,the court entered a judgment dismissing henderson case.

governing law 
the claims asserted by henderson,both here and in the earlier administrative proceeding,arise against the backdrop of california complex and somewhat rigid legislative scheme for classifying public school teachers mcintyre sonoma valley unified school dist.th,d,quoting kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d,fn.omitted.within this scheme,teachers are required to be classified as either permanent,probationary,temporary or substitute.a teacher job classification is important in determining a teacher rights to reelection retention and promotion and to determining the level of procedural protections to which a teacher is entitled should he or she be dismissed or nonreelected for the next school year mcintyre sonoma valley unified school,supra,th at,d.the classification system has precipitated recurring litigation teachers not infrequently seek the greater degree of position permanency which a higher category affords.balen peralta junior college dist.cal d.
in the case of permanent and probationary employees,the employer power to terminate employment is restricted by statute.substitute and temporary employees,on the other hand,fill the short range needs of a school district and generally may be summarily released.citation.citation.vasquez happy valley union school dist.th,d.a school district is not required to provide any reason or offer a hearing if it elects to release or not reelect a temporary teacher all that is required is the school district issuance of statutory notice pursuant to section.vasquez happy valley union school,supra,th at,d.
section specifies that school districts may release certificated temporary employees a t the pleasure of the board prior to serving during one school year at least percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district are maintained,subd.a,and a fter serving during one school year the number of days set forth in subdivision a,if the employee is notified before the end of the school year of the district decision not to reelect the employee for the next succeeding year,subd.b.
but the education code narrowly defines the circumstances in which teachers may be classified as temporary,apparently due to a specific concern school districts might exploit that designation to the detriment of the employees,in an attempt to maintain maximum flexibility in hiring teachers from year to year the code recognizes two general kinds of temporary employees those who are employed to serve for less than three or four months,or in some types of limited,emergency,or temporary assignments or classes see,and those who are employed for up to one year to replace a certificated employee who is on leave or has a lengthy illness see.bakersfield elementary teachers association bakersfield city school dist.th,d,fn.omitted.in establishing these narrow categories,the legislature has sought to limit the ability of school districts to classify teachers as temporary employees.california teachers vallejo city unified school dist.th,d.
moreover,as explained in haase san diego community college dist.d,t he legislature has restricted the flexibility of a school district in the continued use of temporary employees citations,for otherwise the benefits resulting from employment security for teachers could be subordinated to the administrative needs of a district.in that vein,section provides temporary teachers some limited rights with respect to reemployment,if they have been retained in that temporary capacity by their districts for nearly a full school year.stockton teachers.stockton unified school dist.th,d section gives reemployment rights to certain temporary and substitute employees,those who have worked at least percent of the school year and have not been released,or those who have been released,but have been hired as a temporary or substitute for two consecutive years.
specifically,section provides that if a temporary employee who has served percent of the school year is hired for a vacant position the next year,the year of temporary employment will retroactively qualify as a probationary year,subd.a.further,section requires that if a temporary employee who has served at least percent of the school year has not been released pursuant to subdivision b of section,that employee shall be reemployed for the following school year to fill any vacant positions in the school district,subd.b,italics added.in light of the latter provision,school districts must routinely release any temporary certificated employees who have served at least percent of a school year,in order to maintain maximum flexibility to make hiring decisions for the following school year.see mcintyre sonoma valley unified school,supra,th at,d reflecting school district serial releases and rehiring of a temporary teacher over the course of three years.
and in the provision especially pertinent to this case,section,subdivision c,provides that if a temporary employee was released pursuant to subdivision b of s ection,and has nevertheless been retained as a temporary or substitute employee by the district for percent of two consecutive years,that employee shall receive first priority if the district fills a vacant position,at the grade level at which the employee served during either of the two years,for the subsequent school year.in the case of a departmentalized program,the employee shall have taught in the subject matter in which the vacant position occurs,subd.c,italics added.
although the trial court suggested,and the district consequently asserted,that the statute guarantee of first priority to a temporary teacher retained for two consecutive years applies only to a temporary teacher who has been retained for two successive years after being released pursuant to section,we can not interpret the statute that way.while we would agree the provision is awkwardly worded the phrase was released is clearly past tense,while the phrase has nevertheless been retained is temporally equivocal the fact is the provision does not explicitly require the two consecutive years of temporary teaching to follow the teacher release pursuant to section.
more important,if such a requirement were inferred,it would produce an anomalous result.specifically,under that interpretation,the temporary employee who has endured for two consecutive years following receipt of a notice pursuant to section would have less right to fill a vacant position in the subsequent year than would a temporary employee who had served only a single year without receiving such a notice.subdivision b of section requires that the latter be reemployed for the following school year to fill any vacant positions italics added,while under the district interpretation,subdivision c would guarantee the temporary teacher who had served two consecutive years since receiving such a notice only first priority if the district fills a vacant position.italics added.such a result runs counter to the education code near slavish adherence to seniority as a basis for establishing relative job security among teachers,and we reject it.
instead,we conclude the statute simply reflects a modest effort to encourage school districts to integrate temporary teachers whose services have proved satisfactory over an extended period of time into the ranks of the probationary and permanent employees,and thus to curtail any tendency school districts might have to perpetuate a permanent underclass of temporary teachers with no prospects of achieving job security.hence,under the first provision,any temporary employee who has served at least percent of a school year and is then hired for the following year as a probationary employee is entitled to retroactive probationary credit for the year of temporary status.under the second provision,if a school district fails to exercise its absolute right to release a temporary employee who has served at least percent of the school in accordance with section,it is required to reemploy that teacher to fill a vacant position rather than another temporary slot.
and under the third provision of section,which is the one at issue here,even when a school district has given a notice of release to a temporary teacher,if it has otherwise acknowledged the teacher satisfactory performance by choosing to retain him or her over the course of two consecutive school years,it must give that teacher first priority in the event it elects to fill a vacant position for which that teacher is qualified in the subsequent school year.
with that statutory background in mind,we turn to the merits of the district demurrer.
private right of action under section 
as we have explained,the allegations of henderson complaint demonstrate that by the end of the school year,she had served more than two complete,consecutive years as a temporary teacher,and thus she qualified for first priority if the district fills a vacant position,at the grade level at which she served and in the subject matter in which the vacant position occurs,subd.c.
but the district argued,and the trial court agreed,that section did not give henderson a private right of action.we disagree.government code section allows an individual to state a claim for damages against a governmental entity based on its violation of a mandatory statutory duty that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury courts apply a test for determining whether liability can be imposed under this statute an enactment must impose a mandatory,not discretionary,duty citation the enactment must intend to protect against the kind of risk of injury suffered by the party asserting section as a basis for liability citations and breach of the mandatory duty must be a proximate cause of the injury suffered.state of california superior court d.
in its analysis of section,the trial court concluded section did not state a private right of action for two reasons first,because the statute does not provide for any specific remedy or penalty,and does not actually provide for reemployment instead,it provides for nothing more than consideration amongst other teachers for whatever vacant spots if any exist for that particular school year and second,because is not intended to protect the financial of temporary teachers.
with respect to the first point,we note the court confused the issue of whether the statue imposes a mandatory duty with the issue of whether it specifies a particular remedy.those are two distinct questions,and the test for determining the existence of a private right of action does not include any requirement that a statute actually specify a remedy.
section,on its face,imposes more than a mere obligation to consider henderson for an available position.the district mandatory duty is to give henderson first priority if it chooses to fill a vacant position in the grade level and subject which she taught as a temporary teacher.that mandatory duty implies more than an obligation to consider her for the position on an equal basis with other applicants if that were all it required,the benefit would be illusory.we presume a district would consider anyone who applied.
instead,our supreme court characterized section as obligating the district to give a temporary employee who fulfills its requirements a preferential right of reemployment.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d,california teachers including section among six education code statutes which it describes as giving the described classes of persons a preferential right of reemployment.
california teachers,in which the supreme court addressed a teacher claim of preferential employment rights in connection with a vacant coaching position,is instructive in analyzing the effect of such a preferential right and by extension,whether a school district violation of the right would support a claim for damages.there,the teacher filed an action seeking injunctive relief and damages against his school district,alleging it violated section,subdivision b,which specifies that an open coaching position shall first be made available to teachers presently employed by the district.the teacher argued the school district violated that obligation when it awarded a vacant coaching position for which the teacher had applied to a,rather than to him.the trial court ruled against the teacher,however,agreeing with the school district interpretation of the statute as requiring only that it notify its teachers of the available coaching position,without any obligation to accord them any preference in hiring.the court of appeal then reversed that ruling,agreeing with the teacher contention that the statute obligated the school district to give a right of first refusal california teachers,supra,cal th at,d,to any teacher employed by the school district who applied for the vacant coaching position,before it could offer that position to someone else.a divided supreme court rejected both extremes and staked out a middle ground.
the court first rejected the district and trial court position,explaining that b y using the word first,the legislature clearly intended to afford some degree of advantage or priority to teachers presently employed by the district,placing them on a level above both noncredentialed employees currently employed by the district,as well as persons not then employed by the district in question,whether or not credentialed.under the district proposed interpretation of section b,however,teachers can simply apply and be considered along with every other applicant,with no advantage.we fail to see how this interpretation of section b assigns any substantive meaning to the word first.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
the court then rejected the teacher and the court of appeal position,explaining that requiring the school district to give any employed teacher a right of first refusal is too rigid,for it fails to take into account the relevant qualifications and skills the school district may require of an applicant before entrusting him or her to supervis e athletic activities of pupils.one can not qualify for a coaching position simply by possessing a teaching credential.in short,that an applicant for a coaching position is a teacher presently employed by the district,is not,by itself,a guarantee of the job.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d.
instead,the court explained school districts retained the discretion both to establish their own coaching qualifications and to evaluate coaching applicants to determine whether they meet those standards.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d.but if an employed teacher who sought the position met those established qualifications,the school district was obligated to offer the position to that teacher,and could not offer it to someone else who was not employed by it as a teacher in short,b gives credentialed teachers currently employed in the district an employment preference,not a guarantee of the position they seek.only to the extent a currently employed in the school district satisfies the qualifications promulgated by the district,does section b prohibit the district from hiring a in preference to the teacher.ibid.
we conclude the majority analysis in california teachers applies with equal force to henderson proposed claim for violation of her right to first priority under section.here too,the legislature use of the word first means henderson is entitled to more than an opportunity to compete for the vacant position.what she is entitled to,in the words of the supreme court,is a preferential right of reemployment.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d.but just as the majority reasoned in california teachers,that should not mean the district is obligated to hire her without regard to her qualifications.the district is entitled to determine the qualifications necessary for a candidate to fill the vacant position and to assess whether henderson meets them.but if she does,section imposes upon the district a mandatory duty to prefer her for the position over another candidate who does not meet the statutory requirement of temporary service.that duty restricts what would otherwise be the district discretion to choose an outside candidate over henderson.
of course,as the district points out,adherence to the statutory requirement would not guarantee that a temporary teacher such as henderson will actually be hired for the available position.subdivision e of section provides that any permanent or probationary employees who have been subjected to a reduction in force pursuant to section,a layoff such as occurred here at the end of the school year have prior rights to any vacant position in which they are qualified to serve superior to those rights hereunder afforded to temporary and substitute personnel,subd.e.
but the mere fact the statute gave henderson no ultimate guarantee of employment does not mean the duty it imposed on the district to accord henderson first priority was a discretionary one.instead,the fact she might not have been hired even if the district had fulfilled its obligations under the statute is pertinent only in assessing whether plaintiff can satisfy the third prong of the test for establishing a private right of action,whether defendant breach of the mandatory duty is a proximate cause of the injury suffered.state of california superior court,supra,d at.and here,henderson specifically alleged that district advertised three available positions for the school year one full time position and two positions which combined would equal a position teaching the same subjects at the same she had previously taught,and then filled those available positions with candidates who were both new to the district and had less experience than she did.those allegations,if proved,are sufficient to demonstrate the district alleged failure to comply with its mandatory obligation to accord henderson first priority in filling these available positions was the proximate cause of her not being rehired by the district for the school year.
the trial court determination that section is not intended to protect the financial of temporary teachers fares no better.indeed,it seems to fly in the face of the supreme court characterization of that very statute as giv ing the described classes of persons a preferential right of reemployment.california teachers,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,the district reliance on keech berkeley unified school dist.d,and tirpak los angeles unified school dist.d,is unpersuasive,as both cases are inapposite.
in keech,the parents sought to impose liability based on the district failure to promptly assess their son for special educational needs.the court rejected the effort,explaining the statues which governed the district obligations were not designed to protect the parents of an emotionally or mentally handicapped child from the monetary expenses incurred in providing medical,psychological or related services for their child during the time it takes the applicable governmental agencies to assess the child special educational needs.neither were these statutes designed to protect such parents from legal fees incurred in connection with obtaining special educational benefits,or from emotional distress suffered by the parents as a result of delays in making the statutory assessment.in short,the injuries suffered by appellants were not the kinds of harm which the statutes were designed to prevent or assuage.keech berkeley unified school,supra,d at.
and in tirpak,plaintiffs were a student who had been suspended from school and denied readmission and his mother both sought damages for the alleged educational expenses and loss of earning capacity incurred as a result of the student suspension,as well as compensation for their attendant emotional and physical pain.to support their alleged private right of action,the plaintiffs relied on the district alleged violation of the statutory procedures designed to ensure that a student right of access to a free education will not be arbitrarily denied.in concluding no private right of action was stated,the appellate court explained the statutes in question are part of a comprehensive set of procedural guidelines found in the education code,which are administrative in nature and intended to provide due process.since it is clear that these provisions of the education code were not designed to protect students and their parents from money damages resulting from educational injuries,plaintiffs have failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.tirpak los angeles unified school,supra,d at.
here,by contrast to keech,there is no indication the statutory duty imposed by section is designed to provide a benefit to any group other than the one henderson belongs to temporary teachers.moreover,it is clear the goal of the provision is to provide those temporary teachers with an advantage in obtaining employment in a vacant position as against applicants who have no prior relationship with the district,and thus to benefit them financially.and in contrast to tirpak,the duty imposed is not merely procedural in nature.instead,the right accorded to temporary teachers who have served for two consecutive years is a substantive right which guarantees them a hiring preference in the event their school district chooses to fill a vacant position at the grade level and in cases of a departmentalized program,in the subject matter which they have previously taught.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude subdivision c of section gives rise to a private right of action by a temporary teacher who has served at least percent of two consecutive years in that capacity for the same school district,if the district fails to accord that teacher the required first priority when it chooses to fill a vacant position in the subsequent school year.the trial court below erred in sustaining the district demurrer to henderson cause of action based on its contrary conclusion.
henderson claims are not barred by res judicata 
the court also sustained the district demurrer to both henderson claim for violation of section and her claim for violation of feha on the distinct basis that they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.it reasoned that both claims were founded on the same primary right placed at issue in the earlier administrative proceeding,and noted that all of the facts underlying these claims had occurred by september of,a full three months prior to the voluntary termination of the earlier proceeding.based on that analysis,the court concluded henderson current claims were part of the same legal cause of action adjudicated in the administrative proceeding,and thus that henderson was precluded from relitigating them here.henderson argues the court erred in its analysis,and we agree.
primary rights analysis 
the court mistake was in its characterization of the primary right underlying henderson various claims.as explained most recently by our supreme court in boeken philip morris usa,cal th,d,to determine whether two proceedings involve identical causes of action for purposes of claim preclusion,california courts have consistently applied the primary rights theory.citation.under this theory,a cause of action arises out of an antecedent primary right and corresponding duty and the delict or breach of such primary right and duty by the person on whom the duty rests.of these elements,the primary right and duty and the delict or wrong combined constitute the cause of action in the legal sense of the t
