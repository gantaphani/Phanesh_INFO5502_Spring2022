in this case,this court is asked to define the contours between harms best left to the province of traditional tort law and those harms that rise to the level of constitutional violations.appellants and arlene nix,pursuant to,brought a action against the appellees seeking damages for the death of the nixes son,jeremiah.finding that the nixes failed to show that the appellees conduct violated a right secured by federal law,the district court granted the appellees motion for summary judgment as to all of the nixes claims.the nixes brought this appeal.we will affirm the district court holding.
factual background 
this case arises from the tragic death of jeremiah nix during a classroom demonstration at franklin county high school.in the fall of,jeremiah,a student,was enrolled in an electromechanical class taught by defendant paul brown.brown had been teaching the electromechanical curriculum at franklin county high school for years.as a regular part of the class,brown instructed his class of approximately students about the basics of electricity.the curriculum called for students to use volt meters to measure voltages in an electrical current.
on november,brown was instructing the class on the use of a volt meter.in order to give his students the opportunity to operate a volt meter themselves,brown had arranged a single insulated wire across the students desks.at various points along the length of the wire,the insulation had been cut away and the wire exposed so that the students could place the probes from their voltage meters onto exposed wire.the wire was then connected to an adjustable transformer,which brown controlled.after checking to ensure that the probes were all properly attached to the exposed areas of the wire,brown turned on the transformer and began to increase the voltage in graduated increments,with a peak voltage of volts.brown chose to bring the current to volts so that the students might measure voltages spanning the full range of values permitted by the meters,which were capable of reading up to volts.brown repeatedly warned the students about the risk of touching the exposed wires.
while the demonstration was taking place,jeremiah nix was seated at a table with two other students.brown sat across the table from the three students.jeremiah and the other students asked brown several questions about the possible effects that would result if they touched the wire.brown explained to them that if they touched the wire with both hands,the electricity would flow across the heart and possibly cause death.accordingly,brown told the students not to touch the wire.
while the transformer was operating at the level,brown turned to answer a question posed by one of the students seated to his left.when he turned back to the table in front of him,he noticed that jeremiah was leaning over to his left with the wire in his hands.brown immediately cut off the power to the transformer and sought to assist jeremiah,who was gasping for breath.brown raised jeremiah arms in an attempt to help him breathe.some of the other students ran across the hall for assistance,and another teacher came into the classroom and helped brown perform cpr on jeremiah.emergency medical technicians were called to the school,but the efforts to revive jeremiah were died from the electrical shock.
the nixes have presented some evidence that brown was aware of substantial risks to the students in his class.arlene nix,jeremiah mother,has given deposition testimony that the electrical equipment in the classroom kept blowing fuses and it kept showing it was off and on.in addition,brown was aware that students often touched the electrical probes and that some students were being shocked.he knew that students in a group as large as his class would inevitably touch live wires,that students would occasionally get their hands in the wrong place at the wrong time,and that some students were intentionally shocking themselves or one another.others in the school were also alerted to possible problems a few days prior to jeremiah electrocution,the mother of one of brown students called the high school because she had learned from her son that students were being shocked in the class.she expressed concern for the safety of the pupils in the course,and was assured that there was no need for concern and that she would be contacted by either the principal or his assistant.the promised response from the school never came.
assistant principal stanley whitsitt testified that,from a safety standpoint,the curriculum has not been changed since.whitsitt testified as to his belief that the principal and vice principal were aware that live electricity was being used in brown classroom.brown testified that his experimental methodology had become a custom after so many years of being used in the class,and that his superiors were aware of that custom.however,principal jack slaton denied any knowledge that volts of electricity were being used.
ii.procedural history 
and arlene nix,jeremiah parents,filed a complaint on october.they named as defendants the school district brown principal slaton and thomas bridges,superintendent of the franklin county school district.in their complaint,the nixes alleged that the defendants actions deprived jeremiah of his rights under the fourteenth amendment by placing him at an unreasonable risk of harm.
after discovery,all defendants moved for summary judgment,based on qualified immunity and the more general defense that no constitutional violation occurred.the district court granted summary judgment for all defendants on all claims.
iii.general due process principles 
the crucial inquiry for this court is whether the alleged facts,if true,would amount to a constitutional violation.as a general rule,to prevail on a claim of a substantive violation,a plaintiff must prove that a defendant conduct shocks the conscience.county of sacramento lewis,d.
conduct that is 
the somewhat nebulous shocks the conscience phrase has taken on different meanings in different cases,depending on a given case factual setting.for many contexts,the supreme court has yet to determine how serious misconduct must be to be characterized as conscience shocking a standard which duplicates no traditional category of fault,id.at,but the court has made clear that a showing of mere negligence is insufficient to make out a constitutional claim l iability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.id.at.see also davidson cannon,d daniels williams,d.the court has,however,pointed out that actions intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest are those most likely to rise to the level.sacramento,at.acts that fall between the poles of negligence and malign intent require courts to make closer calls,id.at,in which the determination of what shocks the conscience is.deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another id.at.
avoiding the encroachment of substantive due process into the tort field 
before proceeding to analysis of the nixes claim,we must pause to consider the pronouncements of the supreme court regarding the boundaries separating tortious injuries from constitutional harms.as a general matter,the supreme court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and.collins city of harker heights,texas,d.when shaping the contours of law,the court has often emphasized the need to prevent the fourteenth amendment from becoming a surrogate for conventional tort principles.confining liability to more culpable actors,as suggested in sacramento,is in accordance with the intent of the due process clause to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government.see daniels,at.quoting hurtado california.in daniels,the court found that an inmate plaintiff incident at a jail was quite remote from the concerns of the due process clause.id.at.the court went on to say 
far from an abuse of power,lack of due care suggests no more than a failure to meas
