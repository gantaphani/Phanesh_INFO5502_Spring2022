plaintiff kevin mcgarry employment was terminated by the university of san diego university as its head football coach in.mcgarry subsequently filed a lawsuit against university seeking damages for employment termination,and against university and others for defamation.the employment termination aspect of mcgarry lawsuit is not involved in the present appeal.
the present appeal involves mcgarry claims against university and two university officials,robert pastoor and mary lyons,for defamation.these claims were premised first on statements contained in a newspaper article the article,published in the san diego union tribune newspaper two days after mcgarry employment was terminated,reporting the reasons for the termination.mcgarry defamation claims were secondarily premised on statements made by lyons during a meeting with parents of members of the football team concerning mcgarry employment termination.
all defendants filed motions to strike the defamation claims pursuant to code of civil procedure section commonly referred to as the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.the hearing on the motions was continued to permit limited discovery.mcgarry moved to compel the deposition of newspaper reporters to question them about the article,but the trial court denied the motion pursuant to the shield law the trial court ultimately granted defendants motions to strike the defamation claims.
on appeal,mcgarry argues the law was inapplicable because neither the statements to the press nor the statements to the parents qualified as protected conduct under the law.he alternatively asserts that,even if the law does apply,the trial court ruling must be reversed for two distinct reasons.first,he argues that,insofar as his defamation claim was rooted in the statements to the parents,he demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.second,he argues that,insofar as his defamation claim was rooted in the statements in the article,the trial court application of the shield law was error and had the effect of precluding him from discovering evidence necessary to satisfy his burden to show a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim.
factual backgrounda.the parties 
mcgarry was employed by university for years before his employment was abruptly terminated in.he was the head coach of university football team for the past seven years of his tenure,and had been named coach of the year.pastoor was vice president of student affairs for university,and lyons was president of university.
b.the termination of employment 
shortly before mcgarry was fired,university athletic director departed and university hired nestor as the new athletic director.in early september,shortly after nestor appointment,there was a tense exchange between mcgarry and nestor,and mcgarry lodged a complaint against nestor with university human resources department.in late september,shortly after mcgarry complaint,nestor approached mcgarry and stated there had been a complaint by trainers that mcgarry had kicked a football at them during a practice.mcgarry told nestor footballs were routinely removed from the field as a safety precaution and mcgarry would often kick or throw them off the field but he had never aimed one at anyone.nestor appeared satisfied with mcgarry explanation.
approximately one week later,nestor witnessed a verbal argument between mcgarry and one of his coaching assistants.mcgarry and the assistant resolved their differences and continued working alongside each other without further incident.however,nestor generated an interoffice memo dated october that purported to confirm their discussion concerning the football kicking incident and memorialize mcgarry admission that he had kicked a football toward a player out of frustration with the player multiple mistakes.
mcgarry received nestor memo on october and,later that evening,he received written instructions to report to pastoor office the following day.when mcgarry arrived at pastoor office on october,one day before university team was scheduled to play an important game in indiana,mcgarry was informed his employment had been terminated and he was banned from campus because of the incident,the verbal argument incident,and a third incident the cheerleader incident of alleged misconduct.
c.the statements 
the article 
on sunday,october,the article appeared in newspaper stating,in its lead paragraph,that a series of incidents over the past two months led to mcgarry employment termination,several sources at the school told newspaper.it recited that the coaches and staff had been informed of the termination on friday morning and were explicitly told not to comment publicly about it.although the article stated pastoor and nestor declined to comment because of confidentiality related to personnel matters,the article went on to say several u niversity officials,speaking on the condition of anonymity,outlined a culmination of events that led to the termination.the article later stated the sources said three incidents in particular led to mcgarry immediate termination just hours before the team left for indiana,and cited the incident,the verbal argument incident,and the cheerleader incident.
the meeting 
on october,pastoor and lyons held a closed door meeting with parents of the football players to discuss mcgarry employment termination and introduce the interim head coach.at that meeting,parents asked whether the reasons stated in the article were the only reasons for his termination,or whether he had posed a threat or harm to the players,and lyons responded she could not comment on the reasons for his termination.one parent,after stating that the timing of the termination was bad,asked,was it criminal or morality dealing with this school yes or no if you say yes,i can back you percent.if you say no,your timing bad and i ca back you any more.criminal or morality lyons eventually responded,i can say that coach mcgarry was not involved to our knowledge in any criminal activity.
the litigationa.the complaint 
mcgarry defamation claims were based on the article and lyons statement at the meeting with parents.mcgarry asserted university and pastoor were responsible for leaking the three defamatory accusations contained in the article,they knew two of the incidents the incident and the tirade in connection with the cheerleader incident were false,and the third was an unremarkable dispute between coaches.he also asserted lyons comments to the parents,when considered in context,contained an implied accusation that mcgarry had committed unspecified immoral acts warranting immediate dismissal.
b.the motions 
the motion 
all defendants,asserting the gravamen of mcgarry claims were based on protected speech,moved to dismiss his defamation claims under the statute.lyons argued mcgarry could not show probable success on the merits because,even assuming her statement at the parents meeting could be construed to contain an implied charge of immorality,the statement was not provably false and there was no clear and convincing evidence lyons knew the statement was provably false.pastoor,whose declaration denied he was the source of the leak for the article,asserted mcgarry could not show probable success on the merits because mcgarry had no admissible evidence that pastoor was the source for the article accusations.university asserted mcgarry could not show probable success on the merits because university liability was derivative of the liability of pastoor and lyons and,because the claims against them should be dismissed,the claims against university necessarily failed.
the shield law motion 
mcgarry moved for and obtained a continuance of the hearing on the motions,apparently without objection by university,to allow mcgarry to depose the authors of the article to obtain confirmation of the contents of and sources for the article however,newspaper refused to allow the depositions under the shield law.when university was unable to determine the names of the sources who gave the reporters the information contained in the article mcgarry moved to compel the depositions of newspaper reporters.
mcgarry motion to compel argued he was entitled,at a minimum,to ask the reporters to confirm that the statements contained in the article were in fact made by u niversity officials,and those questions would not transgress the shield law.he also argued newspaper had waived the shield law because a reporter allegedly told a third party pastoor was the source of the statements.newspaper opposed the motion,asserting the information sought by mcgarry was within the shield law,and the protections of the shield law create an absolute immunity against compelled disclosure rather than a waivable privilege.the court denied mcgarry motion to compel the depositions.
mcgarry opposition to the motion 
mcgarry asserted university,pastoor and lyon did not show his defamation claims were subject to section because the two sets of actionable statements were not taken in furtherance of the defendants constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,as defined by the statute mcgarry alternatively argued that,even if the burden shifted to him under the law,he had met the burden of showing probable success on the merits as to each set of claims.
the trial court granted the motions to strike.it first concluded the defendants met their initial burden of showing the conduct was within the ambit of the statute.it also concluded that,for two independent reasons,mcgarry had not shown probable success on the merits.first,insofar as his defamation claim rested on lyons charge by negative implication of immoral conduct,mcgarry had not shown this statement constituted actionable slander.second,insofar as his defamation claim rested on the statements in the article,mcgarry had no competent evidence that pastoor was the source of the statements.accordingly,the court granted the motions to strike.
the law provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.the purpose of the statute is to encourage participation in matters of public significance by allowing a court to promptly dismiss unmeritorious actions or claims brought to chill another valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.
the law involves a process for determining whether a claim is subject to being stricken.in the first step,the defendant bringing an motion must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff suit is subject to section by showing the defendant challenged acts were taken in furtherance of his or her constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,as defined by the statute.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d.
after the defendant satisfies the first step,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate there is a reasonable probability he or she will prevail on the merits at trial,subd.b.in this phase,the plaintiff must show both that the claim is legally sufficient and there is admissible evidence that,if credited,would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment.wilcox superior court th,d,disapproved on other grounds by equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn,d,robertson rodriguez th,d.in making this assessment,the court must consider both the legal sufficiency of and evidentiary support for the pleaded claims,and must also examine whether there are any constitutional or nonconstitutional defenses to the pleaded claims and,if so,whether there is evidence to negate any such defenses.traditional cat,gilbreath th,d.
in considering whether a plaintiff has met those evidentiary burdens,the court must consider the pleadings and the evidence submitted by the parties,subd.b.however,the court can not weigh the evidence looney superior court th,d but instead must simply determine whether the plaintiff evidence would,if credited,be sufficient to meet the burden of proof.wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d standard for assessing evidence is analogous to standard applicable to motions for nonsuit or directed verdict.
on appeal,we review de novo the trial court ruling on the motion to strike.bernardo planned parenthood federation of america th,d.
defendants satisfied their prima facie burden 
the trial court concluded the statements constituted speech in connection with a public issue qualifying for treatment under section,subdivision e.mcgarry occupied a position in san diego athletic community,and the abrupt termination of his employment,coming in the middle of a successful season and on the eve of an important game,was an issue of import to a substantial segment of the public.it was important to those immediately affected by the change in leadership,including the players,the players parents,and the staff connected to university football team.moreover,it was of import to those who follow the team fortunes,including university current students,university alumni and boosters potential recruits to the football team,and peripheral fans of the team.finally,the loss of a team head coach is of import to competitor schools,both for its immediate impact on the team performance in the remaining contests for the current season and for the reverberations on recruiting players for future seasons.
mcgarry asserts that,even assuming his employment termination was a public issue,the reasons for his termination were private and confidential matters,and therefore not converted into a matter of public interest merely because the public was curious about the reasons.however,the court in terry davis community church th,d,noting section does not provide a definition for an issue of public interest,explained 
a few guiding principles may be derived from decisional authorities.first,public interest does not equate with mere curiosity.citations.second,a matter of public interest should be something of concern to a substantial number of people.citation.thus,a matter of concern to the speaker and a relatively small,specific audience is not a matter of public interest.citations.third,there should be some degree of closeness between the challenged statements and the asserted public interest citation the assertion of a broad and amorphous public interest is not sufficient citation.fourth,the focus of the speaker conduct should be the public interest rather than a mere effort to gather ammunition for another round of private controversy citation.finally,those charged with defamation can not,by their own conduct,create their own defense by making the claimant a public figure.citation.a person can not turn otherwise private information into a matter of public interest simply by communicating it to a large number of people.citations.quoting weinberg feisel th,d.id.at,d.
here,the considerations outlined in terry convince us the statements concerning mcgarry employment termination qualify for treatment.his termination was of concern to a substantial number of people,and it is difficult to imagine a greater closeness between the topic of the public interest the termination and the challenged statements the reasons for the termination.indeed,the focus of the speakers statements were to respond to the public interest rather than a mere effort to gather ammunition for another round of private controversy.weinberg feisel,supra,th at,d.finally,university,pastoor and lyons did not by their conduct create a defense by thrusting mcgarry into the public eye mcgarry role as head coach of a local university football team already made him a public figure,and his employment termination was already a topic of widespread public interest.
mcgarry correctly notes that,although we are admonished to broadly construe the statute,it can not be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is illegal as a matter of law and,for that reason,not protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition.flatley mauro cal th,d.he argues that because the content of the statements reasons for terminating his the unauthorized disclosure of confidential and privileged information that can never qualify as protected speech,it was error to apply the statute.however,mcgarry cites no relevant authority holding that otherwise public acts by an employee are transmogrified into confidential personnel information merely because the employer subjectively relies on them as grounds to terminate the employee the only case cited by city of santa clara d.disclosure of a confidential interoffice memo explaining the employee had been terminated from employment for dishonesty,unauthorized absences and violation of departmental rules.there was no suggestion these transgressions were public acts by the employee or were otherwise known to the public 
we conclude the trial court correctly found the conduct was speech in connection with a public issue or a matter of public interest within the meaning of section,subdivision e.accordingly,the burden shifted to mcgarry to show there was a reasonably probability he would prevail on the merits at trial by demonstrating his claim was legally sufficient and that there was admissible evidence that,if credited,would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment for him.
defamation principles 
mcgarry asserts the statements contained in the article and made by lyons were defamatory.before evaluating the rulings of the trial court as to each set of statements we outline the general principles that guide our resolution of claims for defamation by a limited public figure.
a.the defamatory statement 
a claim for defamation requires proof of a false and unprivileged publication that exposes the plaintiff to hatred,contempt,ridicule,or obloquy,or which causes him to be shunned or avoided,or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.a statement is defamatory when it tends directly to injure a person in respect to his office,profession,trade or business,either by imputing to him general disqualification in those respects which the office or other occupation peculiarly requires,or by imputing something with reference to his office,trade,profession,or business that has a natural tendency to lessen its profits,subd.statements that contain such a charge directly,and without the need for explanatory matter,are libelous per se.a statement can also be libelous per se if it contains a charge by implication from the language employed by the speaker and a listener could understand the defamatory meaning without the necessity of knowing extrinsic explanatory matter.macleod tribune publishing cal d.however,if the listener would not recognize the defamatory meaning without knowledge of specific facts and circumstances,extrinsic to the publication,which are not matters of common knowledge rationally attributable to all reasonable persons superior court d,the matter is deemed defamatory per quod and requires pleading and proof of special damages.ibid.
the sine qua non of recovery for defamation is the existence of falsehood.letter carriers austin,d.because the statement must contain a provable falsehood,courts distinguish between statements of fact and statements of opinion for purposes of defamation liability.although statements of fact may be actionable as libel,statements of opinion are constitutionally protected.baker los angeles herald examiner cal d.however,the court in milkovich lorain journal,d,refining the distinction between nonactionable statements of opinion and actionable assertions of false facts,rejected the contention that statements of opinion enjoy blanket constitutional protection.milkovich reasoned that s imply couching such statements in terms of opinion does not dispel these false,defamatory implications id.at.because a speaker may still imply a knowledge of facts which lead to the defamatory conclusion.id.at.the court explained that expressions of opinion may imply an assertion of objective fact,and a statement that implies a false assertion of fact,even if couched as an opinion,can be actionable.id.at.
thus,under milkovich,the question is not strictly whether the published statement is fact or opinion,but is instead whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude the published statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact.citations.whether a statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact is a question of law for the court to decide citations,unless the statement is susceptible of both an innocent and a libelous meaning,in which case the jury must decide how the statement was understood citations.franklin dynamic details,th,d.
to determine whether a statement is actionable fact or nonactionable opinion,courts use a totality of the circumstances test of whether the statement in question communicates or implies a provably false statement of fact.franklin dynamic details,supra,th at,d.under the totality of the circumstances test,f irst,the language of the statement is examined.for words to be defamatory,they must be understood in a defamatory sense next,the context in which the statement was made must be considered.baker los angeles herald examiner,supra,cal d at.
constitutional malice and clear and convincing evidence 
public figure 
a threshold determination in a defamation action is whether the plaintiff is a public figure.the courts have defined two classes of public figures.the first is the all purpose public figure who has achiev ed such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts.the second category is that of the limited purpose or vortex public figure,an individual who voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.citing gertz robert welch,d.unlike the all purpose public figure,the limited purpose public figure loses certain protection for his or her reputation only to the extent that the allegedly defamatory communication relates to his role or her in a public controversy.reader digest superior court cal d.
constitutional malice 
when the plaintiff is a public figure,he or she may not recover defamation damages merely by showing the defamatory statement was false.instead,the plaintiff must also show the speaker made the objectionable statement with malice in its constitutional sense that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.reader digest superior court,supra,cal d at.the test is a subjective test,under which the defendant actual belief concerning the truthfulness of the publication is the crucial issue.citation.this test directs attention to the defendant attitude toward the truth or falsity of the material published,not the defendant attitude toward the plaintiff.quoting widener pacific gas electric d,disapproved on other grounds by mccoy hearst cal d,fn.reader digest,at.
the reckless disregard test is not a negligence test measured by whether a reasonably prudent person would have published,or would have investigated before publishing,the defamatory statement.amant thompson,d.instead,the evidence must permit the conclusion that the defendant actually had a high degree of awareness of probable falsity.citation.as a result,failure to investigate before publishing,even when a reasonably prudent person would have done so,is not sufficient to establish reckless disregard.citations.communications connaughton,d.instead,to support a finding of actual malice,the failure to investigate must fairly be characterized as demonstrating the speaker purposefully avoided the truth or deliberately decided not to acquire knowledge of facts that might confirm the probable falsity of charges.antonovich superior court d.
the requisite malice must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.this standard requires that the evidence of actual knowledge of the falsity or reckless disregard for its falsity must be of such a character as to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.rosenaur scherer th,d.
mcgarry was a limited purpose public figure 
mcgarry asserts he was not a limited purpose public figure,and therefore need not meet the more stringent constitutional malice standards and its associated quantum of proof,because the position he held and the reasons for his employment termination did not involve a dispute affecting the general public or some segment of the general public in any appreciable way.
numerous courts,beginning with the supreme court opinion in curtis publishing butts,d,have concluded professional and collegiate athletes and coaches are at least limited purpose public figures.see,brewer memphis pub,cir,chuy philadelphia eagles football club.a common thread in these cases is that one voluntary decision to pursue a career in sports,whether as an athlete or a coach,invites attention and comment regarding his job performance and thus constitutes an assumption of the risk of negative publicity.barry time.the court in time,johnston cir,holding a professional basketball player was deemed a limited public figure for purposes of his libel suit alleging he had been defamed in an article questioning his conduct as a player,explained he had offered his services to the public as a paid performer and had thereby invited comments on his performance as such.in a sense,he assumed the risk of publicity,good or bad,as the case might be,so far as it concerned his public performance.the publication in question related strictly to his public character.it made no reference to his private life,it involved no intrusion into his private affairs.it dealt entirely with his performance as a professional basketball player it discussed him in connection with a public event in which the plaintiff as a compensated public figure had taken part voluntarily.
mcgarry voluntarily entered the public arena as a college football coach,and the statements dealt exclusively with his performance of the public role he voluntarily undertook.we conclude mcgarry was a limited purpose public figure for purposes of the allegedly defamatory statements.
lyons statement 
we must assess whether mcgarry showed a likelihood of success on the merits in light of the applicable standards for a defamation claim by a limited public figure.rosenaur scherer,supra,th at,d.we conclude mcgarry did not show he was likely to prevail on the merits of his claim,insofar as it was based on lyons statement,for at least two reasons 
first,we conclude the statement was not reasonably susceptible of being interpreted to imply a provably false assertion of fact.couch san juan unified school dist.th,d whether statement reasonably susceptible of interpretation which implies provably false assertion of fact is question of law for court.lyons statement did not expressly assert mcgarry employment had been terminated because of immoral behavior moreover,even assuming we accepted mcgarry claim that lyons impliedly asserted he had engaged in some unspecified immoral behavior,the statement still is incapable of being interpreted as implying a provably false assertion of fact.behavior that might qualify as immoral to one person,although being perfectly acceptable to another person,demonstrates that an amorphous assertion of immoral behavior is within the range of statements of opinion that are not actionable.
because lyons statement contains no hint of what conduct she believed mcgarry had engaged in that would be immoral,her statement neither contained nor implied a provably false assertion of fact,but at most implied an opinion.we agree with the court in held pokorny,which concluded a statement that the plaintiff was immoral was a nonactionable statement of opinion,and its observation that concepts of morality are infinitely debatable,and their precise meaning is extremely elusive.as justice hunt noted over years ago,the principle of right and wrong,or morality or immorality,is impossible as an element of proof indeed,the court could not instruct the jury on how to evaluate the truth of a charge of immorality without entering an age old debate better left to philosophers.id.at,fns.omitted.
the amorphous nature of the implied assertion is fatal for a second reason mcgarry evidence did not demonstrate malice,that lyons subjectively believed her statement was or was likely a false statement.lyons declaration accompanying her motion affirmatively averred that she believed,based on information she had received from people she believed to be reliable sources,that mcgarry had engaged in some conduct she believed to be immoral.mcgarry produced no contrary evidence,much less evidence capable of command ing the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind rosenaur scherer,supra,th at,d,that lyons subjectively believed mcgarry in fact had not or likely had not engaged in the underlying conduct,or that she subjectively believed the underlying conduct was not immoral.
because mcgarry has no evidence lyons made a statement reasonably susceptible of being interpreted to imply a provably false assertion of fact,nor clear and convincing evidence the opinion she did express was based on facts she either knew were false or believed were likely to be false,mcgarry can not show a likelihood of success on the merits and the court ruling granting lyons motion was therefore correct.
the article statements 
the trial court,after denying mcgarry motion to compel the depositions of newspaper reporters,granted pastoor motion because mcgarry had no competent evidence pastoor was the source of the statements.the trial court also granted university motion because mcgarry had no competent evidence upon which to premise respondeat superior liability for university for the statements contained in the article.
mcgarry argues it was error to deny the motion to compel the depositions of newspaper reporters,and the error requires reversal of the rulings on the motions.first,he argues newspaper waived the protections of the shield law and therefore should have been compelled to reveal that pastoor or perhaps some other university official for whom university would have respondeat superior liability made the defamatory statements.he alternatively argues,even were he barred from obtaining the precise identity of the source,it was nevertheless error to deny the depositions because the limited information he sought was outside the protections of the shield law,and the limited information he was entitled to obtain would have met his burden of showing a likelihood of success on his defamation claims.accordingly,he argues the erroneous denial of his discovery motion requires reversal of the rulings on pastoor and university motions because those depositions would have garnered evidence that would have satisfied his burden.
a.the article 
the october article reported several sources at the school told newspaper it was a series of incidents over the past two months that led to mcgarry employment termination,and later stated several u niversity officials,speaking on the condition of anonymity,outlined a culmination of events that led to mcgarry termination.italics added.the article contained no specification of what these incidents or events were until recitation later in the article that t he sources said three incidents in particular italics added led to mcgarry termination,and specified the incident,the verbal argument incident,and the cheerleader incident.
b.the shield law 
california law provides that a publisher,editor,reporter,or other person connected with or employed upon a newspaper shall not be adjudged in contempt by a judicial body for refusing to disclose the source of any information procured while so connected or employed for publication or for refusing to disclose any unpublished information obtained or prepared in gathering,receiving or processing of information for communication to the public.cal,art.i,subd.b see also,subd.a.
c.the immunity was not waived 
mcgarry appears to concede,absent a determination the authors of the article graney and zeigler can be held to have waived the protections of the shield law,he could not obtain a court order compelling them to identify who stated as reported in the article mcgarry had engaged in an argument in connection with the cheerleader incident or stated he had kick ed a ball at a member of the training staff.however,mcgarry asserts that because zeigler allegedly told a third party gosen pastoor was graney source,the reporters should be deemed to have waived the protections of the shield law and mcgarry should be entitled to an order compelling graney and zeigler to answer whether pastoor was the person who told them mcgarry had engaged in an argument and had kicked a ball at a member of the training staff.
factual basis for waiver argument 
mcgarry deposed gosen,the sports information director for university,and asked about a telephone conversation between gosen and zeigler.during that telephone conversation,zeigler allegedly told gosen that graney had had some prior communication with pastoor where pastoor allegedly confirmed the same three incidents after pastoor went off the record.
the immunity was not waived 
newspaper argues that the shield law provides an immunity not forfeited on the facts presented here the embodiment of the shield law into the california constitution evidenced an intention to provide the broadest protections for a journalist unpublished materials and their sources for information,whether published or unpublished.delaney superior court cal d.in new york times superior court cal d,the court concluded the shield law confers an absolute immunity against compelled disclosure of the protected information and,although that immunity must occasionally yield when it threatens to frustrate the competing federal constitutional right of a criminal defendant to a fair trial,there is no analogous competing right of a civil litigant that will suffice to overcome the immunity.id.at.
the issue of whether a party may obtain unpublished information because the journalist waived the immunity by his or her published information was addressed by the court in playboy enterprises,superior court d.the court rejected that claim,reasoning the shield law protects all unpublished information,even information that could or would confirm or amplify the published information derived therefrom.id.at.moreover,the court rejected the argument that the journalist,by publishing quotes and attributing them to marin,had no cognizable interest in refusing to disclose its working and editorial materials to protect the confidentiality of its source and thus has no further interest in protecting its undisseminated material.ibid.the court reasoned that any undisseminated material remained protected by the shield law,including materials that would confirm or refute the accuracy of the statements attributed to plaintiff marin in the playboy magazine article because it is evident that the published information attributed to marin in the article is either based upon or related to the underlying records of the interview.accordingly,this material falls squarely within the ambit of the shield law protection whether the published information is an exact transcription of the source material or paraphrases or summarizes it.id.at.thus,the court held that unpublished information remained protected even though the journalist published some information and published the identity of the source.here,mcgarry claims that revealing the identity of a source for the article constituted a waiver of the protections for unpublished information,to wit,the identity of the source of information for the articles.under playboy enterprises,we do not believe a limited disclosure can be deemed to waive the immunity for refusing to reveal unpublished information,including the unidentified sources of the information 
mcgarry cites no pertinent authority supporting his claim that the reporters immunity was waived.because the shield law is absolute on its face,and mcgarry has no countervailing federal constitutional right against which the reporters state constitutional protections must be balanced,we conclude the reporters could not be compelled to reveal the sources for their article.
d.the limited discovery would not have satisfied mcgarry burden 
mcgarry asserts that,even without an order compelling the reporters to disclose the identity of the sources,the court ruling on the motion should nevertheless be reversed.he asserts the limited information he sought was outside the protections of the shield law because he sought only an order compelling the reporters to,in effect,repeat under oath the facts stated in the article.mcgarry notes the article alone was incompetent under the hearsay rule to prove either the content of the defamatory statements or that u niversity officials uttered the defamatory statements,and he argues he was entitled to obviate university hearsay objection to the article by compelling the reporters to verify they heard the defamatory statements from in the words of the article several sources at the school or u niversity officials.he asserts this would not have offended the shield law because such limited testimony would not require the reporters to reveal anything beyond the published materials.
we conclude it is unnecessary to determine whether the shield law precludes deposing the reporters for the limited purposes proposed by mcgarry,because even if the trial court erred by preventing mcgarry from obtaining the testimony he sought,the testimony would still have been ineffective to satisfy his burden.it is necessary to conduct a separate evaluation of mcgarry claim against pastoor and his claim against university because distinct,albeit overlapping,considerations convince us that compelling the reporters to authenticate or verify the article content would not have provided mcgarry with evidence that would have satisfied his burden.
claim against pastoor 
mcgarry cause of action against pastoor required proof that pastoor was the utterer of the defamatory statements.even ignoring that the attribution contained in the article is ambiguous the article and presumably the reporters repetition thereof at a deposition would not identify which of the defamatory utterances if any were attributable to pastoor rather than to one of the other several sources at the school.mcgarry claims a jury could infer,by process of elimination,pastoor must have been the utterer because he was the only individual who both knew the underlying reasons for the termination and spoke to the press prior to october.however,mcgarry concedes there were numerous other individuals pastoor,lyons,joann nestor,kevin blackmun,a few individuals working in university human resources department,and perhaps dan yourg and gosen aware of what underlying incidents formed the basis for university decision to terminate him prior to october,and the article contains nothing that would narrow the field of potential sources to pastoor mcgarry claims the jury could infer pastoor must have been the source because university purportedly conceded that only three people associated with university pastoor,gosen and yourg knowledgeable about the termination spoke to the press.even assuming the evidence mcgarry relies on for this assertion had been presented below but see fn,the evidence does not support more than speculation that pastoor rather than gosen or yourg or perhaps another person who spoke to the press but did not reveal that fact to university was the source of some or all of the defamatory statements.
moreover,the applicable standard of proof required for mcgarry defamation action requires clear and convincing evidence the speaker uttered the defamatory remarks knowing them to be false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.we apprehend that this requirement necessarily incorporates the same standard of proof for the identity of the utterer,because clear and convincing evidence of the utterer state of mind can not proceed without clear and convincing evidence identifying whose state of mind is at issue.while mcgarry proposed process of elimination might provide a tenuous inference that pastoor was the utterer of either or both of the statements,it would not provide clear and convincing evidence that he rather than some other person whose state of mind would be relevant spoke the words with constitutional malice.
finally,the burden requires a showing the evidence wo
