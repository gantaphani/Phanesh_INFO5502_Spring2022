introduction 
dawn mcintyre mcintyre,a former employee of the sonoma valley unified school district the district,filed a petition for writ of mandate code civ,to compel the district to reinstate her as a permanent tenured teacher.the primary issue in this case is whether the district had a mandatory duty under the education code to classify mcintyre as a probationary employee rather than as a temporary employee.whether mcintyre was properly classified as temporary instead of probationary is a matter of some consequence because a teacher job classification is important in determining a teacher rights to reelection retention and promotion and to determining the level of procedural protections to which a teacher is entitled should he or she be dismissed or nonreelected for the next school year,as happened in mcintyre case.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,kavanaugh.the trial court denied mcintyre petition after ruling that the district had properly classified her during her three years of service.we affirm 
statutory overview and facts 
before reciting mcintyre employment history with the district,we briefly review california complex and somewhat rigid legislative scheme for classifying public school teachers,with emphasis on the sections that have the most applicability to this case.kavanaugh,supra,cal th at.the statutory classification scheme applies typically to employees occupying positions requiring certification qualifications bakersfield elementary teachers bakersfield city school dist.th,bakersfield.in this case,mcintyre holds a multiple subject teaching credential authorizing her to teach kindergarten through eighth grade.california education code requires that certificated employees,like mcintyre,be classified in one of four ways permanent,probationary,substitute,or temporary,kavanaugh,supra,at bakersfield,supra,at.
a certificated employee is classified as permanent tenured if,after having been employed for two complete successive school years in a probationary position,he or she is reelected retained for the following year,subd.b.permanent employees receive the maximum amount of procedural protection.for example,a permanent employee may not be dismissed unless one or more statutorily enumerated grounds are shown and then only after being afforded an opportunity for a due process hearing.
the classification of probationary is the default classification.school districts must classify all teachers as probationary who are not otherwise required by the education code to be classified as permanent,temporary,or substitute.bakersfield,supra,th at.probationary teachers have some limited protections against dismissal.school districts may dismiss a probationary employee during the school year,but only for cause,or for unsatisfactory performance.however,a school district can terminate a probationary teacher employment effective at the end of the teacher yearly contract without any showing of cause,without any statement of reasons,and without any right of administrative redress.kavanaugh,supra,cal th at california teachers mendocino unified school dist.th.
temporary teachers receive the least amount of job protection.the education code recognizes two general kinds of temporary employees those who are employed to serve in temporary assignments see,and those who are employed for up to one year to replace certificated employees who are on leave or have a lengthy illness see.the latter category is considered a replacement teacher and is the job classification mcintyre was assigned for the vast majority of her employment with the district.bakersfield,supra,th at.
in the case of permanent and probationary employees,the employer power to terminate employment is restricted by statute.substitute and temporary employees,on the other hand,fill the short range needs of a school district and generally may be summarily released.citation.citation.vasquez happy valley union school dist.th,vasquez kavanaugh,supra,cal th at.no statement of reasons or hearing is required to release or nonreelect a temporary teacher if notice is given pursuant to section all that is required is the school district issuance of the statutory notice to the employee.vasquez,supra,th at.because the substitute and temporary classifications are not guaranteed procedural due process by statute,they are narrowly defined by the legislature,and should be strictly interpreted.balen peralta junior college dist.cal d,california teachers vallejo city unified school dist.th.
section requires school districts to classify their employees into one of these four classifications at the time of employment.the district must give each new employee a written statement indicating the employee classification no later than the first day of paid service.if the district hires a teacher as a temporary employee,the statement must clearly indicate the temporary nature of the employment and the length of the employment term.if the statement does not indicate the temporary nature of the employment,or if the statement is untimely,the employee is deemed to be a probationary employee as a matter of law.see kavanaugh,supra,cal th at california supreme court enforced section by requiring school district to reclassify a temporary teacher as probationary because it had failed to notify the teacher of her temporary classification at the commencement of her employment.
we now turn to mcintyre employment history with the district.
school year 
on or about august,mcintyre was notified she would be employed by the district for the school year,specifically from august,to june.she was given a written notice of terms of employment classifying her as a temporary employee under section based on the need for additional certificated employees because of leave or illness of another employee.mcintyre was employed as a fifth grade teacher at dunbar elementary school.on or about march,mcintyre was notified pursuant to section that she would be from continued temporary employment in the district.
school year 
on or about may,barbara young,the former superintendent of the district,notified mcintyre that the district had certificated employee positions available for the school year,and that mcintyre would once again be offered employment with the district.she was once again given a written notice of terms of employment classifying her as a temporary employee under section based on the need for additional certificated employees because of leave or illness of another employee.during the school year,mcintyre was assigned to teach a third grade class at dunbar elementary school.on or about march,mcintyre was notified pursuant to section that she would be from continued temporary employment in the district for the school year.

on or about may,mcintyre was notified that the district had certificated employee positions available for the school year.she was once again given a written notice of terms of employment classifying her as a temporary employee under section based on the need for additional certificated employees because of leave or illness of another employee.during the school year,mcintyre was assigned to teach a combined grade class at dunbar elementary school.on or about october,mcintyre was notified that the district board of trustees approved changing her status from temporary employee to a probationary employee.in granting mcintyre probationary status,the district included or tacked on mcintyre service as a temporary employee during the school year section directs governing boards of school districts to notify probationary employees of their decision to reelect or nonreelect them by march of the employees second complete consecutive school year of employment.if no notice is given,the employee is deemed reelected.on or about march,mcintyre was notified that the board had taken action pursuant to section to her from continued employment in the district for the school year.mcintyre last day of employment in the district was june.
on july,mcintyre filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate.in essence,mcintyre alleged that,but for the district failure and refusal to provide her with the proper employment classification,she would have completed her probationary employment status on march,and would have earned the right to continued employment and other benefits as a tenured teacher.mcintyre sought reemployment with the district and benefits and back wages which she would have earned but for the district failure to honor her rights to proper classification in her employment.
after oral argument,the court issued an order on december,denying mcintyre writ.after ruling on numerous evidentiary and timeliness issues,the court concluded that mcintyre did not attain permanent status because she was properly classified as a temporary employee for the and school years consequently,the court found that mcintyre has not met her evidentiary burden to establish that she is entitled to reemployment by the district as a permanent certificated employee due to purported classification errors this appeal followed.

ordinary mandamus is an appropriate remedy when challenging a school district assignment,classification,or discipline of a teacher.citations.vasquez,supra,th at code civ.in reviewing a trial court judgment on a petition for writ of mandate,the appellate court is required to exercise independent judgment on legal issues.kreeft city of oakland th.this appeal turns on the interpretation and application of numerous sections of the education code governing employment classification for public school teachers.the interpretation and applicability of statutes is clearly a question of law.sutco construction modesto high school dist.d.where the statute is clear,the plain meaning rule applies.ibid.the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.id.at.
to the extent that facts are disputed,they should be reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.vasquez,supra,th at.the substantial evidence standard for review has been described by our supreme court as a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.citation.we must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor citation.sfpp burlington northern santa fe ry.th.
b.the number of temporary certificated employees did not exceed the number of employees on leave 
mcintyre first argument is that,in violation of section,the district employed temporary employees in excess of the number of employees on leave of absence in each of the three school years she was employed and therefore,she is entitled to reclassification and employment in a permanent status.the district denied the factual allegation.
we emphasize at the outset that mcintyre has the burden of proof on this issue.t he party who seeks a writ of mandate has the burden of proving that the official body which fails to perform an act has thus violated its duty toward him by denying him a clear and present right.citations.fair fountain valley school dist.d,fair.
section provides in pertinent part notwithstanding the provisions of sections substitute employees and temporary employees,the governing board of a school district may employ as a teacher,for a complete school year,but not less than one semester during a school year unless the date of rendering first paid service begins during the second semester and prior to march,any person holding appropriate certification documents,and may classify such person as a temporary employee.the employment of such persons shall be based upon the need for additional certificated employees during a particular semester or year because a certificated employee has been granted leave for a semester or year,or is experiencing illness,and shall be limited,in number of persons so employed,to that need,as determined by the governing board.italics added.
the rationale behind section is to permit school districts to employ temporary teachers to replace teachers who are absent on leave.temporary teachers employed in compliance with section do not obtain reemployment rights because the temporary teacher is no longer needed when the absent teacher returns from leave.to confer probationary or permanent status on a teacher employed to replace a teacher who is out on leave would place the district in the untenable position of employing two teachers when only one position is available which would result in overstaffing.santa barbara federation of teachers santa barbara high sch.dist.d,santa barbara centinela valley secondary teachers centinela valley union high sch.dist.d.
it has been repeatedly held that a district ability to use section temporary classification is not dependent on a match of an employee on leave to a temporary teacher.see santa barbara,supra,d at we do not believe that section recodified as requires that a temporary teacher replace a particular employee on leave accord,bakersfield,supra,th at nothing in the statutory language or purpose of requires the temporary employee to replace a particular employee.rather,all that is required under section is that the number of temporary teachers not exceed the total number of probationary and permanent employees on leave at any one time.santa barbara,supra,at bakersfield,supra,at,and cases cited therein.
mcintyre submitted evidence purporting to show that in all three years of mcintyre employment,in violation of,the district continued to employ a greater number of teachers as temporary under as for other teachers on leave than the number to whom it had actually granted leave of absence.mcintyre evidence consisted of a declaration from her trial counsel with pages of documents appended to the declaration that were produced by the district as a result of a public record request,et.however,mcintyre counsel does not claim any particular expertise in the subject of public teacher employee classifications an extremely complicated subject,and cites no effort to explain how counsel analyzed the district document,or how the figures used in mcintyre writ petition were derived.
based on this evidentiary showing,mcintyre argued that the district conduct,by employing certified teachers and classifying them as temporary under in number s exceeding those permanent and probationary certificated employees on leave of absence from their duties,was an violation of.because of this statutory violation,mcintyre contends the district had no basis to classify her as a temporary teacher under section in either the or school years.therefore,she is entitled to be reclassified into the presumptive classification probationary status for those two school years,and must be accorded all of the rights of probationary employees as provided in the education code,including acquiring credit toward permanent status under section.see kavanaugh,supra,cal th at under,subd.b,if a certificated probationary employee works for two complete consecutive school years and is then reelected for the next succeeding year,the employee is deemed elevated to permanent status by operation of law.
consequently,mcintyre maintains she became a permanent tenured teacher of the district during the school year pursuant to section based on her first two complete consecutive school years as a probationary employee and,the district failure to give her proper notice of nonreelection after two years as a probationary employee as opposed to a temporary employee,and her reemployment for the third school year.
the district provided conflicting documentary evidence to support its argument that section does not operate to confer permanent status on mcintyre because there were a sufficient number of teachers on leave to justify mcintyre temporary classification under section during all three years of her employment.specifically,the district submitted a declaration with supporting documentation from ashley halliday who was the director of human resources for the district for the years in question,which showed that the district maintained an appropriate balance of temporary employees to employees on leaves of absence during the three years mcintyre was a district employee.specifically,halliday proffered documentary evidence that in the school year,employees were on a leave of absence for all or a portion of their positions.during this timeframe,there were certificated employees who were classified as temporary employees replacing the district employees who were on leaves of absence.
likewise,halliday declaration referred to appended documentary evidence demonstrating that during the school year,the district had certificated employees on leaves of absence and certificated employees classified as temporary employees filling in for district employees on leaves of absence.
halliday declaration also relied on documents for the school year demonstrating that the district had certificated employees on leaves of absence and certificated employees classified as temporary employees filling in for those employees.
faced with this conflict,the trial court found the district evidence to be determinative,finding that i t reasonably appears to the court that the district had more permanent and probationary certificated employees on leaves of absence than it had certificated employees working under temporary contracts during each of the,and school years.while mcintyre invites this court to the court resolution of this conflicting evidence,we are not permitted to do so under our standard of review.as was stated in shamblin brattain cal d,the trial court,with declarations and supporting affidavits,is able to assess credibility and resolve any conflicts in the evidence.its findings are entitled to great weight.even though contrary findings could have been made,an appellate court should defer to the factual determinations made by the trial court when the evidence is in conflict.this is true whether the trial court ruling is based on oral testimony or declarations.citation.id.at,italics fn.omitted accord,weathers kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.
accordingly,the trial court did not err in concluding that the district established that the number of temporary certificated employees did not exceed the number of certificated employees on leave at any time during the years mcintyre was classified as a temporary employee as required by section.
c.the school district is authorized to release and reemploy a teacher in temporary status 
alternatively,mcintyre makes the broad claim that nothing in the pertinent legislation allow s for the continuing cycle of employment as a temporary teacher,nonreelection under,subd.b and as a temporary teacher which she suffered.she contends that the district tried to circumvent the tenure statutes by employing her for three years principally as a temporary employee.consequently,she argues that she was denied her proper and lawful rights to probationary and subsequently permanent or tenured employment classification.
as already explained,in order to prevail on her writ of mandate,mcintyre was required to prove that she had a clear,present,and beneficial right in classification as a permanent employee,and that the district had a clear,present,and ministerial duty to classify her as such.fair,supra,d at.in addition,mcintyre must also prove that the district acted arbitrarily,capriciously,fraudulently,or without due regard for her rights.id.at.mcintyre has not met this burden.there is absolutely no evidence that the district actions were arbitrary,capricious,or fraudulent,or undertaken in order to deprive mcintyre of any rights,including permanent teaching status.
at the outset,we emphasize that there is nothing in the education code that precludes a school district from hiring temporary teachers to replace teachers on leave on a basis without elevating them to probationary status.this is confirmed by santa barbara,supra,d,where the court considered many of the same issues presented in this appeal.in santa barbara,petitioners sought to compel the district to grant them probationary status based on their three consecutive years of employment as temporary teachers.id.at.the santa barbara court held that the legislature has authorized school districts to replace teachers on leave and that the petitioners three years of temporary service did not compel their classification as permanent or probationary teachers.id.at.the appellate court noted the districts ability to employ a temporary employee to replace a teacher on leave enabled the district to offer more consistent instruction than a succession of substitute teachers could provide while avoiding the problem of overstaffing when the employee on leave returned.id.at.consequently,the mere continuity of employment by a temporary or substitute teacher in a position regularly held by a probationary or permanent teacher does not,by itself,give rise to tenured status.citation.id.at.the court concluded by stating,w hen,as in the present case,the statutes plainly do not compel the classification to a higher status,the terms of the contracts of employment must be deemed controlling.citation.id.at.
mcintyre was properly classified for the,and school years 
mcintyre appeal is based on the simple premise that she was deprived of the job classifications to which she was legally entitled.after reviewing the statutory classification system and mcintyre employment history with the district,we conclude that mcintyre has failed to prove that she had a clear,present,and beneficial right to a different employment classification during her three years with the district.fair,supra,d at.
for mcintyre first full year of employment with the district,it is undisputed that her notice of terms of employment explicitly states she was a temporary employee as described by section,replacing a certificated employee on leave of absence for the school year.it is also undisputed that in march of the school year,the district timely released mcintyre pursuant to section,subdivision b.while mcintyre argued below that her employment was not governed by section because she was not truly replacing a teacher who was on leave,and there were actually more temporary teachers employed than teachers out on leave,this argument was rejected by the trial court,and we have affirmed that determination on appeal.therefore,mcintyre classification as a temporary employee for the school year was proper.
for mcintyre second full year of employment,she was once again given written notice of her terms of employment placing her in a temporary position replacing a teacher on leave under section,and she once again was timely released pursuant to section,subdivision b.in certain specified circumstances,either section or section can automatically transform a teacher classification from a temporary employee to a probationary employee.however,when the facts underlying mcintyre employment in are considered,we find mcintyre is not entitled to invoke either section.
section provides,in pertinent part any person employed for one complete school year as a temporary employee shall,if reemployed for the following school year in a vacant position requiring certification qualifications,be classified by the governing board as a probationary employee and the previous year employment as a temporary employee shall be deemed one year employment as a probationary employee for purposes of acquiring permanent status.section goes on to explain for purposes of this section vacant position means a position in which the employee is qualified to serve and which is not filled by a permanent or probationary employee.it shall not include a position which would be filled by a permanent or probationary employee except for the fact that such employee is on leave.italics added.
consequently,while section permits a temporary employee who has served one full year in a temporary position and who is reemployed the following school year in a vacant position to be classified as a probationary employee,and to have the first year of employment as a temporary employee reclassified as probationary for the purposes of acquiring permanent status,mcintyre does not qualify under the express terms of this provision.one critical fact in the analysis of section,is that the term vacant position is specifically defined by that statute,and it doe
