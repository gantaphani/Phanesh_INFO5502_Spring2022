plaintiff excelsior college,a new distance learning nursing program,sought writs of mandate,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief,in response to decisions of the california board of registered nursing board altering the board interpretation and application of business and professions code section previously,the board recognized excelsior program as equivalent to the minimum requirements of accredited programs in california,thus enabling excelsior graduates to apply for licensure in california.the board,however,recently concluded it has no authority to evaluate programs is,before a nursing program graduate applies for licensure.excelsior seeks to invalidate the board interpretation of section and compel the board to continue accepting the excelsior program as equivalent to california minimum requirements.the trial court sustained the board demurrer to excelsior petition for writs of mandate and causes of action for declaratory and injunctive relief.
on appeal,excelsior alleges multiple errors in the trial court ruling,but the arguments revolve around whether section requires the board to continue evaluating nursing programs,such as excelsior,prospectively,and whether the board actions violated any administrative duties it owed to excelsior.we conclude the trial court did not err in dismissing excelsior complaint because section does not require the board to make prospective evaluations of programs such as excelsior and excelsior has no right to an administrative hearing on the board interpretation and application of section.
statutory and regulatory framework 
the nursing practice act,section et,governs the licensing requirements and the practice of nursing in california.it also created the board of registered nursing to oversee licensure of registered nurses in california.the primary purpose of the board is to protect the public.protection of the public shall be the highest priority for the board of registered nursing in exercising its licensing,regulatory,and disciplinary functions.whenever the protection of the public is inconsistent with other interests sought to be promoted,the protection of the public shall be paramount.
the board is responsible for ensuring the quality of nursing in california.specifically,the board is responsible for licensing and disciplining nurses within this state.the board also has authority to accredit nursing schools located in california.students who graduate from an accredited program are eligible to apply for licensure.
section,subdivision a provides that a nursing applicant seeking licensure in california must have either successfully completed required courses of instruction in an accredited program or successfully completed courses of instruction in a school of nursing outside of this state which,in the opinion of the board at the time the application is filed with the board of registered nursing,are equivalent to the minimum requirements of the board for licensure established for an accredited program in this state.
section,subdivision b provides the board shall determine by regulation the required subjects of instruction to be completed in an approved school of nursing for licensure as a registered nurse and shall include the minimum units of theory and clinical experience necessary to achieve essential clinical competency at the entry level of the registered nurse.the board standards shall be designed to encourage all schools to provide clinical instructions in all phases of the educational process.
california code of regulations,title,section,identifies the coursework requirements for programs.these requirements include an equal number of units in both theory and clinical practice.graduates of california nursing programs are required to complete semester or quarter units of supervised clinical practice,concurrent with classes in theory,in five areas of nursing,including,mental health,psychiatric nursing and geriatrics.in clinical practice,students learn the vital skills that are at the heart of nursing practice.nursing students receive supervised clinical practice with rotations to various settings hospitals,clinics,with a variety of patients adults,pediatrics,obstetrics,psychiatric,geriatric.some of the skills that require supervised clinical practice are administering medications,including injections assessing patient pain levels and performing mental status exams,including assessing psychiatric and geriatric patients.nursing students learn how to manage multiple patients at the same time,and they learn to distinguish various symptoms by working with numerous patients who have a wide range of health conditions.to fulfill the clinical practice unit requirements,california nursing students must complete a minimum of hours of supervised clinical practice.
background 
documents filed by excelsior provide the following background information excelsior college formerly known as regents college is a distance learning program,based in new york.excelsior programs,including its nursing programs,are designed to enable individuals to earn college degrees by using college courses,proficiency examinations,and special assessment.the programs are free of customary time constraints and permit students to satisfy requirements at their own pace.
in,the board began officially accepting excelsior nursing program as equivalent to the minimum requirements of the board for licensure established for an accredited program in this state,pursuant to section,subdivision a.this acceptance continued for more than years.
in august,the board received correspondence from the statewide organization of public health nursing directors expressing concern about the skill level of new graduates from some nursing schools.the board subsequent inquiry revealed that the nursing education provided by excelsior college did not meet minimum education requirements for california registered nursing licensure because it lacked sufficient supervised clinical practice.
excelsior supervised clinical practice consisted of students taking and passing its clinical performance nursing examination cpne.the cpne is a weekend course,administered over two and days,with a limited number of patients involving only two areas of nursing.as opposed to california hours of supervised clinical practice in a variety of settings with various patients,excelsior students simply take the weekend cpne.excelsior reports that of students fail the cpne.this differed substantially from the minimum hours of supervised clinical practice required under california code of regulations,title,section.the cpne,in the board opinion,is not equivalent to the minimum education requirements for clinical practice under california licensure law.
the board notified excelsior of its concerns and engaged in numerous discussions with excelsior and its counsel.between august,and october,the board communicated with excelsior and its counsel,either in writing,via telephone,or in person on at least six occasions to discuss ways for excelsior to come into compliance with california clinical supervision requirement.on january,the board committee recommended removing recognition of excelsior program and,on february,the board deferred action at excelsior request.at subsequent meetings,the committee continued to recommend cessation of the recognition of excelsior program as meeting california requirements,but the board continued to defer action at excelsior request.meanwhile,excelsior contacted members of the california legislature,conveying concerns that the board was unfairly evaluating excelsior nursing program.excelsior final opportunity to present a plan to comply with california clinical practice requirement occurred on october.
on december,the board approved a motion itemizing the requirements an excelsior graduate must satisfy for the applicant coursework to be considered equivalent to california minimum requirements.the board later determined this decision was too narrow and did not fully resolve the issue.on february,the board superseded the december,decision with the following 
excelsior college graduates,like other graduates,must meet the requirements set forth in california business and professions code section a and california code of regulations section,including the requirement of supervised clinical practice concurrent with theory,in order to be eligible for examination and licensure as a california registered nurse.this eligibility requirement applies to students who enrolled at excelsior on or after december.
excelsior sought four types of relief to correct the board alleged erroneous interpretation of section and to reinstate excelsior previous recognition.excelsior sought a traditional writ of mandate,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,compelling the board to set aside its february,decision and reinstate the board prior recognition of excelsior program as equivalent.excelsior asked for the same relief through an administrative writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.excelsior sought injunctive relief to prevent the board from implementing its february,decision.finally,excelsior asked the court to declare the following the board requirement that graduates demonstrate exact compliance with the minimum california requirements constitutes an underground regulation excelsior is entitled to continued recognition that its nursing programs are equivalent to the minimum requirements for approved schools,absent a showing of a change of fact or law the board application of its underground regulation to excelsior college violates an executive order not discussed on appeal and the board interpretation of section,subdivision a violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution 
in its complaint,excelsior alleged the board,without offering any evidence of changes in either excelsior program or the requirements,revoked its prior findings that excelsior nursing programs were equivalent to the requirements of schools.excelsior alleged the board assertion that it has no statutory authority to make prospective findings regarding the equivalency of schools is contrary to law.it claimed the board adoption and implementation of this new interpretation of statutory authority denied excelsior due process of law and caused direct injury to excelsior and its students.excelsior further claimed this statutory interpretation violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution because it imposes a discriminatory and unreasonable burden on nursing schools as compared to schools.
excelsior filed its petition for writs of traditional and administrative mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief on december.on demurrer,the board asserted for the first time that its prior recognition of excelsior was beyond the board statutory authority.the court sustained,with leave to amend,the board demurrer to the petition for writs of mandate.the trial court overruled the demurrer to the causes of action for injunctive and declaratory relief.excelsior filed a first amended petition for writs of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief on april.the court sustained the board demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the case.
standard of review 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law.id.at,d.the court must affirm the judgment if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.ibid.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.ibid.
discussion 
ibusiness and professions code section 
excelsior claims the trial court erred in upholding the board assertion that section does not allow it to make prospective evaluations of nursing programs and that the board previous acceptance of the excelsior program was beyond its statutory authority.excelsior argues the section not only allows,but as a practical matter requires,the board to make prospective evaluations.excelsior further claims that if this new interpretation of section is accepted,then the section violates the commerce clause by favoring california nursing schools to the exclusion of schools.
prospective evaluation of programs 
section,subdivision a provides that an applicant must h ave successfully completed the courses of instruction prescribed by the board for licensure,in a program in this state accredited by the board for training registered nurses,or have successfully completed courses of instruction in a school of nursing outside of this state which,in the opinion of the board at the time the application is filed with the board of registered nursing,are equivalent to the minimum requirements of the board for licensure established for an accredited program in this state.
the arguments regarding the interpretation of this statute involve two questions whether the statute applies to applicants or to programs and whether the phrase at the time the application is filed prohibits prospective evaluations of programs.
the board claims the language of the statute is clear in its exclusive application to applicants for nursing licenses,and not to nursing programs.the board further claims the statute does not authorize prospective evaluations of nursing programs.excelsior disagrees with this narrow focus on the applicant and argues the board mandate to evaluate an applicant coursework consequently requires the board to evaluate the school.additionally,excelsior argues the language at the time the application is filed does not prohibit the board from making prospective evaluations,but as a practical matter requires such prospective evaluations.
we agree with the board that the statute focuses on the coursework completed by the applicant,not an evaluation of the program attended.the focus of the statute is on applicants for nursing licensure in california,not on approval of nursing programs.it is the applicant who seeks licensure and it is the applicant qualifications that the board evaluates.the board is charged with protecting the public from unqualified nurses.the nurse administering care,not the nursing program,poses the threat to the public.
the board interpretation that the statute prohibits prospective evaluations of programs,however,is unnecessarily narrow.the board is required to form an opinion at the time of application as to whether the coursework completed by an applicant at an program is equivalent to the minimum requirements for an accredited program.this does not prevent the board from prospectively evaluating a program curriculum and then relying upon that evaluation to form an opinion about the equivalency of the coursework completed by a particular applicant.nothing in the language of the statute prohibits this activity on the part of the board.a prospective evaluation,however,is a discretionary action the board may take for its own convenience and efficiency.because the board must,at the time the application is filed,determine whether the applicant coursework meets the minimum california requirements,a discretionary prospective evaluation of a program curriculum is not a seal of approval binding the board.
in other words,the board may choose to evaluate a program and compare its curriculum to the minimum requirements for california schools.the board may then decide to use this evaluation as an aid when later forming an opinion about the sufficiency of the coursework completed by an applicant who graduated from that program.this prospective evaluation,however,does not give rise to a board duty to the school to continue recognizing the program coursework as meeting the minimum california requirements.any such prospective evaluation is for the board convenience only.
excelsior expansive assertion that section requires the board to evaluate schools finds no support in the statutory language.excelsior claims that common sense dictates that the board can not determine whether the courses of instruction an applicant completed are equivalent to the requirements of california unless the board evaluates those courses and,consequently,the school offering them.italics in original.the argument erroneously treats as synonymous the terms courses of instruction and school.we agree that the board must evaluate the courses of instruction an applicant has completed,but this is far different from the board determination that a particular school nursing program satisfies minimum california requirements.a student may have completed coursework from more than one school,or a student may have completed coursework from both an school and an accredited school.the board job is to determine if the coursework the applicant has completed satisfies the minimum requirements for licensure.such an evaluation does not require the board to evaluate a particular school,but rather to evaluate the competency of the applicant.
although excelsior claims to challenge only the board interpretation of its authority under the statute,to prevail on appeal excelsior must establish a right to the board prospective evaluation and approval.while section does not prohibit the board from choosing to make prospective evaluations of schools programs for its own convenience,efficiency,and consistency,neither excelsior nor any other school has a right to require the board to make a prospective evaluation.
interpretation 
excelsior argues the trial court erred in ignoring the board interpretation of section.b ecause of the agency expertise,its view of a statute or regulation it enforces is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous or unauthorized.pacific legal foundation unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.this guideline,however,does not prevent the agency,itself,from correcting its own erroneous interpretation of a statute.
excelsior claims the board recognition of authority,pursuant to section,to conduct prospective evaluations supports excelsior argument that section does not prohibit prospective evaluations.while we agree the board may prospectively evaluate a school curriculum,this conclusion does not support a duty to make a prospective evaluation and does not give excelsior the right to require such evaluation.
furthermore,excelsior contention that the board can not change its interpretation of section is wrong.historical administrative practice,though entitled to great respect in statutory construction,is not controlling where the practice is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.state bd.of education honig th,d.in other words,historical practice may be wrong.id.at,d.an agency is not bound by its prior statutory interpretation if it determines that prior interpretation was in fact erroneous.
legislative history of section 
excelsior argues the trial court erred in sustaining the board demurrer without giving excelsior the opportunity to present the legislative history that supports its interpretation of section.w hen statutory language is clear and unambiguous,resort to the legislative history is unwarranted.citations.bonnell medical board cal th,d.we have concluded the language of section clearly does not support excelsior claim of a right to have its nursing program prospectively evaluated and permanently approved by the board.therefore,it is unnecessary to resort to the statute legislative history to determine its meaning.
commerce clause 
excelsior contends the board revised interpretation of section violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution by unreasonably burdening schools and benefiting schools.excelsior argues on appeal that the trial court erred by determining this cause at the demurrer stage and in finding that excelsior had no standing to bring this claim.we conclude excelsior dormant commerce clause claim lacks merit and,therefore,need not address the standing issue.
a ny state statute or regulation that impacts domestic interstate or foreign commerce is subject to judicial scrutiny under the commerce clause unless the statute or regulation has been preempted,or expressly authorized,by an act of congress.pacific merchant shipping voss cal th,d,pacific.the commerce clause implicit,restriction on the states power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is commonly referred to as the negative or dormant commerce clause.pacific,supra,at,d.
facial discrimination 
the first step in analyzing any law subject to judicial scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause is to determine whether it regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce,or discriminates against interstate commerce.pacific,supra,cal th at,d.if a restriction on commerce is discriminatory,it is virtually per se invalid.id.at,d,italics in original.by contrast,nondiscriminatory regulations that have only incidental effects on interstate commerce are valid unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,citing oregon waste systems of env.quality,d,oregon waste.the party challenging the statute validity bears the burden of showing discrimination.pacific,supra,at,d,citing hughes oklahoma,d.
in this context discrimination simply means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.pacific,supra,cal th at,d,citing oregon waste,supra,at.such discrimination may take any of three forms first,the state statute may facially discriminate against interstate or foreign commerce second,it may be facially neutral but have a discriminatory purpose third,it may be facially neutral but have a discriminatory effect.pacific,supra,cal th at,d,citing chemical waste management,hunt,d,fn.
based on allegations in paragraphs and of the petition and paragraph of the complaint,excelsior initially appears to allege facial discrimination the board differential treatment of and schools is facially discriminatory.however,it is not the board implementation of the statute that determines facial discrimination but rather the text of the statute.for example,in oregon waste cited by excelsior,the different rates for disposal of solid waste charged to per ton versus per ton waste constituted facial discrimination.oregon waste,supra,at.in this case,however,there is no facial discrimination.applicants from both and schools are subject to the same coursework requirements.see,subd.a.
excelsior has not alleged a specific discriminatory purpose sought by the statute.rather,excelsior allegations appear to fall within the third form of facially neutral statute that has a discriminatory effect.excelsior claims schools are denied the ability to determine whether their graduates will qualify for licensure in california,while schools have clear notice of whether their graduates will or will not qualify for licensure.consequently,the school would receive a huge competitive advantage in trying to attract nursing students who wish to eventually practice in california.while such statutory discrimination may be good for business interests,it is not constitutionally proper.
burden on interstate commerce versus local benefit 
the relevant question with this form of discrimination is whether the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,d.in pike,the challenged regulation required the packing of all cantaloupes in standard containers identifying them as arizona cantaloupes.an arizona grower of cantaloupes sent its highly perishable crops to the closest packing facility,located in blythe,california.id.at.at,d at.arizona issued an order prohibiting the company from transporting its uncrated cantaloupes outside the state for packing and processing.id.at.at,d at.because no arizona packing plant existed in close proximity,the only way the company could comply with this order was to build its own packing facility at a cost of approximately.id.at.at,d at.the court concluded this order affected interstate commerce because it required the grower to discontinue packing its cantaloupes outside arizona.id.at.at,d at.although the court found that the purpose of the statute,to promote and preserve the reputation of arizona growers by prohibiting deceptive packaging,was a legitimate state interest,the burden imposed on this company to buil
