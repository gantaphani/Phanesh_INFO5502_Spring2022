under certain circumstances,an educational agency may remove a disabled child from his school and place him in an alternative educational setting in response to disciplinary problems.k.if,as in this case,an educational agency intends to place a disabled student in an alternative educational setting for more than ten days because the child broke a rule applicable to all students,it must notify the child parents and timely conduct a manifestation determination review mdr.id.k a.an mdr the child parents,at least one of the child teachers,at least one special education teacher,a representative of the local educational agency and,if appropriate,the child whether the offending behavior was a manifestation of the child disability.see id.k c,d b.if the mdr team determines that the behavior was not a manifestation of the child disability,then the relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children without disabilities may be applied to the child in the same manner in which they would be applied to children without disabilities,except that the educational agency must continue to provide the child a fape.id.k a id.a.if a child parent disagrees with a determination that the child behavior was not a manifestation of the child disability or with any decision regarding placement,id.k a i,she may request an impartial due process hearing under the idea,id.f.see also id.b ensuring parents an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the educational placement of the child,or the provision of a fape to such child.any party aggrieved by an idea hearing officer decision may bring suit in district court.id.i a.
at the local level,municipal regulations provide for the discipline of dcps students.among the disciplinary actions they permit is class exclusion,which may entail placement in an alternative educational setting.dcmr see id.g.the regulations delineate level i infractions,which are punishable by class exclusion for ten days or fewer,and level ii infractions,which are punishable by class exclusion for no fewer than eleven days and no longer than two semesters.id.the regulations also detail procedures the dcps must follow when taking disciplinary action.under this framework,t he decision to effect a disciplinary action shall be made by the principal or the principal designee,although t he implementation of disciplinary action for a level ii infraction must be approved by,and may be modified by,the dcps superintendent or his designee.id.before a child is disciplined his parent must be notified and the child must be given a conference with the school official responsible for making or approving the disciplinary action.id.also,the child parent is entitled to request a disciplinary hearing.see id.at the disciplinary hearing,the hearing officer shall determine that all due process procedures have been followed or waived,id,and i t shall be the burden of the public schools to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the student did,in fact,commit the infraction s upon which the disciplinary action is based,id.upon conclusion of a disciplinary hearing,the hearing officer must issue a written determination including,inter alia,a determination regarding the appropriateness of the disciplinary action or an order for a modification thereof.id.d.the hearing officer determination with respect to disciplinary actions other than expulsion shall be binding unless changed following appeal to the dcps superintendent or superintendent designee.id.see also id.with respect to all disciplinary actions,the superintendent may overrule or modify any proposed disciplinary action including expulsion.

on march,the dcps determined that john student nearing graduation from the district janney elementary eligible for special education under the due to a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.on march,doe acted out in class and was disrespectful to a substitute teacher.idea hearing officer decision at,dcps office of compliance june,hod the substitute reported the incident to janney principal,charles abelmann.abelmman conferred with doe the next day and determined that his conduct had violated dcmr b,constituting a level i infraction.see dcmr b level i infractions include repeated failure to comply with the orders or directions of a teacher where failure to comply with the order constitutes a disruption.because doe had committed two other level i infractions during that school year,both involving fighting,abelmann classified this latest as a level ii infraction,pursuant to dcmr,and decided to remove doe from janney for days and place him in another facility,choice academy,as an alternative educational setting.the assistant superintendent approved the level ii classification.
an mdr convened on april,to determine whether doe infraction had been a manifestation of his disability.the mdr team included abelmann,doe regular teacher,a special education teacher,a social worker and a behavior specialist.doe mother was notified of the mdr but did not attend.the team concluded that doe infraction had not been a manifestation of his disability and agreed with abelmann decision to remove doe from janney.the team did not,however,document discussion of any specific alternative educational setting.
doe mother requested a hearing to challenge the manifestation determination and the class exclusion.instead of requesting an idea impartial due process hearing,however,she requested a disciplinary hearing pursuant to dcmr doe mother later made clear that the choice of hearing was a mistake,resulting from her unfamiliarity with the idea intricacies.the disciplinary hearing convened on april,and the hearing officer issued a determination on april.he upheld the mdr team conclusion that doe infraction was not a manifestation of his disability.but he reduced the duration of doe class exclusion from days to ten,concluding that the longer term was inappropriate given the infraction trivial nature.see id.d authorizing disciplinary hearing officer to modify inappropriate disciplinary action.
the dcps appealed the disciplinary hearing officer determination to the assistant superintendent,in his capacity as the superintendent designee,pursuant to dcmr.it argued the hearing officer erred in reducing a class exclusion for a level ii infraction to fewer than eleven days.the assistant superintendent agreed and,on april,changed doe class exclusion to days.
jane doe then filed suit in the district court to obtain a temporary restraining order preventing implementation of the class exclusion.doe pub.the district opposed doe on the ground that she had not exhausted her administrative remedies by request ing a due process hearing pursuant to the idea.def.opp to pl.mot.for tro at,doe pub,may.on may,the district court dismissed the case without prejudice after the parties agreed at a motions conference to pursue an idea hearing.see f.
the idea hearing took place on three days in may.the hearing officer heard testimony from nine witnesses,including a teacher,a psychologist,a social worker and abelmann.he issued his decision hod on june,pursuant to the idea.hod at.he framed the issue as w hether dcps denied doe a free and appropriate public education by imposing the day class exclusion.hod at.in his analysis,he first upheld the determination that doe infraction had not been a manifestation of his disability.he then reduced the length of doe class exclusion from days to eleven,holding that the latter duration was more appropriate because doe infraction consisted of nothing more than being a nuisance.hod at.next,he determined that,while choice academy may be able to provide doe with educational benefit,it was not appropriate and not warranted as an alternative academic setting for him.hod at.he based his conclusion in part on the fact that doe mdr team had not specifically approved of that facility.id.he also stated that it is not reasonable to place the student at choice for the remainder of the school year and his last year in elementary school at janney for the purpose of having him learn that there are consequences for sic his behavior.hod at.accordingly,he ordered that doe spend the remainder of the year at janney.he also ordered that,in the event doe had not already served the entire eleven days of class exclusion,janney was to offer alternatives such as those specified in dcmr.hod at.doe graduated from janney soon thereafter.
on july,the district requested reconsideration,which the idea hearing officer denied on july.the district then filed suit in the district court,see i a,alleging the idea hearing officer exceeded his authority by modifying the terms of doe class exclusion.doe countered that the hearing officer had acted within his authority and,in any event,the case was moot because he no longer attended a dcps school.the parties eventually filed cross motions for summary judgment and,on august,the court granted the district summary judgment.first the court held that the action should not be dismissed as moot because it was capable of repetition,yet evading review.district of columbia doe ex rel.doe,d,quoting jenkins squillacote.on the merits,the court interpreted the hod as finding that doe class exclusion did not violate the idea the court then concluded that the hearing officer exceeded his authority in modifying the assistant superintendent disciplinary decision notwithstanding the finding.doe moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied on new year eve.doe timely appealed.
having traveled a long,unusual road to this court,doe now argues that this action is moot,the district court erred in declining to dismiss the district complaint as untimely,the district court erred on the merits in holding that the idea hearing officer exceeded his authority and the district judge was biased against him.we address his arguments in turn.
under article iii of the united states constitution we may only adjudicate actual,ongoing controversies.honig,at see black police ass district of columbia,f d.accordingly,the mootness doctrine prohibits us from deciding a case if events have so transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the parties rights nor have a chance of affecting them in the future.clarke united states,en banc internal quotation omitted.that seems to be the case here both parties acknowledge that the dcps can no longer enforce additional discipline against doe as he is no longer a dcps student.there is a mootness exception,however,if an action is capable of repetition,yet evading review.jenkins,at.the exception applies where the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.id.at quoting murphy hunt,quotation omitted alteration in jenkins.
we had occasion to apply the exception in the idea context in jenkins,at.in that case,an idea hearing officer ruled that the dcps had given insufficient notice to a disabled child parents that it intended to change his placement in furtherance of his iep.id.at see supra note.as a remedy,the hearing officer ordered that the child spend the impending school year in a private school in accordance with the parents wishes but contrary to the dcps.id.at.the dcps superintendent filed suit in the district court challenging the hearing officer decision to change the child placement.id.the district court held the case was moot because,by the time it had ruled on the parents motion to dismiss,the school year had already ended.id.we reversed,holding that the challenged action was capable of repetition,yet evading review.id.at.applying the exception first prong,we held that there can be no doubt that a placement order under the idea is,by its nature,too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to its expiration.id.at quoting honig,at.regarding the second prong,we held that there is a reasonable expectation that the district will again be aggrieved by a similar application of the idea notice requirements.jenkins,at.we concluded that the issue was a recurring one as the case wa s not simply about where the child would attend school for the relevant school year,but rather about what sort of legal standard the district must meet in providing notice to his parents,and to other parents as well.id.at.and,while we noted a reasonable likelihood that the district would be confronted again with the same question regarding the same student,our decision turned on the reasonable expectation that the same complaining party the repeatedly confront the issue as to disabled children generally.see id.at emphasis added.
turning to this appeal,we start by asking whether the challenged class exclusion modified by an idea hearing review.the supreme court once somewhat euphemistically characterized administrative and judicial review of cases under this statute as ponderous.honig,at see also roland concord sch,cir p lacement disputes may take years to wind their way through the labyrinth.this is a case in point.doe class exclusion was nearly six years ago.it has been several years since he attended a dcps school.he has long been immune from any discipline the district might impose were it to successfully litigate a challenge to the idea hearing officer decision.and there is no reason to think that doe status is anomalous.as the supreme court noted in honig,the adolescent student improperly disciplined will often be finished with school or otherwise ineligible for eha protections by the time review can be had of the improper disciplinary decision.at.we conclude,therefore,that this action evades review.as for the second prong,here,as in jenkins,the legal idea hearing officer authority to revise discipline upon finding that an infraction is not a manifestation of a almost certain to be a recurring one.jenkins,at.we can reasonably expect that the district will again be aggrieved by similar application of the idea.id.in other words,this case is capable of repetition.the exception therefore applies.see devries by deblaay spillane,ci
