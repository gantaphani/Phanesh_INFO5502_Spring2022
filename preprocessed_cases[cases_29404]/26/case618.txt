this appeal considers the meaning of the phrase salary reduction agreement.the university of chicago did not pay,report,or withhold federal insurance contributions act fica tax between and for payments made under its employee retirement plans.the internal revenue service irs assessed fica tax plus penalties and interest on contributions made under the university retirement plans.in this case,fica tax liability turns upon whether the payments made under the plans were pursuant to salary reduction agreements.the university is currently appealing from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government.we affirm.
background 
the university of chicago,one of the world foremost universities,is an illinois corporation.as is relevant to this appeal,the university maintains two retirement plans for its employees,the contributory retirement plan crp and the retirement income plan for employees erip.crp applies to academic and highly compensated employees,and erip applies to nonacademic and employees.participation in the applicable plan is mandatory for all eligible employees as a condition of employment the plans require employees to contribute specified percentages of their salaries the university,in turn,contributes additional amounts,specified as percentages of the employees salaries.for example,under crp during the tax years,an employee was required to contribute of her salary,and the university was required to contribute an amount equal to of the employee salary.the contributions by the employee and employer are used to fund the purchase of annuity contracts on behalf of the employee.erip functions similarly.
fica is a payroll tax that funds social security and medicare programs.an employee and employer are both taxed of the employee wages for social security up to a specified limit and of the employee wages for medicare.an employer is required to deduct and withhold the employee share of fica taxes from the employee wages,remit the withheld taxes to the irs every quarter,and report the amount of withheld taxes on a quarterly tax return.diamond plating united states,cir citing.the employer is liable for the tax that it is required to deduct and withhold from the employee.employers are subject to penalties for failure to deposit taxes unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.id.a.
the employer and employee tax liability for fica turns upon the definition of wages in the internal revenue code the term is broadly defined but followed by specific exceptions.of chi.hosp.united states,wl,at cir.wages includes all remuneration for employment,but certain kinds of payments are excepted.a.the exception at issue here includes any payment made to,or on behalf of,an employee or his beneficiary under or to an annuity contract described in section b,other than a payment for the purchase of such contract which is made by reason of a salary reduction agreement whether evidenced by a written instrument or otherwise.id.a d.
on may,the irs assessed the university with additional fica taxes,as well as failure to deposit penalties and interest for each quarter during the tax years,based upon the university failure to report,withhold,or pay fica taxes on the payments made under crp and erip.the university paid divisible portions of the assessed amounts the irs later assessed additional penalties based on the university failure to pay the full amounts originally assessed,and the university also paid divisible portions of those additional penalties and interest.the university claimed refunds from the irs,which the irs denied.the university then filed suit in the northern district of illinois challenging the refund denials the government counterclaimed for the unpaid portions of the assessed amounts.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court considered and rejected the university argument that the language made by reason of a salary reduction agreement is ambiguous.of chi.united states,wl,at.the court concluded that both plans fell squarely within the definition of wages and if congress had intended the subsection to apply only to individually negotiated salary reduction agreements,as the university suggested,congress would have added those words.id.in support for its decision,the court cited public employees retirement board shalala,cir,which concluded that the term salary reduction agreement as used in another subsection of the internal revenue code included mandatory plans.the court also acknowledged but rejected the university argument that a revenue ruling from and a treasury regulation in effect prior to supported its interpretation.of,wl,at.the court declined to address the university analysis of legislative history,finding that it would be improper where the subsection was unambiguous.id.finally,the court determined that the university should be liable for a penalty because the obligation to withhold was precise and not university failure to deposit was at best willful blindness to the plain meaning of the governing statute.id.at.similarly,the court found that the university should be liable for a penalty,despite the university argument that the penalty was inconsistent with the divisible tax doctrine i t is one thing to say that a taxpayer need not pay the total tax in order to gain entry to the courthouse,and quite another to say that the taxpayer may escape the penalty for failure to timely pay the tax by filing a lawsuit.id.
ii.salary reduction agreement 
the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment based purely upon a decision of law,which we review de novo.officer chase ins.life annuity,cir.the meaning of salary reduction agreement is a matter of statutory interpretation,and we begin by considering the language of the statute.united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,cir.we also consider the context of the provision because the certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d quoting fda brown williamson tobacco,d internal quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,the university of chicago argues that congress intended the salary reduction agreement language of a d to include a salary reduction agreement in the fica wage base only if the agreement reflected an employee voluntary choice to receive a lower stated salary plus payments to purchase annuity contracts in lieu of receiving cash.in addition to discussing the plain language,the university directs our attention to revenue rulings,regulations,and the statute legislative history to demonstrate congressional intent.the government argues that the proper distinction drawn in a d is between payments that are salary reductions as compared to payments that are salary supplements.as might be expected,the government provides alternative explanations for the revenue rulings,regulations,and legislative history relied upon by the university.
the language of a d sets up an definition of wages.wages includes all remuneration for employment,except payments made to,or on behalf of,an employee or his beneficiary under or to an annuity contract described in section b.it excludes those payments for the purchase of such contracts which are made by reason of salary reduction agreements.the university contends that the plain language supports its interpretation that the agreement must be individually negotiated through an employee voluntary election to receive a lower stated salary plus payments to purchase annuity contracts.the use of the term agreement requires a choice,it argues.the university employees were not given a choice because participation in crp and erip was mandatory therefore,the payments were not made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement or subject to fica tax.
in public employees retirement board,the tenth circuit considered the meaning of salary reduction agreement in a different subsection of,which dealt with payments that were treated as employee contributions but had been picked up by the local or state government employers.the pickups were mandatory through a state statute.the retirement board made a similar argument as the university makes a salary reduction agreement had to be individually negotiated and voluntary.the tenth circuit held that salary reduction agreement in the context of government pickups included mandatory reasons we will discuss in more detail it rejected the retirement board contention that an agreement had to be individually negotiated.public employees retirement board,at.the court cited the second restatement of contracts and determined that 
a n agreement is not limited to individually negotiated contracts but may also refer generally to a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons here,an employee decision to go to work or continue to work as a state employee constitutes conduct manifesting assent to a salary reduction in exchange for the state contribution to a pension plan on the employee behalf.the employee has agreed to the salary reduction by continuing employment with the state.
id.at internal citations omitted.we agree with our sister circuit that congress use of the word agreement in this provision does not foreclose mutual assent through something other than individual negotiation or voluntary election 
standing alone,a d is more susceptible to the government interpretation that the provision distinguishes between a salary supplement,any payment made to,or on behalf of,an employee or his beneficiary under or to an annuity contract described in section b,and a salary reduction,a payment for the purchase of such contract which is made by reason of a salary reduction agreement.the university argument that the provision refers to voluntary elections does not rest solely upon the language of itself,though.and so we wade into the murky waters of context in the tax code to look for evidence of the meaning asserted by the university.
the current version of a was enacted in.versions of that section date back to the term wages means all remuneration for employment except that such term shall not include t he amount of any payment made to,or on behalf of,an employee under a plan or system established by an employer including any amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities,or into a fund,to provide for any such payment,on account of retirement.social security act amendments of,ch,stat,this excluded funds from taxation under fica,so as to eliminate any reluctance on the part of the employer to establish such plans due to the additional tax cost.new england baptist hosp.united states,cir citing,reprinted in.
in,the irs issued a revenue ruling responding to advice sought by an employer as to whether amounts used to purchase an annuity contract for an employee under an agreement that reduced the employee salary constituted employer contributions not subject to fica or employee contributions subject to fica.rul.the ruling held that the amounts should be considered employee contributions and subject to fica.id.
in,the supreme court decided rowan companies,united states,d,which considered whether the value of meals and lodging for employees on offshore oil rigs provided for the employer convenience should be included in the computation of wages for purposes of fica and federal unemployment tax act futa tax.the court looked to comparable sections in the income tax provisions,as well as treasury regulations and legislative history to determine congressional intent.the court concluded that the plain language and legislative history indicated that congress intended wages to be treated in the same manner for purposes of income taxation and taxation.id.at.the meals and lodging amounts were excluded from income tax withholding therefore,the amounts should also be excluded from fica and futa.id.
after rowan,there was some doubt about the continuing validity of the salary reduction agreement revenue ruling because amounts paid to purchase annuity contracts under a salary reduction agreement were included in the fica wage base but were not subject to income tax withholding,cong.at.subsequently,congress codified the revenue ruling in.temple united states,cir.it also added a decoupling provision to make explicit that n othing in the regulations prescribed for purposes of chapter relating to income tax withholding which provides an exclusion from wages as used in such chapter shall be construed to require a similar exclusion from wages in the regulations prescribed for purposes of this chapter.a.as previously noted,congress expressed a purpose in to eliminate employers reluctance to establish such plans due to the additional tax cost courts have noted that by,the focus had shifted somewhat in,congress was looking to solidify the social security system in the face of serious concerns about its solvency new england baptist,at.the current version of a d was created at this time.
the university argues that the revenue ruling supports its current position.we acknowledge that the plan at issue in the ruling was a voluntary salary reduction agreement,but we disagree with the university as to the import of that fact.the issue in the ruling was whether a reduction in an employee salary where the funds were used to purchase annuity contracts for retirement was subject to fica taxation,even though it was not subject to income tax withholding.rul.in the ruling,the irs noted that the purposes of b and are substantially different.therefore,a determination under section b of the code that a particular amount is contributed by the employer for the purchase of an annuity contract does not necessarily require a similar determination that it is also an amount paid by an employer under section a.id.the ruling concluded that the funds were considered and subject to fica tax,even though they were treated as for purposes of income taxation.id.the final paragraph distinguished the ruling from a previous revenue ruling,which held that an organization that uses its own funds for the purchase of an annuity contract is not subject to fica tax on the amounts of those funds.id.the irs explained that the ruling covered a different situation where the employee takes a voluntary reduction in salary to provide the necessary funds.id.while the underlying plan in the ruling was a voluntary agreement,this was not a point of emphasis in the fact,the word voluntary appeared only once.to the extent that the employee degree of control may have affected the irs distinction between and funds,the ruling simply did not address it mandatory salary reductions were certainly not expressly or implicitly excluded from fica taxation the government also notes that the distinction drawn by the ruling and by is consistent with the original purpose of the fica exclusion to eliminate any additional tax cost on the employer.if the employer did not contribute a amount to a b plan,then the amount would be used instead to pay the employee salary.both options would result in the same fica taxation for the employer.a salary supplement,on the other hand,would result in an additional tax cost for the employer,so it is specially excepted from the definition of wages.
the university also directs our attention to former treasury regulation a d,in effect from to.the regulation set out the fica exclusion for payments made by an employer to or on behalf of an employee on account of retirement,sickness,disability,or death.it elaborated on several points,one of which stated it is immaterial for purposes of this exclusion whether the amount or possibility of such benefit payments is taken into consideration in fixing the amount of an employee remuneration or whether such payments are required,expressly or impliedly,by the contract of service.the government explains that the payments required by the contract of service are,salary supplements,and the provision is merely detailing the is still in effect employers do not pay fica taxes on contributions to annuity plans for their employees.we agree.the reference to fixing the amount of an employee remuneration is not equivalent to a salary reduction agreement because the funds contributed are the employer funds.to a certain extent,of course,all benefits offered to an employee have the indirect effect of reducing the employee salary.but the point of a salary reduction agreement is that the funds are considered,which is the principle that was later explained in the revenue ruling.
we also consider the cited by the university in determining the meaning of a d.the internal revenue code currently uses the term salary reduction agreement in only six sections income taxation of dependent care assistance programs,income taxation of employees trusts,income taxation of employee annuities,special income taxation rules,fica definitions,and futa definitions.none of the sections provides a definition of salary reduction agreement,although two sections refer to a salary reduction agreement within the meaning of section a d.g c n c iii iii.the university points to the former,g c,as evidence supporting the meaning it asserts.
section g provides a limitation on the exclusion from income taxation for elective deferrals.section g defines elective deferrals for purposes of that subsection as the sum of certain employer contributions under other sections of the code and,under subsection c,any employer contribution to purchase an annuity contract under section b under a salary reduction agreement within the meaning of section a d.the university asserts that this language demonstrates that congress equated salary reduction agreements with elective deferrals.but g c borrows the meaning of salary reduction agreement from a d does not conversely inject its context into.the university also contends that the other types of employer contributions listed in g are payments that involve a option,which demonstrates that a salary reduction agreement should also be interpreted as it suggests a voluntary reduction in salary for purchase of retirement annuities taken in lieu of cash.however,the university ignores g additional limitation an employer contribution shall not be treated as an elective deferral described in subparagraph c if under the salary reduction agreement such contribution is made pursuant to a irrevocable election made by the employee at the time of initial eligibility to participate in the agreement or is made pursuant to a similar arrangement involving a irrevocable election specified in regulations.because all salary reduction agreements are not elective deferrals even within g itself,there is no reason to read as encompassing only elective deferrals.moreover,the university invocation of the nondiscrimination rules in b fails to persuade us for the same reason as g the provision uses the term salary reduction agreement but further limits and defines it within the same subsection in the same manner that g did.
as promised,we now return to public employees retirement board to consider how the term salary reduction agreement was used in v b.at issue in the case was the fica tax liability of contributions by employees to state and local government pension plans that had been picked up by the government employers,as mandated by state statute.section v b states nothing in any paragraph of subsection a shall exclude from the term wages any amount treated as an employer contribution under section h where the pickup referred to in such section is pursuant to a salary reduction agreement whether evidenced by a written instrument or otherwise.to determine whether salary reduction agreement included mandatory payments,the court analyzed the corresponding h,and revenue rulings interpreting that section,to ascertain under what circumstances pickups occurred.public employees retirement board,at.the court concluded that pickups require the employer to specify that the contributions,although designated as employee contributions,are being paid by the employer in lieu of employee contributions and the employee can not have the option of receiving the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the pension plan.id.at.because the second requirement foreclosed voluntary agreements as pickups,the term salary reduction agreement in v b could not coherently exclude mandatory agreements because the provision would never be implicated.id.at.therefore,the court held that the salary reduction agreement provision included mandatory government pickups as wages for fica purposes.id.
the university does not point to a flaw in the reasoning of public employees retirement board instead,it argues that,like the tenth circuit,we should consider the corresponding section referenced in the subsection at b to determine the proper context for salary reduction agreement.if we assumed that the meaning of salary reduction agreement as used throughout the code generally encompasses both voluntary and mandatory agreements,then we agree with the university premise that we could reach the opposite conclusion of public employees retirement board without necessarily creating a circuit tenth circuit found that h implicates only mandatory agreements,so we could find that b implicates only voluntary agreements.we do not find,however,that b requires us to read that limitation into a d.without support for that limitation,the sensible approach,which is consistent with basic rules of statutory construction,would be for us to conclude that a d,like v b,includes mandatory salary reduction agreements.see arnett comm r of internal revenue,cir citing comm r of internal revenue lundy,d applying the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning internal quotation marks omitted in re willett,cir courts are obliged to read statutory provisions at issue in such a way as to avoid a conflict between them if such a construction is possible and reasonable.square d subsidiaries comm r of internal revenue,cir citing alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d noting the cardinal principle of statutory construction that,if possible,a statute should not be construed to render another clause,sentence,or word superfluous,void,or insignificant.
finally,the university argues that the government position unnecessarily elevates form over substance whereas,the university interpretation offers a functional,substantive approach.the university explains that the government interpretation emphasizes the form of the the university characterize the payments as a higher stated salary minus a mandatory annuity contribution or a lower stated salary plus a larger annuity contribution that form,it argues,is of no economic significance.if the employer mandates a contribution of from an employee salary and contributes an additional amount equal to of the employee salary,the money used for both contributions comes directly from the same source the university.it makes no difference how that money is characterized.in the context of income taxation,we have previously recognized this argument,noting that the distinction between funds and funds is almost wholly nominal.howell united states,cir.it is a matter of indifference to an employer whether it pays salary to the employee plus to a pension plan on the employee behalf,or instead to the employee,of which it sends to a pension plan.in either event the employee receives at once and in deferred compensation,and the employer may deduct the whole as an ordinary and necessary business expense.id.therefore,the university urges us to adopt its functional distinction between mandatory and voluntary salary reduction agreements an employee has wages if she could choose to receive an amount in cash but instead directs it to an annuity,and she does not have wages if the employer makes a mandatory annuity payment with no cash option.
the distinction between funds and funds might be nominal from the employer perspective,but the difference nevertheless could be significant to the employee.the government responds to the university argument by pointing out one purported economic distinction funds count for purposes of social security benefits and funds do not therefore,a salary reduction would result in higher social security benefits.the error in this argument is apparen
