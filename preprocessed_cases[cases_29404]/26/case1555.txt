although amendments to education code section have been in effect for close to years,no appellate court has interpreted them.this case requires us to do so.lori summerfield successfully petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate directing the windsor unified school district and its governing board collectively,the district to employ her as a permanent certificated teacher and compensate her for accrued benefits and back pay.relying on section,the district argued the two years summerfield spent teaching under emergency permits could not be counted toward the time necessary for her to attain permanent status,and thus the district had full discretion to terminate her employment when it did.
considering the relevant statutory language and legislative history,we agree with the district interpretation and reverse the order issuing a writ of mandate.under section,time spent teaching under an emergency teaching credential may not be counted in computing an employee progress toward permanent status unless the employee is credentialed in another state and demonstrates adequate basic skills proficiency pending successful completion of the california basic educational skills test cbest 
background 
the district hired summerfield as a substitute teacher in september.because summerfield did not have a teaching credential,the district helped her obtain an emergency substitute teaching permit from the commission on teacher credentialing,which authorized her to teach as a substitute for up to days.in october,the district changed summerfield from a substitute to a temporary teacher and assigned her to replace a teacher gone on a leave of absence.summerfield taught in this assignment for the remainder of the school year under an emergency long term multiple subject teaching permit.the district initially rehired summerfield as a temporary teacher for the following school year but in october changed her classification from temporary to probationary.another emergency long term multiple subject teaching permit authorized summerfield to continue teaching in the district throughout the school year.
on march,near the end of her second year teaching in the district,the director of summerfield school informed her that she had successfully completed her probationary period and would be reclassified as a tenured teacher in the upcoming school year.however,a month later,the district advised summerfield that it believed her service under emergency teaching credentials did not count in her progress toward permanent employment status.thus,the district concluded,summerfield could not be considered a probationary teacher until she obtained a credential.she did so in july,when the commission on teacher credentialing issued her a preliminary multiple subject teaching credential valid until august.
the district rehired summerfield for the school year,classifying her as a probationary employee.however,on march,the district notified summerfield that her employment would be terminated in june and she would not be reemployed for the school year.summerfield moved to florida in july and has not taught school in california since that date.
discussion 
in any california school district with an average daily attendance of or more,a teacher who completes two consecutive school years as a probationary employee and is reelected for a third year becomes a permanent employee of the district at the beginning of the third year,subd.b.school districts have complete discretion regarding the reelection of probationary employees.they may choose not to reelect a probationary teacher without any showing of cause or statement of reasons,so long as they notify the teacher no later than march of the teacher second year of the decision not to reelect.board of education round valley teachers cal th,d,subd.b.any employee not given notice of by march shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year,subd.b.
summerfield taught for a total of three consecutive years in the district.since she received no notice of a decision during her second year of employment,the school year,summerfield claims she became a permanent employee of the district by operation of law at the commencement of the third year.as a permanent employee,she could not be summarily terminated by the district notice of march.however,the district responds that the time summerfield worked under emergency teaching credentials does not count toward fulfilling her mandatory probationary term.see fleice chualar union elementary school dist.d.probationary period is mandated by education code and beyond district power to shorten.the district bases this conclusion on section,which states 
service by a person under a provisional credential shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of,or eligibility to,classification as a permanent employee of a school district.
this section shall not be applicable to teachers granted a emergency credential under the conditions specified in subdivision b of section and subdivision h of section.
provisional credentials include emergency teaching permits 
focusing on the first paragraph,summerfield claims section does not apply because she worked for the district under emergency permits,which she asserts are not the same thing as provisional credentials.
the history of california teacher credentialing statutes and regulations was discussed in some detail in california teachers commission on teacher credentialing th,d.under former section of the education code of,the commission on teacher credentialing had the power to issue provisional credentials in accordance with certain regulations.id.at,d,citing stats,ch.in,the legislature replaced section with section,which authorized the issuance of emergency credentials and stated with the exception of this chapter,any reference in any law or regulation to a provisional credential shall be deemed to mean an emergency credential.stats,ch,former.in,section became section.stats,ch,operative.section continued to use the nomenclature of emergency credentials and repeated the statement from former section deeming provisional credentials equivalent to emergency credentials.
in,the legislature repealed section and replaced it with section.california teachers commission on teacher credentialing,supra,th at,d stats,ch.section authorizes the commission on teacher credentialing to issue and renew emergency teaching or specialist permits under specified conditions,subd.a.summerfield reads much into the fact that section did not retain the final sentence from former section,which had deemed the phrase provisional credentials equivalent to emergency credentials.according to summerfield,the legislature failure to include this sentence in section must be construed as a conscious decision to abandon the definition.reasoning that section reflects a legislative intent for emergency credentials to be viewed as something different from provisional credentials,summerfield concludes the legislature failure to amend section means that the legislature intended section to apply only to those teachers who obtained provisional credentials under former provisions of the code.
we are not persuaded by this argument,which infers too much from the absence of a single sentence with no supporting legislative history.in keeping with the change in nomenclature from emergency credentials in former section to emergency permits in section,it would not have made sense for section to repeat verbatim the sentence in section dealing with emergency credentials.moreover,when it enacted section in,the legislature may well have believed clarification of the phrase provisional credentials was no longer necessary.provisional credentials,as such,have not been issued since.
summerfield argument also leads to an implausible interpretation of section.section first states that time worked under provisional teaching credentials does not count toward tenure and then makes an exception for time worked under emergency credentials issued pursuant to specific statutes.if the provisional credentials referred to in the first paragraph of section mean something different from em
