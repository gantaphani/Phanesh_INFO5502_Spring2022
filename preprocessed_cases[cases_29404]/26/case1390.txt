racial integration of america public schools began with brown board of education,when the united states supreme court ruled that segregation in education that intentionally discriminated against african americans on the basis of their race was unconstitutional.half a century after brown some educators have gone beyond removing segregation,and have implemented affirmative policies fostering social diversity in their schools.the question confronting courts today is whether these new policies go too far and themselves improperly discriminate on the basis of race.
we conclude that the particular policy challenged aims to achieve social diversity by using neighborhood demographics when assigning students to not discriminatory.the challenged policy does not use racial classifications in fact,it does not consider an individual student race at all when assigning the student to a school.instead,the assignment policy looks at the student residential neighborhood,and considers the average household income in the neighborhood,the average education level of adults residing in the neighborhood,and the racial composition of the neighborhood as a whole.every student within a given neighborhood receives the same treatment,regardless of his or her individual race.we find that educators who include a general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods in student assignments,without classifying a student by his or her race,do not discriminate against,nor grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race.cal,subd.a.
in,california voters adopted proposition,which amended the state constitution to provide that state and local government entities including school districts shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.cal,subds.a,f section.
plaintiff american civil rights foundation acrf is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to monitoring and enforcing the civil rights laws,with at least one member living in berkeley,california.in october,acrf sued the berkeley unified school district,its superintendent,and the berkeley board of education collectively school district for alleged constitutional violations in assigning students among the school district elementary schools,and in assigning students to academic programs within the school district only high school acrf alleged that the school district used race to discriminate against,and to grant preferences to,students when making student assignments,in violation of section 
a.the elementary student assignment plan 
the school district has a long history of trying to eliminate school segregation created by the residential segregation within the city of berkeley.from september forward,a s a result of the changing legislation in california,the school district explored assertedly race neutral factors to create school diversity.in,the school district adopted the elementary student assignment plan plan at issue here.the plan determines which of the school district elementary schools kindergarten through fifth grade a child will attend.
the avowed purpose of the plan is to promote the values of socioeconomic and racial diversity,and is founded upon a belief that diversity in our student population enriches the education experiences of students advances educational and occupational aspirations enhances critical thinking skills facilitates the equitable distribution of resources reduces,prevents or eliminates the effects of racial and social isolation encourages positive relationships across racial and economic lines by breaking the cycle of racial hostility to foster a community of tolerance and appreciation of students from varied and diverse backgrounds and promotes participation in a pluralistic society.when supporting adoption of the plan,the school district superintendent stated that a multifactor approach would enrich the educational experience of all students by expanding diversity beyond racial and ethnic considerations to include socioeconomic factors.
student assignments under the plan proceed through several layers parental choice priority categories and diversity categories the last of which is at issue on appeal.parents complete a parent preference form is which parents rank in order of preference three of the elementary schools they wish their child to attend.the school district attempts to assign students based on their parents preferences but assignment is made within the constraints of six priority categories.the priority rankings are students currently attending the school who live within that school geographic attendance zone students currently attending the school who live outside the zone siblings of students currently attending the school school district residents not attending the school who live within the zone school district residents not attending the school who live outside the zone and nonresidents wanting an interdistrict transfer.
within a given priority category,the school district uses diversity categories to make assignments with the goal that the student body at each elementary school reflects the racial and socioeconomic diversity of the total elementary school population in the attendance zone the school district calculates a student diversity category by dividing the district into planning areas,which are geographic divisions typically between four and eight city blocks.each planning area receives a diversity category of one,two,or three that measures that area composite diversity,which is based on three factors the average household income of those living in the planning area the average education level attained by adults living in the planning area and the percentage of students of color living in the planning area information on household income and education level is obtained from census data,and the percentage of students of color is derived from a pool of student data collected by the school district.planning areas containing a relatively high concentration of students of color from,lower educated households are generally category one planning areas.planning areas containing a relatively high concentration of white students from,higher educated households are generally category three planning areas.planning areas whose demographics are less concentrated in terms of race,household income,and education level are generally category two planning areas.every student within a given planning area receives the same diversity score,regardless of his or her individual race.the plan states t he actual personal attributes of students is not relied upon in determining student assignments.instead,diversity characteristics derived from the planning area in which the student lives are used to calculate a diversity category,and students from each category are assigned proportionately to individual schools to approximate the racial and socioeconomic diversity of the geographic attendance zone as a whole.
as an example of how the plan operates,we use the scenario proposed by plaintiff acrf in its briefing on appeal.assume an elementary school has a concentration of fourth graders living in category one planning areas that is substantially higher than the concentration of category one students within the entire district.that school then receives applications to enroll from two fourth graders who have just moved into the school attendance zone.one of the students lives in a category one planning area and the other student lives in a category three planning area.the school district will give the student living in a category three planning area a higher priority for enrollment over the student living in a category one planning area.that student will receive priority regardless of whether his or her own personal attributes household income and education levels,and race match the general attributes of the planning area in which the student lives.
b.the high school student assignment plan 
the school district has one high school comprising grades to berkeley high school.students have the option of choosing from six academic programs with differing curricula.the academic programs include four small schools the arts and humanities academy community partnership academy communication arts and sciences and school of social justice and the environment.the programs also include two smaller learning communities within the comprehensive high school academic choice and berkeley international high school.the system used to assign students to the various programs at berkeley high school is modeled on the elementary school assignment plan and its diversity categories.
all students rank their preferences for each of the six programs and are assigned a diversity category based on the same factors used to determine an elementary school child diversity category the average household income of those living in the student residential planning area the average education level attained by adults living in the planning area and the percentage of students of color living in the planning area.the school district determines the number of students that may enroll in each academic program based on a proportional representation of students within diversity categories that match within a set range the diversity of berkeley high school as a whole.a computer then randomly selects students and assigns them to their highest ranked program choice where openings are still available 
for example,the approximate number of all berkeley high school students in category three is percent.assuming a grade level within a particular academic program has a total enrollment capacity of students,the program would aim to enroll students from category three.once that target number is reached,the program is no longer open to students from diversity category three wishing to enroll,but may remain open to students from other diversity categories.
like the elementary student assignment plan,assignments to berkeley high school academic programs do not consider the race of the individual student.every student in a particular neighborhood,or planning area,receives the same diversity rating regardless of the student race.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiff acrf filed its complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief on october,challenging the constitutionality of the school district student assignment policies.cal.the school district demurred to the complaint on january.on that same date,six parents of school district children sought to intervene in the action to join with the school district in defending the student assignment policies the trial court granted the motion to intervene,and the interveners joined in the school district demurrer.
acrf filed its opposition to the demurrer on january,and the school district served its reply on january.the demurrer was heard on january,and,on april,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the causes of action relevant to this appeal.the demurrer was overruled as to a separate cause of action concerning a challenge to the school district admission policy to a tutoring program.as noted earlier,the parties stipulated to dismissal of that cause of action and it is not an issue in this appeal.the order of dismissal on that distinct cause of action was filed on january.judgment for defendants was filed on february.
plaintiff acrf filed a notice of appeal on march.plaintiff and defendants school district and intervener parents filed briefs on appeal.amicus curiae briefs in support of defendants were also filed by the california teachers association and former directors of the board of education for the school district.
iii.discussion 
does a school board use of neighborhood demographic data in assigning students to schools or academic programs violate section of the california constitution when the data includes information about the racial composition of neighborhoods in answering that question,we must be conscious of several matters.
principles requiring judicial restraint 
first,the legislature has granted school boards wide authority to set policies for the communities they serve.the legislature has declared that school boards and districts have diverse needs unique to their individual communities and programs,and in addressing their needs,common as well as unique,school districts should have the flexibility to create their own unique solutions.the authority of school boards extends to setting student assignment policies.decades ago,it was observed that california public school boards have pervasive control over and continuing responsibility for both the daily decisions and the long range plans which determine the racial and ethnic attendance pattern of its district schools,including plenary authority to determine school assignment policies and to establish and reestablish geographic attendance zones.crawford board of education cal d.a school board also has authority to adopt a school integration plan.cal,art.i,subd.a.of course,a school board authority is not unlimited a school board may not initiate policies or programs in conflict with the law.but our role as judges is also limited we determine the legality of the school board policy,not its wisdom.
second,acrf is claiming that the school district student assignment policy is unconstitutional on its face,not as applied in a particular case,and thus must meet a heavy burden of proof.a facial challenge is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the law would be valid.citation.the moving party must show that the challenged statutes or regulations inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable prohibitions.san diego unified school dist.th,d,italics omitted.our task,therefore,is to determine whether the challenged policy can constitutionally be applied in any set of circumstances.arcadia unified school dist.state of education cal th,d.
third,our aim when interpreting a constitutional amendment adopted by voter initiative is to determine and effectuate the voters intent.silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th,d.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning governs.ibid.when the language is ambiguous,we refer to other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.citation.citation.however,a court can not insert or omit words to cause the meaning of a statute to conform to a presumed intent that is not expressed.citations.as a judicial body,it is our role to interpret the laws as they are written.citation.w e may not properly interpret the measure in a way that the electorate did not contemplate the voters should get what they enacted,not more and not less.citizens to save california california fair political practices com.th,d.
section plain meaning 
with these principles in mind,we turn to plaintiff acrf contention that section prohibits the school district from using a student residential neighborhood include consideration of the neighborhood racial assign students to schools and academic programs.section provides,in relevant part the state shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.
interpreting the provision in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of its words,our supreme court has held that d iscriminate means to make distinctions in treatment show partiality in favor of or prejudice against.wire works,city of san jose cal th,d,italics omitted.wire works.the word preferential means giving preference,which is a giving of priority or advantage to one person over others.id.at,d.
we conclude that the challenged student assignment policy does not violate section because the policy does not show partiality,prejudice,or preference to any student on the basis of that student race.all students in a given residential area are treated of the student individual race or other personal characteristics.the challenged policy is explicit on this point t he actual perso
