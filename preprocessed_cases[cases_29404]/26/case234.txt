opinion of the court 
refugees facing language barriers asked the district court for a preliminary injunction compelling the school district of lancaster to allow them to transfer from phoenix academy,an accelerated high school,to mccaskey high school international school,a program designed principally to teach language skills to english language learners,or ells.the district court granted that request,finding likely violations of pennsylvania law and a provision of a federal statute we never addressed the equal educational opportunities act of eeoa,f.the school district appeals,asking us to vacate that order.we will affirm based on the eeoa violations but not on the state law violations.
the named plaintiffs,now the appellees,are immigrants,ages to.they fled war,violence,and persecution in their native countries to come to the united states,arriving here since.international refugee agencies resettled them in lancaster,pennsylvania.none are native english speakers.as students,all fall within a subgroup of ells called slife students with limited or interrupted formal education.slife are english language learners who are two or more years behind their appropriate grade level,possess limited or no literacy in any language,have limited or interrupted formal educational backgrounds,and have endured stressful experiences causing acculturation challenges.the named plaintiffs embody these traits.

the international school and phoenix academy 
the school district of lancaster,the appellant in this case,administers numerous schools.two are relevant here mccaskey high school,which the school district operates directly,and phoenix academy,operated by camelot schools of pennsylvania,llc,a private,company under contract with the school district.
mccaskey high school consists of two smaller schools.one is mccaskey,a traditional public high school.the other is mccaskey east,known as the international school.the international school is a program designed primarily to teach language skills to students who speak little,if any,english those students generally attend the international school for one year,after which they join mccaskey general population.during that year,they receive intensive esl english as a second language support through two esl courses per day.for content classes science,math,social studies,and other enrichment subjects ells at the international school receive esl teaching through a method called sheltered instruction.under that method,ells,including slife,are grouped together in content courses with other ells at comparable levels.ells are hence sheltered in those classes from other ells at higher proficiency levels and from native english speakers.to foster proficiency,the international school also introduces ells to new american cultural values and beliefs while respecting their cultural diversity and embraces close communication with families and access to appropriate translation services.id.
phoenix academy is,as the district court said,a little different.issa sch.dist.of lancaster,wl,at.it an alternative education program intended to serve students for their grade,and in danger of not graduating high school before they age out of eligibility at.phoenix principal missions are to ensure that students accumulate enough credits to graduate and to change students negative behaviors not to further their academic proficiencies.a significant portion of grading is therefore based on students behavior and attendance,known as seat time.in step with its mission to change students behaviors,phoenix enforces stringent security measures not in effect at mccaskey,including daily searches.phoenix bars its students from bringing in or out any personal belongings,like backpacks,food,books,and even homework.and a strict dress code is in place.based on a hierarchical system,students are rewarded with different colored shirts as they demonstrate improved behavior.
teaching is also different at phoenix.all phoenix students,including ells,take an accelerated curriculum allowing them to earn a high school diploma in roughly half but sometimes less than half the time of a traditional high school,like mccaskey.phoenix students take five classes per day,generally completing each class in half an academic year days.mccaskey students,in contrast,take seven classes per day,generally completing each class in a full academic year days.under these different schedules,mccaskey students receive about more minutes,or more hours,of instruction per class than do students at phoenix,the equivalent of about thirty more class periods per class.the upshot is,as one former phoenix teacher put it,that phoenix curriculum must be taught double time.
phoenix program for teaching english to ells also differs from the international school.phoenix offers ells of all levels,with no special accommodations for slife,one esl course per day.otherwise,ells,including slife,take all their content courses science,math,social studies with phoenix general population under the accelerated model.in those content classes,ells are sheltered from each other by their english proficiency or from native english speakers like they are at the international school.
how does the school district empirically evaluate the efficacy of phoenix esl program it does.the school district does not assess in any measurable way whether phoenix program helps ells overcome their language barriers.it has attempted to weigh concretely the impact phoenix accelerated,program has on ells,including slife.raw data about phoenix esl program apparently exists.but the school district does disaggregate it from data about the international school esl program.because the two programs rely on different esl teaching methods,commingling the data means the school district can not quantify whether phoenix esl program is successful.
the school district enrollment policies and practices 
enrollment in phoenix rather than mccaskey is usually a choice offered to students and their families.but one group of prospective students is offered that choice students over age and.for students in that category which included the plaintiffs,the choice is made for them the school district unilaterally assigns them to phoenix and does allow them to transfer to mccaskey.this mandatory enrollment rule applies regardless of a student english proficiency or educational background and even if the student has several years of public school eligibility left under pennsylvania law.the school district does this,it says,because these students represent a higher risk of dropping out or aging out at age before earning a high school diploma,which is a prerequisite for future advancement.but the school district funding and evaluations also turn,in part,on its graduation rates,which decline when students drop out or age out at.
actual enrollment at phoenix has been a smooth process for these plaintiffs.while the school district unilaterally assigned them to phoenix under the mandatory enrollment rule,their actual placement there proved far more difficult.they experienced significant delays between when they applied for enrollment and when they were either allowed to attend phoenix or denied enrollment outright.the district court said it well in no case did the school district accomplish the enrollment of the plaintiffs within the period mandated by state law.issa,wl,at.iang and sung were not permitted to start at phoenix until december and february,though they enrolled in november.issa enrolled in november but was allowed to start at phoenix until february.hassan was initially denied enrollment outright.he was later enrolled when the school district learned he was,not,a factor with no legal significance under pennsylvania law.id.and by when the injunction issued in,the school district had yet to enroll alembe dunia,despite his repeated attempts to enroll dating back to at least january.id.
how attending phoenix affected the plaintiffs 
for those plaintiffs ultimately admitted to phoenix,a common complaint was that they did understand the vast majority of content taught in their classes.issa,wl,at.the plaintiffs all testified through interpreters that phoenix accelerated curriculum moved too quickly for them to grasp.apart from their phoenix esl courses,the plaintiffs explained,they could understand most of what their teachers and classmates were saying.despite these difficulties,they accrued credits and advanced to higher grade levels.
through her interpreter,issa testified that phoenix classes went very fast and she did understand anything.she felt she was benefiting there and wanted to attend a school slower in pace.when asked,she could explain what two of her classes were about.in those classes,she said,her teachers and classmates spoke and wrote only in english,which she could understand.nevertheless,she was promoted to the next grade.of students in her class,she was ranked first.
hassan testified through his interpreter that learning at phoenix was impossible and he only understood his esl teacher.he could understand his teachers or classmates.
through their interpreter,iang and sung explained they too had great difficulty understanding their content classes at phoenix because they were all taught in english.they could understand their teachers or classmates,and there were never interpreters there to help.
anyemu dunia graduated from phoenix during the evidentiary hearing,earning a diploma in just sixteen months.he did so although he arrived in the united states without any academic credits or proficiency,all while amassing total absences.despite his readily apparent difficulties conversing in english and his testimony that phoenix classes moved too fast for him,he graduated sixth in his class of.issa,wl,at see.
in july,the plaintiffs sued the school district in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania requesting a preliminary injunction allowing them and similarly situated ells to enroll in and attend mccaskey.on behalf of a putative class,they allege violations of the eeoa,f title vi of the civil rights act of,et the fourteenth amendment due process and equal protection clauses and.stat.of the pennsylvania public school code of and various pennsylvania regulations.
following expedited discovery on the plaintiffs motion,the district court held a evidentiary hearing.eighteen witnesses testified and dozens of exhibits were entered into evidence.the plaintiffs expert,helaine marshall,a specialist in teaching english to speakers of other languages tesol and teaching esl to slife,testified at length.
on august,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion,finding likely violations of the eeoa and state law.issa,wl see order,wl on the plaintiffs eeoa claims,the district court held that the school district failed on prongs one and three of the test penned in castaneda pickard,cir,a case we discuss in detail below.on their state law claims,the district court found likely violations of the public school code and regulations in light of the school district enrollment delays.it entered the following order 
p ending final resolution of this matter,the school district shall 
enroll and permit the plaintiffs,who so wish,to attend the main high school,mccaskey,beginning on august,
ensure that all plaintiffs are properly assessed for language proficiency and receive an appropriate and adequate program of language instruction,including assignment to the international school if appropriate,esl instruction,modifications in the delivery of instruction and testing to facilitate their achievement of english proficiency and state academic standards,and interpretation and translation services,as required by law,to enable the plaintiffs and their parents to meaningfully participate in education decisions 
ensure that the plaintiffs have equal access to the full range of educational opportunities provided to their peers,including curricular and programs and activities and 
the plaintiffs shall post a nominal bond of.
order,wl,at.the district court deferred deciding the plaintiffs motion for class certification but urged the school district to fairly apply its order to refugees similarly situated to the plaintiffs in language proficiency.id.at.
the school district filed this timely appeal,asking our court to stay the injunction enforcement.it informed us that,as of september,four of six named plaintiffs excluding alembe and anyemu dunia and five similarly situated ells transferred to the international school after the injunction issued,one of whom requested reinstatement at phoenix.appellant resp.to,order see supra note.later,our court denied the school district stay motion and ordered expedited briefing.the united states department of justice filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs.
the district court had jurisdiction under and a.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal under a.dep t of,cir.
at the outset,we underscore the school district heavy burden on appeal.in reviewing a order,findings of fact are assessed for clear error,legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,and the ultimate decision to grant relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion.strong families attorney of,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if it completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility or bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.havens mobex network,llc,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.an abuse of discretion occurs only if the decision reviewed rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law,or an improper application of law to fact.mancini northampton,cir.with these principles in mind,we turn to the legal standards for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy granted in limited circumstances.ferring,watson,cir.those seeking one must establish that a they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims,b they are likely to suffer irreparable harm without relief,c the balance of harms favors them,and d relief is in the public interest.id.we address each element seriatim.
we turn first to whether the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their eeoa and state law claims.to satisfy this requirement for preliminary relief,the movant need only prove a prima facie case,not a certainty she win.highmark,upmc health plan,cir.we do not require that the right to a final decision after trial be wholly without doubt the movant need only show a reasonable probability of success.punnett carter,cir.internal quotation marks omitted see singer mgmt.consultants,milgram,cir.en banc.we address the plaintiffs eeoa claims first,followed by their state law claims.
this appeal requires us to interpret f of the eeoa,a provision we never addressed and that the supreme court and our fellow courts of appeals have infrequently applied.we start where we always do when interpreting a statute with its text.passed in as a floor amendment to the elementary and secondary education act of,the eeoa states in f that n o state shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race,color,sex,or national origin,by the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.f.an individual denied an equal educational opportunity may bring a civil action in federal court against such parties,and for such relief,as may be appropriate.id.the eeoa limits remedies to those that are essential to correct particular denials of equal educational opportunity.horne flores,quoting.
based upon these provisions,we hold that an individual alleging a violation of f must satisfy four elements the defendant must be an educational agency,the plaintiff must face language barriers impeding her equal participation in the defendant instructional programs,the defendant must have failed to take appropriate action to overcome those barriers,and the plaintiff must have been denied equal educational opportunity on account of her race,color,sex,or national origin.see f id.a defining educational agency 
here,there is no dispute the plaintiffs satisfied f first element.the school district does not quibble with the district court conclusion that it is an educational agency under f and a.see issa,wl,at.we see no reason to disturb that conclusion on appeal,as the eeoa expressly contemplates local educational agencies,like the school district,in defining an educational agency.a see id.a.
likewise,there is no genuine dispute the plaintiffs satisfied f second element.the record here is replete with evidence the named plaintiffs,all slife,face formidable language barriers.all testified through interpreters that they could understand their content courses taught in english at phoenix.given this evidence,we agree the plaintiffs demonstrated language barriers impeding their equal participation in the school district instructional programs,satisfying f second element.see issa,wl,at stating that the parties do not dispute the plaintiffs language barriers and crediting the plaintiffs testimony that their participation was impeded.
because elements one and two of f prima facie case are met,we move to f more difficult third and fourth elements.
section f third element appropriate action 
to satisfy f third element in the context of a motion,the plaintiffs must adduce evidence of a reasonable probability that the school district failed to take appropriate action to overcome their language barriers.because the eeoa itself does define appropriate action,we must look elsewhere for guidance.
we turn first to the supreme court decision in lau nichols,issued just before congress passed the eeoa.there,a school district failed to provide any instruction to a significant number about percent of its chinese students.id.at.those students filed suit,alleging violations of title vi,which restricts federal funding for entities that discriminate based on race,color,or national origin.id.at.finding adequate proof of a title vi violation,the court stressed the importance of language instruction in american education.
there is no equality of treatment merely by providing students with the same facilities,textbooks,teachers,and curriculum for students who do not understand english are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.basic english skills are at the very core of what public schools teach.imposition of a requirement that,before a child can effectively participate in the educational program,he must already have acquired those basic skills is to make a mockery of public education.we know that those who do not understand english are certain to find their classroom experiences wholly incomprehensible and in no way meaningful.
id.at.because no specific remedy was requested,the court left that question open,suggesting the school district had latitude to decide how it would comply with title vi teaching english to the students of chinese ancestry who do not speak the language is one choice.giving instructions to this group in chinese is another.there may be others.id.at.
lau pronouncements about title vi were later called into question,and the supreme court ultimately recognized its abrogation on that ground.see alexander sandoval,w e have since rejected lau interpretation of title vi.in enacting f,however,congress embraced lau essential holding that schools are not free to ignore the need of limited english speaking children for language assistance.castaneda,at.
following lau and f enactment,the fifth circuit handed down castaneda pickard in.claiming violations of f,students sued their school district,alleging its failure to implement a program impeded their ability to overcome language barriers.id.at.measuring f reach,the fifth circuit found that by using the less specific term,appropriate action,congress left state and local authorities a substantial amount of latitude to choose the programs and techniques they would use to satisfy f mandate.id.at.but too much latitude,the court cautioned,would render f a nullity.accordingly,the fifth circuit held that state educational agencies must make a genuine and good faith effort,consistent with local circumstances and resources,to remedy the language deficiencies of their students under f,and noted that congress deliberately placed on federal courts the difficult responsibility of determining whether that obligation is met.id.at.without guidance from congress on what appropriate action looks like,however,the fifth circuit found itself,like we are now,
confronted with a type of task which federal courts are to perform and which we are often criticized for undertaking prescribing substantive standards and policies for institutions whose governance is properly reserved to other levels and branches of our government,state and local educational agencies which are better able to assimilate and assess the knowledge of professionals in the field.
id.nevertheless,the court charted a path forward,fashioning a mode of analysis to fulfill the responsibility congress reposed in the federal courts under f without unduly substituting its educational values and theories for the educational and political decisions reserved to state and local school authorities and the expert knowledge of educators.id.that mode of analysis,it said,is threefold.first,courts 
examine carefully the evidence the record contains concerning the soundness of the educational theory or principles upon which the challenged program is based.this,of course,is not to be done with any eye toward discerning the relative merits of sound but competing bodies of expert educational opinion the court responsibility is only to ascertain that a school system is pursuing a program informed by an educational theory recognized as sound by some experts in the field or,at least,deemed a legitimate experimental strategy.
id.second,courts determine whether the programs and practices actually used by the school system are reasonably calculated to implement effectively the educational theory adopted by the school.id.at.and third,if an and program fails to produce results indicating that language barriers are actually being overcome,it may no longer constitute appropriate action.id.applying this test,the fifth circuit found serious doubts under prong two about the language competency of teachers employed in the school district bilingual classrooms and remanded for an evidentiary hearing.id.at.
courts have consistently followed castaneda approach to apply f third element,requiring appropriate action.see,united states texas,cir.mumid abraham lincoln high,cir.gomez.state bd.of,cir.united states texas,cir.and in horne flores,the supreme court relied on castaneda to apply f,at,though it did not adopt the fifth circuit test explicitly,id.at expressing no view on whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance regarding the meaning of appropriate action.given these decisions and the parties agreement that castaneda should here guide our analysis,we will apply the fifth circuit test.though we decline to adopt without qualification castaneda framework and think fine tuning must await future cases,we believe this test,as a general matter,properly balances f allocation of responsibilities between the courts and the schools and hence provides a fruitful starting point for our analysis under f third element.gomez,at.
applying castaneda here to resolve whether the school district took appropriate action to overcome the plaintiffs language barriers under f,we agree with the district court the school district foundered on castaneda first and third prongs.we explain why below 
castaneda prong one 
on castaneda first prong satisfied where an educational agency fails to pursue a program informed by an educational theory recognized as sound by some experts in the field the plaintiffs showed a reasonable probability of success.their expert,marshall,testified consistently and at length that phoenix accelerated,program for ells is unsound for slife again,students with limited or interrupted formal education.the plaintiffs and two former phoenix teachers corroborated her testimony.the school district did not rebut it with another expert or through contrary research.we see no clear error here.
slife,marshall emphasized,generally struggle or have yet to learn to read or write in any language,including their native languages.not only must they learn english in american schools,she explained,they must learn how to learn there.see w e have to teach slife for the first time how to read in a language that is even a language they speak yet.describing how teaching in the united states relies on decontextualized tasks multiple choice,matching,and questions that foreign students are completely unaware of.marshall said that for slife to succeed,teaching must go more slowly and build,build the language,build the literacy,and fill in the gaps.this testimony went unchallenged.
given slife need for unhurried and deliberate literacy and language development,marshall opined that phoenix accelerated curriculum is totally inappropriate for them.see for slife it is contraindicated.it is the opposite of what they need.students like the plaintiffs who are behind academically and do understand english,she explained,can not be expected to go faster through content when they have reached a threshold of english.her view,she attested,accords with those of other experts in the field.she was unaware of any contrary research,and the school district did point to any.uniformly,she said,the field in talking about slife talks about going more slowly,building in redundancy,building in repetition,and having them become familiar with material in many different ways in order for them to learn it,and not to go at double time.id.emphasis added see again and again they say the key is to take your time,present the material in a variety of ways,make sure they get it and nobody is talking about accelerating.no evidence was presented that an accelerated curriculum,on its own,is accepted as sound educational theory for slife.
marshall also opined consistently that sheltered instruction content classes,like those offered at the international school,are needed for slife,and that phoenix commingling of slife with ells and native english speakers,when combined with accelerated content courses,is not accepted as sound educational theory,i f you going to try and have newcomers with very little english mixed in with fluid english speakers what happens is that it becomes overwhelming for the lower level ells.see slife need an entire day of instruction that tailored to them.w hen slife are in their content classes with native speakers they not understanding what happening,they really not progressing,they not moving forward b ecause they not actually learning the material.here too,no evidence was adduced that accelerated,unsheltered instruction is accepted as sound educational theory for slife.the plaintiffs own testimony,cited extensively above,confirmed their great difficulty in understanding their accelerated,content classes at phoenix.
former phoenix teacher jandy rivera reinforced marshall and the plaintiffs testimony,explaining that her refugee students were not able to master the material in phoenix accelerated,program.she stated that a t the fast pace and atmosphere at phoenix,refugee students were not able to learn that these students needed a regularly paced atmosphere,or perhaps even an extended learning atmosphere in order to master the material and that in her experience,phoenix program did work for newly arrived ells.id.phoenix teacher,marianne ortiz,similarly corroborated marshall testimony,stating that the international school is a better placement for entering students because it not accelerated and gives ells sheltered instruction content classes.given this evidence,we see no clear error in the district court findings that 
w hen a student with no ability to speak or understand english,such as the plaintiffs,is placed in accelerated classes,the student will cover material twice as fast as a normal school,but that material is also taught in a language that student does not understand.on its face,this practice appears to be counterintuitive expert testimony confirmed that the practice was unsound the district did not offer any expert to the contrary.instead,the district offered its esl coordinator amber hilt,who testified that the structured immersion technique is a sound theory generally for overcoming language barriers,but nothing persuasive to the court to contradict marshall testimony that this technique was not recognized as sound for an accelerated,program.the phoenix model of accelerated learning presents different language barriers than a traditional education program,and is particularly imposing for students who can not yet understand the language in which the courses are taught.
issa,wl,at,emphasis added.
on appeal,the school district attempts merely to impeach the credibility of marshall testimony.it points out,for example,that marshall neglected to personally observe phoenix,although rivera and ortiz and all six named plaintiffs reinforced her testimony.appellant br.it says marshall was a mere teacher of teachers,not an esl instructor,without explaining why that might render the district court reliance on her testimony clearly erroneous.id.and it says marshall contradicted herself when she testified that immersion of ells in content classes with native speakers impeded their progress,not necessarily acceleration.id.at.but when we consider the record en bloc,these alleged blemishes in marshall testimony fail to persuade us that the district court findings are completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility or bear no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data,as required to show clear error.havens,at internal quotation marks omitted.
for these reasons,the district court did not err in concluding that the plaintiffs showed a reasonable probability that phoenix accelerated,program is informed by an educational theory recognized as sound by some experts in the field,as required under castaneda first prong.
castaneda prong three 
on castaneda third prong satisfied where an educational agency programs fail to produce results indicating that language barriers are actually being overcome we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success.the evidence shows that the school district does keep separate data on the efficacy of phoenix esl program.this rendered it difficult,if not impossible,for the district court to ascertain whether the plaintiffs language barriers were actually being overcome at phoenix.given this evidence,we see no clear error in the district court findings,unchallenged on appeal,that 
u ndisputed testimony offered in court shows that the district does not evaluate whether the language barriers confronting students are actually being overcome at phoenix as required by castaneda.the esl coordinator hilt acknowledged that there is no data that would allow us to determine whether the esl delivered to these students in phoenix accelerated model is working or not.because the district did not disaggregate the phoenix data to make this assessment,it could not demonstrate the effectiveness of the program to the court.through her own efforts,marshall was able to discern from limited data provided by the district that phoenix performance on literacy measures the core measure of overcoming language barriers was far worse than mccaskey.
issa,wl,at.the school district superintendent,damaris rau,confirmed that the effectiveness of phoenix esl program had yet to be evaluated.this further supports the district court findings.
on appeal,the school district argues phoenix esl instruction is and continues to be successful.appellant br.to bolster that point,it notes that one named plaintiff,anyemu dunia,graduated from phoenix and read an essay aloud in court,while many other unspecified ells have gone on to college after graduating phoenix.id.citing.though he could read an essay aloud in court,the district court found that anyemu had readily apparent difficulties conversing in english,issa,wl,at,and anyemu himself testified that he could only catch some word s when his teachers talked to him in class.even if we were to accept this as sufficient indicia of anyemu progress,his ability to read a portion of an essay in court says nothing about whether the other four named plaintiffs were overcoming their own language barriers at phoenix.the record here amply supports the district court conclusion that they were not.as explained before,all testified they could understand what their teachers and classmates were saying in their content classes at phoenix.this argument therefore fails to show clear error.
we also find unavailing the school district contention,in its papers and at oral argument,that an ell ability to graduate phoenix,on its own,weighs in the school district favor under f.on this record,we see little evidence of a meaningful connection between ells graduating from phoenix accelerated,program and ells actually overcoming their language barriers there.on the contrary,there is ample evidence supporting the district court finding that a lthough the student earns or at least is issued a diploma and all of the attendant benefits,the student will likely graduate phoenix with limited ability,if any,to converse in english also often a prerequisite to future advancement and limited understanding of the content of the courses he actually took.issa,wl,at.we therefore conclude that the plaintiffs showed a likelihood that phoenix program fails to produce results indicating that their language barriers are actually being overcome,as required under castaneda third prong.
because the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success under castaneda test,they met f third element,requiring proof that the school district failed to take appropriate action to overcome their language barriers.
section f fourth element on account of a protected characteristic 
we now address f fourth and final element,which requires proof the plaintiffs were denied equal educational opportunity on account of their race,color,sex,or national origin.see f.we hold they met this element.
the supreme court has yet to address how the preamble to,which includes the on account of language here in issue,interacts with the rest of and subsection f in particular.the court did not discuss the matter in horne flores,so we look elsewhere.in its entirety,provides that 
n o state shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race,color,sex,or national origin,by 
a the deliberate segregation by an educational agency of students on the basis of race,color,or national origin among or within schools 
b the failure of an educational agency which has formerly practiced such deliberate segregation to take affirmative steps,consistent with part of this subchapter,to remove the vestiges of a dual school system 
c the assignment by an educational agency of a student to a school,other than the one closest to his or her place of residence within the school district in which he or she resides,if the assignment results in a greater degree of segregation of students on the basis of race,color,sex,or national origin among the schools of such agency than would result if such student were assigned to the school closest to his or her place of residence within the school district of such agency providing the appropriate grade level and type of education for such student 
d discrimination by an educational agency on the basis of race,color,or national origin in the employment,employment conditions,or assignment to schools of its faculty or staff,except to fulfill the purposes of subsection f below 
e the transfer by an educational agency,whether voluntary or otherwise,of a student from one school to another if the purpose and effect of such transfer is to increase segregation of students on the basis of race,color,or national origin among the schools of such agency or 
f the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.
the school district suggests preamble requires the plaintiffs to prove it failed to take appropriate action to overcome their language barriers on account of their national origins under f.the school district interprets on account of to require a showing of intentional discrimination,contending there insufficient evidence the plaintiffs national origins motivated their placement at phoenix.reply br.we reject this reading of.
we start with what f does require when read together with on account of language a showing of discrimination of any kind,intentional or otherwise,on account of an characteristic.congress expressly included the word discrimination in d but omitted it from f.see castaneda,at.and in subsections a and e of,congress explicitly required showings of deliberate and purpose ful conduct,but merely required proof of a fail ure to take appropriate action under f.see id.where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute here,the word discrimination and language connoting intentional conduct in subsections a,d,and e but omits it in another section of the same act here,subsection f we presume it acted intentionally and purposely in so doing.dean united states,see bd.of trustees of ibt local pension fund c s wholesale grocers,cir.we therefore join the fifth circuit in holding that f prohibits the mere failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome students language barriers,regardless of whether such a failure is motivated by an intent to discriminate against those students.castaneda,at.and we add that,because f does say discrimination,there no requirement under it to prove discrimination of any kind,including,for example,disparate impact discrimination this reading accords with the supreme court observation in horne,at,that f requires educational agencies to tak e appropriate action to teach english to students who grew up speaking another language,and with lau essential holding that schools are not free to ignore the need of limited english speaking children for language assistance,castaneda,at 
we end with what f does require when read together with s on account of language a nexus between the lost educational opportunity alleged and an characteristic.stated differently,we hold that the denial of the equal educational opportunity in f case,the language barrier that is not being overcome must stem from race,color,sex,or national origin,rather than from,for example,a cognitive disability covered by a different remedial scheme,like the individuals with disabilities education act,et.applying this reading here,we conclude the record fully supports that the plaintiffs language barriers,and hence their lost educational opportunities,stem from their national origins.
thus,the plaintiffs satisfied f fourth element,as they were denied equal educational opportunity on account of an characteristic their national origins.given the plaintiffs successful showings under all four of f elements,we agree with the district court that they demonstrated a likelihood of success on their eeoa claims.
we turn now to whether the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable probability of success on the merits of their state law claims.because neither the plaintiffs nor the district court addressed the threshold question whether the plaintiffs state law claims are cognizable,we remand for the district court to consider that question in the first instance.
in pennsylvania,every child who has graduated from high school may attend the public schools in her district until the end of the school year in which she turns.stat.see.code,a.a child right to be admitted to school may not be conditioned on the child immigration status.code d.a school district shall normally enroll a child the next business day,but no later than within business days of application.id.b.the district court concluded the plaintiffs showed likely violations of these state laws because none was enrolled within five days and one alembe dunia was still not enrolled when the injunction issued.issa,wl,at.
while the school district enrollment delays are indeed troubling,we must conclude the district court erred as a matter of law in finding that the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success on their state law claims.unlike the eeoa,which explicitly grants individual s the right to institute a civil action in court for equitable relief,our de novo review reveals nothing in.stat.or elsewhere in the public school code that expressly grants individuals,like students or their parents,a private cause of action to enforce the statute in court through equitable remedies see.stat.to.likewise.code b,a regulation promulgated by pennsylvania state board of education,does expressly grant private litigants a cause of action to remedy enrollment delays or denials in court through equitable relief,assuming a regulation can ever do so under pennsylvania law 
in the absence of an express private cause of action under a pennsylvania statute,we look to whether the statute implicitly creates one.estate of witthoeft kiskaddon,emphasis added.when there sufficient indicia of the general assembly intent,pennsylvania courts have recognized the possibility of implied private causes of action and remedies stemming from state statutes that do expressly provide for them.see,schappell motorists mut.ins,inferring a private cause of action from pennsylvania motor vehicle financial responsibility law estate of witthoeft,at declining to infer a private cause of action from pennsylvania motor vehicle code and regulations solomon healthcare of.super.finding no implied private cause of action under pennsylvania health care act.here,to the extent pennsylvania decisions can be read to support an implied private cause of action,they suggest that exhaustion of administrative remedies may be required in the first instance.see velazquez ex rel.stroudsburg area sch.commw.but neither the district court nor the parties cited any authority concerning the viability of an administrative exhaustion requirement or an implied private cause of action for equitable relief stemming from the pennsylvania statute and regulations in issue.the district court thus implicitly assumed such a private cause of action and remedy may be so inferred without exhaustion of administrative remedies.
without any briefing on these issues which appear to be matters of first impression under pennsylvania law we decline to resolve them.we leave them for the district court to address in the first instance on remand,assuming they raised by the parties.see young martin,cir.leaving legal questions not reached in the district court and not briefed on appeal for the district court to address in the first instance on remand.suffice it to say that,without any analysis of whether the plaintiffs can bring private causes of action for equitable relief without exhausting administrative remedies under these state laws,the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their state law claims.
we note,however,that nothing about the district court order relies specifically on a conclusion that the plaintiffs proved likely violations of pennsylvania law.thus,we need not vacate any part of it on that ground.and even without proving likely violations of state law,the plaintiffs successful showings under the eeoa may support a preliminary injunction.see,contemplating equitable relief for eeoa violations.we therefore proceed to the next element they must prove to justify one irreparable harm.
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must prove irreparable harm is likely in the absence of relief.winter nat.res.def.council,see ferring,at.
we agree with the district court that without preliminary relief,irreparable harm was likely for these plaintiffs,who would have remained in phoenix accelerated,program for at least the duration of this litigation.the plaintiffs already demonstrated a reasonable probability that phoenix programs are unsound for them and fail to actually overcome their language barriers under the eeoa.and these plaintiffs,all slife,must overcome uniquely difficult challenges to learning.time is of the essence their eligibility to attend public school in pennsylvania is dwindling.we recognize that a sound educational program has power to change the trajectory of a child life,ligonier valley school district authority,cir,while even a few months in an unsound program can make a world of difference in harm to a child educational development,puerto rico,cir.internal quotation marks omitted plyler doe,noting the lasting impact of education deprivation on the life of the child.in accordance with this injunction,moreover,four named plaintiffs now attend mccaskey,where they say they flourishing.appellees br.jockeying them back to phoenix now would thus cause them greater harm,as the school district conceded during oral argument.given these factors,we are satisfied the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of irreparable harm absent this injunction.
we must now balance the parties relative harms that is,the potential injury to the plaintiffs without this injunction versus the potential injury to the defendant with it in place.novartis consumer health,johnson consumer pharm,cir.
we already identified the irreparable harm the plaintiffs would likely suffer absent this injunction.and we agree with the district court that the school district has no interest in continuing practices that violate f of the eeoa.issa,wl,at.the school district argues the plaintiffs fail on this element because the injunction permits usurpation of its decisionmaking authority to place older,students where they can best be educated,which could lead to future litigation in other unspecified areas of discretion and to the erosion of unspecified authority and funds.appellant br.the record before us,however,belies the school district contention that phoenix is where the plaintiffs can best be educated.under the eeoa,we reject an educational agency call for unfettered authority when its programs fall short of f mandate.see gomez,at w e can not accord such sweeping deference to state and local agencies that judicial review becomes in practice judicial abdication.by the school district own representations,we know only eight students transferred from phoenix to mccaskey after the preliminary injunction issued four named plaintiffs and four similarly situated students.the school district therefore retains substantial decisionmaking authority over the affairs of the vast majority of its students,this injunction notwithstanding.we agree with the district court that the balance of harms favors the plaintiffs.
finally,we must weigh whether the public interest favors this preliminary injunction.doing so is often fairly routine.kos,andrx,cir.if a plaintiff proves both a likelihood of
