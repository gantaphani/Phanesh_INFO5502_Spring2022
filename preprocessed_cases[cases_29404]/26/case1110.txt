the plaintiff in this case,is a young child who suffers from severe emotional and mental health problems.during the relevant time period these problems manifested themselves in repeated outbursts in which he threatened,and at times assaulted,teachers and students.in,when he was six years old,he was placed in a special education program at the governor bent elementary school.school officials worked with his mother,jennifer couture,to develop an individualized education plan iep.the plan included a behavior management system designed to teach to control his dangerous outbursts.in addition to implementing clear and strict rules,the system permitted teachers to place in supervised timeouts when his behavior became disruptive.
despite the small class size and personal attention received,his behavior did not improve,and,at times,it deteriorated.frequently interrupted class and often made it impossible for the teachers to instruct the other students.when they could not control his behavior,the teachers placed him in timeout until he calmed down for a period of at least five minutes.the appropriateness of these timeouts,and the characteristics of the timeout room,are the central issues in this suit.
couture brought suit under,individually and on behalf of,against the board of education of albuquerque public schools aps,brady the teacher,flippo the principal,and willis,the school psychologist.in addition to other claims not before us today,she argued that the defendants use of the timeout room violated fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures and his fourteenth amendment right to procedural and substantive due process.the three individual defendants filed a motion contending that they were entitled to qualified immunity,which the district court denied.we disagree with the district court and find that qualified immunity protects all three individuals from liability.we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for dismissal on the fourth and fourteenth amendment claims.
following a difficult turn in a public school kindergarten classroom and a rocky start to first grade,the albuquerque public school system determined that was emotionally disturbed and therefore eligible for special educational services.in october of,his mother,jennifer couture,met with a multidisciplinary team composed of aps officials to develop individualized educational plan iep.this document,a product of consultation between the student family and experienced professionals at the school,established the blueprint for his education,and must be followed by the student teachers and educational assistants.at the meeting,the team identified some of the problematic behavior he displayed 
is defiant,uncooperative,argumentative,and aggressive.he throws things,does not do what is asked of him,sits under the table,plays with inappropriate things,isolates himself,and cuts up things is inattentive,has poor peer relations,argues,and is oppositional.is continually defiant he tries his best to be oppositional first grade teacher reports the following specific behaviors of concern defiance,angry aggression,lack of attention,lack of interest,and unhappiness the children stay away from him with some children being scared.he can not sit at tables with other children because he talks,bothers them,and threatens other children.
id.at.to address these concerns and to help receive an appropriate education,the team formulated a behavior intervention plan iep targeted toward improving behavior,social skills,and academics.id.the teachers were to establish clear rules with consistent implementation of consequences,communication,supervised time out,and therapeutic deescalation techniques by trained personnel.id.emphasis added.the teachers also agreed to report home to couture daily.couture signed that she agree d with the recommendations of the individualized education program team and gave permission for her child to receive the recommended services.id.at.
on october,was placed in jacqueline brady special education classroom in the governor bent elementary school.the classroom had no more than eight students in it at a time,but still received special,attention from educational assistant wendy orr.despite the instructors use of both positive reinforcement techniques and intervention tools such as rewards,ignoring misbehavior,visual contact,verbal comments,warnings,physical proximity,talking with,and touching,continued to struggle with his anger management problems.app.brady reported that e very day would mock and mimic other children.id.he frequently used profanity.he threatened to kill other children,hit or kicked his chair,and regularly shoved his desk against the wall.id.at.he also threatened his teachers,yelling things such as you dead.i going to kill you.i going to throw hot oil on you and kill you.app.district.op.at.occasionally,he engaged in physical violence,for example punching the assistant in the stomach and kicking her in the shin.app.unsurprisingly,this behavior had an adverse effect on the rest of the students.
because the interventions and positive reinforcement techniques failed,and in accordance with the prescription of supervised time out as part of behavioral intervention plan,brady used timeouts to help calm down.when behavior became disruptive,brady or orr would ask him whether he needed a timeout at his desk,in the timeout chair,or in the timeout room.these strategies sometimes worked.was not always effective,however,and the teachers often had to force into the timeout room if he bec a me violent,a threat to himself or to others,or if he demonstrated a ggressive behavior either to himself or aggressiveness toward other children dist.op.at.in addition to using the timeout room as a deescalation technique,the teachers occasionally placed in it when he was not following directions to begin work id.to be released from the timeout room,had to remain calm and silent for five minutes.sometimes immediately calmed down,but often his behavior grew worse in the timeout room,and he would scream and kick or throw himself against the door.dist.op.at.the teachers often had to hold the door shut.couture received daily reports documenting day these reports contained some,but not all,of the factual details of the timeouts.
couture eventually saw the timeout room while visiting the classroom.she described it as very small with carpeting,but no padding on the walls.nothing in it.just carpet on the floor.it had a very dim light.there was black construction paper over the window,completely covering the window.you could not see in there unless you either moved the paper or took it off the window.app.the district court summary of the factual record is more nuanced while at times,the teachers covered the window so that could not antagonize teachers and students through it and barricaded the door to prevent from shoving his way out of the room,generally,the timeout room complied with the standards set forth by the albuquerque public schools.dist.op.at.the room was lighted and empty,the room did not have a lock on the door,and teaching staff were able to see into the room through a window in the door.id.at.
on november,couture initiated an administrative action pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act idea against the albuquerque public schools and the defendants,in both their official and individual capacities the complaint is not entirely clear as to which claims applied to which defendants,but it asserted violations under section of the rehabilitation act,the idea,and title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.couture claimed that was denied a free appropriate education fape,and was discriminated against on the basis of a disability,because the defendants failed to consider eligibility as a student with a specific learning disability document the decision not to classify him as a student with a learning disability provide special education consistent with the existence of a learning disability and write or implement an iep reasonably calculated to meet needs as a child with a disability.pertinent to this appeal,she also claimed that the district discriminated against by s anctioning or ignoring ongoing inappropriate reliance upon timeouts and physical restraint as strategies in an educational setting when such strategies would not be tolerated if directed at children.app.because she was moving out of the district,the hearing officer limited evidence to that pertinent to compensatory relief.id.at.
the due process hearing officer dpho held a three day hearing.he found no evidence of inadequate instruction or a denial of a fape,and no evidence of discrimination or exclusion from participation in the educational process.app.while acknowledging that not all of the defendants techniques were successful,he found that r espondent provided the student with an array of appropriate interventions,supports,and services that were individually designed to meet his needs app.the lack of any spectacular level of success was not due to any lack of trying on the part of the staff,nor was it caused by any failure on the part of the district to meet legal requirements or to apply the expected level of professional educational acumen.id.the dpho denied all of petitioner claims and dismissed them with prejudice.
couture appealed this decision to the federal district court of new mexico.she added several claims against defendant brady,classroom teacher,in her individual capacity,under for violations of right to be free from unreasonable seizures pursuant to the fourth amendment procedural due process rights and substantive due process rights she filed these same claims against defendants flippo and willis,principal and school psychologist,under a theory of supervisory liability.she also sued the three educators in their official capacities.brady,flippo,and willis moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.the district court denied summary judgment on all but the substantive due process claim,holding that the plaintiff facts,if true,demonstrated that brady violated clearly established rights when she seized him and placed him in a timeout room without proper procedures.it granted summary judgment on the substantive due process claim because the same conduct alleged by plaintiff as a violation of substantive due process is covered by the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures.app,citing graham connor,d.
this interlocutory appeal followed.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,as we must,we hold that the individual defendants did not violate fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures or his fourteenth amendment procedural due process rights and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review the denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity under.see mitchell forsyth,d.orders denying qualified immunity before trial are appealable only to the extent they resolve abstract issues of law.shrum city of coweta,cir citing behrens pelletier,d.when the question is whether there is sufficient evidence or whether the district court findings with respect to a genuine issue of material fact are correct,an interlocutory appeal is improper.id.citing johnson jones,d.a fact is material if the resolution might affect the outcome of the case under governing law.linbrugger abercia,cir.
whether a seizure was reasonable is a question of law reviewable on interlocutory appeal.see doe bagan,cir.accepting the district court interpretations of the plaintiff evidentiary proffers,we must determine whether those facts render the seizures unreasonable under the fourth amendment.johnson martin,cir see also blossom yarbrough,cir.
we conclude that,on this summary judgment record,the individual defendants did not violate fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures or his fourteenth amendment procedural due process rights.it is therefore unnecessary to reach the second part of the saucier inquiry whether those rights were clearly established at the time.saucier katz,d we have no jurisdiction to review the substantive due process claim,which was resolved in favor of the defendants and has not been appealed.other legal claims and claims against other parties,including the plaintiff challenges under the idea,ada,and rehabilitation act,which are not subject to interlocutory review,are not resolved by this appeal.
iii.fourth amendment claim 
the fourth amendment to the united states constitution protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,amend,iv.contrary to early intimations in supreme court decisions,see ingraham wright,d,the amendment is now understood to apply within the school setting,and it is not limited to actions taken for law enforcement purposes.new jersey,d dubbs head start,cir.but the setting and the purpose of actions undertaken outside the typical law enforcement context profoundly affect their reasonableness.see hazelwood school dist.kuhlmeier,d the rights of students must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment quoting tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.the requirement that police have probable cause before conducting a seizure,for example,does not apply in schools the court has held that such a standard would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures that are needed.board of educ.of indep.school dist.of pottawatomie county earls,d quoting vernonia school dist.acton,d further citations omitted.to balance the students privacy rights with the schools custodial and tutelary responsibility for children,pottawatomie county,at,a seizure need only be justified at its inception and reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.edwards rees,cir quoting,at.couture argues that the defendants violated fourth amendment rights when they repeatedly placed him in the timeout room.
the first step in our analysis is ordinarily to determine whether there was a seizure under the fourth amendment.a seizure occurs when a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.michigan chesternut,d.we must think about seizures differently in the school context,as students are generally not at liberty to leave the school building when they wish.see vernonia school,at.u nemancipated minors lack some of the most fundamental rights of even the right to come and go at will.wallace batavia school dist,cir l aw compels students to attend school,which deprives them of a level of freedom of mobility.once under the control of the school,students movement and location are subject to the ordering and direction of teachers and administrators.to qualify as a seizure in the school context,the limitation on the student freedom of movement must significantly exceed that inherent in,compulsory attendance.
was certainly subject to greater restrictions than are most students.as the district court found,was at times physically carried into the timeout room,where teachers shut and barricaded the door.his requests for release from the room were consistently denied.on the other hand,the defendants maintain that the timeouts can not legally be regarded as seizures for purposes of the fourth amendment because they are employed as educational techniques and were consented to as part of iep.we need not resolve this issue because,even assuming the timeouts were seizures,they were not unreasonable.for the remainder of this opinion,we will assume without deciding that the timeouts were seizures.
reasonableness of the seizure 
the more difficult question is whether the seizure was unreasonable.while we accept the district court assessment of the factual record,including whether there exist any genuine disputed issues of material fact,see johnson jones,d,reasonableness is a question of law,which we review de novo.mecham frazier,cir citing medina cram,cir.context is critical to reasonableness analysis a seizure may be reasonable to an fight,see wallace,at,but it may be unreasonable ten hours after the fight occurred.we emphasize that our function here is to evaluate whether the educators transgressed constitutional limits on their treatment of,not whether their action comported with proper educational policy.the fourth amendment sets outer boundaries for official conduct.it does not empower federal courts to displace educational authorities regarding the formulation and enforcement of pedagogical norms.the plaintiff has raised various claims relating to the appropriateness of the school approach toward under relevant federal statutes,and those claims remain pending in district court.we do not resolve them here.
we are sympathetic to couture concern over the repeated use of the timeout rooms,which at least in retrospect did not seem to ameliorate her son behavior.but we can not find that there was a fourth amendment violation.the educators were confronted with an almost impossible behavioral problem,which was only eventually ameliorated with medication.behavior was disruptive and dangerous.he repeatedly cursed at the teachers and students.app.at times,he threatened the physical safety of the teachers,punching them and kicking them in the shins.app.see also dist.op.at.he also threatened the other children with statements such as i going to throw hot oil on you and kill you.the other first grade students in the class were undoubtedly frightened.app.and the educators were faced with this challenge while simultaneously trying to control and teach the other students in the special education class.temporarily removing,given the threat he often posed to the emotional,psychological,and physical safety of the students and teachers,was eminently reasonable.
the educators response was particularly reasonable given that the timeouts were expressly prescribed by iep as a mechanism to teach him behavioral control.the iep,which was developed by educational specialists in consultation with mother,and to which she agreed in writing,sets forth educational and behavioral methods that classroom teachers were required to follow.neglecting to follow the failure to use the prescribed have exposed the teachers to liability.see ex rel.van duyn baker school dist,cir material failures to implement an iep are violations of the idea neosho sch.dist.clark,cir idea is violated when a school fails to implement an essential element of an iep houston indep.sch.dist.bobby,cir de minimis failures to implement an iep do not violate the idea,but failures to implement substantial or significant iep provisions do.while the timeouts were not as effective as the teachers hoped,their continued employment of timeouts over a period was reasonable.if we do not allow teachers to rely on a plan specifically approved by the student parents and which they are statutorily required to follow,we will put teachers in an impossible to litigation no matter what they do.
while recognizing that was extraordinarily disruptive in class,the district court nonetheless denied qualified immunity because it found that several of the alleged seizures were unreasonable we therefore address the court individual concerns.
justified at its inception 
first,the district court found that one of the seizures was not justified at its inception because was placed in the timeout room for not following directions to begin work on his phonics assignment.dist.op.at.the district court characterized this as a question of fact whether defendants placement of in the timeout room for failing to follow directions was justified at its inception.id.at.we think this was a misunderstanding.while the nature of the underlying a factual issue not reviewable by this court,determining whether a timeout was justified at its inception is a question of law.
there is some factual dispute over the factual basis for the timeout whether refusal to follow was the sole cause of the seizure that day.we resolve that dispute,as did the district court,in favor of the plaintiff.nonetheless,the seizure was still justified at its inception.the fourth amendment does not hold that ensuring the safety of the class is the sole permissible reason for sending students to time out.own iep suggests that timeouts may be useful as a technique to obtain cooperation and participation and to teach to do what is asked of him.app.if corporal punishment is a constitutionally acceptable form of discipline for a student defiance,it is implausible that timeouts are not.see ingraham wright,d.when refused to do his school work,it was not unreasonable for the teachers to send him to a timeout in the hope of obtaining his cooperation in the future.
related in scope 
second,the court also found,assuming arguendo that all the seizures were justified at the inception,that the detentions were nonetheless not reasonably related in scope.a seizure is permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the seizure and not excessive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.new jersey,d.
comparing the situation to edwards rees,cir,a case in which the vice principal detained a student for twenty minutes of questioning after the student was accused of making a bomb threat,the district court stated 
i n contrast,defendant brady and her assistants detained,a child with emotional disabilities,for lengthy periods of time up to one hour and minutes,based upon aps own records,and approximately six hours,according to plaintiff,in a closet,for offenses that were,relatively speaking,significantly less serious than a bomb threat.indeed,on certain occasions,brady and her assistants placed in the timeout room for not following directions,giving angry looks,mimicking his peers,and continuously talking brady assistants extended detention even after complied with the rule,for remaining silent after expiration of the five minute rule and refusing to answer a question on one occasion and for trying to force a door open at the expiration of five minutes of silence on another occasion.
app.because t he nature of these offenses by a,student are not similar in kind to an offense committed by a middle school student involving a bomb threat to a school,the court held the scope of the timeouts was not reasonably related to the necessity of the seizure in the first place.id.
we do not agree with this mode of analysis.although a bomb threat is more serious misconduct than threats,taunts,and tantrums,the comparison does not make the defendants use of timeouts unreasonable.the detentions in the two cases had entirely different purposes.in edwards,the student was detained for the purpose of questioning,and twenty minutes was all that was required.in this case,timeouts were employed as a technique for behavioral modification,and the length of time was determined accordingly.
the district court was troubled both by the length of the timeouts and by their continued use even when conduct seemed to deteriorate,rather than improve,while locked in the room.the district court found that detentions lasted up to one hour and minutes,based upon aps records or six hours,based upon plaintiff testimony,for conduct as minor as not following direction,even though placement in the timeout room arguably exacerbated problematic behavior and his emotional state.dist.op.at did spend a considerable period locked in the timeout room,and perhaps in retrospect this was not an effective disciplinary technique.but as the district court found,even when entered the room for a small infraction,would throw his body against the walls and door of the timeout room such that the teachers would have to put all of their weight against the door to keep it shut.dist.op.at.given conduct like this,it was not unreasonable for the teachers to continue to detain,particularly considering that they had a reasonable fear of violence given his past behavior.
the district court found unreasonable what it described as the educators decision to barricade in a timeout room for one hour and minutes for his original offense of refusing to do his spelling test,throwing his pencil into the back of his desk,and starting to walk forcefully toward the rest of the class dist.op.at.but this is an incomplete picture of what occurred.the educators did not confine him to the timeout room for these le
