this case under the family and medical leave act fmla raises two important immunity issues did congress validly abrogate texas sovereign immunity under the fmla provision and if not did the university of texas at el paso utep waive the state immunity through a single sentence in its handbook of operating procedures we hold that utep immunity was neither validly abrogated nor voluntarily waived,and the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court denial of utep plea to the jurisdiction.
background 
alfredo herrera worked for utep as a heating,ventilation,and technician.in march he sustained an injury to his left elbow.herrera took approximately nine months leave and returned to work in january.utep terminated herrera employment less than one month later.
herrera sued utep,claiming it fired him for taking personal medical leave under the provision of the fmla and exercising his first amendment rights by complaining about unsafe work conditions.utep filed a plea to the jurisdiction on the fmla claim,contending it was barred by sovereign immunity.the trial court denied the plea,and a divided court of appeals affirmed,holding the provision validly abrogated the states sovereign immunity 
the court of appeals anchored its holding on the united states supreme court decision in nevada department of human resources hibbs which concerned the fmla provision related to ill spouses,children or parents.the court of appeals reasoned that the provision,like the provision in hibbs,was intended to advance rights and was thus a valid exercise of congress powers under of the fourteenth amendment the dissenting justice emphasized that t he majority opinion flies in the face of a mountain of contrary and persuasive legal authority.
ii.discussion 
does the provision validly abrogate state immunity 
congress listed five purposes underlying the fmla 
to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families,to promote the stability and economic security of families,and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity 
to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons,for the birth or adoption of a child,and for the care of a child,spouse,or parent who has a serious health condition 
to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs and in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers 
to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs and in a manner that,consistent with the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons including disability and for compelling family reasons,on a basis and 
to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men,pursuant to such clause 
to achieve these purposes,the fmla grants eligible up to workweeks of leave during any period for various reasons including an employee serious health condition,the provision at issue in this case.employees returning from fmla leave are entitled to be restored to their former position,or to a new position with equivalent benefits,pay,and other terms and conditions of employment 
two threshold issues are undisputed herrera is an eligible employee under the fmla and the act by its terms applies to state employers like utep today narrow dispute is whether congress overreached in exposing states to fmla claims under the provision.
our federal and state constitutional designs embody the principle of state sovereignty that shields states from private suits in their own courts and in the federal courts herrera fmla suit is thus barred by sovereign immunity unless congress validly abrogates it,or the state voluntarily waives it.as for abrogation,federal legislation can overcome the states immunity provided congress unequivocally expresses its intent to do so,and acts pursuant to a constitutional provision granting congress the power to abrogate.the first part is undeniable in this case the text explicitly subjects states to fmla claims and the supreme court has determined as much the second part is what matters here did congress have constitutional authority to abrogate the states immunity for purposes of the fmla provision 
the principal source for abrogation authority is of the fourteenth amendment the congress shall have power to enforce,by appropriate legislation,the provisions of this article.as the supreme court has explained,section grants congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees of them,equal protection of the enacting appropriate legislation.
congress enforcement power is not limitless,however.if federal legislation reach es beyond the scope of actual guarantees,it can validly abrogate the states immunity only when it is an appropriate remedy for identified constitutional violations,not an attempt to substantively redefine the states legal obligations.
to pass constitutional muster,legislation must meet the test refined in city of boerne that is,it must counter identified constitutional injuries by the states and exhibit congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.the first prong decides today case,as nothing shows congress was thinking of gender discrimination by the states when it enacted the provision.
the court of appeals concluded congress acted within its authority as the fmla legislative record identified unconstitutional gender bias by the states in the administration of leave benefits according to the court of appeals,congress enacted the provision to counter the stereotype that women utilize leave policies more than men and to protect women from such discrimination 
the court of appeals justified its holding by pointing both to the congressional findings noted in nevada department of human resources and the historical context in which the fmla was enacted.in hibbs,which concerned the act provision,the supreme court held that congress intended the fmla to protect a right guaranteed by the equal protection clause,specifically the right to be free from gender discrimination in the workplace the court reasoned that congress had validly exercised its power to abrogate the states immunity with respect to claims because congress had identified a pattern of gender discrimination on the part of the states notably,the court was careful throughout hibbs to make clear it was deciding the narrow issue of eleventh amendment immunity under the provision,nothing else the court of appeals pointed to hibbs as proof that the supreme court already found that congress had before it sufficient evidence of discrimination in the administration of leave benefits to warrant the enactment of prophylactic legislation.but all the evidence of unconstitutional state conduct cited in hibbs concerned discrimination rooted in the belief that women are more likely than men to take leave to care for other family members,not themselves indeed,the court of appeals recognized that in hibbs there was evidence that the states relied on stereotypes that women family duties trumped their workplace duties,caring for family members is women work,and men do not have the same domestic responsibilities as women such evidence regarding women taking leave to care for others does not equate to evidence regarding women taking leave to care for themselves.in hibbs,the supreme court made clear that congress was required to show evidence of pervasive gender discrimination by the states with regard to family leave the same is required for the provision.we must assess each fmla provision separately,and abrogation of the states immunity under this provision must rest on its own evidentiary basis it can not import evidence from the provision there simply is no in congress findings or elsewhere in the fmla legislative women took more personal medical leave,or were thought to,than men 
the court of appeals also examined the historical context in which the fmla was enacted concluding that congress intentionally included the provision to counter the stereotype that women take more advantage of leave policies than men and to provide women with protection from gender discrimination that might result from legislation providing special protection only for pregnant women 
this argument suffers from myriad flaws.first,there is no evidence that congress,when it enacted the fmla,was any more concerned with providing leave benefits to pregnant women than to all medically eligible employees,no matter their gender second,there is no indication the provision was designed to combat workplace discrimination arising from complications,much less a pattern of such discrimination by the states third,there is no reason to believe the provision would in fact remove any disincentive to hire women that might otherwise result from a provision indeed,if employers are reluctant to hire women because they believe women might become pregnant,or because they believe women take personal leave more frequently than men,then mandating twelve weeks of leave will only reinforce such views and make employers even more disinclined to hire women 
in sum,the legislative record reveals no intention by congress to remedy unconstitutional gender discrimination through the provision nothing links that provision to any pattern of stereotyping by the states as employers.we agree with two states highest courts and nine federal circuit courts that congress lacked the power to invoke its abrogation power under the provision although congress did cite evidence,detailed in hibbs,of pervasive stereotyping about women as family caregivers,that evidence does not extend to the act provision.there is no evidence of similar stereotypes when it comes to personal medical leave the legislative record in fact demonstrates the men and women take leave equally 
in fact,the record indicates two motivations underlying the provision,both unrelated to gender discrimination.first,congress was trying to alleviate economic burdens borne by employees and their families facing job loss second,congress was trying to curb discrimination against any employee with a serious health condition,a term broadly defined to include any illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care at a medical facility or continuing treatment by a health care provider,not just those health conditions wholly or mostly experienced by women nothing in the record connects these two,motivations to unconstitutional workplace injuries inflicted by the states.similarly,the congressional finding most germane to the provision makes no distinction,stating there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods.
because the provision was not intended to combat gender bias by the states,and thus does not satisfy city of boerne first prong,we need not reach prong two regarding congruence and proportionality.summing up congress exceeded its abrogation authority when it subjected the states to suits under the fmla provision.
does utep personnel handbook waive the state immunity 
herrera alternatively argues that even if congress did not abrogate the state immunity,utep clearly and unambiguously waived it through its handbook of operating procedures,which states a n eligible employee may also bring a civil action against an employer for violations of the fmla.we disagree.
utep policy manual certainly mentions employees fmla rights,noting that the fmla makes it unlawful to discharge or discriminate against someone for involvement in proceedings under the act.the handbook also includes the may also bring a civil action sentence,which herrera says plainly permits fmla claims.
this cursory language does not remotely constitute voluntary consent to suit,much less clear and unambiguous consent putting aside the issue of whether utep as opposed to the legislature can waive its immunity by declaration in a handbook utep manual actually reveals nothing about an intent to waive immunity the handbook states that employees may sue for violations of the fmla,but makes no attempt to expand the universe of violations by explicitly waiving immunity that utep otherwise enjoys.indeed,it is impossible to grasp how fleeting language in a policy manual can clearly and unambiguously waive immunity when far more overt declarations in statutes enacted by the legislature fall short 
iii.conclusion 
the state of texas can not be sued under the fmla provision.as for abrogation,nothing in the legislative record suggests that gender bias by the states was the constitutional evil underlying the provision.congress power under the fourteenth amendment to overcome the states immunity is limited,and its attempt to do so here was an unconstitutional exercise of its power.as for waiver,a stray line in utep policy manual that employees may bring a civil action against an employer is insufficient to waive state immunity.the trial court erroneously denied utep plea to the jurisdiction.we reverse the court of appeals judgment and dismiss herrera fmla claim for lack of jurisdiction.
at.because the court of appeals held that sovereign immunity had been abrogated on this ground,it did not address the alternative argument that utep waived its immunity through a statement in its handbook of operating procedures.
