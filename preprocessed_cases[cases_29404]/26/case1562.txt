the governing board of the hilmar unified school district and the hilmar unified school district collectively,the district appeal from a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate directing the district to pay eight teachers who resigned or left their employment at the end of the school year an additional payment of percent of base salary.a payment of percent of base salary had been paid by the district to teachers who returned to work for the school year or retired after the school year.the payment was not made to teachers who resigned or left after the school year.the payment determinations by the district were made in accordance with the express terms of a mediated settlement package reached with the teachers union in september.the trial court held the exclusion of the eight teachers violated the uniform pay provisions of education code section and granted the writ of mandate.
we hold that where a payment to teachers is based upon at least one criterion that is neither years of training nor years of experience,the provisions of subdivision d of government code section apply and,thus,section is not violated.accordingly,we reverse.
procedural background 
the california teachers association cta and the hilmar teachers association hta filed a petition for writ of mandate against the district on november,requesting payment of the retroactive pay to all teachers who worked during the school year,including the eight teachers who left or resigned at the end of the school year.the district filed an opposition to the petition,along with declarations and points and authorities.
on april,a hearing was held at which counsel presented arguments based upon the declarations and exhibits filed with the court.no witnesses testified at the hearing.after the oral argument,the trial court issued its decision granting the writ.the judgment was filed and a peremptory writ of mandate was issued on may.the district filed its notice of appeal on june,seeking reversal of the trial court judgment and entry of a judgment denying the petition for a writ of mandate.
the district,like many school districts throughout california,pays its teachers based on a salary schedule with columns for the number of college units taken above a college degree and with rows or steps for the number of years of teaching experience.the base salary of each teacher is set forth in the cell formed by the intersection on the salary schedule of the row,step,containing his or her number of years of teaching experience and the column containing the number of college units he or she has completed.
during contract negotiations for the school year,the district and the hta reached impasse and,in the fall of,a mediator was appointed pursuant to government code section et to assist the parties in reaching agreement.the district and the hta reached a tentative agreement on salary and other matters for the and the school years 
the president of the hta described the round of bargaining that led to the tentative agreement as long and difficult.the district initially proposed a payment of percent of base salary be made only to teachers who returned to work for the school year.during the negotiations,the representative of the hta represented that the proposal was unacceptable unless the payment also was paid to teachers who retired and expressly acknowledged that the hta was not seeking to have this same payment made to hta members who had otherwise left or resigned their employment with the district at the conclusion of the school year.
the president of the hta stated in her declaration that the hta bargaining team made it clear to all concerned,that any settlement should provide retroactive pay to all persons who taught during the school year and the bargaining team recommended the ratification of the settlement agreement based on our understanding and expressed intent,that all persons who were in the bargaining unit during the school year would receive the retroactive pay.the declaration and rest of the record do not indicate whether all concerned included any representative of the district and,if so,how and when either the position concerning retroactive pay or the understanding and expressed intent of the bargaining team was communicated to a representative of the district.
the final language in the tentative agreement was the result of discussions between ron roberti,a cta staff representative,and attorney paul loya,the district lead negotiator.the tentative agreement was ratified by the members of the hta on september,and approved by the district on september.paragraph of the document titled hilmar unified school district and hilmar teachers association mediated settlement package provides 
the parties agree to a salary schedule increase effective july,and an additional payment of of base salary including strs credit.the payment of of base salary shall be paid only to all current unit members who served in paid status during the school year,including those employees who retired at the conclusion of the school year.extra duty schedules will be increased by effective july,for stipends and upon ratification for hourly rates.
pursuant to the express terms of paragraph of the mediated settlement package hereafter,paragraph,the district made the additional payment of percent of base salary to all certificated employees who had returned to work for the school year or who had retired from work at the conclusion of the school year.the percent payment was not made to eight teachers who left employment with the district at the end of the school year,but did not retire.the eight teachers worked the entire school year for the district but were not current unit members in september.
one of the eight teachers wrote to the district requesting the percent additional pay.the district replied with a letter declining the request.subsequently,a demand letter was sent to the district requesting the percent payment be made to all teachers who were employed during the school year.this demand was rejected by the district based on the language of paragraph conditioning payment on either continued employment or retirement.
the trial court ruled the uniform pay provisions of education code section were violated based on the findings that the teachers had already performed their work for the school year for their classification the payment was calculated after the completion of the school year using the base salary in effect for that school year the payment was retroactive pay and not a bonus and the criteria used to determine eligibility for the payment,teachers who returned or retired versus teachers who left or resigned,was arbitrary and without a reasonable basis.this appeal ensued and raises the issue of whether the additional payment of of base salary hereafter,the payment violated section.
discussion 
i.the mediated settlement package unambiguously excludes the eight teachers from receiving the payment.
the first sentence in paragraph set forth the formula for the amount of the payment,that is,of base salary.the second sentence contained the conditions relating to eligibility for the payment.a recipient was required to be a current unit member who served in paid status during the school year or an employee who retired at the conclusion of the school year.our first step is to provisionally examine all credible extrinsic evidence concerning the parties intentions and determine if paragraph is ambiguous,reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.see winet price th,d.the presence of ambiguity in an agreement is a question of law,not fact,which we determine de novo.ibid.accordingly,in addressing whether paragraph is ambiguous,we review the declarations,with attachments,of the hta president the district representative in negotiations,and others.after this review,we conclude the first two sentences of paragraph are subject to only one reasonable who taught during the school year but were not current unit members at the time the mediated settlement package was approved or did not retire after the school year failed to satisfy the conditions imposed and,therefore,were not eligible to receive of their base salary 
ii.the payment was authorized additional compensation.
we next consider whether or not contractually excluding the eight teachers from receiving the payment was permissible under the relevant statutes.this issue requires the interpretation and application of section and government code section,subdivisions d and e,which govern teachers salary schedules and additional compensation.section,subdivision a,provides in part 
effective july,each person employed by a school district in a position requiring certification qualifications,except a person employed in a position requiring administrative or supervisory credentials,shall be classified on the salary schedule on the basis of uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience,except if a public school employer and the exclusive representative negotiate and mutually agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience pursuant to chapter commencing with section of the government code.employees shall not be placed in different classifications on the schedule,nor paid different salaries,solely on the basis of the respective grade levels in which such employees serve.italics added.
subdivision e of government code section sets forth the following rules relating to salary schedules 
pursuant to section of the education code,the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall,upon the request of either party,meet and negotiate a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.if the public school employer and the exclusive representative do not reach mutual agreement,then the provisions of section of the education code requiring a salary schedule based upon a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience shall apply.a salary schedule established pursuant to this subdivision shall not result in the reduction of the salary of any teacher.italics added.
subdivision d of government code section allows additional compensation to be paid to teachers under certain circumstances 
notwithstanding section of the education code,the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall,upon request of either party,meet and negotiate regarding the payment of additional compensation based upon criteria other than years of training and years of experience.if the public school employer and the exclusive representative do not reach mutual agreement,then the provisions of section of the education code shall apply.italics added.
the district contends the payment was authorized by the exception to the salary uniformity requirements,which permits a school district and teacher union to agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience,subd.a.the hta argues that the payment was not salary or part of a salary schedule.alternatively,the district asserts the theory that the payment was additional compensation permitted by subdivision d of government code section.the hta contends that if the payment is considered additional compensation,it is not saved by the provisions of government code section,subdivision d,because it is not based solely on criteria other than years of training and years of experience.to determine which statutory provisions apply to the payment,this court must decide whether the payment is salary within the meaning of section or additional compensation under government code section,subdivision d.
standard of review 
the standards applicable to appellate review of a trial court interpretation of a statute are well established.appellate courts review statutory interpretations de novo.be western truck exchange th,d.
our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.day city of fontana cal th,d,santa ana unified school dist.orange county development agency th,d.
historical background 
in the,section then empowered school boards to adopt a salary schedule provided it was not arbitrary,discriminatory,or unreasonable and,if an allowance for years of training and years of experience was used,it was required to be uniform and based upon reasonable classifications.see shoban board of trustees d.in the legislature amended section then and greatly reduced the flexibility of school districts in fixing compensation of teachers.the amendment mandated that teachers be classified for salary purposes and required that the classification proceed wholly on a uniform basis of years of training and years of experience.italics in original.palos verdes faculty palos verdes peninsula unified sch.dist.cal d.as amended,section was interpreted to mean that years of education and years of experience were the only criteria that could be used in setting teachers salaries.livingston,supra,d at.
in,the legislature added subdivision d to government code section stats,ch,thereby loosening the interpretation given section and allowing the parties to reach agreement for additional compensation on criteria that are separate from years of training and years of experience.livingston,supra,d at.
in,the uniform salary requirements of section were loosened further by the enactment of senate bill reg.sess.the law existing prior to the enactment of sb was described in an analysis of the senate committee on education considering assembly bill reg.sess.
current law requires that teachers be compensated on the basis of a salary schedule with uniform allowances for years of training generally,coursework and years of experience.
in,the legislature authorized school districts and teachers to collectively bargain additional compensation based on criteria other than years of training and years of experience.however,a series of court decisions have determined that current law does not permit collective bargaining agreements to supersede the uniform salary schedule requirement in any other manner see attached legislative counsel opinion.com.on education,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.
sb amended section by allowing a school district and a teacher union to agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience,subd.a.the legislative counsel digest indicates the exception added to section,together with the addition of government code section,subdivision e,changed law by requiring a public school employer and the exclusive representative,upon the request of either party,to negotiate and mutually agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.stats,ch,leg.counsel digest,pt,west cal.legis.service.
we are not aware of any published decisions that have analyzed subdivision a of section or subdivision e of government code section since the enactment of sb decided,since the july,effective date of subdivision d of government code section,whether or not a payment to teachers was additional compensation or salary or addressed the appropriate test for distinguishing between salary under section and additional compensation under subdivision d of government code section.
