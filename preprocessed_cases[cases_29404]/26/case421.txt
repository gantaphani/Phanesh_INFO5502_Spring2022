david and shannon croft,as parents and next friends of their three minor children collectively,the crofts,bring suit against the governor of the state of texas,rick perry perry,arguing that texas education code d is an unconstitutional establishment of religion.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of perry,holding that d had a secular legislative purpose and was not an establishment of religion.for the following reasons,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
section d provides for a mandatory moment of silence to be observed in texas schools in which a student may as the student chooses,reflect,pray,meditate,or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student.d.the provision,which became effective september,is a subsection of a broader statute amended at the same time under the heading school day pledges of allegiance minute of silence the amendments.texas education code,in its entirety,provides as follows 
a a school day shall be at least seven hours each day,including intermissions and recesses.
b the board of trustees of each school district shall require students,once during each school day at each school in the district,to recite pledges of allegiance to the united states and texas flags 
c on written request from a student parent or guardian,a school district shall excuse the student from reciting a pledge of allegiance under subsection b.
b d a the board of trustees of each school district may shall provide for a period the observance of one minute of silence at the beginning of the first class of each school day at each school in the district following the recitation of the pledges of allegiance to the united states and texas flags under subsection b.during which a during the period,each student may,as the student chooses,reflect,pray,or,or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student.each teacher or other school employee in charge of students during that period shall ensure that each of those students remains silent and does not act in a manner that is likely to interfere with or distract another student.
as the underlined and stricken portions indicate,the amendments changed a statute that was simply entitled school day and provided as follows 
a a school day shall be at least seven hours each day,including intermissions and recesses.
b a school district may provide for a period of silence at the beginning of the first class of each school day during which a student may reflect or meditate.
the statute left untouched a broader,yet related,provision entitled exercise of constitutional right to pray,which states that 
a public school student has an absolute right to individually,voluntarily,and silently pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school.a person may not require,encourage,or coerce a student to engage in or refrain from such prayer or meditation during any school activity.
as the district court noted,the moment of silence provision of differs from the version as follows 
it made the provision of a moment of silence mandatory rather than discretionary it changed period of silence to one minute of silence it added the word pray to the list of designated options it added the or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student and it added a provision for teachers or other school employees to maintain discipline during the period.
croft governor of,d.the statutory section,on the whole,also made the following changes it added the pledge of allegiance to the united states flag it added the pledge of allegiance to the texas state flag and it provided a procedure for exemption from reciting either pledge.
beyond the relative changes and additions represented by the provision itself,the statute does not include a signing statement or preamble by which legislative intent can be inferred.nevertheless,transcripts from committee hearings and floor debates,which were summarized at length by the district court,id.at,provide significant insight into the purpose of the legislation pertinent details are as follows 
on february,in introducing in committee the first draft of senate bill did not include a pledge and was designed to amend the right to pray section,not the school day section its sponsor,senator wentworth,repeatedly stated,since the supreme court has just upheld a similar mandatory statute in virginia we ought at least to give texas students the opportunity to reflect,meditate or pray.the senator acknowledged that a period of silence already existed in texas law under,but expressed a desire to add prayer to bring to the state of texas the advantage and opportunity that virginia students have already.senator wentworth also stated that the bill was prompted by the supreme court ruling upholding a virginia state statute,and that although it may not restore the audible prayer that m ost texans prefer,it is what the supreme court now allows,and all that it allows.as to the minute of silence being required,he thought this would help relieve controversy at the local level.
discussing the original bill,senator wentworth lamented the coarsening of society and the lack of prayer in schools.yet,he repeatedly asserted that,for purposes of legislative intent,this is not a prayer bill it an opportunity to give people a chance to spend seconds on a daily basis to reflect or meditate or pray.he observed,we wo know whether they doing any of those three things t hey may be doing something else,because it is actually seconds of silence.senator janek added that the approach is a more civilized moment for voluntary prayer or meditation rather than the cacophony of the school noises and lockers slamming.
senator wentworth dismissed a challenge to the silent,rather than verbal or physical,nature of voluntary prayer activity in the bill as arguably unconstitutional,and repeatedly stressed his desire to conform to supreme court,i not trying to pass a bill that going to be struck down by the supreme court,and that why i tailored the language to follow another state statute that already been upheld by the supreme court.
in the february committee meeting,concern was raised by legislators about the nature of the bill as an exception to the rights in,and,as the district court recounted,witnesses testified on both sides of this issue and the bill generally.pertinently,kathy douglas of the texas association of school boards suggested that to show the legislative intent to separate this issue from the issue of prayer,the bill might be better suited in amending the school day,not the right to pray.
at a march,committee meeting,senator wentworth announced that the bill had been altered to amend,not as urged by douglas,include pledges to the united states and texas flags with an,and require students to stand.witnesses testified for and against the bill.an amendment was made to delete the rule that students stand,and the bill unanimously passed to in committee.
on april,the related house bill was introduced to the house public education committee by representative branch.according to the governor representations to the district court representative branch stated to the response to challenges from colleagues that the bill was bathed in religio n that silence at the beginning of the day is a good thing for students,and not only to focus on the patriotism of the country,the love of state,but also a common moment of preparation,deliberation,and meditation to focus on the serious business of educating our students that day.representative bonnen added,i can tell you the authors intent i t to give students a time to really thing sic about the seriousness of the day.
on april,the senate bill was debated on the floor.at that debate,several senators raised objections to using the word pray,the mandatory nature of the measure,and that only silent prayer is allowed.senator wentworth stated that this is not a school prayer amendment,this bill came about as the result of my reading a newspaper account last year of the united states supreme court upholding the virginia statute,and s chool districts still will be neutral on religion even if this bill is passed senator lucio added that the pledge helps to teach our kids americanism,patriotism,and to have a moment of silence really gives an opportunity for our children to pray just momentarily to their god and to be thankful that they live in the greatest country in the world.after respective amendments were defeated to revisit the issue in two years and delete the word pray,the bill passed to.
on may,the bill was debated on the house floor.at that time,representative branch asserted that t he primary purpose of is to promote the core values of patriotism and establish a contemplative period that underscores the seriousness of the education endeavor.it directs school districts to provide for the pledge,the texas pledge,that is the pledge to the texas flag,and also a one minute period of silence.
finally,on may,the bill was debated on the house floor.representative hupp offered an amendment to make a minute of silence up to local school boards the amendment was defeated.in support of the bill,representative edwards lamented that a number of undesirable things happened when we took prayer out of school.
in the final house debate on may,the bill sponsor,representative branch,proclaimed that the bill offers an opportunity for the school children to say the pledge,the texas pledge and have this minute of silence when they can do anything they want but it does set the tone for the day that this is serious business,education and that they can contemplate what they plan to do with their day.in responding to a challenge as to the type of activity as limited to silence,representative branch opined,a ll this bill does is tries to have a neutral space,a period of silence i t does direct any activity.he stated further that he understood that a moment of silence which allows for prayer is permissible constitutionally,and that although he might occasionally disagree with the supreme court,he respect s it as the rule of law of the land the bill passed to,with abstention.
the district court reviewed all of the legislative history and upheld the statute.it rejected two of the purposes offered by perry fostering patriotism and accommodation of religion.but the court held that the addition of pray along with other substantive changes to the activities students could engage in,both prior to,and during,the moment of silence did serve a secular purpose of encouraging a period of thoughtful contemplation.croft,d at.as a result,it survived the first prong of lemon.the court also held that the addition of pray did not have the primary effect of advancing religion or cause excessive entanglement between government and religion,and so did not violate the establishment clause.the crofts appeal.
standard of review and applicable law 
the parties dispute the correct standard of review for this case.perry relies on lynch donnelly,d,to argue that a district court findings on legislative purpose should be affirmed unless clearly erroneous.but lynch came to the supreme court following a trial on the merits.see id.at.donnelly lynch.the same appears to be true of the only other case cited by perry,may cooperman,cir referencing a final hearing and the district court making findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of a final judgment.
this case,however,comes to us on the district court grant of summary judgment.therefore,the normal summary judgment standard of review applies.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.miller gorski wladyslaw estate,cir.summary judgment should be rendered if the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the supreme court established a general framework for analyzing establishment clause challenges in lemon kurtzman,d.lemon has three prongs the statute must have a secular legislative purpose its principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion and the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.id.at.internal quotations omitted.in addition,a statute can not discriminate among religious sects without showing a compelling governmental interest and a close fit.see larson valente,d.
in evaluating a secular purpose,it must be sincere a law will not pass constitutional muster if the secular purpose articulated by the legislature is merely a sham.wallace jaffree,d internal quotation marks omitted.but the statute need not have exclusively secular objectives.id.rather,the touchstone is neutrality,and it is only w hen the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion that it violates that central establishment clause value of official religious neutrality.mccreary county aclu,d.in mccreary county,the supreme court reviewed all of the times that it had invalidated a statute because of an illegitimate purpose and determined that i n each case,the government action was held unconstitutional only because openly available data supported a commonsense conclusion that a religious objective permeated the government action.id.at.emphasis added.while the purpose requirement serves an important function,it is rarely determinative.id.at.quotation omitted.this is presumably because government does not generally act unconstitutionally,with the predominant purpose of advancing religion.id.at.
what is important for lemon purpose prong is the overall legislative purpose of the allegedly unconstitutional provision,not a particular legislator motive in supporting it.bd.of educ.of westside cmty.schs.mergens,d.some legislators may have religious motives,but that alone does not invalidate an act with an otherwise secular legislative purpose.see,id.even if some legislators were motivated by a conviction that religious speech in particular was valuable and worthy of protection,that alone would not invalidate the act,because what is relevant is the legislative purpose of the statute,not the possibly religious motives of the legislators who enacted the law.long ago,the supreme court found that the daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance,or even the observance of a moment of reverent silence at the opening of class,may serve the solely secular purposes of the devotional activities without jeopardizing either the religious liberties of any members of the community or the proper degree of separation between the spheres of religion and government.sch.dist.of abington twp.schempp,d.more recently,the supreme court and three circuit courts have heard direct challenges to moment of silence statutes.
in wallace jaffree,the supreme court struck down an alabama statute that had amended an earlier moment of silence statute to add the option for voluntary prayer.at.in wallace,the legislative history was absolutely clear that the statute had the purpose of advancing religion.id.at.the sponsor of the bill stated that it was an effort to return voluntary prayer to public schools,and that the bill had no secular purpose.id.nor did the state present evidence of any secular purpose.id.at.the only substantive change was the addition of or voluntary prayer to a previous statute which mandated a moment of silence for meditation.id.at.the court found that there was no secular purpose for this change,since voluntary prayer was already protected by the previous statute.id.because there was no secular purpose,the statute violated the first prong of lemon and was unconstitutional.id.at.
justice concurred in wallace,but wrote separately to examine moment of silence statutes in more detail.she found that a moment of silence is not inherently religious,and that by mandating such a period,a state does not necessarily endorse any activity that might occur during the period.id.at.even if the statute specifies a student may pray,the state has not thereby encouraged prayer over other specified alternatives.id.at.but if a teacher tells children to pray,or if the face of the statute or legislative history promotes prayer over other alternatives,then the state may be improperly endorsing religion.id.examining legislative purpose,however,is a deferential and limited inquiry,and courts have no license to psychoanalyze the legislators.id.at.if a legislature expresses a plausible secular purpose for a moment of silence statute in either the text or the legislative history then courts should generally defer to that stated intent.id.at.since there is arguably a secular pedagogical value to a moment of silence in public schools,courts should find an improper purpose behind such a statute only if the statute on its face or in its official legislative history suggests it has the primary purpose of endorsing prayer.id.at.in wallace,however,given its legislative history and the fact that no secular purpose was advanced,justice found that the conclusion is unavoidable that the purpose of the statute is to endorse prayer in public schools.id.at.
soon after wallace,the third circuit invalidated a new jersey moment of silence statute.may.the district court in may had found that the new jersey statute,which does not mention prayer,violated all three prongs of lemon.id.at.the third circuit held that there was no violation of the effect or entanglement prongs.id.at.the district court,however,ruling before wallace,had found that the state proffered secular purpose to provide a transition from nonschool life to school life was pretextual.id.at.the third circuit could not say that this finding was clearly erroneous,and so accepted the district court finding that there was no secular purpose.id.at.the third circuit did not find any evidence,however,that the statute was passed to encourage prayer over other alternatives.id.but because the supreme court has expressly required a secular purpose when considering a constitutional challenge under the establishment clause and because the district court made a finding that the statute lacked such a secular purpose,we hold the new jersey statute to be unconstitutional under the first amendment.id.at.
in,the eleventh circuit upheld a georgia moment of silence statute in bown gwinnett county school district,cir.the statute allowed for a moment of silence,but specifically stated that it was not intended to be conducted as a religious service,and a preamble to the act stated that the purpose was to allow a moment of quiet reflection for students.id.at.the legislative history indicated that the sponsor had brought the act forward as part of a package to reduce youth violence.id.at.the legislative transcripts revealed that some house members wanted to institute school prayer and saw the act as accomplishing that goal.id.a few members opposed the act for that reason,although several spoke in favor and stated that they did not believe that it authorized school prayer or had a religious purpose.id.
the bown court first examined the statutory language,and found that the preamble and act espoused a clear secular purpose of allowing a moment of quiet reflection.id.at.while the court noted that the legislative history was somewhat conflicting,it held that it was not inconsistent with this secular purpose.id.at.even though some of the legislators may have indeed had religious motives,the language of the statute revealed a clearly secular purpose,which satisfied the first lemon prong.id.at.the court also found that there was no impermissible effect of the statute or any resulting excessive entanglement of the state with religion.id.at.
in,the fourth circuit upheld a virginia moment of silence statute in brown gilmore,cir.in,virginia enacted a moment of silence statute which authorized,but did not require,schools to observe a moment of silence where students could meditate,pray,or engage in any other silent activity.id.at.the virginia legislature later amended the statute in to require that every school provide the minute of silence.id.at.in analyzing the legislative purpose,the fourth circuit first examined its text and found two secular purposes to promote meditation and to accommodate religion.id.at.the court held that a statute having dual legitimate clearly secular and one the accommodation of run afoul of the first lemon prong.id.at.nor did the statute facially violate the second prong of lemon given the statute facial neutrality between religious and nonreligious modes of introspection and other silent activity.id.the court also did not find an excessive entanglement,holding that the involvement in religion is negligible,with the teacher only informing students that one of the permissible options during the moment of silence is prayer.id.at.
in all four of these cases,none of the courts found that moment of silence statutes had the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion,or fostered excessive government entanglement with religion.all of the courts focused on the legislative purpose of these statutes.wallace overturned the alabama statute because the state did not advance any secular purpose,and the statute sponsor explicitly stated that the statute was meant to bring prayer back into schools.may overturned the new jersey statute because the district court had found that the proffered secular purpose was pretextual.that finding was not clearly erroneous,and with no other secular reasons offered,the third circuit was compelled to find the statute unconstitutional.all of these cases follow the supreme court assertion in mccreary that statutes have only been overturned on the purpose prong of lemon if a religious purpose permeated the government action or the secular purpose serves only as a sham.
discussion 
constitutional standing has three elements an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and the likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the alliance defense fund adf amicus brief and perry argue that the crofts have not stated any sufficient injury,and so lack standing to bring this case.
the loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.elrod burns,d.the question then becomes whether the crofts have alleged a personal loss of first amendment freedoms.it is not enough simply to argue that there has been some violation of the establishment clause they must allege a personal violation of rights valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.
the crofts have children who are required to observe a moment of silence every day they attend school.the crofts complaint alleges that the moment of silence statute violates the establishment clause and that their children constitutional rights are being violated by being required to undergo the moment of silence.perry argues that the crofts have not alleged any specific injury that resulted from participating in the moment of silence.
in doe tangipahoa parish school board,cir en banc,the fifth circuit evaluated standing in an establishment clause context.the plaintiffs were challenging prayers said at school board meetings,and the court found that unless they could prove that they were exposed to and injured by those prayers,they lacked standing.id.at.because there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had ever attended a school board meeting,however,they could not prove any injury from the prayers.id.at.the plaintiff bears the burden to prove standing with the manner and degree of evidence required at successive stages of the litigation.id.at quoting lujan,at.but the doe court specifically noted that they could certainly assume that the does may have been offended by an invocation at a school board meeting,if they attended one.id.after a bench trial based on stipulations,however,the does had brought forward no evidence that they had ever attended a school board meeting and heard the offending prayer,so they lacked standing.id.
at this stage of plaintiffs burden on standing is only to raise an issue of material fact.the crofts have alleged that their children are enrolled in texas public schools and are required to observe the moment of silence daily.perry does not dispute this fact,and while still a party,the school district admitted in its answer that the crofts children attended school there.the crofts children are definitely present for the moment of silence,and like in doe,we can assume that they or their parents have been they would not be challenging the law.that is enough to establish standing at this stage of the suit.
the adf amicus claims that a moment of silence can not violate the establishment clause,as there is no active religious component.but that is a question to be determined on the merits,which must come after determining whether we have jurisdiction to hear the case.see,plains commerce bank long family land cattle,d w e bear an independent obligation to assure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits.because the crofts have claimed a personal violation of their first amendment rights,we have jurisdiction to determine on the merits whether those rights have in fact been violated.
establishment clause 
in his brief,perry advances three secular purposes for the amendments fostering patriotism,providing a period for thoughtful contemplation,and protecting religious freedom.the amendments changed the way that every schoolchild in texas begins the day.they provide for the recitation of the pledges of allegiance to the flags of the united states and texas,followed by a minute of silence for students to reflect,pray,meditate,or engage in any other silent activity.on its face,the statute seems to serve two of the above purposes of fostering patriotism for both america and the state of texas,and of providing a period for thoughtful contemplation.from the statutory language alone,it does not appear that the legislative purpose in adding the term pray to d is to advance religion,particularly since the bill expressly allows for any silent use of the moment of silence,either religious or.
regarding the third stated purpose,of protecting religious freedom,this purpose does not appear on the face of the statute.while the option to pray is included in the amendments,texas already had a statute specifically stating that students have an absolute right to silently pray or meditate in school.any purpose of protecting religious freedom was already accomplished by this earlier statute.there is also no burden on free exercise rights that the amendments protect against,and so protecting religious freedom does not seem to be a valid purpose on the face of the statute.see wallace,at.i t is undisputed that there was no governmental practice impeding students from silently praying for one minute at the beginning of each schoolday thus,there was no need to accommodate or to exempt individuals from any general governmental requirement because of the dictates of our cases interpreting the free exercise clause.
prior to the amendments,texas already had a moment of silence statute that allowed districts to provide for a period of silence where students might reflect or meditate.b.the amendments,however,include several substantive changes such as the addition of the pledges,making the moment of silence mandatory,establishing the indefinite period as one minute,and allowing students to pray or engage in any other silent activity.this case is thus somewhat different than wallace,where the supreme court found that the only substantive change was the addition of the words or voluntary prayer.at.as such,we must consider all of the substantive changes in evaluating the purpose behind the amendments.
the crofts focus on the addition of the word pray without examining the other changes.but the amendments were introduced as a package to change the start of every school day to include the pledges of allegiance and a more comprehensive list of appropriate activities during the minute of silence itself changed from a period of silence in fact,during the legislative process,it was purposefully changed from being a bill that amended the exercise of a right to pray to being one that amended the beginning of the school day.this is not an omnibus bill with provisions that have little to no relation to one another.the crofts do not point to any case law requiring us to parse the legislature intent so finely as to go word by word looking for religious purpose.in wallace,the only reason that the supreme court focused solely on the addition of prayer was because that was the only substantive change in the amendment that affected the children at issue.at.conversely,in bown,the eleventh circuit considered as indicative of legislative purpose that the bill was brought forward as part of a legislative package aimed at reducing youth violence.at.here,we have multiple substantive changes altering the beginning of every texas public school day,including the option to engage in any other silent activity during the moment of silence.d emphasis added.we consider the purpose of the amendment,including the addition of the word pray,in this context.
from the bill text,the obvious purpose of the pledges is to inculcate patriotism among students.following the pledges with a minute of silence then allows time for reflection before starting the school day.thus,at least from the statutory text,it seems that the purpose of the amendments is to foster patriotism and provide for a period,if a student so desires,of thoughtful contemplation.within this context,the purpose of d is clearly permissible.in addition to adding pray,the new text adds engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student.the neutral,purpose of providing examples of permissible silent activities during the minute of silence at the start of a now more organized and contemplative school day is buttressed further by the fact that,which still provides that a person may not require,encourage,or coerce a student prayer,was intentionally left unamended.
the legislative history generally supports these secular purposes unlike in wallace,where the sponsoring state senator stated that his sole purpose for the bill at issue was an effort to return voluntary prayer to the public schools,at.internal quotation marks omitted,the supporting legislators in texas,particularly in the house debates,emphasized the need for an opportunity to begin the school day with patriotic pledges and a reflective moment.in may,the third circuit rejected the transition from nonschool life to school life as a pretext,citing district court findings about a lack of pedagogical support and a history of legislative efforts to return prayer to the public schools.at.here,there is no pedagogical evidence to rebut legislative intent,there are no relevant district court findings on which to defer,and there is no evidence of a steady prayer in schools effort.
although senator wentworth and at least one house member cited lack of prayer in schools in lamenting various societal ills,he repeatedly emphasized that for purposes of legislative intent,this is not a prayer bill.the house sponsors also emphasized the purposes of the law even more consistently.on the whole,the debates suggest a history more similar to bown and brown,where several reasons,including the return to prayer but also purely secular ones such as a reflective moment,were given in support of the pertinent legislation and passed constitutional scrutiny.see brown,at bown,at.indeed,the wallace court noted that even though a statute is motivated in part by a religious purpose it may still satisfy the lemon test.brown,at quoting wallace,at.even if some legislators had religious motives in promoting this legislation,there are clear secular legislative purposes present.this is unlike wallace or may,where there were really no secular purposes at all.
finally,unlike alabama campaign of defiance in wallace,as the fourth circuit described it in brown,at,and new jersey history of other less facially neutral efforts to return prayer to the public schools in may,at,the effort in texas was an isolated one to conform to current law,as the legislature saw it.the legislative history repeatedly indicates that the statute at hand was the direct product of the success of the virginia statute in brown.in adding
