discussion 
on the day of the incident,appellant was years old,a student at rio hondo community college,and a player on that college baseball team.on that date,he played in a game against citrus college,at the citrus college field.he was hit in the head with a citrus college pitch which was thrown with such force that it cracked his helmet.he alleged,inter alia,that the pitch was thrown in a deliberate attempt to retaliate for a rio hondo pitch which hit a citrus college player.
appellant staggered,felt dizzy,and felt pain.the citrus college coaching staff did not tend to him or summon medical care.the rio hondo coach told appellant to go to first base.he did so,and when he complained to the first base coach he was told to stay in the game.at second base,he still felt pain,numbness,and dizziness.a citrus player yelled to the rio hondo dugout that rio hondo needed a new runner.appellant walked off the field and went to the rio hondo bench.his injuries were not tended to.
appellant alleged that citrus college was negligent in that it failed to summon or provide medical care for him when he was obviously in need of medical care,failed to supervise and control the citrus college pitcher and the game,failed to provide umpires or other supervisory personnel to control the game and prevent retaliatory or reckless pitching,and failed to provide adequate equipment to safeguard him from serious head injury.finally,appellant alleged that citrus college acted negligently by failing to take reasonable steps to train and supervise managers,trainers,employees and agents in providing medical care to injured baseball players and by conducting an illegal preseason practice game in violation of community college baseball rules designed to protect participants such as appellant.
in its demurrer,citrus college contended that it was protected by section,subdivision a,which provides that neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable to any person who participates in a hazardous recreational activity for any damage or injury to property or persons arising out of that hazardous recreational activity.hazardous recreational activity is defined in the statute.it means a recreational activity conducted on property of a public entity which creates a substantial as distinguished from a minor,trivial,or insignificant risk of injury to a participant or a spectator,subd.b.
citrus college also contended that under ochoa california state university th,d,it had no duty.
our opinion here is limited to those two issues.
appellant relies on acosta los angeles unified school dist.th,d and iverson muroc unified school dist.th,d to argue that the statute does not immunize school districts for injuries sustained in school sponsored and supervised activities.respondent relies on ochoa california state university,supra,th,d,which held that acosta and iverson have no bearing on the liability of colleges to adult students.we consider each of the cases in turn,and conclude that acosta and iverson have it right,and that the statute does not immunize community college districts for negligence to students in connection with school sponsored and supervised sports.
acosta and iverson 
in acosta,supra,th,d,a member of a high school gymnastics team was injured during a practice supervised by his coach.he sued the school district,which asserted section immunity.the court began its analysis by citing the california law that a school district has a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising students engaged in extracurricular activities and by observing that if the term hazardous recreational activity is interpreted to include school sponsored and supervised activities,schools would be immune from liability for the negligent supervision of students engaged in virtually every extracurricular sport,football,basketball,baseball,gymnastics,soccer,wrestling,as well as activities which are often part of a school physical education program such as archery and trampolining t his would constitute a major revision of california law with respect to school district tort liability.id.at,d.
the court chose not to make that major revision of law,and its reasoning is well worth quoting at length a court will not conclude the legislature intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.citation.nowhere in section or its legislative history is there an express declaration the legislature intended to immunize school districts from liability resulting from negligent supervision of extracurricular activities in general or athletics in particular.nor is such immunity conferred by necessary implication.under section a school district would not be liable for purely recreational activities which happen to be conducted on school property.yarber oakland unified school dist.th at d school district immune from liability under for injury to player in adult community basketball league using gym after school hours.however,we believe a clear distinction exists between allowing the public to use school facilities after hours,on weekends or during vacations and athletic practices under the supervision of school personnel after school or during the.id.at,d.
acosta held that as a matter of law,school sponsored and supervised extracurricular athletic activities are not hazardous recreational activities under the statute.id.at,d.
in iverson,supra,th,d,the plaintiff was a junior high school student injured during a soccer match conducted as part of a gym class.iverson agreed with acosta that application of section to a school physical education program would constitute a major revision of california tort law,noting that school districts have a duty to supervise children.iverson analysis sets forth the legislative history the bill was proposed and supported by park and recreation districts,municipalities,and similar entities which wanted to keep their land open to recreational users but sought some protection against increasing numbers of personal injury actions by public property users engaging in such activities as hang gliding and rock climbing,and attendant escalating insurance rates.the senate judiciary committee analysis noted that the primary purpose of this bill is to prevent the hang glider or rock climber from suing a public entity when that person injured himself in the course of the activity.iverson,supra,th at,d.
iverson held that a body contact sport incorporated into a school time physical education class is not a recreational activity within the meaning of section,subdivision a hazardous as that activity may be in the abstract.we hold,as a matter of law,that section is inapplicable in the context of the injuries incurred sustained on school grounds during a physical education class required by the school and conducted during school hours.iverson,supra,th at,d.
in the case respondent cites,ochoa california state university,supra,th,d,the plaintiff was a student at california state university,sacramento.who played intramural soccer on a student team representing a dormitory.the game was run under the auspices of a nonprofit corporation called associated students,a corporate entity distinct from cal state,and primarily funded by student fees.the referees and the student supervisor who oversaw them were employees of associated students.
the plaintiff was punched in the jaw during a game which ended in combative behavior.he sued cal state in tort,alleging that it negligently failed to supervise the game.cal state successfully raised section immunity.
ochoa essentially based its holding on its finding that under california law,colleges and universities have no duty to supervise the activities of their adult students.the cases ochoa cited in support of that proposition are crow state of california d,and baldwin zoradi d.neither case concerns sports teams or the duty of coaches or trainers to supervise games or to provide medical care to students injured during sports events.neither case concerns section.instead,both cases concern student drinking and criminal behavior.
in crow state of california,supra,d,the plaintiff was a student who was punched and kicked by a drunken at a keg party in a dormitory.the lawsuit alleged that the university negligently operated,maintained,and supervised the dormitory.id.at.the court found that the essential question was the university liability for the criminal acts of a third party,that there is no such liability without a special relationship,and that the relationship was not such a special relationship.the court noted that the plaintiff before it was an adult college student voluntarily drinking beer at the dormitory,and that there was no allegation that the university should have known of any particular risk of harm at that dormitory.id.at.crow also relied on baldwin zoradi,supra,d,and quoted it at length.
in that case,a group of cal poly students drank great amounts of alcohol,then raced their cars,with predictably tragic results.the plaintiff was a student who was a passenger in one of those cars.she sued the trustees of the california state university,alleging that they had permitted the students to possess and consume alcohol and failed to control those students.the court used a rowland christian cal d,analysis and found that the trustees had no duty of care to prevent the injuries.in the portions of the opinion quoted in crow,baldwin noted that colleges no longer acted in loco parentis,and no longer controlled student morals or alcohol use.id.at.
we believe that extending section immunity to the facts alleged here would as acosta and iverson held concerning the facts of those cases go well beyond the intent of the legislature and constitute an unwarranted change in california tort law.
in finding that section applied to the facts before it,ochoa relied on cases which concerned a college or university in loco parentis duty to supervise student drinking and student dormitories,not the facts here.ochoa itself concerned a student brawl,albeit one which began at a student soccer game,and the game in question was not school organized or supervised,but instead was organized by a student organization and supervised by that organization employees.
in contrast,this case involves allegations that the game was school sponsored and school supervised,and that those supervisors failed to supervise properly or to provide medical assistance to a student injured in the game.the rule relevant to those facts is that coaches and instructors owe a duty of due care to persons in their charge.tan goddard th,d duty of instructor to student at a riding school galardi seahorse riding club th,d riding instructor had a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to plaintiff.we see nothing in section which constitutes anything like an express declaration or necessary implication acosta,supra,th at,d that the legislature wished to change that rule.
nor do we see that,when supervision of sports is concerned,there is any meaningful difference between a high school supervising a teenager gymnastics practice and a community college supervising a teenager baseball game.section was intended to prevent users of public land who chose to engage in hazardous activities such as from suing public entities when they got hurt.it was not intended to affect the relationship between schools and their students 
in its demurrer,citrus college contended that it had no duty to supervise appellant or any other student in the game,citing ochoa,supra,th,d.the question ochoa considered was whether colleges or universities had a duty to protect students from the criminal acts of third parties.the court noted that the usual rule is nonliability for the criminal conduct of a third party absent special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant which imposed a duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from the type of harm that occurred.id.at,d.ochoa found no such special relationship,and that general tort law and public policy militated against creation of a duty.ochoa also reviewed the rowland christian cal d,factors and reached the same result.
we have no quarrel with ochoa holding,but do not find that it resolves the question before us,which is not liability for the criminal conduct of third parties.instead,the complaint includes a variety of allegations against citrus college,including the allegations that appellant was injured by citrus college failure to exercise reasonable care to protect him from the harm he alleged,under the circumstances set out in the complaint.
we conduct a rowland analysis to determine whether citrus college had a duty to protect the plaintiff from the harm alleged in the complaint.
rowland began by noting the general principle that a person is liable for injuries caused by his failure to exercise reasonable care in the circumstances.rowland christian,supra,cal at,see.it went on to hold that a departure from this fundamental principle involves the balancing of a number of considerations the major ones are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.id.at.
we find that the factors militate toward a finding of duty.it is surely foreseeable that a student might be injured if supervision is lax or at a sports event,and if medical care is not summoned when any injury occurs.it is also easy to conclude that future harm to students might be prevented if sports games were to be properly supervised and equipped and managers and other school employees whom the school has made present at the game are trained to provide or summon medical care.
lax supervision of a student sports event is not perhaps the most blameworthy conduct.however,reasonably read,the complaint alleges that citrus college coaches could have,but did not,prevent or ameliorate the injury which occurred,so that the moral blame factor must be decided in favor of duty.we find,too,that on this demurrer,the factor concerning the connection between citrus college conduct and appellant injury must also be decided in favor of duty.
the final two factors,concerning availability of insurance and the burden to the defendant,are more problematic,since the record contains no evidence on either factor and the briefs contain no argument.ochoa found that the cost of insurance would be extraordinary and that the likely consequence would be that colleges would abandon intramural sports.ochoa,supra,th at,d.that might be true under the facts of ochoa,where the issue concerned a duty to prevent crime,a very difficult task indeed,but those are not the facts alleged here.nothing in our understanding of colleges and sports makes it seem likely that a finding of duty here would cause insurance premiums to rise astronomically or schools to abandon sports.
