the supreme court held in christian legal society chapter of the university of california,hastings college of the law martinez that a public law school does not violate the constitution when it condition s its official recognition of a student group and the attendant use of school funds and facilities on the organization agreement to open eligibility for membership and leadership to all students.the court referred to the open membership requirement as an policy and concluded that such a policy was a reasonable,condition on access to the forum.id.the court further held that the policy did not violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment.id.at.
the court expressly declined to address whether these holdings would extend to a narrower nondiscrimination policy that,instead of prohibiting all membership restrictions,prohibited membership restrictions only on certain specified bases,for example,race,gender,religion,and sexual orientation.see id.at.the constitutionality of such a policy is the issue before us in this case.we conclude that the narrower policy is constitutional.we hold,however,that plaintiffs have raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the narrower policy was selectively enforced in this particular case,thereby violating plaintiffs rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.we affirm in part and reverse in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
plaintiffs are alpha delta chi,a christian sorority,and alpha gamma omega,a christian fraternity,as well as several of their officers,at san diego state university san diego state in california 
alpha delta chi,the sorority,has several religious requirements for its members,including personal acceptance of jesus christ as savior and lord,active participation in christian service,and regular attendance or membership in an evangelical church.
alpha gamma omega,the fraternity,requires its members to sincerely want to know jesus christ as their lord and savior,and its officers must sign a statement of faith reading 
i hearby publicly confess my belief in the lord jesus christ as god and only savior and give witness to the regenerating power of the holy spirit in my life.
i will make it a purpose of my life to continue in fellowship with god through prayer and reading of the holy scriptures.
alpha gamma omega officers beliefs and practices must be consistent with orthodox christian beliefs.
plaintiffs have repeatedly submitted applications for official recognition in san diego state student organization program.there are approximately officially recognized student organizations at san diego state.san diego state requires these groups to submit a signed student organization on campus recognition application,and recognition must be renewed each year.officially recognized student organizations receive a number of benefits,such as university funding,use of san diego state name and logo,access to campus office space and meeting rooms,free publicity in school publications,and participation in various special university events.officially recognized groups may set up informational tables and banners in the student union and participate in various events for recruiting new members.further,officially recognized fraternities and sororities may be members of one of four fraternity and sorority councils,which grants them access to recruitment fairs,leadership conferences,and social activities organized by the councils.
each time plaintiffs have applied for official recognition,they have been denied by san diego state administrators because of plaintiffs requirement that their members and officers profess a specific religious belief,namely,christianity.these membership requirements conflict with san diego state nondiscrimination policy,which san diego state requires all officially recognized student organizations to include in their bylaws.the policy states 
status will not be granted to any student organization whose application is incomplete or restricts membership or eligibility to hold appointed or elected student officer positions in the chapter or group on the basis of race,sex,color,age,religion,national origin,marital status,sexual orientation,physical or mental handicap,ancestry,or medical condition,except as explicitly exempted under federal law.
this policy reflects the california state university system non discrimination regulation,which states 
no campus shall recognize any fraternity,sorority,living group,honor society,or other student organization which discriminates on the basis of race,religion,national origin,ethnicity,color,age,gender,marital status,citizenship,sexual orientation,or disability.the prohibition on membership policies that discriminate on the basis of gender does not apply to social fraternities or sororities or to other university living groups.
because plaintiffs were denied official recognition by san diego state,they were denied the benefits of official recognition.they still may hand out flyers and post signs to recruit new members,but only in areas open to all groups,whether recognized or not,such as the free speech steps of the student union and the wall next to the university bookstore.plaintiffs still may use university rooms for meetings and events,but not for free or at reduced prices,as officially recognized groups are able to do.
plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court challenging san diego state nondiscrimination policy under the first and fourteenth amendments.plaintiffs and defendants filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment on all counts in defendants favor while denying plaintiffs motion.plaintiffs appeal from that judgment.

discussion 
free speech and freedom of expressive association 
plaintiffs argue that san diego state requirement that they comply with the nondiscrimination policy forces them to accept members who will significantly impair the message plaintiffs joined together to promote.appellants br.at.this,plaintiffs claim,violates their first amendment right to expressive association plaintiffs also argue that san diego state has excluded them from an expressive forum on the basis of their religious viewpoint,in violation of their free speech rights.
the parties in their briefs disagree as to the proper standard of review for these claims.after the briefs were filed,however,the supreme court decided christian legal society,which held that when a university excludes a student organization from official recognition for refusing to comply with the school nondiscrimination policy,both freedom of speech and freedom of expressive association challenges are properly analyzed under the doctrine.at w e are persuaded that our precedents adequately respect both the student group speech and rights,and fairly balance those rights against the university interests as property owner and educational institution.
a limited public forum is government property opened for use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.id.at quoting pleasant grove city summum,d.in a limited public forum,the government may impose restrictions that are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,so long as the government does not discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint.rosenberger rector visitors of of,d internal quotation marks omitted.
christian legal society held that a law school student organization program is a limited public forum.at.plaintiffs attempt to distinguish that case,contending that san diego state student organization program is not a limited public forum,but a designated public forum.a designated public forum is government property open ed for indiscriminate public use for communicative purposes.lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d.speech in a designated public forum has significantly greater protection than speech in a limited public forum restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are subject to strict scrutiny and,therefore,must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.christian legal soc y.at quoting pleasant grove city.at.
we see no material distinction between san diego state student organization program and the student organization program discussed in christian legal society and,therefore,conclude that san diego state program is also a limited public forum.like san diego state,the university in christian legal society provided benefits to student groups within its program,such as financial assistance access to university newsletters,bulletin boards,and meeting rooms and the use of the university name and logo.id.at.in exchange,the student groups agreed to abide by certain conditions,including an approval process and the school nondiscrimination policy.id.thus,both the program in christian legal society and san diego state program are not open for indiscriminate public use,lamb chapel,at,but are instead limited to certain groups student organizations which is the hallmark of a limited public forum,see christian legal soc y.at.the fact that both the school in christian legal society and san diego state require student groups to obtain university approval is further indication that the student organization programs are limited public forums.see faith ctr.church evangelistic ministries glover,cir requiring prior permission for access to a forum demonstrates that a public forum has not been created by designation,abrogated on other grounds by winter natural res.def.council,d.
because we conclude that san diego state student organization program is a limited public forum,we apply the same analysis to both plaintiffs free speech and expressive association claims plaintiffs exclusion from san diego state student organization program is permissible if san diego state requirement that student groups adhere to the nondiscrimination policy is reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum and viewpoint neutral.at.
reasonableness 
in truth kent school district,we held that a high school requirement that student organizations comply with a nondiscrimination policy was a reasonable restriction in light of the purpose of the school student organization program,cir,cert.denied,d and,d,overruled on other grounds by los angeles county humphries,d.the policy prohibited the school and,by extension,student organizations officially approved by the school from discriminating on various grounds such as race,gender,and religion.id.at.
to determine whether this policy was reasonable in light of the purpose of the student organization program,we looked to the program constitution.id.at.the constitution listed various purposes for the program,including developing good citizenship,promoting harmonious relationships,facilitating student and faculty expression,and encouraging students to obey,honor,and sustain state and local laws and school rules.id.we read these broad statements of purpose to mean that the purpose of the student organization program was to advance the school basic pedagogical goals.id.we then noted that the supreme court had emphasized that part of a school mission is to instill in students the shared values of a civilized social order,which includes instilling the value of.id.quoting hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d.thus,we concluded that the school nondiscrimination policy aligned with the school pedagogical goals and was a reasonable limitation in light of the purpose of the student organization program.see id.
as in truth,we look to san diego state student organizations handbook to determine the purpose of the student organization program.the section of the handbook entitled principles of community is filled with references to diversity and nondiscrimination underlying san diego state educational goals are basic values that include freedom from discrimination we affirm our positive commitment toward diversity we encourage every student organization to make a conscious effort to undertake recruitment efforts to ensure diversity within the group membership and to take steps to reach populations currently underrepresented.no organization will direct recruitment toward any one group,ethnic,gender,of potential members we challenge you to express yourself in a manner that promotes and maintains the ideals of respect,equality,diversity,and freedom from harassment.
these statements make clear that one of the intended purposes of san diego state student organization program is to promote diversity and nondiscrimination.these statements are far more explicit than the broad statements of purpose in truth the statements in truth did not expressly mention nondiscrimination.see at.requiring student groups to adhere to a nondiscrimination policy is reasonable in light of san diego state intended purpose.
also relevant to the analysis of reasonableness is whether plaintiffs have alternative avenues of communication besides the forum from which they have been excluded.in christian legal society,the supreme court found the university nondiscrimination policy all the more creditworthy because the plaintiffs in that case still had many avenues for expressing their message.at.the university offered the plaintiffs access to meeting facilities,chalkboards,and generally available bulletin boards.id.the court noted that,although the plaintiffs were denied use of the student organization program special means of communication,the advent of electronic media and sites reduces the importance of those channels.id.the court specifically cited references to internet message groups,email,websites,google,and myspace.id.the court deemed the availability of other means of communication significant to analysis.id.
as in christian legal society,san diego state allows groups like plaintiffs to use campus facilities for meetings,to set up tables and displays in public areas,and to distribute literature.plaintiffs also have access to all the electronic resources mentioned by the supreme court,as well as new resources invented since then.thus,san diego state policy should be deemed as creditworthy as the policy in christian legal society.
therefore,san diego state nondiscrimination policy is reasonable in light of the student organization program purpose of promoting diversity and nondiscrimination 
viewpoint neutrality 
plaintiffs contend that san diego state nondiscrimination policy,as written,discriminates against plaintiffs viewpoint.alternatively,plaintiffs argue that,even if the nondiscrimination policy is viewpoint neutral on its face,san diego state has applied it in a discriminatory fashion,exempting some groups from the policy while requiring other groups to comply with it.we find that the policy is viewpoint neutral as written,but that there are triable issues of fact as to whether san diego state has selectively enforced its nondiscrimination policy.
the nondiscrimination policy as written 
viewpoint discrimination is an egregious form of content discrimination,and occurs when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction on speech.truth,at ellipsis in original quoting rosenberger,at.a restriction on speech is unconstitutional if it is an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.however,a restriction that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression and only incidentally burdens some speakers,messages,or viewpoints,is deemed neutral.christian legal soc y.at quoting ward rock against racism,d.we thus look to the government purpose as the threshold consideration.madsen women health,d.
in the context of a student organization program,the supreme court has made clear that an policy that requires all student groups to accept all members does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.christian legal soc y.at.such a policy is justified without reference to the content or viewpoint of the regulated speech.id.at alteration in original quoting ward,at.the requirement draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that the reasoning and holding of christian legal society do not apply,however,when a school policy prohibits only certain membership requirements,such as those based on race,gender,or religion,rather than prohibiting all membership requirements,as an policy does.the more limited nondiscrimination policy at issue in this case,plaintiffs argue,discriminates on the basis of viewpoint because it allows secular discrimination while prohibiting religious discrimination.for example,under this more limited policy,a student republican organization could permissibly exclude democrats because the policy does not forbid discrimination on the basis of political belief,but a christian group could not exclude a muslim student because that would discriminate on the basis of religious belief.
indeed,san diego state stipulates that some officially recognized student groups at the university restrict membership to those who believe in the group purpose,or agree with the particular ideology,belief,or philosophy the group seeks to promote.for example,the immigrant rights coalition requires members to hold the same values regarding immigrant rights as the organization.the san diego socialists at san diego state require students to be in agreement with our purpose.the hispanic business student association opens membership to those who support the goals and objectives of the organization.plaintiffs argue that san diego state is discriminating against their viewpoint by allowing these secular groups to discriminate on the basis of belief,while prohibiting plaintiffs from doing so on the basis of their religious beliefs.
plaintiffs argument,while seemingly compelling at first glance,does not survive closer scrutiny.we accept plaintiffs assertion that san diego state nondiscrimination policy incidentally burdens groups that wish to exclude others on the basis of religion,but does not burden groups that do not exclude or exclude on bases not prohibited by the policy.but this assertion is insufficient to prove viewpoint discrimination,because plaintiffs have put forth no evidence that san diego state implemented its nondiscrimination policy for the purpose of suppressing plaintiffs viewpoint,or indeed of restricting any sort of expression at all.see truth,at upholding high school requirement that plaintiff student group comply with nondiscrimination regulations because group ha d not shown that the school district justifie d its policies with reference to the content of the group message.
san diego state asserts that the purpose of its policy,which closely tracks the nondiscrimination policy applied to the entire california state university system,is to prevent discrimination and to ensure that the school resources are open to all interested students without regard to special protected classifications.appellees br.at.as the supreme court has made clear,antidiscrimination laws intended to ensure equal access to the benefits of society serve goals unrelated to the suppression of expression and are neutral as to both content and viewpoint.roberts jaycees,d holding that a state law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race,color,creed,religion,disability,national origin,or sex does not aim at the suppression of speech and does not distinguish between prohibited and permitted activity on the basis of viewpoint hurley irish am.gay,lesbian bisexual grp.of boston,d stating that a public accommodations law forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and other grounds did not,on its face,target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content,the focal point of its prohibition being rather on the act of discriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods,privileges,and services on the proscribed grounds.like the laws challenged in roberts and hurley,san diego state nondiscrimination policy does not target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content,but instead serves to remove access barriers imposed against groups that have historically been excluded.
we reached a similar conclusion in truth,a case with facts very close to those of the instant case.in truth,we held that a high school student organization program did not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint when it denied access to a religious student group for refusing to comply with a nondiscrimination policy prohibiting exclusion on enumerated grounds.at.like alpha delta chi and alpha gamma omega,the student group in truth required its members to be christian,which violated the school district nondiscrimination policy prohibiting discrimination based on race,creed,color,national origin,sex,marital status,previous arrest,incarceration,or physical,sensory or mental disabilities.id.at,ellipsis in original.the student group in truth challenged its exclusion from the student organization program as a violation of various constitutional and statutory provisions,including its first amendment rights of free speech and expressive association.id.at.
we held that the school nondiscrimination policy in truth was neutral as to content and viewpoint id.at.while acknowledging that the student group may have been attempting to convey a message via its discriminatory conduct,we found that the student group ha d not shown that the school district justifie d its policies with reference to the content of that message.id.at.we concluded that the school denying the plaintiff student group access to the student organization program was based on the student group discriminatory membership criteria,not the religious content of the speech.id.at.thus,the school was not denying the religious student group access based solely on its religious viewpoint,but rather on its refusal to comply with the school district nondiscrimination policy.id.at.truth,along with roberts and hurley,compels the conclusion that san diego state nondiscrimination policy is neutral as to content and viewpoint.
it is true that antidiscrimination laws can nonetheless violate the first amendment right of expressive association when used to force a private group to accept members who materially interfere with the message the group wishes to express.see boy scouts of am.dale,d hurley,at.plaintiffs argue that requiring them to accept into their groups forces them to say what they do not want to say.appellants br.at.were san diego state compelling plaintiffs to include,plaintiffs might have a sound argument.but as christian legal society makes clear,there is a difference between policies that require action and those that withhold benefits.at.the supreme court declined to apply the line of expressive association cases including dale and hurley in the context of a student organization program,because the university was not forcing student groups to accept unwanted members,but only conditioning certain benefits on the adoption of a nondiscrimination policy.id.instead,the court analyzed the plaintiffs first amendment challenge under the doctrine,which permits reasonable restrictions on expression so long as they are viewpoint neutral.id.at.under this reasoning,san diego state reasonable and requirement that recognized student groups comply with its nondiscrimination policy does not violate plaintiffs right to expressive association.plaintiffs are free to express any message they wish,and may include or exclude members on whatever basis they like they simply can not oblige the university to subsidize them as they do so.
again,we do not doubt that,regardless of san diego state purpose in enacting its nondiscrimination policy,the policy will have the effect of burdening some groups more than others.but the fact that a regulation has a differential impact on groups wishing to enforce exclusionary membership policies does not render it unconstitutional.id.at internal qu
