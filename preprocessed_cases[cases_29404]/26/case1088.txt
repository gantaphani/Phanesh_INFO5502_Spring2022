in this appeal,we are asked to interpret a difficult contract and attempt to divine what congress meant in portions of the higher education act act.the importance of the issues can not be gainsaid,as they deal with loans to students.
we suppose the complexity of the case is demonstrated by the fact that both parties appeal from the judgment of the district court.the department of education and secretary of education together,secretary argue that the district court erred both in holding that the secretary was in breach of his obligations to the student loan fund of idaho,slfi and in interpreting the agreements entered between slfi and the secretary to allow the continuation of slfi guaranty operations even after slfi terminated the agreements and ceased to guarantee new loans.in the alternative,the secretary argues that even if slfi had limited contractual authority to continue its operations,the secretary has removed this authority by making a best interest determination.finally,the secretary argues that the district court failed to afford proper deference to the applicable regulations,promulgated pursuant to the secretary authority under the act,in determining the secretary rights in slfi reserve fund assets.
in its,slfi argues that the district court erred in requiring slfi to hold a large portion of the awarded damages in a separate account to be used solely for paying its future obligations on guarantee claims,with any excess to be returned to the secretary.in addition,slfi argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying slfi motion to amend its complaint to include bivens claims.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and a.we have jurisdiction of the timely filed appeal and pursuant to.we reverse and remand.
slfi is a private corporation that began in the late to function as a guaranty agency under the federal family education loan program loan program,formerly known as the guaranteed student loan program.under the loan program,private lenders provide financing to qualifying students attending educational programs.the lenders enter into agreements with and pay insurance premiums to a guaranty agency which then guarantees repayment in case of default on the student loans.the ultimate insurer of the loans is,however,the federal government.o.the act,et,and the regulations promulgated thereunder,part,govern the interaction between the federal government and the guaranty agencies.
the act obligates the secretary to provide reinsurance to the guaranty agencies during the life of the guaranteed loans.c a.however,in order to become a guaranty agency within the meaning of the loan program and the act,a state or private nonprofit organization is first required to contract with the secretary.see j defining guaranty agency as any state or nonprofit private institution or organization with which the secretary has an agreement under section b of this title.at the time slfi contracted with the secretary then commissioner,the secretary employed a series of standard regulatory agreements for bringing nonprofit entities into the loan program.see,colorado cavazos,cir describing the series of contracts educ.assist.cavazos,cir same.in large part,the provisions of the agreements either restate or implement the requirements of the regulations and the act.four of the five agreements entered into between slfi and the secretary provide that slfi is to comply with the act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.all of the agreements state that they are to be interpreted in the light of the act and the regulations.two of the reinsurance agreement and supplemental reinsurance the rates at which slfi may obtain reinsurance from the secretary.the reinsurance agreement provides that the secretary will reimburse of the amounts expended by slfi in discharging its insurance obligations with respect to loans insured by slfi prior to termination of the agreement or prior to the expiration of the reinsurance authority in the act.the supplemental reinsurance agreement provides that if the default rate is or less,the secretary will reimburse of slfi expenses.if the default rate is more than but does not exceed,then the secretary reimburses of expenses.these supplemental reinsurance rates apply only with respect to loans insured by slfi prior to the expiration of the reinsurance authority provided in the act.these varying contractual rates of reinsurance track the rates then authorized by the regulations.see a a.
the agreements,as well as the act and regulations,require slfi to maintain loan program funds in a reserve fund.one of the agreements entered into between slfi and the secretary specifies that slfi is required to deposit into a separate fund,called the guarantee fund by slfi,advances made by the secretary,sums appropriated by the state for the purposes of the loan program,money received as loan insurance premiums,amounts received by slfi through gift,grant,or by other means from other sources for loan program operations,money collected on defaulted loans,and interest or other earnings derived from the investment of the previously listed sources of money.the regulations require that funds from these same sources are to be included in the reserve fund.a.the act provides that the secretary may require the return of the entire reserve fund of a guaranty agency only if the secretary determines that such return is in the best interest of the operation of the program or to ensure a the proper maintenance of such agency funds or assets or b the orderly termination of the guaranty agency operations and the liquidation of its assets.g.
the agreements between slfi and the secretary also provided for termination under certain circumstances with results disputed by the parties.it is now undisputed that slfi invoked this termination provision in april of and terminated its regulatory agreements effective as of july.in the secretary view,upon the termination of the regulatory agreements slfi ceased to be a guaranty agency within the meaning of the act and,as a result,was required to yield control over all of its guaranty functions to the secretary.here,the secretary attempted to exercise such control by repeatedly ordering slfi to end its guaranty operations and to transfer its entire loan portfolio and all of its reserve funds and assets which in the secretary view constitute federal property to a successor guaranty agency,the northwest education loan association nela.
slfi refused,however,to comply with the secretary directives,asserting that the only effect on its operations of the termination of the agreements was that it could not guarantee new loans.with the exception of,slfi has not transferred any reserve fund assets to the secretary or nela since june.the secretary continued to reimburse slfi until october at which time the secretary instituted an offset against slfi by withholding reimbursement payments.the secretary suspended the offset during january and february of by making reimbursement payments in those months.however,since that time no other reimbursement payments have been made by the secretary.
during september,slfi brought this action to challenge the legality of the secretary orders.the secretary counterclaimed and,on a motion for summary judgment,ultimately obtained an injunction from the district court requiring slfi to turn over all of its reserve fund.in the same order granting the injunction,the district court granted slfi motion to amend its complaint to include a breach of contract claim.however,the district court denied slfi motion to include bivens claims against the secretary in his official capacity and three other department of education officials.
slfi appealed from the injunction,and we reversed,holding in an unpublished disposition that there was still a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the secretary had met the statutory requirements for requiring the return of all reserve funds.student loan fund of idaho riley,unpublished table at.slfi also attempted to gain review of the district court denial of its motion to amend its complaint to include bivens claims.however,we held that at that stage of the case we lacked jurisdiction over that issue because slfi entire action had not been dismissed,and none of the relevant exceptions applied.
while the prior appeal before us was pending,the secretary sought to remove any doubt as to whether slfi had terminated its agreements and instituted its own for cause termination of the agreements pursuant to c e.had the secretary succeeded in his efforts to effect such a termination,the applicable statutes would have provided the secretary with plenary power over slfi operations.c f.slfi challenged the secretary termination notice in an administrative proceeding and at that point conceded through a stipulation that it had already terminated the agreements in.the hearing officer ruled that he did not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the secretary attempt to invoke his power to terminate in light of slfi stipulation that the agreements were already terminated.in addition,following our prior decision in this case,the secretary issued a best interest letter in an effort to meet one of the means specified in g for requiring the return of all of slfi reserve funds.
on remand from our court,the district court held a nine day trial on slfi breach of contract claim and determined that,as a matter of contract interpretation,slfi had control upon termination of the agreements over whether to maintain its operations with respect to loans.the district court agreed with the secretary that slfi is no longer a guaranty agency within the meaning of the act,but it held that slfi could continue operating as a former guaranty agency,or private loan guarantor with existing obligations incurred under the loan program.one possible implication of this holding is that the secretary can not require the return of all slfi reserve fund assets on the basis that such return is necessary to ensure the orderly termination of the guaranty agency operations and the liquidation of its assets,g,because slfi has elected not to terminate its operations.
the district court also held it unnecessary to reach the question of whether the secretary could require the return of all reserve fund assets on the basis that the secretary had determine d that such return was in the best interest of the operation of the program,because the district court found that slfi no longer had any federal reserve funds to return to the secretary.the district court agreed with the secretary that monies received from the student loan fund of idaho marketing association ima,which operates a secondary market for student loans,would qualify under the regulations as reserve funds.ima,because of its position in the secondary market for the loans,had a substantial interest in the operations of slfi and infused fees and an additional slfi in order to support its guaranty operations.the district court held,however,that the regulations were contrary to congress intent and that these funds from a separate,private entity should not be considered part of the federal reserve fund.in our prior opinion,the question of interpreting the termination provision of the agreements was not before us,and we expressly declined to reach the issue of to what extent the reserve fund could be deemed federal funds.
the district court determined that since slfi was contractually authorized to continue its operations with respect to loans,the secretary was in breach of its reinsurance obligations to slfi as to those loans.the court awarded as reinsurance reimbursement for claims paid by slfi with private money between november and march.on appeal,the secretary agrees that it owes reimbursement for this period since it would have had to pay reinsurance on the defaulted loans no matter who was insuring those loans however,the secretary disputes the amount.the court also awarded slfi as the present value of slfi projected insurance payments on its loan portfolio for defaults occurring after march.finally,the court awarded slfi for damages based on lost business unrelated to slfi guaranty operations.
the secretary filed a timely motion to amend the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e.the district court granted the motion in part and amended the judgment to require slfi to put the into an escrow account to be used only for paying the insurance claims of lenders,with any remainder to be returned to the secretary.the district court reasoned that slfi could receive a windfall if for example future default rates fall below the historical default rates which slfi expert employed in calculating slfi future damages.if the default rate were to drop,slfi would have guaranty money left over which rightfully belongs to the government.
slfi argues,and the district court held,that upon slfi termination of the agreements between itself and the secretary,the decision whether slfi would continue operations with respect to loans devolved upon slfi,not the secretary.the secretary argues that this holding is inconsistent with the terms of the agreements,particularly because the agreements are to be read in the light of the act,the regulations,and legislative policy.the secretary asserts that upon slfi termination of the agreements,slfi became obligated to relinquish to the secretary all control with respect to slfi guaranty functions under the federal program.here,the secretary decided that slfi should cease all guaranty operations and,as part of the orderly termination of the guaranty agency operations,also required the return of all reserve funds.g.thus,in the secretary view,it is slfi that is in breach of its duties to the secretary.
the interpretation and meaning of contract provisions is a question of law that we review de novo.see mendler winterland prod,cir.we apply federal law in interpreting the contractual provisions at issue because an agency of the united states is a party to the contract.see mohave valley irrigation drainage dist.norton,cir.if we hold that slfi was contractually required to cede control to the secretary following the termination of its agreements with the secretary,we will not need to reach the secretary alternative argument that it has made a best interest determination or the issues raised in slfi.we therefore discuss the secretary contractual argument first.
we begin with the language of the agreements which contains the following termination provision 
this agreement may be terminated by either party upon not less than days written notice to the other party,except that the secretary may terminate this agreement only for cause.termination shall not affect obligations incurred under this agreement by either party before the effective date of termination.if termination is effected by the secretary,it will not become final until the agency has been afforded reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing,except that the secretary may suspend this agreement pending the outcome of the hearing if he determines that such action is necessary in order to prevent substantial harm to the interests of the federal government.
emphasis added.slfi argues that the language emphasized above means that termination of the agreement does not alter obligations incurred before the termination.slfi apparently reaches this result by equating the word termination with the phrase effective date of termination and positing that the prepositional phrase before the effective date of termination modifies the verb incurred.according to slfi,the implication of this interpretation is that slfi may continue its operations essentially free of the secretary oversight and require the secretary to provide reinsurance on loans.indeed,slfi argues in its that the district court erred in exerting control over slfi by requiring slfi to hold the future damages award in a separate account to be used solely for the paying of defaulted loans,with any excess to be returned to the secretary.thus,slfi asserts that its power over its present operations and funds should be virtually absolute now that it has withdrawn from its agreements with the secretary.
the secretary argues that the termination provision actually provides that obligations under the agreement are not altered until the termination is finalized,or effective,at which time all obligations under the agreements cease.the secretary refers to this as a period.thus,under this interpretation,the prepositional phrase before the effective date of termination would modify the verb affect.the secretary interpretation is bolstered by the fact that the sentence immediately following the highlighted segment distinguishes between a termination and a final termination.according to the secretary,once slfi tendered its termination of the agreements,the secretary had control as to how the period would proceed and whether slfi could continue limited operations thereafter.
although we believe that the secretary reading is the more plausible of the two,the provision is not free from ambiguity.however,interpreting an ambiguous provision in a contract involving a federal agency is different from the same exercise when the contract involves private parties.in the instance before us,we attempt to resolve ambiguities by consulting the act,the regulations,and the policies behind them.peterson united states of interior,cir holding that governmental contracts must be interpreted against the backdrop of the legislative scheme that authorized them,and our interpretation of ambiguous terms or implied covenants can only be made in light of the policies underlying the controlling legislation.indeed,in this case,we are required to do this by the agreements themselves.
first,slfi was able to enter the loan program and receive the benefit of reinsurance only by agreeing to contract with the secretary and submit to extensive federal regulation.j.thus,guaranty agencies are essentially the creatures of regulatory agreements and federal regulations.as the seventh circuit has explained,the guarantee agency is heavily regulated by federal law.the purpose and legal structure of a guaranty agency places it in that borderline between the wholly public and wholly private instrumentality.the extensive federal regulation of the agency suggests its highly public nature.great lakes higher educ.cavazos,cir internal citation omitted.the court pointed out that i n essence a guaranty agency is an intermediary between the united states and the lender of the student loan.the united states is the loan guarantor of last resort.the guaranty agency assists the united states in performing that function.id.at.see also ohio student loan comm cavazos,cir the guaranty agency is a public entity that is not interested in making any sort of profit in its administration of the loan program.instead,it has chosen to join with the federal government to administer the loan program.
as the district court recognized,a guaranty agency without agreements with the secretary is no longer a guaranty agency,but a former guaranty agency,or private loan guarantor.while the district court did hold that slfi remains under the obligations imposed upon slfi preparatory to receiving federal reimbursement,the district court provided no explanation as to how the secretary is to exercise oversight over slfi now that slfi is no longer a party to any agreement with the secretary.further,slfi now purports to operate largely outside the strictures of the loan program.this is emphasized by slfi contention that the district court erred in placing it under the obligation to use the damages award only to pay claims on defaulted student loans.under the district court decision,the federal government has thus lost its intermediary position between the lenders and itself with respect to the particular student loans guaranteed by slfi prior to its having terminated its agreements.yet the federal government remains the ultimate insurer of those loans,and the district court held that it must continue to pay reinsurance on those loans to slfi,a former guaranty agency or private loan guarantor,and not to nela,the successor intermediary named by the secretary and with whom the secretary has loan program agreements.
this result is particularly striking when compared with the authority the secretary would have had over slfi if the secretary had terminated the agreements for cause.c e provides a list of determinations the secretary may make to effect the termination of its agreement with a guaranty agency 
the secretary may terminate a guaranty agency agreement if 
i a guaranty agency required to submit a management plan under this paragraph fails to submit a plan that is acceptable to the secretary 
ii the secretary determines that a guaranty agency has failed to improve substantially its administrative and financial condition 
iii the secretary determines that the guaranty agency is in danger of financial collapse 
iv the secretary determines that such action is necessary to protect the federal fiscal interest 
v the secretary determines that such action is necessary to ensure the continued availability of loans to student or parent borrowers or 
vi the secretary determines that such action is necessary to ensure an orderly transition from the loan programs under this part to the direct student loan programs under part d of this title.
the termination provision of the agreements provides that the secretary may only terminate for cause.reading that contractual requirement in light of the act,it becomes clear that the secretary would have cause to terminate if any of the conditions in c e were met.
if before slfi had terminated the agreements the secretary had terminated the agreements for cause that is,under the conditions prescribed by the the secretary authority to control the functions of slfi would have been absolute.the act commands,if a guaranty agency agreement under this subsection is terminated pursuant to c e then the secretary shall assume responsibility for all functions of the guaranty agency under the loan insurance program of such agency.c f emphasis added.in carrying out this responsibility,the secretary may 
i permit the transfer of guarantees to another guaranty agency 
ii revoke the reinsurance agreement of the guaranty agency at a specified date,so as to require the merger,consolidation,or termination of the guaranty agency 
iii transfer guarantees to the department of education for the purpose of payment of such claims and process such claims using the claims standards of the guaranty agency,if such standards are determined by the secretary to be in compliance with this chapter 
iv design and implement a plan to restore the guaranty agency viability 
v provide the guaranty agency with additional advance funds 
vi use all funds and assets of the guaranty agency to assist in the activities undertaken in accordance with this subparagraph and take appropriate action to require the return,to the guaranty agency or the secretary,of any funds or assets provided by the guaranty agency,under contract or otherwise,to any person or organization or 
vii take any other action the secretary determines necessary to ensure the continued availability of loans made under this part to residents of the state or states in which the guaranty agency did business,the full honoring of all guarantees issued by the guaranty agency prior to the secretary assumption of the functions of such agency,and the proper servicing of loans guaranteed by the guaranty agency prior to the secretary assumption of the functions of such agency,to avoid disruption of the student loan program,and to ensure an orderly transition from the loan programs under this part to the direct student loan programs under part c of this subchapter.
id.this list of powers clearly encompasses the directives issued by the secretary in this case.however,as discussed above,the secretary attempt to invoke this provision was unavailing an administrative hearing officer held that he was without jurisdiction to determine the validity of the secretary termination effort because the agreements had already been terminated by slfi.thus,slfi interpretation of the termination provision of the regulatory agreements allows a guaranty agency to circumvent the secretary power under c f by beating the secretary to termination.
slfi argues for its part that c a gives it the right to exact reinsurance from the secretary.that provision states
