nina austin appeals from the denial of her postjudgment motion for relief after the trial court granted the unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by the los angeles unified school district and two of its employees in austin lawsuit alleging wrongful discharge in violation of california whistleblower statute,discrimination based on race,gender and age in violation of california fair employment and housing act feha,et and unlawful harassment in violation of feha.austin contends the court erred when it denied her motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b section b,because it had not been signed under penalty of perjury and,as a result,failed to exercise its discretion to decide whether the judgment and order granting summary judgment should be set aside.we reverse and remand for the trial court to consider on its merits austin motion to vacate the judgment and the order granting summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
austin complaints for unlawful discharge and feha violations 
austin,represented by counsel,filed her initial complaint on january,alleging violations of the whistleblower statute,unlawful discrimination and two tort causes of action.in addition to the district,she named as defendants danford schar,principal at ernest lawrence middle school in chatsworth where austin had been employed as a campus aide,responsible for helping to maintain student discipline and compliance with campus rules james ramirez,dean of students at the school and junior sandoval,a school safety officer.a first amended complaint was filed in april.the district successfully demurred to the tort causes of action.the operative second amended complaint was filed on july,naming only the district,ramirez and sandoval.none of the complaints was verified.
the second amended complaint averred,as preliminary allegations,that sandoval and ramirez had harassed austin for approximately five years based on her gender,race african american and age or years old in,addressing her as old lady,often in the context of urging her to retire,playing tricks such as hiding her keys,refusing to respond to communications and otherwise ignoring her.according to the pleading,in may ramirez attempted an unlawful sting operation directed at austin by asking a student to violate campus rules walking the halls without a pass in the expectation austin would take no action and the failure to act could serve as a ground for her termination.however,the student told austin what she had been asked to do.austin reported the episode to schar.sandoval learned of the report and retaliated by claiming austin had threatened him during an angry encounter on may.the pleading describes sandoval as in his and weighing close to pounds austin as slightly built and weighing pounds.austin was arrested,but the charges were promptly dismissed.schar stated he had investigated the matter and asserted other teachers had supported sandoval allegations.as a result,austin was suspended and then her employment was terminated.austin alleged schar did not investigate and did not know of any independent witnesses that supported sandoval version of events.
each of the three causes of action in the second amended complaint incorporated the preliminary allegations by reference.in her first cause of action for violating the whistleblower statute against the district only,austin alleged she reasonably believed ramirez had engaged in an unlawful activity because he had involved a minor student without authorization from the principal or the consent of her parents when she reported the sting operation to schar and her discharge was in retaliation for that protected act.in her second cause of action for unlawful discrimination,also against the district only,austin asserted the district had responded to her reports of harassment by sandoval and ramirez and the unlawful sting operation by terminating her without a proper investigation of the may,incident.her third cause of action for unlawful harassment against sandoval and ramirez alleged the conduct described constituted harassment on the basis of race,gender and age in violation of feha.
the case management statement filed in early may by austin counsel requested a jury trial,estimated trial would require five days and confirmed the case would be ready for trial within months of the filing of the complaint.the district counsel estimated a jury trial and noted that,in addition to the demurrer to the first amended complaint that was then pending,the district and individual defendants intended to move for summary judgment.
a second case management statement filed by austin counsel on september,indicated written discovery and depositions of key witnesses would be completed within six months.in the category for discovery issues,counsel stated,the parties were to complete two depositions and return to mediation.however,one of the witnesses that needs to be deposed no longer works for lausd and is not cooperating in scheduling his deposition.plaintiff has had to serve a written interrogatory to get his last known address for the purpose of serving a subpoena.
on september,the court set a trial date of july.
limited discovery and withdrawal of austin counsel 
on october,austin lawyer moved to be relieved as her counsel,citing as the ground disagreement over the future handling of the case.austin subsequently advised the court the lawyer had withdrawn because austin would not accept what she considered to be an inadequate settlement offer.hearing on the motion was scheduled for february,and the motion was granted on that date.
it appears that,prior to withdrawing,austin counsel did not depose schar,ramirez or sandoval and conducted,at most,only limited written discovery.he did depose two individuals who the district claimed supported sandoval version of austin threat,which had served as the ground for her termination.as reflected in materials filed in connection with austin motion for postjudgment relief,one of those witnesses testified he had heard austin say to sandoval,i will fuck you up,but only once,not repeatedly as sandoval had claimed,and the statement was in response to harassment by sandoval.according to this witness,sandoval had locked the school gate so austin could not enter the school grounds.when austin asked why sandoval had done that,sandoval replied,what are you going to do about it,nina the witness explained austin vulgar comment was made in response to that taunt.the second witness testified he had not heard any of the conversation between sandoval and austin and reported that fact to schar.
the motion for summary judgment 
on march,the district and the individual defendants hereafter collectively the district moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication.the district argued austin had not engaged in protected activity and therefore could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of labor code section and,in addition,her dismissal was based on legitimate,nonretaliatory reasons and she had presented no evidence of pretext.with respect to her claim for unlawful discrimination,the district repeated its position austin dismissal was based on legitimate reasons and there was no evidence of pretext.finally,as to the claim for unlawful harassment the district argued the conduct alleged was neither severe nor pervasive.the motion was supported by declarations from schar sandoval,ramirez and the principal at lawrence middle school prior to schar excerpts from austin deposition and her responses to special interrogatories and several exhibits including copies of schar may,letter to austin informing her he was considering issuing a notice of unsatisfactory service with a recommendation for dismissal from her employment and the notice of unsatisfactory service provided to austin.hearing on the motion was scheduled for may.
on may,austin,representing herself,filed a document entitled request for leave to amend in opposition to motion for summary judgment,noting on the caption page the may,hearing date set for the district motion.austin asserted her lawyer had abandoned her for no other reason than that plaintiff would not accept an inferior offer,which she contended was the result in large part of her counsel failure to include additional causes of action alleged violations of various civil rights statutes in her complaint against the district.she invoked the principle that leave to amend should be granted with liberality,cited the doctrine and requested days to file a third amended complaint adding those causes of action as well as several new tort claims.the filing made no attempt to identify any material issues of fact that would defeat the district summary judgment motion.
the district filed a reply,arguing its motion was unopposed,it had met its initial burden on summary judgment and,therefore,the motion should be granted.the district also argued austin had failed to explain the extended delay in requesting leave to file a third amended complaint,her request was procedurally defective and it would unduly prejudice the district to permit her to assert new legal theories at this point in the litigation.
on may,at a hearing at which austin and counsel for the district appeared,the court granted the district motion for summary judgment,explaining its reasoning in a page order originally prepared as its tentative ruling,and ordered judgment entered in favor the all three defendants.the court also denied austin request for leave to amend,noting the procedural irregularities in her filing no proposed amended complaint was attached and observing,as the other claims fail,it is likely the other claims fail as well.the district served a notice of ruling immediately following the hearing.the judgment was signed by the court on may,and filed the same day.
austin efforts to vacate the judgment 
on may,still representing herself,austin filed a motion for reconsideration for the court ruling on may,in favor of defendants.in this request for relief from the order granting summary judgment,austin asserted there was newly discovered evidence that was intentionally withheld by the defendants legal representation and her prior counsel had abandoned her even though he knew of her mental state memory loss due to old age and overwhelmed from mental anguish due to this case at hand.in part,austin noted that her attorney had not taken schar deposition and asserted that both the district and her lawyer were aware of information bearing on the merits of her case that had not been disclosed to her.she concluded by promising to submit a supplemental brief that will have documentation to support the facts at hand and stated she would retain new counsel in the near future.the court apparently set an october,hearing date to consider the motion.
the district opposed the motion,arguing it was untimely because it was filed more than days after service of notice of entry of the order granting summary judgment and it was improper because filed after final judgment had been entered.the district also argued austin had not provided any new facts or legal theories that were not available to her at the time the summary judgment motion was heard.
on october,austin filed a reply brief that included copies of letters written by teachers at lawrence corroborating austin complaint of harassment by ramirez and sandoval and a newspaper article discussing the million settlement of a lawsuit by a san fernando valley student and his family following the student recruitment as a decoy drug buyer by a dean at another district middle school.none of this material was presented in the form of admissible evidence however,austin also included her own handwritten declaration,signed under penalty of perjury,describing the incident in which she had allegedly threatened to attack sandoval.according to austin,although she used crude language,she threatened to report sandoval to the school principal,not to assault him after she asked sandoval why he would not open the school gate and he responded,what are you going to do about it,nina,she said,i tire d of you fucking with me.i going straight to schar.she also denied she had hit the golf cart in which sandoval was riding.
prior to the hearing on october,the court issued a tentative ruling denying austin motion.that tentative order,which,although never finalized,was subsequently submitted by the district in connection with its opposition to austin renewed request for relief indicated the court was inclined to rule it was without jurisdiction to consider the motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section because it had been filed after final judgment was entered and was,in addition,not filed within days of the order granting summary judgment.the tentative ruling also stated,finally,to the extent plaintiff arguments in the motion regarding her attorney abandoning her may constitute a request for relief under ccp b,her claims may not be considered because the motion is not signed under penalty of perjury.
according to the district at the hearing austin asked the court to provide her with another opportunity to make her case because she lacked representation.the court took the motion for reconsideration under submission and on october,issued a minute order in which it stay ed entry of its final ruling which was tentatively to deny the motion so that plaintiff may retain counsel to assist her in connection with her motion and this case as she stated she intended to do.the court gave austin days to retain counsel.a new attorney substituted in as counsel for austin on december,and on that date the court set a new hearing on the motion for reconsideration for april,with the admonition,all briefing shall be per code.that hearing date was continued several times at the request of austin counsel.
on july,austin through her new attorney filed a motion for reconsideration of judgment filed in this case on may.the filing reiterated the various arguments austin had previously made regarding her status while the district motion was pending and decided and included a summary of the evidence she could present demonstrating triable issues of material fact on her claims for unlawful discharge,discrimination and harassment.
in its opposition the district once again argued austin motion for reconsideration was untimely because it was filed after the final judgment had been entered and more than days after the order granting summary judgment had been issued.the district also argued the motion was not based on new or different facts,circumstances of law as required under code of civil procedure section.
the district also argued austin was not entitled to relief under section b.first,citing section b time limit,the district noted the july,motion had been filed more one year after the judgment was entered.next,without directly misstating governing law,the district referred the court to its october,tentative ruling and reminded the court it had previously indicated austin may,motion could not provide a basis for relief under section b because it had not been signed under penalty of perjury.finally,the district asserted in a single sentence,even assuming that plaintiff motion is timely for purposes of section b relief,plaintiff motion fails to provide an excusable reason to justify relief.
austin filed a reply brief that for the first time expressly relied upon section b and urged the court to hear and resolve her case on the merits.she argued her initial postjudgment filings were well within six months of the order granting summary judgment and the judgment itself and should be considered as her request for relief under section b.she argued the combination of her own inexperience and lack of education together with her original counsel failure to conduct discovery and his withdrawal at a critical phase of the litigation should be considered mistake,inadvertence and excusable neglect sufficient to justify relief.
the court denied austin motion for relief on august.the court ruled section b relief could not be based on austin july,motion because the statute expressly requires an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry of judgment.with respect to austin original may,motion,the court ruled,although this motion would have been within the six month period,plaintiff can not receive relief here due to her failure to sign her motion under penalty of perjury.the motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section was denied on each of the grounds asserted in the district opposition memorandum.
contentions 
austin contends the trial court erred in ruling a section b motion must be signed under penalty of perjury and,based solely on that faulty premise,failing to consider the merits of her motion and to exercise its discretion to vacate the judgment in favor of the district upon any terms as may be just.alternatively,austin argues the court should have exercised its inherent equitable power to grant relief from the order granting summary judgment and the resulting judgment.
discussion 
section b and the standard of review 
the trial court has discretion under section b on a showing of mistake,inadvertence,surprise or excusable neglect to grant relief from a judgment,dismissal or other order based on its evaluation of the nature of the mistake or error alleged and the justification proffered for the conduct that occurred the general underlying purpose of section b is to promote the determination of actions on their merits.even zohar construction remodeling,bellaire townhouses,llc cal th,accord,zamora clayborn contracting group,cal th,it is well settled that appellate courts have always been and are favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of the trial courts as will permit,rather than prevent,the adjudication of legal controversies upon their merits.citation.thus,the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure are to be liberally construed and sound policy favors the determination of actions on their merits.
a party seeking relief under section b must file the motion within a reasonable time but not longer than six months after the judgment or dismissal has been entered.this time limitation is jurisdictional the court has no power to grant relief under section once the time has lapsed.arambula union carbide th,see rappleyea campbell cal th,weitz yankosky cal d.in addition,the moving party bears the burden of establishing a right to relief.hopkins carley gens th,see schwab southern california gas th,moving party bears burden under b see also in re marriage of kieturakis th.within the context of section b neglect is excusable if a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances might have made the same error.huh wang th,solv all superior court th,see comunidad en accion los angeles city council th,t he test for discretionary relief under code of civil procedure section requires the party seeking relief to show excusable error.
a motion to vacate under section b is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court,and in the absence of a clear showing of abuse the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal.citations.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.strathvale holdings th,accord,anastos lee th.however,b ecause the law favors disposing of cases on their merits,any doubts in applying section must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default citations.therefore,a trial court order denying relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the merits.rappleyea campbell,supra,cal th at.moreover,failure to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion.ashburn aig financial advisors,th,accord,austin valverde th.
the trial court improperly denied austin may,request for relief from judgment on the ground a section b motion must be signed under penalty of perjury 
a.the trial court had discretion to treat the may,motion as a request for relief under section b 
as discussed,in denying austin motion for reconsideration,the trial court expressly considered whether she was entitled to relief under section b and concluded she was not because a the may,motion filed while she was was not signed under penalty of perjury,as the court believed was required,and b the july,motion filed by her counsel was untimely.the district argument the court did not construe austin may,motion as one arguably seeking relief under section b is a disturbing distortion of the record.
the trial court acted well within its authority in considering austin may,motion as a motion from relief under section b.see sole energy petrominerals th,upholding authority of trial court to construe a motion for reconsideration as a motion for a new trial a trial court is free to consider the motion regardless of its label.the proposition that a trial court may construe a motion bearing one label as a different type of motion is one that has existed for many decades.the nature of a motion is determined by the nature of the relief sought,not by the label attached to it.the law is not a mere game of words.citation.neither the legislature,nor the california supreme court,nor any court of appeal has ever challenged that notion the principle that a trial court may consider a motion regardless of the label placed on it by a party is consistent with the court inherent authority to manage and control its docket.see shapiro prudential property casualty th,trial court acted within its discretion in treating motion to vacate as motion for new trial on damages when a party brings a timely posttrial motion,the trial court has broad discretion to determine the relief being requested.
the requirement a moving party specify the grounds for his or her motion,as set forth in code of civil procedure section,is intended to provide both the adverse party and the court with an adequate opportunity to address the issues presented.see,luri greenwald th.here,all of austin filings,starting with the initial may,motion submitted while she was and continuing through her counsel final reply memorandum prior to the august,hearing,made clear she was not simply asking the court to reconsider its prior ruling but rather to set aside the judgment and the order granting the district summary judgment motion so she could have a fair opportunity to submit opposition papers demonstrating the existence of triable issues of fact and the potential merit of her claims.although in its opposition papers the district prudently noted the procedural defects in the motion if it were to be considered one for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section,it was clearly on notice as to the nature of the relief austin was requesting.indeed,before the motion was finally decided,the district advanced both procedural and substantive arguments in opposition to the court granting relief under section b arguments that plainly belie its position on appeal that the issue was never properly before the trial court.
section b imposes no requirement 
as explained in uriarte united states pipe foundry th,before a party seeking relief under what is now section b had to submit either an affidavit of merits or a verified pleading.however,in the legislature amended the statute to specifically provide no affidavit or declaration of merits need be submitted that language expressly eliminating any such requirement remains in the statute today.see shapiro clark th,i n,after decades of criticism,the legislature abrogated any such requirement by explicitly declaring,no affidavit or declaration of merits shall be required by the moving party.b stats,ch.
in light of the express statutory language that no affidavit or declaration of merits is required,the court refusal to consider the merits of austin motion under section b because it was not signed under penalty of perjury was plain error.the district does not contend otherwise nonetheless,the district argues the court error was harmless because under section b the moving party is required to prove relief is warranted that is,that there was some mistake or excusable neglect that justifies vacating the judgment or order at issue and that proof is typically presented by way of declaration under penalty of perjury from the moving party.austin papers,the district contends,are void of any competent evidence.
the trial court,however,did not evaluate austin evidence,which,as discussed,eve
