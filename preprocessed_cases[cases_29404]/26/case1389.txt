plaintiff and appellant eric eric,by and through his guardian ad litem,gloria,brought this action against defendant and respondent cajon valley union school district the district,alleging that his injuries from being hit by a car were proximately caused by the district failure to supervise adequately the process of his dismissal from school and anticipated school bus ride home.after eric boarded but then immediately left the school bus telling the bus driver he saw his father car,shortly after school had ended for the day,he started walking to the bus stop where he thought his mother would pick him up,but was hit by a car as he crossed the street.
eric appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered against him after the trial court granted the district motion for summary judgment,and denied eric motion for summary adjudication on the existence of an affirmative duty not to let him off the bus under those circumstances.the trial court ruling to grant the district summary judgment motion was based on its analysis of duty and immunity under education code section under the circumstances of a student being injured by being struck by a car,after school and off campus.the court concluded the district owed eric no duty,as of the time of his injuries,to provide him safe transportation under its transportation safety plan tsp.
the trial court analysis applied authority from this court,guerrero south bay union school district th,d guerrero,to conclude that although the district had undertaken to provide transportation for pupils to and from the school premises,within the terms of section,it had not undertaken to supervise children until they were safely in the arms of their parents.the trial court concluded the district had exercised reasonable care in its transportation functions under all the relevant circumstances,and was entitled to statutory immunity.
on appeal,eric argues the trial court erroneously determined as a matter of law that the district owed him no duty of reasonable care during the events leading up to his injuries.eric contends the district negligently supervised him while he was on campus,boarding and then leaving the bus,and that such a failure of supervision was the proximate cause of the accident.according to eric,the district,through its tsp,undertook the duty to transport him at the school,but failed to exercise reasonable care by letting him leave the bus without making sure that he had alternative transportation.
we agree with eric that,as a matter of law,and under existing authorities,the trial court incorrectly determined the district did not owe eric a duty of reasonable care at the relevant times during these events.hoyem manhattan beach city school district cal d,hoyem.moreover,triable material issues of fact remain regarding the extent and manner of performance of that duty,and the summary judgment and underlying summary adjudication ruling must be reversed.
factual and procedural background 
accident complaint 
on september,eric was a first grade student at johnson elementary school,part of the district.eric parents had paid a fee for him to participate in the district school bus program,and had filled out paperwork showing that eric would normally be dropped off after school at at the magnolia school bus location,which was closer to his home.eric had been in school for about a month and he was taking the bus home on an irregular basis,because sometimes one of his parents would pick him up,and this changed day to day.eric parents told him that if he missed the bus home,he should go to the school office.
under the district tsp for providing school bus transportation service,once a student had signed up for this bus transportation,it was available to him but not mandatory.on the day of the accident,eric was dismissed from school at and headed for the school bus area.as required by the tsp,several school staff monitors were present as usual at the time of boarding the school buses.eric boarded the bus as usual,but within a minute,he told the driver,youngs not a party here that he saw his father car and was going to drive home with him.youngs grabbed him by the arm and asked him if he were sure,and he said he was.eric got off the bus while it was still on campus,but he could not find his father,who was not in fact there.apparently,his mother had come to campus in the family car around the same time,and was allegedly looking for him to tell him to ride the bus to magnolia school,but she could not find him.
eric then started to walk with other students toward magnolia school,and after about a half a mile,he crossed a busy street.meanwhile,his mother was reporting to the office that he was missing.shortly thereafter,they learned he had been injured when a car struck him when he crossed the street.
eric filed a complaint for personal injuries against the district and the of the car in his governmental claim and amended complaint,eric alleged that the district breached its duty of care when it negligently permitted,allowed,and let him wander away from school,et.
the district answered the complaint,raising numerous affirmative defenses,including the immunity of section for injuries incurred off school premises,after school hours.
motions district transportation plan 
the district moved for summary judgment,claiming section provided it with immunity for the accident,which occurred off campus and after school hours.it argued that contrary to arguments made by eric that it had been negligent per se,its tsp was adequate under the statutory standards set by section.the district provided evidence that eric was not normally escorted to the bus,but that three or four staff members and teachers were assigned and on site for monitoring the boarding of the buses.the district relied on its transportation department handbook,describing a bus driver duties to students on the bus and stating that students are to be properly supervised at all times.tsp.the district contended that since eric had gotten off the bus while it was still on campus,it did not undertake to transport him that day,within the meaning of section.see guerrero,supra,th,d.
eric filed a for summary adjudication msa arguing the same duty issues but in an opposite manner,and additionally seeking a determination that certain government code immunities did not apply,subd.b,subd.b,affirmative defense.eric also argued that under section,school teachers must hold pupils to strict account for their conduct on the way to and from school,and therefore a duty of supervision existed for his way home.
rulings motion for summary for summary adjudication 
the trial court heard argument on both the district motion for summary judgment and eric msa on may,and it issued separate orders granting summary judgment to the district,and denying eric msa that a duty was owed to him as alleged.in both rulings,the court concluded that section provided the district with immunity as a matter of law.according to the rulings,even though the district came under an obligation to supervise the children during bus transportation and a duty to provide a reasonably safe system,when it enacted and applied its tsp to provide transportation to and from school premises,no such particularized duty arose out of these facts.the court reasoned that eric had left the bus after boarding it and was injured after school and off campus,and therefore,the necessary undertaking to transport him had not arisen.the court took note that there was no case law clearly defining where the duty to transport begins and ends,and concluded that such a duty to transport arises when the student is transported from one location to another.this was not the case here.citing farley el tejon unified school dist.d.farley.
moreover,the ruling stated that no triable issues of fact had been raised as to the existence of duty and immunity under section,because eric failed to show that insufficient numbers of had been provided,nor could he show that the bus driver was required to question and detain him until it could be ascertained whether he actually had alternate transportation.the court further determined that eric had failed to plead and prove any cause of action for negligence per se or insufficiency of the tsp,under section.
based on the same reasoning,the msa was denied for failure to establish a duty was owed to eric when he got off the school bus and was later injured after school and off campus.the court found no undertaking of a duty to supervise eric until he was safely united with his parents.guerrero,supra,th at,d.for the same reasons,the trial court also found unmeritorious eric claim that he could prove the existence of a duty,leading to liability of the public entity,despite the governmental immunity provisions of government code section et.
thereafter,the court entered a final judgment of dismissal.eric filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
iguerrero and predecessors approaches to duty 
we restate basic appellate standards of review,from guerrero,supra,th,d summary judgment is proper only where there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.to secure summary judgment,a moving defendant may prove an affirmative defense,disprove at least one essential element of the plaintiff cause of action citations or show that an element of the cause of action can not be established citations.citation.all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.citation.citation.we review the record de novo to determine whether defendants met their burdens of proof.citation.citation.citation.
it is well established that a school district owes a duty of care to its students because a special relationship exists between the students and the district.citation.the special relationship,by itself,does not create liability.tort liability for governmental entities is based upon statute.citations.guerrero,supra,th,d.in hoyem,supra,cal d,the supreme court analyzed liability and immunity issues arising from an injury to a student who was struck by a motorcycle some distance from the school grounds.in guerrero,we explained the facts and conclusions in hoyem,about section,as follows 
the student had left the school without authorization and was injured after his departure.the school defended on the basis that the injury occurred off campus and was thus outside the statute.the court rejected that argument finding that the school failed to properly supervise the student in allowing him to leave and thus the question was whether the on campus negligence was the proximate cause of the off campus injury.citation.guerrero,supra,th,d.
the key legal issue in eric current appeal,as in guerrero,is to determine upon undisputed facts the existence of any statutory duty undertaken by the district as an essential part of a negligence cause of action,within the terms of section 
the threshold element of a negligence cause of action is the existence of a duty of reasonable care.citation.whether a duty of care exists is a question of law to be determined on a basis.citation.citation.accordingly,we review de novo the trial court determination that the district did not owe student a duty of care at the time of the accident.citation.we also review de novo the trial court determination that the district established its affirmative defense of immunity pursuant to section as a matter of law.citation.guerrero,supra,th,d.
potentially,if summary judgment regarding the lack of a duty is reversed,eric will be allowed to go forward to address the remaining elements of a negligence cause of action.if and when the alleged duties are established as a matter of law,the legal focus turns to the manner of exercise of reasonable care under the given set of circumstances.for example,in farley,supra,d,the court commented that section is simply a recognition by the legislature of the law existing prior to its enactment that once a school district undertakes to provide transportation for its pupils it has a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.even though a school district ordinarily has no legal duty to supply bus transportation to students,o nce it does so,no one would deny a concomitant obligation to provide a reasonably safe system.citation.
in farley,supra,d,the facts were that the school bus driver stopped to let children out at the usual stop on one side of the road,where many of the children normally had to cross the road to get to the operative destination there store and parking lot where parents waited.the appellate court interpreted the last paragraph of section that liability for the safety of a pupil exists only while the pupil is should be under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of the district,as raising the question of how this duty should be applied whether or not student should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of the district depends on whether the exercise of reasonable care under those circumstances required id.at,its bus driver to exercise more supervision.in farley,those specific circumstances did give rise to a duty of reasonable care,that required the bus driver to supervise the student crossing of the road,after being discharged from the bus,quite apart from the statutory duty to turn on the red lights.
thus,in farley,supra,d,it was deemed to be a triable issue of fact whether the exercise of reasonable care under the circumstances would require a school bus driver,who had knowledge of the road conditions there,to supervise the children safe crossing farley,supra,at,of the road after the children exited the bus.further,if the trier of fact found the district to be negligent under the circumstances,by breaching that duty,the trier of fact would next have to address whether the act or omission forming the basis of such finding is a proximate cause of the accident and student resulting damages ibid.the ultimate issue here,therefore,is whether the school district,acting through its officers and employees,was negligent under the circumstances as shown by the evidence.id.at.
in our case,the trial court ruling on the immunity of section was central to its other legal conclusions,that eric could not claim any negligence per se under the tsp statute,nor could eric achieve summary adjudication of the governmental duty or immunity issues in his own,et on appeal,those rulings are subsumed within the grant of summary judgment.as will be explained,our disagreement with the trial court basic conclusions on this section immunity requires reversal of the summary judgment as a whole,and we need not directly address those secondary issues,except as noted below.
beyond guerrero section and its undertakings 
under section,the district would not be liable for injuries off campus and after school unless they were the result of the district negligence occurring on school grounds or were the result of some specific undertaking by the district,which was then performed in a negligent manner.guerrero,supra,th at,d italics added.eric recognizes that the district liability in this case is governed by section,which provides in full 
notwithstanding any other provision of this code,no school district,city or county board of education,county superintendent of schools,or any officer or employee of such district or board shall be responsible or in any way liable for the conduct or safety of any pupil of the public schools at any time when such pupil is not on school property,unless such district,board,or person has undertaken to provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises,has undertaken a activity off the premises of such school,has otherwise specifically assumed such responsibility or liability or has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.in the event of such a specific undertaking,the district,board,or person shall be liable or responsible for the conduct or safety of any pupil only while such pupil is or should be under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board.italics added.
in guerrero,supra,th at page,d,the majority opinion upheld a grant of summary judgment to the district,finding there was no undertaking by the school to safeguard the stude
