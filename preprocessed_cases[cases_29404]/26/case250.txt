opinion of the court 
this case arises under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,a federal statute requiring states that receive federal education funding to ensure that disabled children receive a free appropriate public education fape.a.the statute protects the rights of disabled children by mandating that public educational institutions identify and effectively educate those children,or pay for their education elsewhere if they require specialized services that the public institution can not provide.abington sch,cir quoting chester area sch,cir.appellant muhammad munir sent his son,to a private residential facility and a private boarding school following multiple suicide attempts,and sought reimbursement for the cost of those placements from the pottsville area school district pottsville or school district.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court order denying that request.
to comply with the idea,school districts must identify and evaluate all children who they have reason to believe are disabled under the statute,at.once a school district has identified a child as eligible for idea services,it must create and implement an individualized education plan iep based on the student needs and areas of disability,at.school districts are not,however,required to maximize the potential of each handicapped student.kingwood twp.bd.of,cir quoting bd.of educ.of hen drick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley.instead,to satisfy the idea,the district must offer an iep that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive meaningful educational benefits in light of the student intellectual potential,at quoting shore reg l high sch.bd.of educ,cir see also mary sch.dist.of,cir explaining that once the school district has designed and administered an iep that is reasonably calculated to enable the receipt of meaningful educational benefits,it has satisfied its obligation to provide the child with a fape.
if parents believe that the school district is not providing a fape for their child,they may unilaterally remove him from the school,enroll him in a different school,and seek tuition reimbursement for the cost of the alternative placement.id.at citing a c and sch.comm.of burlington dep t of.parents who change their child placement without the consent of state or local officials,however,do so at their own financial risk.burlington,at.a court may grant the family tuition reimbursement only if it finds that the school district failed to provide a fape and that the alternative private placement was appropriate.see florence cnty.sch.dist.four carter,mary,at.courts also have broad discretion to consider equitable factors when awarding tuition reimbursement.florence cnty.sch,at.
is a year old former pottsville student who was diagnosed as suffering from emotional disturbance.he first required hospital treatment for making threats of suicide and suicidal gestures in,when he was enrolled in middle school.at that time,the school district conducted a evaluation to determine whether suffered from a learning disability and would be eligible for idea services.it determined that was not eligible for learning disability services based on his cognitive and achievement test scores.it determined that he was not eligible for emotional disturbance services based on behavioral ratings completed by teachers and a psychiatric report.
returned to pottsville in the fall of and performed well academically for three years.he had no problem with attendance,expressed no concerns about school,and received grades in the a to c range in regular college preparatory courses during the school year,periodically saw the school psychologist,who observed nothing suggesting that an additional evaluation for idea services was necessary.
in april,took an overdose of prescription medication and was hospitalized.although his parents notified the school district about the incident,they did not provide it with details or medical records.also was hospitalized twice in the summer of for making suicidal threats and gestures and attempting suicide.the first hospitalization occurred after an incident with his high school football coach during a summer practice session the second occurred during a family trip to the university that sibling attended.
following the very difficult summer experienced,in august,parents notified the school district that they were going to enroll him in the private boarding school that his brother had attended.the school district assisted in this effort by writing letters of recommendation for and supplying teacher evaluation forms.guidance counselor,who submitted a very positive letter of recommendation,noted that was ranked out of a class of.was accepted,but after his first day the boarding school notified his parents that he felt depressed and had thoughts of harming himself,and it required his parents to take him home.
after his withdrawal from boarding school,reenrolled at pottsville area high school.his behavior and performance at school were,for the most part,unremarkable.he initially decided to take honors math classes,but began struggling academically and dropped them.when he returned to regular college preparatory courses,his grades improved.on at least two occasions after returned,he became upset and spoke to the guidance counselor,and his parents were required to pick him up from school.otherwise,generally attended and participated in his classes,and he was observed spending his lunch and free periods socializing with students who were considered popular.
mental health problems continued,however.in early september,he again expressed suicidal ideation and had to be hospitalized.his parents notified the school district and requested an iep for their son.in response,the school district requested and received permission from parents to conduct an evaluation to determine whether he was a protected handicapped student under of the rehabilitation act,and,if so,what services he needed was hospitalized again in november.in,the school district created a rehabilitation act plan for,which parents approved the school district did not,however,create an iep.
in january,again threatened suicide and was hospitalized for treatment.when he was released,his parents enrolled him at wediko children services,a therapeutic residential treatment center in new hampshire,for the rest of the school year.while there,received daily individual and group therapy,during which he received training in social skills,emotional regulation,stress management,and conflict resolution.wediko also offered a full school day with a curriculum that met new hampshire educational standards,which began attending about two to three weeks after his enrollment.the classes were small and graded on a basis,and the school day included three debriefing periods to assess how well was maintaining control of his thoughts,mood,and anxiety.
wediko conducted an evaluation of in february.the evaluation consisted of standardized cognitive and academic achievement tests and measures designed to test functioning.wediko notified the school district of the results and recommended that the district consider an iep for.the district reviewed wediko analysis,which indicated that was in the average range of intellectual functioning,with average to above average scores in math,reading,and writing,and accepted wediko diagnosis of emotional disturbance 
in may,the school district offered an iep for,which included annual goals and provided for emotional support services.in september,the school district added a curriculum for students experiencing anxiety and depression.it also increased social work services and added psychological services.although these proposals incorporated most of wediko recommendations,parents rejected the iep because it did not provide with small classes or the same types of counseling services that he was receiving at wediko.completed the school year at wediko.
before the start of the school year,parents decided that his risk level had decreased to the point where he could function in a less intensive environment.accordingly,parents decided to send him to the phelps school,a residential school located in malvern,pennsylvania,and licensed by the pennsylvania department of education.phelps was closer to home and offered small classes and a supportive environment.
parents filed a due process complaint in august with the office of dispute resolution,and a hearing was conducted by a pennsylvania special hearing officer.parents alleged that the school district had failed to conduct a timely evaluation of and provide specialized educational services,in violation of the idea.they sought compensatory education for the time period between the fall of and december and reimbursement for the cost of placements at wediko and phelps.
the hearing officer issued a written administrative decision and order denying relief on january.she concluded that the school district had no obligation to evaluate or provide him with specialized educational services between and spring of because,although the record suggested that was emotionally disturbed,there was no evidence that condition was affecting his ability to learn at that time.the hearing officer remarked that whether the school district had an obligation to evaluate and provide him with specialized services in the fall of,after it learned of his september and november suicide attempts,was a closer question.nevertheless,she determined that even if the school district had committed a procedural violation of the idea,that violation had no substantive effect,as was placed at wediko before the school district would have had time to complete an evaluation,develop an iep,and begin to provide services.because the school district delay did not actually deprive of an educational benefit,was not entitled to an award of compensatory education for that period.
the hearing officer then considered whether parents were entitled to compensation for the costs of private placement at wediko or phelps.relying on mary school district of philadelphia,cir,she determined that they were not entitled to reimbursement for the costs of attending wediko because the primary purpose of that placement was the provision of mental health treatment rather than provision of special education.she explained that was placed at wediko because of a health crisis that required immediate treatment.app.this finding was supported by the testimony of father and witnesses from wediko,who emphasized that student needed to attend wediko in order to keep him safe from the effects of his depression,which led to suicide threats and gestures when he was living at home.app.she also noted that the services received while at wediko were based on a treatment plan designed by a clinical psychologist and were not focused primarily on education.
finally,the hearing officer determined that parents were not entitled to compensation for the costs of attending phelps because,at the time that went there,the district had proposed an iep that met all of educational needs.although parents opined that could benefit from smaller class sizes and counseling services such as those provided by the private schools,the hearing officer explained that,under the idea,is entitled to an appropriate program,not an ideal program.app.
on april,munir appealed the hearing officer decision by filing a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the district court adopted the factual findings of the hearing officer,applied the same legal analysis,and granted summary judgment in favor of the school district munir filed this timely appeal,challenging only the district court denial of his request for tuition reimbursement.
the district court had jurisdiction in this matter under and i a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
in deciding cases brought under the idea,district courts apply a modified version of de novo review.ramsey bd.of educ,cir.although the district court must make its own findings by a preponderance of the evidence,it is also required to afford due weight to the factual findings of the hearing officer.id.the due weight standard requires the court to consider the factual findings from the administrative proceedings prima facie correct and,if the court fails to adopt those findings,it must explain its reasons for departing from them.mary,quoting shore,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.we exercise plenary review over the district court legal conclusions and review its factual findings for clear error,at.
on appeal,munir argues that he is entitled to reimbursement for the costs of tuition at wediko and phelps.to be entitled to reimbursement,munir must show that the school district failed to provide with a fape and that the alternative private placement was appropriate.see florence cnty.sch,at mary,at.for placement at a residential program to be appropriate,the program must itself be proper under the idea that is,it must provide significant learning and confer meaningful benefit.mary,at quoting lauren ex rel.jean deflaminis,cir.the court must also find that the residential program is the sort of program that the public school should have taken financial responsibility for in the first place.see,id.at considering whether the school district should have initially been financially responsible for the placement in determining whether a placement was appropriate for purposes of reimbursement see also butler evans,cir same 
the district court determined that munir was not entitled to reimbursement for the costs of attendance at wediko because he could not meet the second prong of the test.that is,placement at wediko was not an appropriate placement because he was placed at wediko to treat his mental health needs,and any educational benefit that he received was incidental.the court further determined that munir was not entitled to reimbursement for the costs of attending phelps because the first prong of the test had not been met when was enrolled at phelps,the school district had offered him an iep that would meet his educational needs.because we perceive no error in the hearing officer comprehensive decision or in the district court thorough review of the case,we will affirm.
parents enrolled him at wediko in january,after he received treatment following a suicide attempt,and stayed at wediko through july.munir seeks reimbursement for the costs of this placement,which amounted to.
munir argues that the school district violated the procedures set out by the idea when it failed to offer an iep until may and that the iep the school district offered then was inadequate.he argues that,as a result of the school district violations,was denied a fape during the school year.he further claims that residential treatment was a necessary ingredient to learning,so placement at wediko from january to july was appropriate.munir br.at.
school districts are responsible for the costs of a disabled child placement in a residential program when that placement is necessary to provide special education and related services.residential placement may be necessary when the disabled child needs a highly structured environment in order to obtain any kind of educational benefit.for example,in kruelle new castle county school district,cir,we explained that the appropriate educational goals for a child with severe mental disabilities and cerebral palsy included the development of basic and social skills such as toilet training.id.at quoting battle commonwealth of,cir.however,the child suffered from emotional problems that prevented him from achieving those goals when he experienced stress,he would induce choking and vomiting,which interfere d fundamentally with his ability to learn.id.at.the student needed consistency of programming and environment to meet his educational goals because of his emotional problems,and we thus found that the school district was responsible for the costs of the residential program.id.at,
school districts are not,however,financially responsible for the placement of students who need supervision for medical,social,or emotional reasons,and receive only an incidental educational benefit from that placement.see mary,at kruelle,at analysis must focus on whether placement may be considered necessary for educational purpos
