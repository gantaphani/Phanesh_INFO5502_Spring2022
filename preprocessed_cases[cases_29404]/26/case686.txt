kathleen koszola sued the board of education of the city of chicago under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,for refusing to hire her for a teaching position because she is white.the board moved for summary judgment at the close of discovery.citing the dearth of facts in koszola submissions pursuant to northern district of illinois local rule,the district court granted the board motion.we affirm,as koszola has provided no evidence showing that she may have suffered discrimination.
koszola rocky tenure with the board began in.while pursuing her bachelor degree in teaching at northeastern illinois university,koszola spent a semester as a student teacher at the dirksen elementary school,a chicago public school.after she graduated in,koszola served as a substitute teacher for the board at a number of public schools on the north side of chicago,located in regions,and of the chicago public schools cps system.koszola never served as a substitute teacher in any school located on chicago south side,which is divided into regions,and.between and,koszola applied for a number of teaching positions with the cps,but she limited her search to schools on the city north and northwest sides.the board never hired her for any of these positions.
in,while she was serving as a substitute teacher at the howe school,located on the city west side in region,koszola car was vandalized.after that negative experience,she refused all assignments at howe,despite the board policy requiring substitute teachers to accept all assignments.the board manager of substitute teacher assignments,ursula anderson,repeatedly attempted to contact koszola after this incident,but she did not respond.anderson then demoted koszola.on april,koszola sent a resignation letter to the board,stating i refuse to work on the west or south side.i want to work on the northwest side,but the board of education says i am the wrong color.i do need this aggravation.i give up teaching.you win.go hire all the blacks and foreigners to balance the employment.i am not going to endanger my life anymore.from august through june,koszola again applied unsuccessfully for cps teaching positions in schools on the north and northwest sides.
since,the board faculty hiring and assignment process for the cps has been governed by a federal consent decree arising from a lawsuit brought by the department of justice alleging that the board maintained a racially segregated school system in violation of the equal protection clause.the decree provides for the establishment of the greatest practicable number of stably desegregated schools,considering all the circumstances in chicago,and,to that end,calls for integration of both the student bodies and faculty of the cps.with respect to faculty assignments,the decree requires that t he board will promptly implement a plan to assure that the assignment of classroom teachers to schools will be made in such a manner that no school is identified as intended for students of a particular race.the decree dictates that with respect to the classroom teachers in each school faculty,the composition and the proportion of experienced teachers will be plus and minus fifteen percent of the systemwide proportions of such teachers with respect to such characteristics,and the range of educational training will be substantially the same as exists in the system as a whole.
on april,koszola filed a complaint against the board in federal district court alleging racial discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the equal protection clause.specifically,she alleged that her applications for employment with the cps had continually been rejected or not considered by defendant because she is caucasian.after discovery closed,the board successfully moved for summary judgment.this appeal followed.

to establish the set of facts that were properly before the district court,a brief review of the procedural history of the case is in order.on july,the board filed its local rule a statement of facts,listing paragraphs of allegedly undisputed facts.among these was paragraph,which stated koszola does not know the name,qualifications,date of assignment,or otherwise have any personal knowledge regarding any persons who were assigned to positions which she sought with the chicago public schools.on september,koszola filed her local rule b response,in which she admitted that she did not dispute these facts in paragraphs of the board filing.she then provided additional statements of fact,including paragraph,which stated with respect to defendant,plaintiff identifies the persons who were hired in her place at oriole park by a black female from texas,hitch by a black female from georgia,canty by an hispanic male teacher,sayre academy by a black female by the name of smith.at the board motion,the court struck a number of paragraphs from koszola response and accompanying affidavit,including paragraph on the ground that it inherently contradicts facts in the board statement that koszola had admitted.in particular,her identification in paragraph of specific schools that had allegedly hired nonwhite teachers and the races of those hired contradicted her admission of the board paragraph.the court then granted koszola five days to resubmit her local rule b statement and supporting affidavit.
on november,koszola submitted a revised local rule b statement and affidavit,which omitted the paragraphs stricken by the district court.inexplicably,koszola again admitted all the factual statements in the board original local rule a statement,including paragraph.in addition,she replaced the text of paragraph in her response with the following in the fall of at a public school plaintiff was substituting regularily sic the principal apologized to plaintiff for never interviewing plaintiff.she explained that she was forced to hire a minority and she told plaintiff that plaintiff was eight times better than the candidate she had.the principle sic nodded to a young black female,identifying her as the one she hired for the position.koszola also atta
