appellant,christopher lehto,appeals from the decision of appellee,board of education of the caesar rodney school district the board,terminating his employment as a teacher on grounds of immorality.lehto appealed his dismissal to the superior court,which affirmed the decision of the board.lehto now appeals to this court,arguing that there is insufficient evidence to support his dismissal.we find no merit in lehto appeal and affirm.
lehto was an art teacher at the star hill elementary school star hill in the caesar rodney school district in camden,delaware the district,for eight years.in early,lehto became involved in a sexual relationship with a female the student who attended polytech senior high school in woodside,delaware at the time,lehto was years old.
lehto was previously the student teacher when she attended star hill.he became reacquainted with his former student in december when she began to come to the elementary school to pick up her younger sibling,who attended star hill at the time.the two soon began to speak on the phone and lehto provided assistance to the student with at least one school project.
the relationship became sexual in nature a few months later and lehto and the student engaged in several instances of sexual contact on one occasion,lehto called in sick and stayed home from work.during school hours,lehto communicated with the student and she came to his home during her lunch hour.they watched a movie and began to kiss,eventually moving to the floor where the student shirt was removed.the couple then moved to lehto bedroom where he fondled and licked the student breasts.they also engaged in grinding,or simulated sexual intercourse,but the episode ended without lehto and the student engaging in actual sexual intercourse.
several other occasions of sexual contact occurred in a parking lot after lehto and the student met for lunch.during these trysts,lehto and the student kissed and lehto licked and fondled the student breasts.on at least one occasion,lehto sexually penetrated the student by putting his hand down her pants and inserting his finger into her vagina 
eventually,the student told a friend about her relationship with lehto and that friend told her parent,who informed the delaware state police.lehto was charged with fourth degree rape based on the student age and his position as a person in a position of trust,authority or supervision over her however,a nolle prosequi was entered on the charge on june,for lack of prosecutive merit 
on july,the board notified lehto of its intention to terminate his services as a teacher because of immorality misconduct in office.at a hearing held on august,the district presented evidence through detective kevin mckay of the delaware state police,who had conducted the investigation of lehto detective mckay had interviewed lehto and the student,both of whom detailed the numerous instances of sexual contact described above.in an effort to show that the relationship had not affected his job performance,lehto presented evidence of his teaching evaluations,all of which had been positive.lehto also presented proof that the state dismissed the rape charge initially filed against him.
on august,the board issued its written decision terminating lehto.the board found that there was no factual dispute that the relationship between lehto and the student was of a sexual nature.it concluded that lehto conduct in initiating and engaging in a sexual relationship with a minor constituted immorality,violated the common mores of society,and provided just cause for his termination.the board noted such conduct certainly interferes with lehto important function of serving as a role model to the students in his school,and threatens the moral and social orientation of such students.the board based its finding of immorality on the fact that the relationship sends the wrong message to students of the district regarding appropriate relationships between teachers and students and that the referenced relationship evinces a serious lack of judgment that is far below the standard of such judgment acceptable for teachers employed by the caesar rodney school district.
lehto appealed to the superior court,arguing that there was no substantial evidence in the record or any legal basis to support the board ruling.particularly,lehto focused on the fact that the student did not attend a school within the district,that he did not engage in criminal activity,and that the affair had no impact on his professional duties.the superior court acknowledged that t he definition of immorality does not lend itself to methodical application,and found that the board determination that lehto could no longer serve as an effective role model to the students in his school because of his conduct was supported by substantial evidence.the superior court affirmed the board decision and this appeal followed 
when reviewing an appeal from a decision of a board of education,we apply the substantial evidence review standard substantial evidence has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.if there was presented substantial and credible evidence to support the charges and a fair administrative hearing was had,the superior court can not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the school authorities.
immorality requires a nexus with fitness to teach 
the board terminated lehto because of immorality pursuant to,which provides 
termination at the end of the school year shall be for or more of the following reasons immorality,misconduct in office,incompetency,disloyalty,neglect of duty,willful sic and persistent insubordination,a reduction in the number of teachers required as a result of decreased enrollment or a decrease in education services.the board shall have power to suspend any teacher pending a hearing if the situation warrants such action 
immorality is not defined in this statute,or anywhere else in.ch.however,in skripchuk austin the superior court addressed the meaning of immorality as follows 
although there might be disagreement about the meaning of immorality in some cases,by the very nature of the term,which refers to the common mores of society,one would expect broad agreement in most cases.moreover,the term will be construed in the context in which it appears in this chapter to refer to such immorality as may reasonably be found to impair the teacher effectiveness by reason of his unfitness or otherwise.
we adopt this definition for purposes of section.
consistent with skripchuk,a majority of courts have required that a nexus exist between the conduct and a teacher duties before allowing termination of the teacher based on immorality.an early decision in this area was morrison state board of education in which california state board of education,acting pursuant to a state statute,revoked a teacher life diplomas because he had engaged in immoral conduct.the california supreme court ruled that the statute upon which the revocation was based was not unconstitutionally vague,but only to the extent that its immoral conduct were construed to implicate only conduct that impacts the fitness to teach since morrison,numerous courts have similarly interpreted analogous statutes to require a nexus that nexus typically focuses on how the conduct may affect the teacher ability to teach,which includes the teacher ability to maintain discipline in the classroom,the effect the act will have on the teacher students,and the attitudes of the teacher students parents.additionally,acts for which a teacher is being disciplined need not be limited to interactions,but must relate to fitness as a teacher and must have an adverse effect on or within the school community.we conclude that in cases involving termination for immorality,this nexus test strikes a proper balance under section for school boards to apply.
the nexus was sufficient to support lehto termination 
the record demonstrates a sufficient nexus between the undisputed sexual relationship between lehto and the student and lehto fitness to teach.lehto argues to the contrary and cites performance reviews that predate the
