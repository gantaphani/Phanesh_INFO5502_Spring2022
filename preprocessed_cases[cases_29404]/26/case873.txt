james and jamie costello the costellos,and their daughter sadonya costello sadonya collectively,the plaintiffs,appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of mitchell public school district,the school board and superintendent of mitchell public schools,the principal of mitchell high school mitchell or the school,and a teacher at mitchell collectively,defendants.we affirm.
in this appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.we begin with a brief note on terminology.according to the lexicon of special education services,an sat is a student assistance team,which evaluates students,attempts to assist teachers in providing general education,and may refer a child to a multidisciplinary team mdt for further evaluation.an mdt is responsible for determining if a child has a verified disability under the regulations and for developing and implementing an individual education plan to ensure that child receives an appropriate education.
during her first four years at morrill elementary school in morrill,nebraska,sadonya received special education services.by fifth grade,however,she was not verified as having a disability sufficient to qualify her for the provision of special education services under nebraska regulations,see.regs.tit,ch,a.in may of,for example,a report issued by her mdt indicated that sadonya had no disability.in may of,however,after sadonya year,another mdt report concluded that sadonya was disabled by an other health impairment and that she should have more testing.this determination,however,was not supported by a written report of a physician detailing her current health status and its implications,a requirement under nebraska law.see.regs.tit,ch.
in the summer of,the costellos completed the appropriate paperwork to have sadonya and her older brother attend mitchell high school,where sadonya accordingly matriculated for seventh grade during the school year.her educational records were transferred from morrill to mitchell.
at the beginning of the fall semester,principal kent halley,guidance counselor joe yauney,and special education teacher carey brown met to discuss sadonya medical records and concluded that she was not eligible for special education services because her disability had not been verified under nebraska law.brown testified that this was an sat meeting.sadonya was informally monitored,however,and during the first semester mitchell staff saw no indication that sadonya would need special education services.both halley and brown observed that sadonya grades were generally average,that she was very social,and that she seemed to be well accepted by her peers.her grades dropped somewhat during the second quarter of that semester,however,and by the end she was failing band class.
several weeks into the semester the costellos became aware of the fact that sadonya was not receiving special education services when sadonya reported that she was not receiving occupational therapy.during the next few months,and particularly in the spring of,many contacts occurred between the costellos and mitchell high school administrators and staff regarding sadonya status.the costellos signed a release so that sadonya doctors could send information on her health to the school.the diagnoses and evaluations the school received,however,were outdated and did not explain sadonya current status.for example,several letters stated that sadonya had previously been diagnosed with epileptic seizures,attention deficit disorder,and unspecified learning disabilities,but did not give her current status and abilities.one report did indicate,however,that sadonya was currently taking phenobarbitol.
at the end of her first semester at mitchell,sadonya was having difficulty with her band teacher,roger kercher.she testified in her deposition that he daily called her retarded,stupid,and dumb,in front of her classmates.in one instance,after belittling her in front of the class for a bad grade on an assignment in her notebook,he threw the notebook at her,hitting her in the face.during a basketball game in either late december or early january at which the band was playing,sadonya came to her mother and explained that kercher had just told her that she could no longer play in the band because she was too stupid and that he did not have to teach students like her and that he would not.jamie costello asked kercher about it,who just laughed and said yeah,something like that.
jamie costello subsequently met with halley,yauney,kercher,and sadonya therapist about the problems with band,although kercher became angry and left the meeting.during the meeting,jamie costello asked sadonya therapist what she thought about sadonya remaining in band class,and she said if kercher feels that way,sadonya not going to gain anything by being in one of his classes.sadonya was then removed from band and placed in a required music appreciation class,which was also taught by kercher.sadonya completed the music appreciation class despite kercher comments.several other students and parents mentioned to jamie costello that kercher had also been verbally,and occasionally physically,abusive toward other students in his classes.
early in the second semester,principal halley convened an sat meeting with sadonya and various staff members,including yauney and sadonya social studies teacher,to discuss ways to improve sadonya academic situation.sadonya subsequently signed a contract with mitchell that required her to ask for more help from teachers when she needed it.sadonya grades continued to drop during the spring,however,and the costellos were sent several notices in january,march,and may about her failing grades.sadonya also was less social and had more absences than during the prior semester.mitchell staff members sent letters on behalf of the school seeking additional information from various health professionals about sadonya current impairments and contacted the costellos about the need for more medical information.in the absence of such information,sadonya case stalled and she received no formal special education services.
in may of,mark scanlan,a psychiatrist,wrote a letter to mitchell,concluding that if sadonya returns to school at this point her situation would only worsen,both physically and mentally.sadonya has been since that time.she has suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts and receives counseling and treatment.
sadonya and her parents filed suit in the district court,bringing three claims,two for violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution and one for violations of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,the americans with disabilities act ada,and the rehabilitation act.they also brought separate claims under the idea,ada,and rehabilitation act and a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.all claims were brought against mitchell school district and the board of education of mitchell public schools,as well as against kercher,halley,and district superintendent donald wagner,individually and in their official capacities.
on november,the district court granted partial summary judgment against the costellos and sadonya,holding that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and dismissing on the merits the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.on september,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants.the costellos and sadonya appeal.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.henerey city of charles,cir.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
due process clause 
the costellos and sadonya argue that they have a liberty interest in sadonya education and that the school district acquiescence in kercher harassment constituted a violation of substantive due process.they also allege a procedural due process violation,arguing that the defendants were required to provide special education services to sadonya.
assuming the existence of a protected liberty interest,we turn first to the procedural due process issue.the record shows that sadonya disability was not verified.her records at morrill elementary show her as a student with a disability consisting of an other health impairment,but they lack the required written report detailing her current health status.see.regs.tit,ch.accordingly,mitchell informed the costellos that more information was needed.mitchell subsequently followed appropriate procedures to determine sadonya entitlement to special educational services.an sat monitored sadonya,considered all facets of her adjustment to mitchell,and concluded independently that she did not qualify for special education services.accordingly,we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on a procedural due process violation.
we also conclude that the plaintiffs substantive due process claim,based on kercher verbal harassment of sadonya,fails.to establish a substantive due process claim,the plaintiffs must show that the government actions either shock the conscience or offend judicial notions of fairness or human dignity.young city of charles,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although kercher behavior,as alleged by the plaintiffs,strikes us as being singularly unprofessional,we conclude that the plaintiffs have not raised a genuine issue of material fact on whether his behavior was sufficiently shocking to the conscience to state a substantive due process claim.see collins city of harker heights,d abeyta chama valley indep.sch,cir teacher repeatedly calling student a prostitute and turning a deaf ear while her classmates did so held not to constitute a substantive due process violation.
equal protection 
plaintiffs acknowledge that a disability like retardation is not a classification calling for a more exacting standard of judicial review than is normally accorded economic and social legislation.heidemann rother,cir quoting city of cleburne cleburne living,d.a plaintiff may bring an equal protection claim as a class of one where she alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam.
the plaintiffs argue that sadonya removal from band class violated her equal protection rights.we conclude that the plaintiffs have not raised a genuine issue of material fact on whether removing sadonya from the band was rationally related to a legitimate governmental,providing sadonya with a public education that is conducive to learning.although removal from band may not have been the only option available to mitchell,we conclude that there is no issue of material fact about whether this determination was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.see heidemann,at finding no equal protection violation where restraint technique was not beyond the scope of professionally acceptable choices.
c.the idea 
the idea was intended to ensure that children with disabilities receive an education that is both appropriate and free.florence cty.sch.dist.carter,d d a.under the idea,a child with a disability is defined as having one of certain enumerated conditions,which includes other health impairments.a i.under nebraska law,a diagnosis of other health impairment must include the analysis and documentation of such an impairment in a signed,written report from a physician which describes the current health status and gives any medical implications of the impairment.regs.tit,ch.the parents of a child who has a disability within the meaning of the idea are entitled to written prior notice whenever the local educational agency proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child.b.
in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the idea claim,the district court found that the costellos and sadonya had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on whether sadonya had a verified disability.the plaintiffs argue that mitchell violated the idea because sadonya did not receive special education services despite a verified disability and because they did not receive proper notice that sadonya services would be discontinued when she entered mitchell.
although morrill elementary treated sadonya as having a verified other health impairment,her records from that school lacked the necessary physician report on sadonya current health impairments.mitchell was required under the appropriate regulations to determine if sadonya was qualified for special education services at her current level of functioning,not her past levels.see.regs.tit,ch.accordingly,mitchell properly did not consider sadonya as a child with a disability within the meaning of the idea.
turning to the procedural issue,the idea requires parental notice whenever an educational agency proposes to initiate or change or refuses to initiate or change the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child.b.the idea does not refer to verified disabilities.that term occurs only in nebraska administrative code the idea contemplates that the parents of a child in any stage of the verification process receive prior written notice of all initiations or refusals of action by the agency.mitchell identified and evaluated sadonya,but it refused to institute an educational placement that included special education services.this is a refusal within the meaning of the idea.thus,sadonya parents should have received the written notice required by c,which details the specific information an educational agency must include in the notice.
not all procedural errors result in a loss of educational opportunity.see pawlet sch,cir heather wisconsin,cir quoting bd.of trustees,cir.despite the failure to provide the notice required by.mitchell requested,both orally and in writing,a current medical report.in response to these requests,the plaintiffs provided only outdated diagnoses that did not describe any current health impairment.in light of their failure to provide information that might well have helped mitchell in its continuing efforts to evaluate sadonya condition,the plaintiffs will not now be heard to complain of mitchell failure to comply literally with the terms of the relevant statutes.accordingly,we conclude that the court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on the idea claim.
d.the ada and rehabilitation act 
the plaintiffs argue that sadonya was disabled within the meaning of the ada because she has a disability,was regarded as disabled,or has a record of disability,and that the defendants therefore violated the ada and rehabilitation act by denying her the benefits of participating in band class.see no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity see also a 
under the ada,disability is defined as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.w hether a person has a disability under the ada is an individualized inquiry.sutton united air lines,d.an impairment is substantially limiting if it renders an individual unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform,or if it significantly restricts the condition,manner,or duration under which an individual can perform such an activity compared to the general population.j i ii.major life activities include learning.i.
sadonya and her parents point to her past impairment diagnoses to support a claim of actual disability.they present no evidence,however,of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits sadonya in the life activity of learning.the evidence demonstrates that it is more difficult for her to learn than for her peers,but that th
