the education resources institute and pennsylvania higher education assistance agency appellants appeal an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court order discharging geoffrey ifenay ekenasi student loan debts pursuant to west supp.because we conclude that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in discharging ekenasi student loans more than two years before ekenasi scheduled completion of his confirmed chapter plan,we reverse.
ekenasi is a native of nigeria.he obtained a degree in political science at the university of lagos,nigeria,in.in the late,he emigrated to the united states.upon arriving in this country,he worked briefly in a factory and,for several years,as a taxi driver in new york city.
while working as a taxi driver,ekenasi learned that he could attend law school in the united states and pay for his postgraduate education through student loans sponsored by the federal government.he was accepted to the west virginia university college of law,enrolled in classes in,and graduated on schedule in.in,ekenasi passed the west virginia bar examination and obtained a license to practice law in that state.all of this was made possible by his receipt of nearly in student loans.
in august,ekenasi filed a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code and a proposed chapter plan the plan.at the time,ekenasi was employed as a paralegal with the west virginia tax department,a temporary position he had accepted while studying to pass the bar examination and seeking employment as a licensed attorney.as a paralegal,ekenasi was earning a salary of approximately per year and a net monthly income of.he claimed total monthly expenses of,which included a student loan payment.his petition also claimed six children of minority age who resided with him in the united states.ekenasi estimated the,unsecured claims against him to be in student loan debt and in other unsecured debt,for a total of.
based upon his income and expenses,including the per month student loan payment,ekenasi claimed excess income of per month.he proposed to make scheduled payments in the amount of per month to the bankruptcy trustee for months for distribution towards his general unsecured,loan creditors only,while continuing to make his student loan payment directly to the student loan creditors.the plan proposed that cause exist ed to extend ekenasi payment of the debt over a period of more than months due to ekenasi desire to pay student loans outside the plan and pay of the general unsecured debt through the trustee.see d west supp providing that a chapter plan may not provide for payments over a period that is longer than three years,unless the court,for cause,approves a longer period,but the court may not approve a period that is longer than five years.
in february,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming ekenasi chapter plan.thus,ekenasi approved plan,including its exception of the student loan creditors from any portion of the payment made to the bankruptcy trustee,was premised upon his choice to continue making the student loan payment outside the plan and directly to the student loan creditors.ekenasi also obtained an extended payment period towards his other unsecured creditors by pointing to the very same choice.
then,in may,ekenasi instituted this adversary proceeding,seeking a discharge of his student loan debts in their entirety on the basis that they imposed an undue hardship upon him.since filing his chapter plan,however,ekenasi had passed the west virginia bar examination and secured employment as an attorney with the west virginia bureau of child support enforcement with a starting salary of per year.in his complaint,ekenasi represented that he was unmarried but living in the same household as his with his six children ranging in age from four years to seventeen years old.by,ekenasi salary had increased to and,by the time trial in the adversary proceeding commenced in december,ekenasi salary had increased to per double the salary he was earning when he filed his proposed chapter plan claiming in excess monthly income.also by this time,two of the six children residing with ekenasi in this country had achieved majority status.however,ekenasi testified that he had three additional children ages,and living in nigeria who were dependent upon him for support and that he was subject to a nigerian court order for such support in the monthly amount of per child.
in january,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting ekenasi a complete discharge of his student loan debts based on undue hardship.although noting that ekenasi had the education necessary to practice law,the bankruptcy court found that ekenasi nationality and language skills impose d a barrier to his practicing law in a private practice setting or in a corporate setting.additionally,the bankruptcy court found that ekenasi had nine children who were dependent upon him for support,including three children in nigeria to whom he was obligated under a foreign support order requiring him to pay per month.based primarily upon these factors,the bankruptcy court found that ekenasi did not possess a reasonable likelihood of an increase in income and would not likely have additional disposable income to utilize towards paying back these student loans after he completed payments under the chapter plan.these findings were made approximately two years before the scheduled conclusion of ekenasi chapter plan.the district court affirmed on appeal.
