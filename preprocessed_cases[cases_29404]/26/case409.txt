in the early morning hours of november,tigrett and kintz the appellants,along with three of their fraternity brothers,richard smith,wes kaupinen,and wes mccluney,travelled to a convenience store in charlottesville,virginia.while returning from the store,they encountered alexander kory,another university student,walking on the school main grounds.kory then engaged in a hostile verbal exchange with at least one of the five men,and the exchange escalated to the point where mccluney stopped his vehicle and smith,kaupinen,and the appellants exited from it.kaupinen avoided further hostilities by returning to the fraternity house,but the appellants confronted kory.in an effort to calm the situation,smith instructed kory to leave,and he directed the appellants to return to the automobile.kory then called smith a fat ass,and in response smith punched kory in the face.the appellants also may have kicked and attacked kory,and,as a result,kory suffered extensive injuries to his face,jaw,and teeth.a few days after the incident,smith turned himself in to the university police,and he later brought the other four appellants,plus mccluney and him to the police station.all five students then made voluntary statements to the university authorities.on december,pursuant to the procedures of the university judiciary committee ujc,kory initiated a student disciplinary complaint against smith,mccluney,and the appellants 
the ujc is a disciplinary body of the university with responsibility for investigating and hearing complaints involving student misconduct,particularly violations of the university standards of conduct usoc pursuant to its,a ujc trial must be convened within a reasonable time after the filing of a complaint,and an accused must be accorded reasonable notice of any charges and of the time and place for trial.in each case,a ujc member is appointed as investigator,and he meets with the complainant,the accused,and other witnesses to ascertain the facts underlying the complaint.the investigator compiles a report,which is usually presented at a ujc trial.the trial is conducted before a panel of seven members of the ujc.pursuant to ujc,decisions of a trial panel are automatically subject to review by the university vice president for student affairs.if the vice president for student affairs concludes that the decision of the trial panel is inappropriate,he may remand the matter to the ujc,or he may refer it to an independent body called the judicial review board jrb,which is composed of faculty,administrators,and students the jrb possesses the authority to remand the case to the ujc for a new trial,or it may reverse or modify the trial panel decision.
kory complaint alleged that smith,mccluney,and the appellants violated section of the usoc,which prohibits physical or sexual assault and section of the usoc,by blocking traffic on university property because mccluney was scheduled to graduate at the end of the following semester,the vice president for student affairs,william harmon,determined that he would not be subjected to a ujc trial.instead,harmon reprimanded mccluney and required that he attend aggression counselling sessions before he could receive his university diploma.the ujc initially scheduled the trial of smith and the appellants collectively,the ujc defendants for february,but the trial was postponed pending resolution of criminal charges in the state court of albemarle county,virginia.
in may,smith was convicted in state court of assault and battery,on the basis of a nolo contendere plea.the appellants and mccluney also entered pleas of nolo contendere and were convicted of disorderly conduct.the ujc thereafter rescheduled the trial of the ujc defendants for november,before a ujc panel the ujc panel.
prior to their trial the ujc trial,the disciplinary charges against the ujc defendants were amended to include a charge under section of the usoc,which prohibits disorderly conduct according to the investigator,the ujc defendants were notified of the section charge when they received his report,which occurred at least hours before the ujc trial was scheduled 
on november,the day before trial was to begin,the ujc defendants,along with smith father and his student counsel,met with vice president harmon to express concerns about the trial.after the appellants left the meeting,smith and his father continued their discussions with harmon.smith subsequently asserted as do the appellants on appeal that harmon assured him that the trial would not go forward the next day.at approximately seven that evening,smith student counsel filed a motion requesting that the trial be postponed,which the ujc denied later that night.smith student counsel promptly advised the ujc defendants that their trial would be conducted as scheduled,but they nevertheless decided not to attend.because harmon had represented that the trial would not proceed,the ujc defendants believed that any trial conducted in their absence would be invalid.
although the ujc defendants failed to attend,their trial was conducted the next day.following presentation of the prosecution evidence,the ujc panel found each of the ujc defendants guilty on all three charges violating section physical assault,section blocking traffic,and section disorderly conduct,and the panel recommended their expulsions from the university.by letters of november,the ujc informed the three ujc defendants of the expulsion sanctions,and it advised them of their right to appeal the decisions to the jrb.these letters failed to reflect that,pursuant to the ujc,the decisions were automatically subject to review by the vice president for student affairs,vice president harmon.on november,the ujc wrote to harmon,requesting finalization of its expulsion sanctions.without a response from or the approval of harmon,the ujc then wrote the university registrar,on november,requesting that she mark enrollment discontinued on the transcripts of the ujc defendants.after consulting with harmon,however,the registrar did not mark anything on their transcripts,and she declined to discontinue their enrollments.instead,the registrar wrote the words not processed at the bottom of the ujc letters.
on november,vice president harmon declined to finalize the expulsions.he instead acknowledged perceived procedural irregularities and misunderstandings,and he referred the case to the jrb.pursuant to the jrb procedures for appeals,the ujc defendants each appealed to the jrb.the chairperson of the jrb then appointed a appellate review panel,consisting of a professor,an administrator,and a student,to handle their appeals.on february,the review panel set aside the recommended expulsions and remanded the case to the ujc for a new trial.
following remand,the ujc convened a new trial panel and scheduled a second trial for april.on april,it again notified the ujc defendants that they were charged with violations of sections,and of the usoc.prior to the new trial,however,allegations of bias surfaced concerning the panel chair,who recused herself.this panel was disbanded,and the ujc then determined that it lacked sufficient membership to form another panel and resolve the charges in a timely manner by letter of may,the ujc relinquished control of the case,referring the matter to harmon for disposition 
vice president harmon then appointed a factfinding panel,consisting of a law student a member of the ujc,a professor,and three administrators,to hear the pending charges the panel by letters of may,harmon notified the ujc defendants that the charges against them would be heard by the panel,and they were advised that this panel would not be governed by the rules and practices of the ujc.harmon further informed them that t he panel will make findings of fact with respect to the pending charges and recommend an appropriate sanction to the president or his designee in the event of a finding of guilt.harmon also specified that president casteen would be the ultimate,and that the appellants would have the right to appeal the president decision to the jrb on the grounds that the sanction was unduly harsh,clearly excessive or grossly inappropriate to the offense,or for procedural error in violation of due process that had a substantial negative impact on the outcome.the jrb would be the final appeal except on written permission to the board of visitors in the case of expulsion.
the panel convened its trial on may,the trial.at the trial outset,smith entered a plea of guilty to sections,and of the usoc the appellants,on the other hand,tendered not guilty pleas to all three charges.the panel then conducted a trial at which witnesses were examined and evidence was presented.shortly thereafter,the panel completed its report of fact finding panel the report,and,by letter of may,forwarded it to the university president,john casteen,iii,and copied it to the ujc defendants.the report concluded that the appellants had engaged in behavior which threatened the health or safety of kory,and it found them guilty of violating section of the usoc.additionally,the report unanimously found that they had engaged in disorderly conduct on property,and it found them guilty of violating section of the usoc.however,the panel decided that it could not fairly conclude that the facts constituted an unlawful blocking of normal pedestrian traffic,and it therefore found the appellants not guilty of violating section of the usoc.the report recommended that smith be suspended for two consecutive semesters which could include one summer session and that he be required to perform hours of community service.it also recommended that the appellants be suspended for one semester not to include a summer session and that they each perform hours of community service.in response to the report,the appellants lawyers,by letters of may,and june,urged casteen to reject the recommendations.
after reviewing the report,the transcript of the trial,and the correspondence of the appellants lawyers,president casteen,on june,affirm ed the findings of guilt reached by the panel.he adopted the report recommended sanction as to kintz,imposing academic suspension for one semester plus hours of community service.as to smith and tigrett,however,casteen imposed more severe sanctions than had been recommended by the report.with regard to smith,he imposed two full years of academic suspension,rather than the suspension recommended by the panel,plus hours of community service.casteen suspended tigrett for a full academic year,instead of the one semester recommended by the panel,and he imposed hours of community service.tigrett promptly appealed casteen sanction to the jrb.his appeal was rejected on june,when the jrb determined that his case was final under university procedure.
shortly thereafter,on october,tigrett filed an complaint in the western district of virginia against the rector and visitors of the university,president casteen,vice president harmon,the members of the board of visitors the board,the members of the ujc panel,and the members of the panel collectively,the university defendants tigrett alleged ten separate due process and first amendment claims under,as well as a state law contract claim,all arising from the handling of the student disciplinary charges made against him.on december,the university defendants moved for dismissal of the complaint,or,in the alternative,for summary judgment on the various claims.by opinion and order of may,the district court addressed the university defendants contentions,tigrett rector and visitors of the of virginia,d.in that opinion,the court determined that the rector and visitors of the university were immune from suit and it dismissed them.it further concluded that the university defendants were immune from monetary damages in their official capacities,but that they were subject to suit in their personal capacities and for injunctive relief.with regard to tigrett specific claims,the court dismissed his state law contract claim,except to the extent that it sought prospective injunctive relief,and it partially granted the university defendants motion for summary judgment.
on april,kintz filed a separate civil action against the university defendants,which contained allegations nearly identical to those made by tigrett in his october,complaint.on august,kintz lawsuit was consolidated with what remained of tigrett claims.on january,the university defendants sought summary judgment on the claims of the appellants.the court thereafter issued its memorandum opinion and order of march,awarding summary judgment to the university defendants on all of the remaining claims.tigrett rector visitors of the of virginia,d.with no federal claims remaining in the case,the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the appellants state law contract claims,and it dismissed those as well.the appellants filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to

in their appeal,the appellants maintain that the district court erred in three specific respects in its award of summary judgment to the university defendants.first,they contend that the trial conducted in their absence by the ujc panel resulted in their expulsion from the university,and that the trial violated their fourteenth amendment due process rights.second,they assert that the court erred in concluding that they possessed no due process right to appear before president casteen,the final in their case.finally,they maintain that the court failed to recognize that casteen,harmon,and the members of the board violated their due process rights by failing to properly instruct,train,supervise,and control the ujc panel.we address each of these contentions in turn.
the appellants first assert that the ujc panel in fact expelled them from the university,and that it did so in a manner that violated their fourteenth amendment due process rights.specifically,they maintain that their due process rights were contravened because they did not receive adequate notice that the ujc trial was going forward they had no opportunity to appear and defend themselves they had no opportunity to witnesses they failed to receive adequate notice of the disorderly conduct charge and the ujc panel violated its internal procedures by,inter alia,allowing the participation of outside attorneys.each of these claims must fail,however,because the appellants were not expelled from the university by the ujc panel,and hence they could not have been deprived of any constitutionally protected fourteenth amendment interest.
