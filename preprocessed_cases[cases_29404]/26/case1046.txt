this is a first amendment student speech case.
one january day,and other private sponsors supported a winter olympics torch relay in juneau,alaska.students were released from school so that they could watch the olympic torch pass by.joseph frederick,then an senior at high school,never made it to school that morning because he got stuck in the snow in his driveway,but he made it to the sidewalk,across from the school,where the torch would pass by.he and some friends waited until the television cameras would catch it,then unfurled a banner reading bong hits jesus.deborah morse,the school principal,crossed the street,grabbed and crumpled up the banner,and suspended frederick for ten days.he appealed the suspension administratively,but it was sustained.he then filed a action in the federal district court seeking declaratory and other relief.
there was disorder at the torch passing,but the uncontradicted evidence is that it had nothing to do with frederick and his fellow.handed out samples in plastic bottles,and students threw them at each other.students threw snowballs.some students got into fights.but frederick and his group did not participate in these disorders,saving their energy for what they hoped would be their nationally televised sign display.and,the disruption that took place occurred before the display of the banner,so it could not have been caused by it.
in subsequent days,there was some graffiti in the high school which the principal thought was sparked by the banner,but the principal did not rip down the sign at the rally because she anticipated or was concerned about such possible consequences.when principal morse crossed the street from the school and confronted frederick about the banner,he asked what about the bill of rights and freedom of speech she told him to take the banner down because she felt that it violated the policy against displaying offensive material,including material that advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs,and she grabbed it from him and crumpled it up.
in their answers to interrogatories,appellees never contend that the display of the banner disrupted or was expected to disrupt classroom work.asked for all the ways in which the banner display disrupted the educational process,they said 
display of the banner would be construed by many,including students,district personnel,parents and others witnessing the display of the banner,as advocating or promoting illegal drug use which is inconsistent with the district basic educational mission to promote a healthy,life style.failure to react to the display would appear to give the district imprimatur to that message and would be inconsistent with the district responsibility to teach students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior.
there are some genuine disputes about the facts,but they are not material to the resolution of this case.frederick says that the principal initially told him that he was suspended for five days,but when he quoted thomas jefferson to her,she doubled it.the principal says that she does not remember whether he quoted jefferson to her,but that was not why the suspension was ten days.frederick says that an assistant principal told him that the bill of rights does not exist in schools and does not apply until after graduation,but principal morse says that the assistant principal made some remark to the effect that students do not have the same first amendment rights as adults.frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored olympic torch being carried through a public street,and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released,as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off of the school premises.principal morse says that the release was an approved social event or class trip,noting that the pep band played as the torch passed the school,the cheerleaders were out in uniform to greet the torchbearers,and teachers supervised.
frederick says without contradiction that he had not gone to school that day prior to the banner display,that the banner display was off school property across glacier avenue from the campus,and that there were a lot of people,students and,there to watch the torch pass.other students filed affidavits saying that they were just released,not required to stay together or with their teachers,except for the gym class,and school administrators did not attempt to stop students who got bored and left.frederick says that the bong hits jesus language was designed to be meaningless and funny,in order to get on television,but principal morse says that bong hits means puffs of marijuana and the words promote marijuana use.
frederick was suspended for ten days,and appealed unsuccessfully through all levels of available administrative and school board review.he sued under for a declaratory judgment that his first amendment rights had been violated,an injunction to remove the reference to the ten day suspension from his school records,damages,and other relief.the district court granted summary judgment for the appellees,on the grounds that no constitutional rights were violated and the appellees had qualified immunity even if they were.frederick appeals.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo the district court reasoned that bethel school district fraser as opposed to tinker des moines independent community school district governed frederick speech.we disagree.
one amicus,drug policy alliance,argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case,but simply as speech on a public sidewalk.that would make the case analogous to a student having an job at a video store that rents out cheech and chong tapes,or a student driving a car on public streets with a bong hits jesus bumper sticker.were this factually such a case,the law would be easy indeed,but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case.even though frederick never got to school that morning,that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow.school had started and the students were released to watch the olympic torch pass.and even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent,the school could have supervised them more if it chose to,as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders.frederick was a student,and school was in session.
there is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision.frederick display was not in a class.frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic miniature sample bottles.the school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work.they concede that their objection to the display,and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner,was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny.we nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use,however vague and nonsensical.
thus,the question comes down to whether a school may,in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities,punish and censor,speech by students during activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school.the answer under controlling,precedent is plainly no.
because this is a section case in which the appellees asserted qualified immunity,we are required to proceed in accord with saucier and determine first whether frederick constitutional rights were violated.this is an as applied challenge,not a facial challenge.frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him under tinker des moines independent community school district they plainly were.
in tinker,the supreme court held that wearing black arm bands in high school,unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance on the part of the wearers,and unaccompanied by interference,actual or nascent,with the schools work or of collision with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone,was constitutionally protected speech tinker held that the prohibition of expression of one particular opinion,at least without evidence that it is necessary to avoid material and substantial interference with schoolwork or discipline,is not constitutionally permissible.
tinker disposes of the school board argument that school administrators were entitled to discipline frederick attempt to belittle and undercut this critical mission of preventing use of illegal drugs by a sign that was a parody of the seriousness with which the school takes its mission to prevent use of illegal drugs.under tinker,a school can not censor or punish students speech merely because the students advocate a position contrary to government policy.the tinker armbands were about war.government has no mission in which victory is so important as war.the federal government was,at the time of the facts giving rise to the tinker case,prosecuting a war.government policy was to support and advance the effort to win the war.the black armbands in tinker expressed hostility to the war.by doing so,they legitimized opposition and undermined support for the war.yet the students in high school had a constitutional right to express their opposition to this critically important mission of the federal government.
the two leading supreme court cases that have held against students claiming first amendment rights to speak in a way unacceptable to school administrators are distinguishable.bethel school district held that a high school student did not have a first amendment right to give a sexually suggestive nominating speech for a candidate for student office at a school assembly that was part of a educational program in,where disruption immediately ensued as the student gave the speech fraser holds that high school students rights to free speech in school are not coextensive with adults rights,and pervasive sexual innuendo that is plainly offensive to any mature person can be marked off as impermissible incivility within the school context fraser focuses upon the sexual nature of the offensiveness in the speech that can be punished,as contrasted with the political viewpoint of the speech protected in tinker our case differs from fraser in that frederick speech was not sexual sexual speech can be expected to stimulate disorder among those new to adult hormones,and did not disrupt a school assembly.also,it is not so easy to distinguish speech about marijuana from political speech in the context of a state where referenda regarding marijuana legalization repeatedly occur and a controversial state court decision on the topic had recently issued the phrase bong hits jesus may be funny,stupid,or insulting,depending on one point of view,but it is not plainly offensive in the way sexual innuendo is.
hazelwood school district kuhlmeier is similarly distinguishable.in kuhlmeier,the supreme court held that high school students did not have a first amendment right to publish articles on pregnancy and divorce in a school newspaper over the principal objection,where the newspaper was produced in a class on journalism,edited by the journalism teacher as part of the teaching of the class,and paid for with school money the court distinguished tinker on the ground that t he question whether the first amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student question that we addressed in different from the question whether the first amendment requires a school affirmatively to promote particular student speech.this student newspaper was part of the school curriculum.exclusion of any first amendment duty to promote a student viewpoint means that a school necessarily retains authority to refuse to sponsor speech such as frederick,which arguably promotes drug use kuhlmeier does not control the case at bar,however,because frederick banner was not sponsored or endorsed by the school,nor was it part of the curriculum,nor did it take place as part of an official school activity.kuhlmeier might apply had frederick insisted on making his bong hits jesus banner in art class,but that is not what the record shows.his display took place out of school while students were released so that they could watch a and olympics activity.
leaving kuhlmeier out of the analysis,because no sponsorship or curricular activity was involved,the question is how far tinker goes to protect such student speech as frederick,and how far fraser goes to protect school authority to censor and punish student speech that would undermine the school basic educational mission.there has to be some limit on the school authority to define its mission in order to keep fraser consistent with the bedrock principle of tinker that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.had the school in that case defined its mission as instilling patriotic duty or promoting support for national objectives,it still could not have punished the students for wearing the black.all sorts of missions are undermined by legitimate and protected school mission would be undermined by a student passing around copies of john lott book,more guns,less crime a school mission would be undermined by a student links to a medical study showing less heart disease among moderate drinkers than teetotalers and a school traffic safety mission would be undermined by a student circulating copies of articles showing that traffic cameras and automatic ticketing systems for cars that run red lights increase accidents 
public schools are instrumentalities of government,and government is not entitled to suppress speech that undermines whatever missions it defines for itself.what schools are entitled to do,as fraser makes clear,is suppress speech that disrupts the good order necessary to conduct their educational function.no educational function was disrupted by the banner displayed during the sponsored olympics event.one can hypothesize events for which the students might be released that would be educational and curricular in nature and would be disrupted by speech such as frederick.for example,on a school field trip as part of the social studies curriculum to observe a court in session,it might be the case that the school could ban the wearing of cohen famous jacket but a coca cola promotion as the olympic torch passed by on a public street was not such an event.
we have no ninth circuit authority precisely on point,but what we do have is consistent with the above analysis.in burch barker we held that a school could not require prior approval for a student newspaper produced outside the school before it was distributed on school grounds to students,distinguishing kuhlmeier because no one could associate the newspaper with school sponsorship or endorsement.burch sorts the cases by the distinction between as opposed to expression.the school board and administrators properly control what is taught,but no similar content control is justified for communication among students which is not part of the educational program.we held that the school should be enjoined to purge the records of reprimands for violating the policy of the school no doubt the source of frederick prayer for similar relief in this case.
we again upheld student speech rights in chandler mcminnville school district when replacements were used during a teachers strike,some students wore buttons calling the replacement teachers scabs,and were suspended for refusing to take them off.reversing the district court dismissal of the student complaint,we sorted the high school student speech cases in the following manner 
we have discerned three distinct areas of student speech from the supreme court school precedents vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly offensive speech,speech,and speech that falls into neither of these categories.we conclude,as discussed below,that the standard for reviewing the suppression of vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly of
