this case involves charter schools specifically the procedures a charter school sponsor must follow when it decides to immediately terminate a charter pursuant to section d,florida statutes,because good cause has been shown or the health,safety,or welfare of the students is threatened.d.stat the specific issue in this case is whether a school board,as a charter school sponsor,must utilize the provisions of florida administrative procedure act apa,chapter,florida statutes,when immediately terminating a charter.the fourth district court of appeal in survivors charter schools,school board of palm beach county,so d dca,concluded that the apa must be followed when a school board immediately terminates a charter school charter under section d and concluded that immediately essentially meant anything less than ninety days 
the district court decision expressly affects school boards as a class of constitutional or state officers under article ix,section b,florida constitution.therefore,this court has jurisdiction to review the district court decision.see art.v,b.const.
the resolution of this issue is based on statutory interpretation.after a careful review of the governing charter schools statute,pertinent provisions of the apa,and our application of principles of statutory construction to ascertain legislative intent,we conclude that the legislature did not intend for the procedures of the apa to apply to the immediate termination of charter school charters under section d.accordingly,we quash the decision of the fourth district and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.on remand,the fourth district may consider any of the other issues raised by survivors charter schools but not reached,including specific due process and evidentiary issues related to the procedures followed by the school board in this case.
facts and procedural history 
this appeal arose out of the immediate termination by the school board of palm beach county school board of the charters for two charter schools in palm beach county,based on a finding of severe fiscal mismanagement in both charter schools.survivors charter schools,survivors,operated both charter schools,survivors charter school west palm beach survivors wpb and survivors charter school boynton beach survivors bb,under charters granted in and,respectively.both charters included provisions for immediate termination after hours notice.although there had been a history of the school board concerns regarding the fiscal management of both schools,the precipitating event for the immediate termination was an audit report completed on january,which included fourteen findings of fiscal mismanagement by survivors the school board considered the audit report along with the superintendent recommendation to immediately terminate charter agreement due to the severity of the audit findings at a specially noticed meeting on january,at that meeting,the school board heard public comments as well as comments from individuals representing survivors,but there was no presentation of testimony under oath and no formal admission of documents into evidence.at the conclusion of the meeting,the school board voted to terminate the charters and a notice of immediate termination was then to each school.the notice indicated the termination was for good cause because of the severity of the audit findings,based on section d as well as the charter provisions,and would become effective in hours.
survivors appealed to the state board of education,which then referred the matter to the charter school appeal commission csac.the csac held an informal hearing where representatives of survivors spoke but unsuccessfully attempted to proffer evidence.it was the csac position,based upon the florida charter school appeals commission guidelines,that no additional evidence could be considered ultimately,the csac voted that the school board had competent,substantial evidence to support its finding regarding the severity of the audit findings.however,it concluded that although the school board had good cause for the immediate termination of the survivors bb charter,it did not have good cause for the immediate termination of the survivors wpb charter.the csac prepared written recommendations regarding both charter schools,and the matter proceeded to the state board of education for a final decision.the state board of education then held a meeting at which it reviewed the recommendations.the state board of education took comments from representatives of survivors,who raised due process concerns as to the procedures by which the charters had been terminated.the state board ultimately voted to uphold the immediate termination of both charters,rejecting the csac contrary recommendation as to the survivors wpb charter.final orders were entered from which survivors appealed to the fourth district court of appeal.
although multiple issues were raised on appeal,the fourth district determined two key issues whether the administrative procedure act apa applied to the school board charter termination process and,if the apa did apply,what due process protections were required and whether they were provided by the school board.so d at.after reviewing both the apa and the charter school statute,the fourth district concluded that the process leading to the school board termination decision was subject to the apa.id.at.noting that under section c a charter school sponsor may terminate a charter on nonimmediate grounds after giving ninety days notice in writing,the district court concluded,by reading the two provisions together,that for immediate terminations 
under section d,immediate means only something less than ninety days,which clearly encompasses the notice requirement of section b as applied to the school board determination of good cause for termination plus hours notice of termination once good cause is shown based on the charters.
id.at emphasis added.the district court summarized the apa provisions that it held should apply in immediate charter school terminations 
the apa includes defined procedures for providing due process regarding decisions which determine substantial interests.under section b,a ll parties shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing after reasonable notice of not less than days,unless waived by consent of all parties.however,to receive such a hearing,a party is required to file a petition or request for a hearing.a,c.stat.if a hearing is requested and the petition is granted,a hearing will be held and the presiding officer has the power to swear witnesses and take their testimony under oath,to issue subpoenas,and to effect discovery.f.stat the evidence may be received in written form and testimony must be under oath.id.is also permitted.j.additional procedures apply in cases involving disputed issues of material fact.stat.
so d at.the district court then concluded 
i f substantial interests are affected and the apa applies,as we have determined,immediate termination can only mean termination following a determination of good cause subject to the notice requirement and accompanying apa procedures especially where such a requirement allows for more immediate termination than the general termination procedure.as much as the audit report findings may have reflected serious financial transgressions,termination following a determination of good cause can only be so immediate as to afford due process,and due process can only be afforded with fourteen days notice and a hearing under the apa.
after deciding that the apa applied to the procedures the school board was mandated to follow before immediately terminating a charter,the fourth district then analyzed what apa protections applied.it concluded that under the apa,the school board was required to provide reasonable notice of not less than days and to hold a hearing under the apa,where testimony would be taken under oath,subpoenas issued and could occur.because the school board clearly did not follow the apa,the fourth district reversed and remanded so that the termination of survivors charters based on a determination of good cause shown can be considered following proper notice and subject to the due process protections of the apa.in so holding,the fourth district expressly declined to comment on the other specific due process and evidentiary issues raised by survivors.id.at.
the question before this court is whether the school board must adhere to the administrative procedure act when it decides to immediately terminate a charter school charter under section d,florida statutes,or whether it is required to follow only the specific procedures set forth in various provisions contained in section the decision of the fourth district,if upheld,would require pretermination notice and accompanying apa that could take up to ninety days.
as a preliminary matter,certain parties have urged this court to consider matters of policy in reaching a decision as to which statutory procedures control the immediate termination of charter school charters.survivors contends that not requiring adherence to the apa in immediate terminations may allow the school boards to operate on whimsical notions of due process at the leisure of the superintendent.on the other hand,the school board contends that requiring application of the apa to immediate terminations could cause irreparable harm to students or public funds.they,along with the amici,assert that the type of proceeding called for under the apa can realistically consume several months,involving as it might pleadings,motion practice,discovery,hearing,submittals,a final order.
amicus pacific legal foundation weighed in to argue against application of the apa to charter schools.its amicus brief advocates the benefits of charter schools and argues that burdening the charter schools with the costly,complex,and requirements of the apa reduces the flexibility in public education that the charter school statutory scheme was intended to provide and conflicts with the express intent of the legislature in the charter schools statute that a school board may immediately terminate a charter.
we do not express any opinion as to these policy considerations,although they may have merit,because this case does not turn on our view of the better policy,but turns solely on statutory interpretation.in statutory construction,our task is to ascertain the meaning of the phrases and words used in a provision,not to substitute our judgment for that of the legislature.see,tillman state,so d,i t is not this court function to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature as to the wisdom or policy of a particular statute.quoting state rife,so d.
because the provisions of section,the charter schools statute,are central to our analysis,we first discuss the general provisions of that statute.within that discussion,we will focus primarily on the provisions in the statutory scheme that relate to termination of charter school charters.we then provide an overview of the apa and the principles that govern its applicability.finally,using principles of statutory construction,we focus on whether the legislature intended that the procedures set forth in the apa should be followed in immediately terminating charter school charters under section d.
the charter schools statute 
charter schools are nonsectarian public schools that operate under a performance contract charter with a public a district school board or a university.see,a.stat.charter schools were first authorized in florida in in chapter,florida statutes.see ch,laws of.in,the charter school statute was moved to chapter.see ch,laws of.charter schools are considered schools of choice,in that their creation is now authorized under part iii of chapter,florida statutes,titled educational choice.that part provides for several different types of schools of choice,including charter schools.one of the legislatively stated guiding principles for charter schools is that they provide parents with the flexibility to choose among diverse educational opportunities within the state public schools system.stat.private schools,parochial schools,and home education programs are not eligible for charter school status.b.stat.
under the charter school statute,funding for students attending charter schools is provided on the same basis as for students in basic or special public programs,and charter schools are eligible for capital outlay funding under chapter.see.stat.the duties of the district school board include monitoring the revenues and expenditures of the charter schools.see b.stat.
section also sets forth the requirements for eligible students and for employees of charter schools,bases for funding,requirements for charter school facilities,and procedures for charter school performance review.see.stat.finally,section sets forth detailed procedures for the creation and operation of a charter school,as well as termination procedures that apply when a sponsor determines that a charter must be terminated.stat.thus,the statute is comprehensive in its treatment of all aspects of the creation,operation,and termination of charter schools.within this detailed statutory scheme governing charter schools,we focus primarily on the provisions relating to immediate termination of charter school charters and the process set forth in the statute for appeal of charter school terminations.
charter school termination procedures 
central to our decision in this case are the special termination procedures for charter school charters,including when a charter is not renewed or is to be terminated under nonemergency circumstances,as well as procedures for immediate termination of charters for good cause or where the health,safety or welfare of the students is threatened.these two types of terminations are treated in different subsections of.section c,florida statutes,pertains to all terminations other than those requiring immediate action and provides 
c at least days prior to renewing or terminating a charter,the sponsor shall notify the governing body of the school of the proposed action in writing.the notice shall state in reasonable detail the ground for the proposed action and stipulate that the school governing body may,within calendar days after receiving the notice,request an informal hearing before the sponsor.the sponsor shall conduct the informal hearing within calendar days after receiving a written request.the charter school governing body may,within calendar days after receiving the sponsor decision to terminate or refuse to renew the charter,appeal the decision pursuant to the procedure established in subsection.
section d,florida statutes,governing immediate terminations of charters,which was in effect when the school board terminated survivors charters,provides 
d a charter may be terminated immediately if the sponsor determines that good cause has been shown or if the health,safety,or welfare of the students is threatened.the school district in which the charter school is located shall assume operation of the school under these circumstances.the charter schools governing board may,within days after receiving the sponsors decision to terminate the charter,appeal the decision pursuant to the procedure established in subsection.
d.stat.both termination provisions make reference to an appeal pursuant to subsection of section.section c provides that an appeal of the determination of a charter school sponsor,such as the school board,may be taken to the state board of education.see c.stat.under the statute,when an appeal is filed,the state board of education must convene a meeting of the charter school appeal commission csac,which will study and make a recommendation to the state board of education regarding its decision about the pending appeal.c.stat.
the stated purpose of the csac is to assist the commissioner and the state board of education with a fair and impartial review of appeals by applicants whose charter applications have been denied,or whose charter contracts have not been renewed or have been terminated by their sponsors.e.stat.the csac members shall thoroughly review the materials presented to them from the appellant and the sponsor and may request information to clarify the documentation presented to it.e.stat.the csac must provide its recommendation to the state board of education and must include a justification for the recommendation.id.the statute expressly provides that t he decision of the charter school appeal commission is not subject to the provisions of the administrative procedure act.e.stat.
once the recommendation of the csac is provided to the state board of education,the board must either accept or reject the decision of the district school board no later than ninety days after the appeal is filed.the district school board is mandated to implement the decision of the state board of education.c.stat.while t he decision of the state board of education is not subject to the provisions of the administrative procedure act,c.stat,it is final action subject to judicial review.d.stat.because the resolution of this case requires us to determine whether the legislature intended that the chapter apa procedures apply to immediate termination decisions of the charter school sponsor,we proceed to a brief examination of the apa.
the administrative procedure act 
the administrative procedure act,set forth in chapter,florida statutes,is generally applicable to all forms of agency decision making.soon after enactment of the administrative procedure act,the first district confirmed that the apa enforces its discipline on all agency action,unless specifically exempted,which affects the substantial interests of a party.graham contracting,dep t of,so d,dca see also legal envtl.assistance,bd.of county comm rs,so d,the administrative procedure act applies to all administrative agencies in florida.stat.indicating that the legislature and courts are exempt from application of the apa.no one disputes that a school board is an agency as that term is defined in the apa.b.stat.defining agency to include board see also volusia county sch.bd.volusia homes builders ass n,so d,dca holding that county school boards are agencies.
the apa was intended to simplify the administrative process and provide the public with a more certain administrative procedure,thereby insuring that the public would receive due process and significantly improved fairness of treatment.machules dep t of,so d.the apa prescribes a multitude of procedures to be followed by agencies in enacting regulatory provisions pursuant to legislatively granted authority,for parties challenging agency rules,and in agency in matters that affect the substantial interests of persons who are regulated by or do business with an agency.the broad scope of the apa and the many specific procedures that it requires agencies to follow need not be examined in depth here.pertinent to our review are the provisions of section,florida statutes,which generally governs agency action and procedure to be followed in making decisions that determine the substantial interests of a party,and section,florida statutes,which prescribes procedures for hearings.
substantial interests of a party as referred to in section are determined where the proposed action will result in which is of sufficient immediacy to justify a hearing and the injury is of the type that the statute pursuant to which the agency has acted is designed to protect.fairbanks,state dep t of,so d,dca.in the event that there are disputed issues of material fact to be determined,and a hearing has been requested under section a,florida statutes,an adversarial hearing must be provided under section,after reasonable notice is given not less than fourteen days before the hearing.b.stat.the notice must contain certain information including the time,place,and nature of the hearing and the legal authority under which the hearing is to be held.a number of procedures can follow and,where the case is presented to an administrative law judge,those procedures involve preparation of a recommended order by the administrative law judge,filing of exceptions to the recommended order by the parties,and preparation and issuance of a final order by the agency making the final decision.a final order entered under the apa is then immediately reviewable in the district court of appeal,florida statutes.
it is this general apa procedure for notice and hearing set forth in sections and,florida statutes,that the fourth district concluded must be followed by the school board in immediately terminating a charter under section d,florida statutes.however,the fourth district acknowledged that the relationship between chapters and is complex.survivors,so d at.recognizing that an agency must follow the apa unless exempted by the legislature,the fourth district attempted to harmonize the provisions of the apa and section by determining that the school board could only terminate a charter under section d after compliance with section,and that an immediate termination in the charter schools statute means only something less than ninety days.id.
while we endorse the general principle that absent a specific exemption the apa applies to agency action,that principle applies where there are no other countervailing indications of legislative intent we must now determine if the fourth district attempt to harmonize the apa with the immediate termination provisions of section d is consistent with legislative intent relating to charter schools.we thus proceed to a statutory construction analysis.
statutory construction analysis 
because the question presented solely involves interpretation of a statute,it is subject to de novo review.see.dep t of envtl.prot.contractpoint.parks,llc,so d,citing heart of adoptions,so d.in matters of statutory construction,we have repeatedly recognized that legislative intent is the polestar that guides the court.bautista state,so d.while that principle is undisputed,the actual application of that principle is at times difficult.in this case,if the legislature had expressly stated that the apa governs terminations under section d,this case would not be before us.conversely,if the legislature had specifically exempted school boards from the apa,as the legislature did in the case of the charter school appeals commission and the state board of education,there would also be no need for statutory construction to determine legislative intent the answer would be clear.however,in this case,despite the comprehensive statutory scheme set forth in section for the creation,operation,and termination of charter schools,the legislature neither expressly subjected the school boards and other charter school sponsors to the apa in matters involving immediate terminations,nor expressly exempted school boards from the apa requirements.
we determine that within the express text of section,the legislature has given clear indication of legislative intent as to procedures to be followed relative to charter schools by providing a comprehensive,detailed statutory scheme that does not intend that the provisions of the apa be incorporated into the charter school termination process.in reaching this conclusion,we are mindful of the principle that specific statutes covering a particular subject area will control over a statute covering the same subject in general terms.see maggio.dep t of labor empl,so d.
basic to our examination of statutes,and an important aspect of our analysis here,is the elementary principle of statutory construction that significance and effect must be given to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of the statute if possible,and words in a statute should not be construed as mere surplusage.gulfstream park racing ass tampa bay downs,so d,quoting hechtman nations title ins.of,so d.in this regard,we focus first on the word immediately in section d.that section expressly states that a sponsor,here the school board,may immediately terminate a charter school charter upon good cause shown or where the health,safety,or welfare of the students is threatened.d.stat.the survivors charters then impose only a notice requirement upon such an immediate termination.
where,as here,the legislature has not defined the words used in a statute,the language should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.neurological injury compensation ass.div.of admin.hearings,so d.the word immediately in section d is not defined,and it is therefore appropriate to refer to dictionary definitions when construing statutes in order to ascertain the plain and ordinary meaning of words used there.barco school bd.of pinellas county,so d,see also rollins pizzarelli,so d,when necessary,the plain and ordinary meaning can be ascertained by reference to a dictionary.quoting green state,so d.the word immediately means without interval of time.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.accordingly,the legislature use of the word immediately in section d indicates that the charter may be terminated without interval of time.therefore,termination of a charter immediately means something different than termination accomplished over a period of weeks or months or,even as interpreted by the fourth district,only something less than ninety days,which is the time frame established for terminations of charter school charters.see survivors,so d at.
our conclusion that immediate contemplates prompt action is strengthened by the fact that the reasons for which section d may be invoked are limited to situations where the health,safety,or welfare of the students is threatened and where good cause for immediate termination is shown.as to situations involving threats to the health,safety or welfare of students,the emergency nature of the circumstances are apparent,as well as the need for prompt action.as to good cause for immediate termination,the school board agrees that in the context of this statute,good cause would have to be something more than the other legally sufficient causes that govern terminations,and that the circumstances must be exigent so as to necessitate immediate action if grounds necessitating immediate action are not present,then the district school board must utilize the provisions of section c.on the other hand,when situations are present,then the chance of harm to the students increases and the concomitant need for immediate action is obvious,thereby justifying immediate termination under section d.thus,in determining the legislative intent behind section d,we look not just at the use of the word immediately but at the fact that this subsection addresses the type of circumstances requiring an immediate response,such as a threat to the health,safety,or welfare of the students.
further,because we are dealing with an entire statutory scheme for granting and terminating charters,we do not look at only one portion of the statute in isolation but we review the entire statute to determine intent.see gtc,edgar,so d.this is in accord with the principle that we give full effect to all statutory provisions and construe related statutory provisions in harmony with one another.heart of adoptions,so d at quoting woodham blue cross blue shield of,so d.it is thus significant to our analysis that the legislature set forth detailed procedures in section c for the school boards to follow for nonemergency termination and nonrenewal of a charter.survivors concedes,and we agree,that because the legislature set forth those detailed procedures in section c,the apa would not apply to nonemergency terminations under that subsection.at the same time,survivors urges us to find,as did the fourth district,that when it comes to emergency terminations under section d,the procedures of the apa would apply 
we are not required to abandon either our common sense or principles of logic in statutory interpretation.see,bautista,so d at applying a approach to statutory interpretation in order to give effect to legislative intent.we consider survivors view to be contrary to common sense in that a school board would be subjected to more extensive procedures under the apa when emergency circumstances are present than it would be subjected to for all other terminations under the procedures set forth in section c.
finally,we also discuss due process considerations,in part because the fourth district stressed its concern that the charter school termination procedures must provide due process to the school whose charter is being terminated and because the court appeared to conclude that due process could be provided only by compliance with the apa.we are always mindful of our obligation to construe provisions of legislative acts consistent with the basic tenets of fairness and due process.see larimore state,so d,revised on denial of rehearing.weekly,citing state atkinson,so d.we conclude,however,that constitutional considerations do not require us to find that the procedures mandated by the apa must apply in charter school terminations.
while the notice and hearing procedures contained in the apa are crafted in part to provide due process in administrative proceedings,chapter is not the sole method by which a party may receive due process.the apa is a creature of the legislature,as is the charter schools statute.just as the apa may be evaluated to determine what due process protections are provided there,the charter schools statute is subject to a similar review.as we explained in keys citizens for responsible government,florida keys aqueduct authority,so d 
in order to determine what process is constitutionally required,the court must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.cafeteria restaurant workers union,at.three factors are relevant in determining what process is constitutionally due the private interest that will be affected by the official action the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and the government interest.
id.at.due process is not a technical concept with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstances.id.at quoting cafeteria restaurant workers union,local,mcelroy,d.instead,due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.id.quoting morrissey brewer,d.most importantly,t he specific parameters of the notice and the opportunity to be heard required by procedural due process are not evaluated by fixed rules of law,but rather by the requirements of the particular proceeding.id.
in finding that the apa does not apply to immediate charter school terminations,we reiterate the legislature clearly stated purpose of section d to provide school boards and other charter school sponsors with the ability to immediately terminate charters where there are circumstances,such as those that threaten the health,safety or welfare of students,or where other good cause necessitating immediate action exists.the principles we discuss have led us to an interpretation that gives the greatest effect to the actual legislative language set forth in section,more fully accomplishes the legislative purpose apparent in that provision,and honors the detailed termination and appeal statutory scheme.
conclusion 
we conclude that the legislature did not intend that school boards and other charter school sponsors follow the apa when immediately terminating charter school charters for good cause or where the health,safety or welfare of the students is threatened.the legislature has provided a comprehensive scheme specifically applicable to all aspects of charter schools.within that comprehensive scheme,the legislature has provided charter school sponsors with a procedure to immediately terminate the charter where the health,safety,or welfare of the students is threatened or where other good cause circumstances exist that require immediate action.
the district court interpretation that a charter may be immediately terminated,but only after fourteen days notice and an administrative hearing,a process the district court recognized may consume up to ninety days,engrafts requirements upon the termination procedure that are inconsistent with the overall statutory scheme for charter schools.the use of apa procedures for immediate terminations is inconsistent with the expressed legislative intent that a school board act immediately when circumstances arise such as those that threaten the health,safety or welfare of the students.therefore,we reject the district court conclusion that immediate terminati
