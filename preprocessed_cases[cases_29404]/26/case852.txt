john saulsberry appeals from a final judgment entered in the district court in favor of mary university of minnesota mary or the university on his race discrimination and retaliation claims,in violation of title vii,and the minnesota human rights act.mhra.we affirm.
background 
in,saulsberry,an,was working for a security company as a security guard assigned to mary twin cities campus in minneapolis,minnesota.the twin cities campus primarily offers night and classes for adult students.mary also has a residential undergraduate campus in winona,minnesota.in,mary hired saulsberry as a security guard.he worked a split shift from to and from to 
in the fall of,saulsberry sought permission to enroll in undergraduate classes at the twin cities campus at a reduced rate.mary written policy provided that employees could enroll in courses subject to the requirements of the employee job and the approval of the employee supervisor and the university vice president.the policy also provided that employees were entitled to a tuition remission at the winona campus,but did not provide for tuition remission at the twin cities campus.brother louis dethomasis brother louis,president of the university,explained that the reason for the disparity was economic because the winona faculty were salaried employees,whereas the twin cities faculty were adjunct faculty,who were paid according to the number of students enrolled in the class.brother louis,however,had the discretion to grant university employees tuition remission at the twin cities campus.in doing so,he considered the benefit to the university and the benefit to the employee.
although brother louis did not perceive a significant benefit to the university if saulsberry obtained an undergraduate degree,he granted saulsberry a tuition remission.saulsberry was also allowed to enroll in night classes during his regular work hours with no reduction in his wages.in,saulsberry took five classes over three semesters.sometime in,he was promoted to director of security and supervised one or two other employees.in that year,he took nine courses,all during his work hours.saulsberry took eight courses in and six courses in.
in january,the university vice president,daniel maloney,talked to brother louis about granting a tuition remission to his administrative assistant,barbara croucher,a white woman.maloney wanted her to take business courses and obtain an undergraduate degree because she dealt with financial matters and other high profile administrative matters.brother lewis granted croucher a tuition remission,believing that the university would benefit if croucher obtained a degree.unlike saulsberry,croucher did not attend classes during her work hours.saulsberry learned that croucher was receiving a tuition remission that month.in late january or early february,saulsberry complained to maloney that the university was discriminating against him because of the tuition remission disparity between him and croucher.in june,the university promoted croucher to executive director of financial and administrative affairs and she became saulsberry supervisor.in september,two other employees were granted tuition remission at the twin cities campus one was an.
in february,saulsberry filed discrimination and retaliation charges with the state department of human rights.after receiving a letter,saulsberry filed an action in state court,alleging that the university had discriminated against him by awarding him a tuition remission,while awarding tuition remission to white employees,in violation of the mhra,title vii,and.he also asserted that after he complained to maloney,the university retaliated against him.he claimed that maloney limited the number of classes he could take during work hours.saulsberry also claimed he was subjected to comments.in particular,saulsberry alleged that maloney had made a comment that he needed lotion for his ashy skin john pyle,who had replaced croucher as maloney administrative assistant,and a temporary receptionist had referred to him as shaft and the receptionist had referred to him as a black dog.saulsberry also alleged that croucher promotion was a retaliatory act and that,after she became his supervisor,she changed his hours and duties,removed his name from a campus mailbox,moved his office,and promoted the only other security employee to the associate director of security.
mary removed the case to federal district court and moved for summary judgment.mary argued that saulsberry mhra discrimination claim was untimely because it was not filed within the statute of limitations of,subd.the university also argued that summary judgment was appropriate on the state law claim,as well as on the title vii and discrimination claims,because saulsberry could not prove that the white employees who received tuition remission were similarly situated to him.in support,the university submitted evidence that,in addition to croucher,other white employees had received tuition remission,but that none of them had taken classes during work hours.believing that saulsberry had raised a hostile work environment claim,the university argued that the complained of comments did not create a hostile work environment.as to the retaliation claim,the university argued that the alleged retaliatory actions were not adverse actions.among other things,the university noted that his name was removed from the campus mailbox and his hours were changed for only three days.as to any action that might be deemed adverse,the university argued that saulsberry could not prove causation.in particular,as to croucher actions,the university submitted evidence that croucher had not learned of saulsberry complaint to maloney until after he filed his discrimination charges in february.the university also presented legitimate,reasons for the actions and argued that saulsberry had no evidence of pretext.for example,it noted that croucher promotion and appointment as saulsberry supervisor in june was part of an administrative restructuring.
in response,saulsberry argued that the white employees who received tuition remission were similarly situated to him because they were employees enrolled in undergraduate courses and brother louis had made the remission decisions.saulsberry also responded that he was not raising a freestanding hostile work environment claim,but was offering evidence of the comments to show an adverse action in his retaliation claim.
the district court granted mary motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part.although the university had not raised a timeliness defense as to the title vii tuition remission discrimination claim,the district court found that it was,as was the mhra claim.the district court reasoned that the claims accrued by january,when saulsberry learned that croucher had received a tuition remission.because he had one year to file a charge under mhra,subd,and days under title vii,the district court held that february,charge was untimely filed.
the district court also granted the university motion for summary judgment on saulsberry retaliation claim.the district court held that the complained of comments did not constitute a racially hostile work environment,and thus were not adverse actions.in addition,the district court held that saulsberry had failed to prove causation or that the university proffered reasons for the complained of actions were a pretext for retaliation.
however,the district court denied the university motion for summary judgment on the claim.before trial,the district court granted mary motions to exclude maloney ashy skin comment,pyle and the receptionist shaft comments,and the receptionist black dog comment.the district court also limited the evidence to the tuition remission disparity between croucher and saulsberry and to the period before january,the date the district court believed the claim had accrued.
at trial,saulsberry produced no evidence that he was similarly situated to croucher.although saulsberry testified that he made up the time he spent in class on weekends,his work schedules did not support his testimony,and he produced no other evidence in support.after the jury found
