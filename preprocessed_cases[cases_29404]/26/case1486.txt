factual and procedural background 
in june,the university internal auditors began an investigative audit of the athletics department at sdsu.the auditors spent months examining financial materials,interviewing witnesses,and investigating allegations of various improprieties,resulting in a written audit report in april.the audit investigation also resulted in several lawsuits against the university and others,including a whistleblower action by dave ohton,sdsu football team former conditioning coach,and an action brought by steve bartel,the team former equipment manager,who alleged defamation and disclosure of private,protected and confidential information about himself.
after the filing of the ohton and bartel actions,the made a pra request on the university seeking copies of all correspondence and communications between sdsu and dave ohton or his attorneys from december until the present regarding ohton lawsuit claims against sdsu all correspondence and communications between sdsu and steve bartel or his attorneys regarding the ohton or the involving bartel and transcripts of all depositions that have been taken to date in the lawsuits.the university refused to produce the records,citing exemptions to the pra for documents created for pending litigation b private personnel information,subd.c and documents protected by the privilege and the attorney work product doctrine,subd.k with regard to the correspondence the union tribune sought,the university asserted that it was confidential work product prepared for use in the litigation,and thus not subject to disclosure to parties outside the litigation.counsel for barton and ohton also strenuously objected to production of these items,asserting that they were confidential matters not to be disclosed to parties outside the litigation.
in november,in response to the university refusal to turn over any of the requested records,copley filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court.the petition sought to compel the university to comply with the pra by seeking an order that they produce the requested records.after the parties briefed the matter,and after hearing argument of counsel,the court granted copley petition in its entirety,ordering the university to release the requested documents.in rejecting the university contention that the pending litigation exemption protected the documents from disclosure,the court found that the university had not shown that the requested correspondence between sdsu and the opposing attorneys and parties in the ohton and bartel lawsuits were created by sdsu for its own use in litigation.the court also found that there is no showing that the requested deposition transcripts were created by sdsu for its own use in litigation.the court also rejected the university privilege and attorney work product defenses,finding that c orrespondence between opposing counsel and deposition transcripts are not confidential and not work product.because the university failed to present evidence supporting its contention that the documents were exempt from production,the court also found that an in camera review of the documents was not warranted.in ordering production,the court also ordered that any personal information concerning barton and ohton was to be redacted from the documents.
this petition for writ of mandate followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a superior court order directing disclosure of public records held by a public agency is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of section of the code of civil procedure from which an appeal may be taken,but shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for the issuance of an extraordinary writ,subd.c powers city of richmond cal th,d.appellate review of the order is independent on issues of law,and follows the substantial evidence test with respect to any issues of fact.citation.city of hemet superior court th,d.
applicable law 
the pra articulates a policy of broad disclosure of documents in the possession of public agencies and provides that access to information concerning the conduct of the people business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.to implement that right,section,subdivision a provides that every person has a right to inspect any public record,subject only to the express limitations contained elsewhere in the pra.this provision is frequently invoked by news organizations,which have the same standing as individual citizens to seek government records.san gabriel tribune superior court d.
the pra also provides for several exemptions to disclosure,some of which are contained in section one,at issue upon this petition,is section b,which prohibits the disclosure of r ecords pertaining to pending litigation to which the public agency is a party until the pending litigation has been finally adjudicated or otherwise settled.
section exemptions are to be narrowly construed citation,and the government agency opposing disclosure bears the burden of proving that one or more apply in a particular case.county of los angeles superior court axelrad th,d county of los angeles.the federal freedom of information act et foia,upon which the pra was modeled,has similarly been interpreted as creating a liberal disclosure requirement,limited only by specific exemptions,which are also to be narrowly construed.gc micro defense logistics agency cir.
the term records pertaining to pending litigation is a broad term that on its face would suggest that all records in a public entity possession relating to litigation are protected from disclosure.however,because of the narrow construction given to section exemptions,cases interpreting the section b pending litigation exemption have,based upon the facts of those particular cases,given it a more restricted reading.thus,a document is protected from disclosure under the pending litigation exemption only if the document was specifically prepared for use in litigation.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d,italics added.
other cases have further refined and narrowed the scope of documents protected from disclosure under section b.in fairley,an individual filed a california pra request seeking documents relating to his arrest.fairley superior court th,d fairley.the trial court denied the petition,without prejudice,until the pending litigation between the pra requestor and the government agency was finally settled or adjudicated.id.at,d.the requestor filed a writ petition,claiming that the records were not exempt under the pra.ibid.the fairley court held that a public entity may refuse to disclose documents which it prepares for use in litigation.id.at,d,fn.omitted,italics added.the court noted that t he construction we give to pending litigation,which focuses on the purpose of the document,serves to protect documents created by a public entity for its own use in anticipation of litigation,which documents it reasonably has an interest in keeping to itself until litigation is finalized.in this way,a litigant opposing a public entity is prevented from taking unfair advantage of the public agency status of his or her opponent.id.at,d,italics added.
this court also gave a restrictive reading of the section b pending litigation exemption in poway,supra,th,d,wherein the defendant school district claimed that this exemption shielded a student tort claim form from disclosure to the.id.at,d.we first concluded that such documents were not protected from disclosure under section b because under another statute claim forms are available for public inspection.id.at,d.we also concluded that tort claim forms were not within the section b exemption because that section was intended to protect only documents created by the public entity.poway,supra,th at,d.we also noted that section b was primarily designed to prevent a litigant opposing the government from using the pra disclosure provisions to accomplish earlier or greater access to records pertaining to pending litigation or tort claims than would otherwise be allowed under the rules of discovery citations.poway,supra,th at,d.we concluded that because t here is no unfair disadvantage to the public entity from disclosure of the mere claim form,it did not fall within the exemption of section b.poway,supra,th at,d.
as one court explained,this exemption therefore protects privileged and attorney work product,as well as,more broadly,any other work product related to pending litigation section b is not duplicative of subdivision k,through which code of civil procedure section applies and protects attorney work product,but rather subdivision b confers upon public agencies a broader exemption from disclosure by protecting the work product generated by a public agency in anticipation of litigation.fairley,supra,th at,fn,d.
application of section b to correspondence between counsel 
despite the broad language of section b,cases applying the litigation exemption to various factual scenarios have given it a narrow interpretation,indicating that the pending litigation exception would only protect documents that the agency prepared for its own use in litigation and that it had an interest in not disclosing until after the litigation has finalized.
applying this reasoning to this case,it would therefore appear that correspondence between opposing counsel and parties would not be exempt under section b.as to correspondence emanating from ohton,barton or their attorneys,it would not be exempted from disclosure as it was not prepared by the university.correspondence from the university to ohton,barton or their attorneys would arguably not be protected as well.while they were prepared for the university use in litigation,they were disclosed to opposing counsel and therefore it could be argued they were documents that the university did not intend to keep confidential until after the litigation.
however,when,as here,correspondence between opposing counsel and parties is sought under the pra by persons or entities outside the litigation,different policy concerns arise that were not present in cases that have previously interpreted section b.it is true that when an opposing party seeks records from a governmental entity,the primary purpose of the pending litigation exemption is to prevent the litigant from using the pra disclosure provisions to accomplish earlier or greater access to records pertaining to pending litigation or tort claims than would otherwise be allowed under the rules of discovery citation.roberts city of palmdale cal th,d.for this reason,cases have expressed that the exemption is limited to privileged matters,attorney work product,and any other work product of the governmental agency.fairley,supra,th at,fn,d.
however,when third parties such as the media seek documents that the parties did not intend disclosed,except between themselves,different concerns arise.if third persons were able to obtain,through the pra,all correspondence between opposing attorneys and clients in pending litigation or tort claims,it would eviscerate the parties ability to vigorously litigate and protect their clients interests.counsel in such a scenario would have to assume that every communication to the opposing party could be obtained under a pra request.attorneys do not expect such correspondence to be subject to disclosure to parties outside of the litigation.if parties outside of the litigation were able to obtain such documents through a pra request,the ability to communicate openly and freely during litigation would be severely hampered.
a prime example of the dilemma is settlement communications.even if labeled as confidential,they are subject to disclosure under the pra after the litigation has ended.register div.of freedom newspapers,county of orange d.however,the parties to the litigation have a strong interest in protecting such communications between counsel from disclosure to third parties while litigation is pending.in fact,to allow disclosure to the public of such documents would chill the parties ability in many cases to settle the action before trial.such a result runs contrary to the strong public policy of this state favoring settlement of actions.see hinshaw,winkler,draa,marsh still superior court th,d.
we also note that section b only applies to documents while litigation is pending.documents exempt from disclosure while litigation is pending are subject to disclosure under the pra once the litigation has ended.thus,the drafters of section b were obviously concerned that production of documents during the course of litigation could hamper the parties efforts to effectively represent their parties interests.
with these considerations in mind,we conclude that the pending litigation exemption applies to litigation documents,when sought by persons or entities not party to the litigation,which the parties do not intend to be revealed outside the litigation.thus,even though attorneys may exchange correspondence with each other or the opposing party,if they desire to have such matters remain confidential as to nonparties pending resolution of the litigation,the correspondence is protected from disclosure to third parties by section b.here,the record reflects,based upon the university,barton and ohton strenuous objections to disclosure of these materials,the parties intended that correspondence between them not be disclosed to individuals or entities not parties to the litigation.
this holding is consistent with cases that have concluded that section b exemption is not intended to only protect the privilege or attorney work product,but more generally any documents that could be considered work product generated during litigation.fairley,supra,th at,fn,d.
