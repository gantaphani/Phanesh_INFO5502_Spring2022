plaintiff appellant maxiam dean appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york william skretny,granting summary judgment to the university at buffalo school of medicine and biomedical sciences ubmed,state university of new york suny,michael cain,and nancy nielsen collectively defendants and dismissing his complaint.dean brought suit under,inter alia,title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,section of the rehabilitation act of,and usc for alleged violations of the due process clause of the united states constitution.after failing to sit for and pass his third attempt at step of the united states medical licensing examination usmle by the deadline set by ubmed,dean was dismissed from the program.because a trier of fact could find that defendants did not grant the accommodation dean requested for his condition and failed to provide a plainly reasonable alternative or attempt to show that dean proposed modification was unreasonable,the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the ada and rehabilitation act claims.however,having received notice of potential termination from the program and a careful and deliberate decision dean was,as a matter of law,provided the procedural process due for an academic dismissal.
accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to defendants as to dean due process claim,vacate the remainder of the judgment,and remand to the district court.
background 
maxiam dean enrolled in the course at ubmed in august.the program is divided in two phases,each comprising two years of study.to progress to the latter stage a student must pass all modules and electives,a clinical competency examination,and step of the usmle administered by the national board of medical examiners nbme.dean completed the required coursework and second year clinical competency exam by the spring of.
the academic status policies asp issued by ubmed permits a student three opportunities to pass the step exam,with all attempts to be completed in one academic year exclusive of official leaves of absence.a student who thrice fails the step exam is to be administratively dismissed,but may appeal to the dean of ubmed.under this policy dean was required to complete step of the usmle by may.
ubmed allowed dean study leave before his first and second attempts at the step exam.in june,dean took a leave to prepare for the examination but failed it in.dean thereafter received three additional study leaves.although the asp provides only eight weeks for a student to prepare for a second sitting of the step exam,ubmed granted dean requests.prior to his second attempt,senior associate dean nancy nielsen wrote to dean on january,informing him that by the terms of his leave of absence he would be automatically dismissed from medical school if he failed to sit for step by february,and that no extensions for further study would be granted.app x at.dean replied by email to nielsen explaining that he had enrolled in the pass program,a private examination preparation course consisting of lectures and tutoring,to prepare for the usmle,which dean understood he could sit for as late as may.dean noted that prior to attending the program he was ridden with depression,stress,and anxiety,app x at,asked for an extra month in the pass program to succeed but did not request medical leave.app x at.dean ultimately retook step on february,and again failed.
nielsen informed dean by letter that he would go on study leave at the end of his current medical clerkship to prepare for a final try no later than may,at the step exam.the asp does not prescribe a particular study period for a third attempt but states that the student will be removed from the clerkship roster and allowed to prepare for,and sit for,the examination one final time.the student must sit for the examination by the date established by the office of medical education for the next incoming third year class.app x at.former faculty member and chair of surgery eddie hoover attested that it was longstanding policy that students taking the step exam,whether on their first,second or third attempt,were afforded a to week period to prepare.app x at.in particular,he emphasized that each time a medical student took the step exam,he or she was allowed and expected to study exclusively for the exam for a to week period leading up to the examination itself.app x at.in his deposition,dean similarly testified that all students were afforded a six to study leave prior to each attempt.
sometime after failing the step exam for a second time dean became disabled.in april,he began to experience increased symptoms of depression,and on may,andrea greenwood,a psychologist,conducted a crisis evaluation session with dean through the university counseling services.dean reported disrupted sleep and appetite,fatigue,and difficulty concentrating.greenwood advised dean to schedule a comprehensive evaluation.that same day dean met with dwight lewis,an internist,who proposed that dean begin pharmacological treatment and provided dean an excuse slip recommending a leave of absence due to situational depression.
dean presented the slip to ubmed and received responses from nielsen,by letter and email,informing him that lewis note provided insufficient information to support an extended leave.nielsen advised dean that the dean of ubmed,michael cain,would not grant any additional extensions and that dean was to sit for step by may.after learning that dean independently inquired of ubmed leave of absence committee,nielsen notified dean that cain had already reviewed his physician note and declined to grant an extension.in a separate letter nielsen stated that dean would be immediately administratively dismissed from school upon receipt of a failing score on the step exam.app x at.
greenwood dean on may.in a letter to nielsen and the leave of absence committee she outlined the symptoms of dean depression,noting effects on his ability to concentrate and maintain focus and opining that dean would likely benefit from treatment.the following day lewis prescribed dean lexapro,an medication.as a follow up to the earlier excuse slip,lewis also wrote to the committee recommending a medical leave of absence to permit dean to return to proper functioning such that he would be capable of the academic performance required to advance in his medical training.app x at.neither greenwood nor lewis suggested a particular period of leave.
dean wrote separately to the committee on may,describing his symptoms and requesting a leave to continue the medication regimen,visit the university psychologist,and temporarily return home for family support.he indicated that a t the end of the leave he would sit for the retake of step and return back to clinical clerkship.app x at.
after meeting with dean,the committee endorsed a leave of absence until june,a date approximately six weeks after dean began taking lexapro.the committee may,letter to nielsen noted that leave should be granted to permit adequate time for the treatment to become effective but that dean should not be granted a leave of absence to gain more study time and counseled that no further leave be granted.app x at.accepting the committee recommendation,cain informed dean by letter dated may,of the extended deadline but stated that n o further delays whatsoever w ould be granted and reminded dean that he was required to pass step within the three attempts permitted by the asp before returning to the program.app x at.
on may,dean attended a appointment with university psychiatrist calvert warren,who furnished dean with a letter indicating that despite mild improvement since beginning treatment on may,dean exhibited symptoms of major depression.warren supported a leave of absence to permit dean treatment interventions to progress and noted a eightweek timeframe for medications to achieve effectiveness.dean forwarded warren letter to cain and enclosed his own letter dated june,again requesting a leave of absence please reconsider giving me more than one month so that the medication will reach steady state and be therapeutic,so i can focus on preparing for the retake of step.app x at.by letter dated june,cain allowed dean until july,to sit for the step exam but stated that no further extensions regardless of reason would be granted.app x at.the july deadline fell approximately ten weeks after dean began drug therapy for his depression.
while in the pass program,dean experienced a noticeable improvement in his functioning in late june.app x at.by,approximately eight weeks after commencing treatment,dean regained normal functioning and was able to intensively study.app x at.dean reported being virtually free of depression on july.app x at.two days later,francis ihejarika,the founder of the pass program,left a voicemail for cain,expressing confidence that dean would be successful on the step exam with an additional month of preparation time.nielsen informed dean by email that due to privacy regulations the school would not return ihejirika call.dean ultimately did not sit for the step exam by july,and did not request further extension of that deadline.
by letter dated august,ubmed notified dean that he had been administratively dismissed from the program for failure to timely sit for the step exam.the letter informed dean that he could appeal and that nielsen would review the process,purportedly outlined in the asp,with him should he so desire.dean did not appeal.however,in late august he attempted to register for the step exam.nbme rejected the registration as dean was no longer enrolled in a medical school.
dean subsequently filed a complaint with the department of education office of civil rights ocr.in may,ocr concluded that defendants granted dean a leave of absence consistent with the recommendations made by dean medical team,and found insufficient evidence to support dean allegation that the school discriminated against him,on the basis of his disability,by refusing to grant him an additional month leave of absence.app x at.with this complaint pending dean wrote to cain requesting a meeting to discuss his dismissal.cain declined to meet during the ocr investigation but invited dean to submit additional information at the conclusion of those proceedings.in july,dean formally sought reinstatement arguing that his failure to sit for the step exam was not an act of defiance,and submitted a letter from hoover noting that it was impractical for dean to study for the exam with his degree of depression.app x at.ubmed rejected dean request for reinstatement.because dean was dismissed from ubmed he is ineligible to transfer to another american medical school 
dean commenced this action in the district court bringing claims against defendants under title ii of the ada the rehabilitation act and.seeking money damages and reinstatement,dean alleged that his dismissal from ubmed resulted from discrimination on the basis of disability and race.upon completion of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the case in its entirety,finding,inter alia,no plausible inference of discrimination against dean as a result of his disability,dean at buffalo sch.of med.biomedical,cv sr,wl,at,or that the medical leave afforded insufficient accommodation or otherwise disadvantaged dean as compared to students required to complete all attempts at the step exam within one academic year,id.at.on the due process claim,the district court concluded that because academic dismissals require only notice and a careful and deliberate decision,defendants provided dean the process due under the circumstances.id.at.
on appeal,dean challenges the grant of summary judgment to defendants on the ada,rehabilitation act,and due process claims

ii.ada and rehabilitation act claims 
congress enacted the ada to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.b.to that end,title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.id.a qualified individual with a disability is defined as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices meets the essential eligibility requirements for participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.id.a public entity includes a state or local government body or any instrumentality thereof.id.
section of the rehabilitation act provides,in pertinent part,that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity.a.by its terms,the rehabilitation act,which was enacted prior to the ada,applies only to programs receiving federal financial support.see powell bd.of med.exam rs,cir,opinion corrected,cir.
both acts prohibit discrimination against qualified disabled individuals by requiring that they receive reasonable accommodations that permit them to have access to and take a meaningful part in public accommodations.id.the ada defines discriminate as,inter alia,not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the provider of the service can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operations.b a.under the rehabilitation act an otherwise qualified handicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers t o assure meaningful access,reasonable accommodations in the grantee program or benefit may have to be made.alexander choate,see henrietta bloomberg,cir.
in the education context,the ada and the rehabilitation act require a covered institution to offer reasonable accommodations for a student known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program,powell,at citing see rothschild grottenthaler,cir accommodations to permit access to handicapped persons should not impose undue financial and administrative burdens.quoting se.cmty.coll.davis,or fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity,powell,at quoting b see alexander,at w hile a grantee need not be required to make fundamental or substantial modifications to accommodate the handicapped,it may be required to make reasonable ones.thus,while a covered entity must make reasonable accommodations,it does not have to provide a disabled individual with every accommodation he requests or the accommodation of his choice.mcelwee cty.of orange,cir see fink dep t of,cir same.
as the standards for actions under these provisions of the ada and the rehabilitation act are generally equivalent,we analyze such claims together.harris mills,cir.to establish a prima facie violation under these acts,a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is a qualified individual with a disability that the defendants are subject to one of the acts and that she was denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from defendants services,programs,or activities,or was otherwise discriminated against by defendants,by reason of her disability.powell,at quoting henrietta,at alterations omitted.before the district court defendants conceded that they were entities covered by the provisions of the acts,dean,wl,at,and given their failure to address whether dean was a qualified individual with a disability,the district court assumed that defendants conceded that issue for purposes of the summary judgment motion.id.at.thus,only the third prong of the prima facie analysis was in issue whether defendants engaged in discrimination by failing to make reasonable accommodations.
surveying the record,the district court discerned no plausible inference that defendants discriminated against plaintiff or deprived him of an opportunity or benefit because of a disability such that a reasonable jury could find in his favor.id.at.in support of this conclusion,the court noted that the period of medical leave granted by defendants allowed dean to return to normal functioning approximately two weeks prior to the step exam deadline and incidentally extended the time in which he could sit for the exam beyond the period ordinarily permitted.moreover,the district court concluded that dean had not shown that the accommodation he received was unreasonable,as he did not offer any evidence indicating the leave he was granted failed to level the playing field or treat him in an manner with regard to the step exam.id.footnote omitted.that the period of leave granted complied with the general recommendations of dean doctors buttressed the district court conclusion that the accommodation offered was sufficient.finally,emphasizing that dean had already devoted a year to study prior to his medical leave,the district court indicated that dean opinion provided the only support for his contention that a reasonable accommodation would have included an additional period for study after the symptoms of his depression abated.id.at.the district court therefore granted defendants summary judgment motion on dean ada and rehabilitation act claims.
on appeal,dean contends that defendants failed to provide a reasonable accommodation because he should have been afforded an interval of leave sufficient to allow the prescribed medication to take effect and for dean to thereafter prepare for a final attempt at the step exam.defendants respond that dean sought medical leave solely for the purpose of undergoing treatment for depression and did not specifically request additional study time prior to the step retake.thus,in ultimately supplying dean a more generous leave period than purportedly requested by dean and recommended by his physicians,defendants assert they provided a reasonable accommodation.it is axiomatic that a claim for failure to accommodate does not lie where the accommodation received is the accommodation the plaintiff requested.see tsombanidis haven fire dep t,cir.
dean was not afforded the accommodation he sought.in his june,letter to cain requesting reconsideration of the leave of absence set to expire at the end of that month,dean asked for a leave to allow the medication to reach steady state and be therapeutic,so he c ould focus on preparing for the retake of step.app x at.while dean did not explicitly disaggregate the purposes of the requested leave period,he explained that warren had counseled that dean would need at least to weeks before he could see some improvement from the medication.app x at.as dean requested a period some five to seven weeks longer than necessary for the medication to become effective,a trier of fact could find that the additional time dean sought was clearly to prepare for the step retake.the leave of absence committee had little difficulty discerning the dual purpose of dean request for leave.in its may,letter to nielsen,the committee recommended that dean requested leave period be limited to approximately six weeks of medical leave,as the committee fel t that dean should not be granted a leave of absence to gain more study time.app x at.on this record,a reasonable juror could find that the leave dean requested included a period for exam preparation and that defendants understood the scope of his request 
while defendants did not provide the accommodation dean sought,it is undisputed that they afforded him an alternative one.dean was permitted a cumulative leave period spanning approximately ten weeks from may,when he formally requested leave,until july,when he was required to sit for the step exam.the record establishes that by dean symptoms had lessened to the extent that he was able to engage in productive study.thus,by the july deadline,dean enjoyed at least some study time.we must therefore decide,on the summary judgment record before us,whether this modification to the exam deadline was a reasonable accommodation.
where a defendant educational institution has implemented or offered an accommodation,the institution will be entitled to summary judgment only if the undisputed record reveals that the plaintiff was accorded a plainly reasonable accommodation.noll int l bus.machs,cir quoting wernick fed.reserve bank of,cir.the hallmark of a reasonable accommodation is effectiveness.see airways,barnett,it is the word accommodation,not the word reasonable,that conveys the need for effectiveness.the accommodation need not be perfect or the one most strongly preferred by the,but it still must be effective,noll,at.given the nature of the question of whether a measure to accommodate a student disability is a reasonable accommodation,this determination must be made on a basis.wernick,at.
defendants posit that the accommodation offered dean was reasonable since he had studied during two extended periods of leave prior to any reported mental health condition,such that additional study time would not have been necessary.in alluding to the year dean spent preparing for the step exam,the district court appeared to embrace this theory.
we disagree.as an initial matter,we harbor serious doubt that earlier periods of study suffice to prepare a student for a later examination,particularly when the student twice failed that very exam.further,contrary to the district court conclusion,dean offered evidence to establish that he was not treated in an evenhanded manner with respect to similarly situated students.doe pfrommer,cir t he central purpose of the ada and of the rehabilitation act is to assure that disabled individuals receive evenhanded treatment in relation to the.according to dean evidence,ubmed granted a set period of study leave to students prior to each sitting of the examination.hoover attested to a longstanding policy of affording students six to eight weeks exclusively for exam preparation prior to each attempt at step of the usmle.app x at.dean similarly testified at his deposition.while it is unclear how many days or weeks dean spent effectively studying after beginning pharmacological treatment,by any measure dean period of preparation time in late july did not span the six to eight weeks allegedly afforded,as a matter of school policy,to medical students who had also failed two prior attempts at the step exam.given this policy,a juror could reasonably infer that the abbreviated study period encompassed within dean leave would not have been effective.see barnett,at an ineffective modification or adjustment will not accommodate a disabled individual limitations.we therefore can not conclude that defendants afforded dean a plainly reasonable accommodation.
as we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any basis that finds sufficient support in the record,including grounds not relied on by the district court,see lotes,hon hai precision indus,cir quoting bruh bessemer venture partners iii,cir,we further consider,under the applicable framework elaborated below,whether dean proposed accommodation would have been reasonable,see noll,at.
we have not previously addressed the allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion with respect to establishing the third prong of a prima facie violation of the ada or rehabilitation act here the purported denial of a reasonable accommodation in the education context.however,in claims based on a failure to accommodate,the plaintiff bears the initial burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of an accommodation that would allow the plaintiff to perform the essential functions of the position in question,mcbride bic consumer prods,cir,as well as a light burden of production as to the facial reasonableness of the accommodation,id.see borkowski valley cent.sch,cir plaintiff satisfies burden of production by showing plausible accommodation.the burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendant to rebut the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation.mcbride,at.this burden of is in essence equivalent to the burden of showing,as an affirmative defense,that the proposed accommodation would cause the employer to suffer an undue hardship.borkowski,at see barnett,at finding summary judgment in favor of defendant appropriately granted where a plaintiff fails to present evidence from which a jury may infer that an accommodation seems reasonable on its face,ordinarily or in the run of cases,or where defendant demonstrates undue hardship in the particular circumstances of the case.
similarly,in the education context,a plaintiff alleging a failure to accommodate a disability bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow the plaintiff to meet the essential requirements of the service,program,or activity at issue.once the plaintiff has met the light burden of producing evidence as to the facial reasonableness or plausibility of the accommodation,the burden falls to the defendant to persuade the that the proposed accommodation is unreasonable.that burden may be met by establishing that the requested accommodation would a impose undue hardship on the operation of the defendant service,program,or activity,or b require a fundamental or substantial modification to the nature of its academic program or standards.see,powell,at allowing a student in medical school to continue in program without passing step would have changed the nature and substance of the program zukle regents of of,cir rearranging medical clerkship rotations,reducing clinical hours,and otherwise decelerating schedule would lower medical school standards mcguinness of sch.of,cir permitting student with marginal grades to advance in program as an exception to policy requiring repetition of coursework was a substantial rather than reasonable accommodation kaltenberger ohio coll.of podiatric,cir allowing student to attend abbreviated remedial summer program instead of retaking failed examination would diminish podiatric training standards wynne tufts.sch.of,cir providing biochemistry test in an alternative format would lessen academic standards and devalue university credentials as an institution.
under this framework,dean has made out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada and the rehabilitation act.as noted above,defendants did not contest that dean established the first two prongs of the inquiry whether he is a qualified individual with a disability and whether ubmed is a covered entity.in showing that he requested a leave to seek medical treatment and study for the step retake,a trier of fact could find that dean met his initial burdens of production and persuasion as to the existence of an accommodation.further,the affidavit of hoover and dean deposition testimony satisfied dean light burden to produce evidence with respect to the facial reasonableness of the accommodation.that students are ordinarily afforded six to eight weeks of study time prior to each attempt at step of the usmle suggests that dean leave request was a plausible modification of ubmed policies.
thus,the burden falls to defendants.in order to obtain summary judgment,it was incumbent upon defendants to submit a factual record establishing that in rejecting dean requested scheduling modification they diligently assessed whether the alteration would allow dean the opportunity to continue in the program without imposing undue financial and administrative burdens on ubmed or requiring a fundamental alteration to the academic caliber of its offerings.see powell,at.where,as here,the record is devoid of evidence indicating whether defendants evaluated these considerations in determining the reasonableness of the accommodation sought,we decline to extend the deference we ordinarily accord to the professional,academic judgments of educational institutions.see id.noting that in evaluating the substance of a genuinely academic decision,courts should accord the faculty professional judgment great deference citing regents of of ewing.to do otherwise might allow academic decisions to disguise truly discriminatory requirements.zukle,at.we do not mean to suggest that defendants have obscured the basis for their decision to cloak discriminatory intent.rather defendants failure to adduce evidence as to the basis for denying dean requested modification to the exam schedule precludes any conclusion on summary judgment as to the unreasonableness of that accommodation.
we therefore set aside the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on dean ada and rehabilitation act claims.
iii.procedural due process 
in the context of an academic dismissal a student is afforded the procedural process required by the fourteenth amendment where the school has fully informed the student of the faculty dissatisfaction with the student progress and the danger that this posed to timely graduation and continued enrollment,and t he ultimate decision to dismiss the student was careful and deliberate.bd.of curators of of horowitz.this standard reflects the need for far less stringent procedural requirements,id.at,than those called for in disciplinary dismissal.see goss lopez,requiring school to furnish student facing suspension for misconduct formal notice,an explanation of the evidence,and a chance to present a defense though not a formal hearing.given the more subjective and evaluative nature of the judgment school officials exercise in deciding whether to terminate a student for academic cause,such dismissals are not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.horowitz.a graduate or professional school is,after all,the best judge of its students academic performance and their ability to master the required curriculum.id.at.
dean argues that ubmed failed to supply the procedural process owed to him under the circumstances of his dismissal from the program further,he contends that his claim should not be analyzed under the framework for academic dismissals supplied by horowitz and instead invites this court to fashion an alternative standard.such distinction is warranted,according to dean,because ubmed decision did not reflect an academic determination but instead was motivated by animus and undertaken automatically without exercise of professional judgment.we disagree.under horowitz,the appropriate standard to apply here,a trier of fact could find that dean received both the requisite notice of potential dismissal and a careful and deliberate ultimate decision.
as an initial matter,we reject dean contention that this case requires application of a due process standard different from that articulated in horowitz.dean allegation that defendants decision was motivated by ill will or bad faith is entirely conclusory with no support in the record to establish an inference of animus toward dean.see clements cty.of nassau,cir s ummary judgment is usually unwarranted when state of mind is at issue.the state of mind exception,however,is appropriate only where solid circumstantial evidence exists to prove plaintiff case.internal citation omitted.moreover,the decision to dismiss dean plainly resulted from the exercise of professional judgment.it is true that the district court described dean ultimate dismissal as more ministerial than evaluative,dean,wl at,but this finding does not compel the conclusion that the decision did not result from reasoned deliberation.indeed,dean does not dispute that defendants exercised academic judgment in setting a deadline to s
