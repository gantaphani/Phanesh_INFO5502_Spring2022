amanda,a minor,by and through her mother and guardian ad litem,annette,appeals from the district court decision to affirm the state review officer sro conclusion that she received a free appropriate public education fape under the individuals with disabilities education act,idea or the act.as part of nevada administrative review process,the sro reversed the state hearing officer ho determination that the clark county school district the district denied amanda a fape.the ho determination would have provided amanda reimbursement for the cost of the assessments indicating autism and the cost of an program funded by her parents from april,as well as compensation for the inappropriate language services rendered during her time in the district.
we must initially decide a question of first impression for our court what level of deference do we give to the state agencies involved in a review process when each reaches a different result predicated on a credibility determination in other words,to which administrative body do we accord the due weight standard of review for idea cases,established by board of education rowley,d we then turn to a question of more significance to the growing number of parents of autistic children for whom early detection and early parental involvement in education is critical to their ability to overcome the disorder whether the district failure to give amanda parents copies of the evaluations indicating the possibility of autism and the need for further psychiatric evaluations when the district learned of the possible diagnosis violated the procedural requirements of the idea.we hold that it did.by preventing amanda parents from fully and effectively participating in the creation of an individualized education program iep for amanda,the district made it impossible to design an iep that addressed amanda unique needs as an autistic child,thereby denying amanda a fape.we further hold that the district court erred by according greater deference to the credibility determinations of the state review officer than to those of the hearing officer in applying the due weight standard.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
statutory background 
the idea provides states with federal funds to help educate children with disabilities if they provide every qualified child with a fape that meets the federal statutory requirements congress enacted the idea to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs c.
in addition to establishing substantive requirements,the idea also includes procedural safeguards which,if violated,may prevent a child from receiving a fape.among the most important procedural safeguards are those that protect the parents right to be involved in the development of their child educational plan.parents not only represent the best interests of their child in the iep development process,they also provide information about the child critical to developing a comprehensive iep and which only they are in a position to know.to guarantee parents the ability to make informed decisions about their child education,the idea grants them the right to examine all relevant records relating to their child identification,evaluation,and educational placement,as well as to obtain an independent educational evaluation of their child if they disagree with what the school district or state agency has found.b a.p arents have the right to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a fape to such child.b e after making their complaint,the parents are entitled to an impartial due process hearing conducted by the state educational agency or by the local educational agency or an intermediate educational unit,as determined by state law or by the state educational agency,b,and if either party is dissatisfied with the state educational agency review,they may bring a civil action in state or federal court,e.
according to two studies conducted in the,of every children suffer from autism autism is a developmental disorder of neurobiological origin that generally has lifelong effects on how children learn to be social beings,to take care of themselves,and to participate in the community.national research council,educating children with autism catherine lord james mcgee,national academy press the disorder is present from birth,or very early in development,and affects the child ability to communicate ideas and feelings,to use her imagination,and to establish relationships with others.id.no single behavior is characteristic of autism,and no single known cause is responsible for its onset.id.perhaps most distressingly,currently there is no cure.id.
although autism manifests itself in different ways,its symptoms in children are often measurable by eighteen months of age.id.at.the main characteristics that differentiate autism from other developmental disorders include behavioral deficits in eye contact,orienting to one name,joint attention behaviors,pointing,showing,pretend play,imitation,nonverbal communication,and language development.id.according to the national academy of sciences,w ith adequate time and training,the diagnosis of autism can be made reliably in by professionals experienced in the diagnostic assessment of young children with autistic disorders.id.at.early diagnosis is crucial because education of children as well as of parents and teachers is the primary form of treatment,and the earlier it starts,the better.id.at.education covers a wide range of skills or not only academic learning,but also socialization,adaptive skills,language and communication,and reduction of behavior assist a child to develop independence and personal responsibility.id.
without early identification and diagnosis,children suffering from autism will not be equipped with the skills necessary to benefit from educational services.id.at.a report by the national research council analyzed ten educational intervention models for children with autistic disorders.all ten programs emphasized the importance of starting intervention when children are at the earliest possible ages.id.at.these studies showed that intensive early intervention makes a clinically significant difference for many children.id.at.all of the models presented positive and remarkably similar findings,which included gains in iq scores,language,autistic symptoms,future school placements,and several measures of social behavior.id.further,at least two retrospective studies have found less restrictive placement outcomes for children who began intervention at earlier rather than later ages.id.at.thus,the available research strongly suggests that intensive early intervention can make a critical difference to children with autistic disorders.id.at.
iii.amanda 
amanda was born in.she and her family lived in las vegas,nevada,in the clark county school district,until they moved to california in october.on january,when amanda was two years old,she was evaluated by a psychologist at the special children clinic,who found her to be moderately low in communication and daily living skills and adequate in socialization and motor skills.the psychologist recommended that amanda be placed in the district early childhood program prior to her third birthday to determine her eligibility for special education and to promote her needs.
on march,amanda was evaluated by psychologist mark kenney,and speech pathologist christy zuckerman,both of whom worked for the district.amanda parents attended all of her evaluation sessions.kenney written report indicated that amanda results on the autism behavior checklist abc were mixed.he noted that 
h er mother reported that she whirled herself for long periods of time,did not play with toys appropriately,seemed not to hear,about with spinning,had severe temper tantrums,had not developed friendships,got involved with rituals such as lining things up,had communication problems,and had strong reactions to changes in.
kenney also noted that amanda social skills were generally below average for her age.kenney concluded that amanda was developmentally delayed and recommended an eligibility assessment for special education,a coordinated system to improve her behavior problems,speech and language services,parental training,and further evaluation by a child psychiatrist.these recommendations were recorded in a written report,a copy of which was not given to amanda mother.in addition,amanda mother says kenney never discussed these recommendations with her.kenney claims that he did.
zuckerman found that amanda qualified as severely autistic under the childhood autism rating scale,and recommended speech and language therapy as well as further assessments in other areas.she also believed that s pecific activities should be developed and demonstrated in the classroom to stimulate social interaction and the development of communication skills.zuckerman observed that amanda was and engaged in random babbling.she was,however,able to imitate actions and sounds from a videotape.zuckerman had no documentation establishing that she told amanda mother of the severe autism rating,but she testified that her general practice was to discuss such results with the child parents.according to amanda mother,zuckerman never contacted her to discuss her findings.
on march,amanda was evaluated by the school nurse,who found no health problems other than a concern for amanda hearing abilities.amanda mother did not consent to an audiological evaluation.
on april,an eligibility team determined that amanda was eligible for special education due to her difficulties in the areas of receptive or expressive language,cognitive ability,and social or emotional condition.the team included kenney,a special education teacher,and a local agency coordinator.once amanda had been deemed eligible for special education,but prior to the initial iep meeting,amanda mother requested copies of amanda assessment reports.the district did not send her any records until after the initial iep was completed,and at that time she received only a summary of kenney observations.
on may,the initial iep meeting was held with amanda parents,an early childhood special education teacher,and a district representative.the iep team recognized that amanda demonstrated delays in language,cognitive,social skills,and.goals of toilet training,matching colors and shapes,establishing eye contact,making choices,and following classroom activities and rules were established.the iep placed amanda in a specialized early childhood special education program to develop emerging skills to generalize to a large setting,and included speech and language therapy as needed.at the iep meeting,amanda parents were given notice of their parental rights and the procedural safeguards of both the idea and the nevada administrative code.
pursuant to the iep,amanda enrolled in the extended school year program,a program designed to assist students in maintaining their current levels over the summer break.amanda parents felt that six to eight weeks of instruction would help amanda continue to develop her emerging language skills.on september,sixteen days after school officially started,amanda enrolled in lynn martin early childhood education class.while enrolled in martin class,amanda had some speech sessions with therapist marshall fenig.fenig therapy focused on attending to name,vocal or verbal interaction and following directions.on a review sheet dated november,completed after amanda family moved to california and left the district,fenig noted that,although amanda was not in therapy for a long period of time,adequate progress had been made.he recommended continued therapy.
on october,amanda early childhood teacher,martin,requested an iep review because she felt amanda was ready to have some of her goals invested sic.she needed to have some of her cognitive goals changed and she also was ready to have some fine motor goals added which were on the original iep.
on october,a second iep meeting was held.a state agency designee,amanda mother,and martin were in attendance.during the review the iep team noted that although amanda had improved with respect to her toilet training goal,she still did not go to the bathroom independently,nor did she use language to manipulate her environment,make eye contact when spoken to,or respond consistently to her name.although amanda was noted to display amazing dexterity in the fine motor skills area and had learned to copy a simple circle,she had poor pencil and scissors grasp.amanda was also able to match all colors and shapes,work a simple inset puzzle,and complete complex tangrams.individual instruction was recommended to improve her short attention span and lack of interest in cognitive games.the second iep also recommended more specific speech and language sixty minutes a week rather than as needed.
approximately eleven days after the second iep assessment,on or around october,amanda and her parents moved to california.amanda had been enrolled in the district for school days,of which were in the early childhood special education program.soon after moving,amanda was enrolled in the first steps preschool in woodland,california in an interim placement program.amanda mother signed an authorization for of information,which allowed amanda files to be transferred from the siegle diagnostic center in nevada to her preschool in california.the records were transferred on december,and on december,a yolo county iep team in woodland reviewed the interim placement and determined amanda was properly placed.
on december,michael harris,a physician and amanda uncle,referred amanda to robin hansen,a professor of pediatrics and the director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at medical center,requesting that amanda be evaluated because of characteristics denoting autism.amanda was diagnosed as autistic for the first time on january,by hansen,who referred amanda parents to families for early autism treatment and to the alta regional center for a second opinion.on february,the alta regional center confirmed the diagnosis of autism.
one day earlier,on february,amanda mother had amanda evaluated by jane germ and her employee melissa travis from american river speech and hearing associates.amanda was diagnosed with a severe language delay.six months of intensive speech therapy was prescribed.american river did not diagnose amanda as autistic.
amanda began an intervention program with vicki wells using a discreet trial format for fifteen hours a week on april.amanda parents funded this program.
on april,amanda parents requested an iep review from the california school district.at the iep meeting,amanda parents were given updated assessments from the alta regional center and american river as well as copies of the clark county school district early reports indicating possible autism.when they finally saw copies of the district reports,amanda parents learned for the first time that the district had detected the possibility of autism more than a year previously.the reports indicating the possible autism diagnosis were not mentioned in kenney summary of amanda present levels of educational performance.
on april,amanda was evaluated by bryna siegel,associate adjunct professor and director of persuasive developmental disorders clinic.siegel confirmed that amanda was autistic and recommended special preschool classes focusing on her expressive and receptive language skills,the continuation of wells at home intervention for twenty hours a week,and the utilization of individual,weekly speech therapy.
on july,alta regional center began funding amanda home intervention program.on october,another iep meeting was held in california when amanda parents unilaterally decided to remove amanda from the early intervention program so that she could visit a kindergarten class in another school district.a december,psychological report indicated that amanda was progressing well in her academic skills,but still required considerable support from her teachers.on june,the iep team met again and decided that amanda should be placed in a regular kindergarten class,with additional individual speech therapy.
amanda parents requested a due process hearing in nevada on october,to resolve whether amanda had been correctly identified and whether she had received a fape.a due process hearing was held march.the hearing officer concluded that amanda had been misidentified as developmentally delayed and had therefore been denied a fape.on june,the state review officer reversed,overturning the credibility determinations of the ho,concluding that amanda parents had been informed of the tests suggesting a diagnosis of autism.the sro did not reach the procedural violations found by the ho.amanda family challenged the sro decisions in federal court.construing this case as an appeal from an adverse administrative decision,the district court deferred to the factual and legal conclusions of the sro and found that amanda had neither been misdiagnosed nor denied a fape.it,like the sro,did not address the procedural violations found by the ho.amanda timely appealed 
iv.standard of review 
this case requires us to conduct a review of decisions of the district court,the nevada state review officer,and the district due process hearing officer.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error even when they are based on the written record of administrative proceedings.burlington,weyerhaeuser,cir gregory longview sch,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the evidence in the record supports the finding but the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.burlington,at.questions of law and mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed de novo,unless the mixed question is primarily factual.gregory,at.we review de novo the question of whether a school district proposed individualized education program provided a free appropriate public education.id.
under the idea,federal courts reviewing state administrative proceedings are to receive the records of the administrative proceedings hear additional evidence at the request of a party and grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate based on a preponderance of the evidence.i b.thus,congress intended judicial review in idea cases to differ substantially from judicial review of other agency actions,in which courts generally are confined to the administrative record and are held to a highly deferential standard of review.ojai unified sch.dist.jackson,cir.complete de novo review,however,is inappropriate.thomas cincinnati bd.of,cir.as the supreme court has held,we are not free to substitute our own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which we review.rowley,at.because congress intended states to have the primary responsibility of formulating each individual child education,we must defer to their specialized knowledge and experience by giving due weight to the decisions of the states administrative bodies.id.at.
here we are confronted with a question the supreme court did not address when it articulated the due weight standard of review in rowley.at the due process hearing,the hearing officer concluded that the district failed to properly identify amanda as an autistic child amanda gained very minimal educational benefits from the program she attended and amanda parents should be compensated for past educational costs and awarded compensatory education.the state review officer disagreed and reversed the ho decision,in part because the sro disagreed with the credibility determinations of the ho.thus we must decide to which state administrative body decision we accord due weight when the decisions are at odds due to conflicting credibility determinations.
because we have not previously addressed this question,we turn to our sister circuits for guidance.we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions of the second,sixth,and seventh circuits that,in most situations,due weight must be given to the final decision of the state authorities,which in a system is that of the sro.see karl bd.of educ.of geneseo cent.sch,cir we believe rowley requires that federal courts defer to the final decision of the state authorities,and that deference may not be eschewed merely because a decision is not unanimous or the reviewing authority disagrees with the hearing officer.thomas,at f ederal courts are required to defer to the final decision of the state authorities heather wisconsin,cir relying on thomas and karl in holding that due weight must be given to the final state determination in a review process.
we also agree with our colleagues in the second,third,fourth,and tenth circuits that when an sro overturns the credibility determinations of an ho,due weight to the decision of the sro is not warranted.the fourth circuit has held,for example,that in situations where two state administrative decisions differ only with respect to the credibility of a witness,the ho is entitled to be considered prima facie correct.doyle arlington county sch,cir.in doyle,the sro reversed the ho decision on the grounds that a particular witness testimony was not credible even though the sro had neither seen nor heard the witness testify.id.at.because reviewing the credibility determination of a was so far from the accepted norm of a process designed to discover truth,the court accorded due weight to the ho on the credibility determination.id.the court,however,was careful to limit its holding to cases in which a state administrative appeals authority has departed from the norm to such an extent as here.id.at.see,springer fairfax county sch,cir rejecting springer contention that,under doyle,the decision of the ho must be given deference over that of the sro because the ho had no special claim to deference as it did in doyle the ho decision did not turn on witness credibility as it did in doyle and the sro provided specific reasons for departing from the ho decision which the sro in doyle did not delaware county intermediate unit martin,doyle did not create a per se rule to that effect.rather,the doyle court specifically limited its holding to the facts of that case.
the fourth circuit is not alone in recognizing this exception to the general rule that deference should be accorded to the final decision of state authorities.according to the second circuit,
t here is no principle of administrative law which,absent a disagreement between a hearing officer and reviewing agency over demeanor evidence,obviates the need for deference to an agency final decision where such deference is otherwise appropriate.
similarly,the third circuit has held that the 
findings of the ho deserve deference unless,extrinsic evidence in the record would justify a contrary conclusion or unless the record read in its entirety would compel a contrary conclusion.but beyond this rather narrow class of,factual findings,we think that,to give the statute language about independent decisions effect,the appeals panel must have much more leeway in reviewing other based findings of the hearing officer.we will therefore defer to the appeals panel rather than the hearing officer in most circumstances.
see carlisle area sch.dist.scott,cir citations omitted 
the tenth circuit is also in accord 
w e will give due weight to the reviewing officer decision on the issues with which he disagreed with the hearing officer,unless the hearing officer decisions involved credibility determinations and assuming,of course,that the record supports the reviewing officer decision.
olathe dist.schs.unified sch.dist,cir.
we join our colleagues in holding that in a state administrative system due weight should be accorded to the final state of the the sro decision deviates from the credibility determination of a witness whom only the ho observed testify.traditional notions of the deference owed to the fact finder compel this conclusion.the state review officer is in no better position than the district court or an appellate court to weigh the competing credibility of witnesses observed only by the hearing officer.this standard comports with general principles of administrative law which give deference to the unique knowledge and experience of state agencies while recognizing that a ho who receives live testimony is in the best position to determine issues of credibility 
free appropriate public education 
we next consider whether amanda received a fape as required by the idea.the idea was created to bring previously excluded handicapped children into the public education systems of the states and to require the states to adopt procedures which would result in individualized consideration of and instruction for each child.rowley,at.to accomplish this goal,congress provides federal funding to states that have in effect a policy that assures all children the right to a free appropriate public education.a fape is defined by the idea as 
special education and related services that a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge b meet the standards of the state educational agency c include an appropriate preschool,elementary,or secondary school education in the state involved and d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section a of this title.
a.for purposes of the idea,special education means specially designed instruction,at no cost to parents or guardians,to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,including a instruction conducted in the classroom,in the home,in hospitals and institutions,and in other settings a.thus,a fape must be tailored to the unique needs of the handicapped child.rowley,at.although the instruction provided need not be the absolutely best or potential maximizing,gregory,at citation omitted,congress did not intend that a school system could discharge its duty under the idea by providing a program that produces some minimal academic advancement,no matter how trivial,hall vance county bd.of,cir holding that a child was denied a fape when the school failed to inform his parents of their procedural rights,including the right to an independent evaluation,and failed to develop an iep which met the act requirements.
our inquiry in determining whether amanda received a free appropriate public education is twofold.we must determine first whether the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and,second,whether the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.rowley,at.if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.id.at.
procedural compliance 
amanda argues that the district court and the sro failed to consider the procedural violations of the act and the nevada administrative code,and therefore erroneously determined that amanda received a fape.specifically,amanda contends i the district failure to allow her parents to examine all of the records used in identifying and addressing amanda disability violated the idea ii its failure to include both her parents and a speech or language specialist in the multidisciplinary team that identified her as eligible for special education violated nevada administrative code and iii these procedural violations denied her parents the ability to participate in the development of amanda iep in an informed and effective manner thereby preventing amanda from receiving a fape.we agree that the district violated the procedural requirements of the idea,something that the sro and the district court did not consider,by failing to timely disclose amanda records to her those evaluations indicating possible autism and suggesting further psychiatric evaluation was needed.the district egregious procedural violations denied amanda a fape.
enumerates the procedural safeguards of the idea,the importance of which can not be gainsaid.rowley,at.procedural compliance is essential to ensuring that every eligible child receives a fape,and those procedures which provide for meaningful parent participation are particularly important.as the senate committee on labor and public welfare recognized,
in many instances the process of providing special education and related services to handicapped children is not guaranteed to produce any particular outcome.by changing the language of the provision relating to individualized educational programs to emphasize the process of parent and child involvement and to provide a written record of reasonable expectations,the committee intends to clarify that such individualized planning conferences are a way to provide parent involvement and protection to assure that appropriate services are provided to a handicapped child.
at,reprinted in.by mandating parental involvement and requiring that parents have full access to their child records,congress sought to ensure that the interests of the individual children were protected.see rowley,at.not only will parents fight for what is in their child best interests,but because they observe their children in a multitude of different situations,they have a unique perspective of their child special needs.
among the procedural rights guaranteed to parents by the idea is the right to examine all relevant records with respect to the identification,evaluation,and educational placement of the child,and the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child b a.if parents disagree with the state agency evaluation,they are entitled to an independent educational evaluation of the child.id.if the state educational agency proposes to initiate or change,or refuses to initiate or change,the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,it must give the parents written prior notice.b c.the district must also establish procedures designed to assure that the notice required by clause c fully informs the parents of all procedures available pursuant to this section.b d.
the critical nature of the provisions protecting parental involvement is highlighted when they are considered in light of the stated purposes of the idea.to accomplish the idea goal of ensuring that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs,c,those individuals who have knowledge of the child needs and who are most concerned about the child must be involved in the iep creation process.the procedural safeguards facilitate this objective.they also help to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected.c.
given the importance of the idea procedural safeguards,it should be of no surprise that when a school district or other state agency violates the procedural requirements of the act by failing to develop an iep in the manner specified,the purposes of the act are not served,and the district may have failed to provide a fape.bd.of trustees of target range sch,cir.as the supreme court observed,
i t seems to us no exaggeration to say that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process,see,a d,as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.we think that the congressional emphasis upon full participation of concerned parties throughout the development of the iep demonstrates the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what congress wished in the way of substantive content in an iep.
rowley,at.not every procedural violation,however,is sufficient to support a finding that the child in question was denied a fape.technical deviations,for exa
