when a school district lays off certificated employees because of a reduction of services,pursuant to education code section,are employees with greater seniority entitled to bump a employee with lesser seniority we agree with the trial court that they are not and,therefore,shall affirm its judgment denying the writ of mandate sought by certificated employees who were released while the school district retained a similarly credentialed employee with lesser seniority.
background 
following the termination of a memorandum of understanding under which the helena unified school district the district had provided special education services to three other school districts,the district initiated lay off proceedings under section to reduce or discontinue five certificated positions,including one equivalent fte school psychologist position.at the time,the district employed appellant margaret hildebrandt in a fte position as a certificated school psychologist and appellant susan in a similar fte position.both appellants had seniority dates that preceded the seniority date of ramah commanday,who was employed by the district as a certificated school psychologist.although timely termination notices were given to all three employees,the district subsequently rescinded the notice to commanday.following an evidentiary hearing,an administrative law judge found that it was necessary to eliminate one fte psychologist position and rejected appellants contention that because of their greater seniority the district was required to retain them in preference to commanday.according to the administrative law judge,district does not allow a employee to bump a employee.it also believes that a psychologist is what is needed for program continuity.and hildebrandt are entitled to the same positions they would have held had no reduction in service occurred.the positions which they are entitled to retain by virtue of seniority and qualifications have been discontinued.and hildebrandt do not have the right to force district to divide a position to accommodate their desire for employment.therefore,district may lay off both and hildebrandt.
the district governing board adopted the proposed decision of the administrative law judge,and the superior court subsequently denied a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to set aside that decision.appellants have timely appealed from that denial.
discussion 
the issue presented by this appeal is essentially a question of law,as to which this court must exercise its independent judgment.pacific gas electric department of water resources th,d.insofar as the decision turns on questions of fact,the findings of the trial court,which adopted those of the administrative law judge,must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.neumarkel allard d.
section,subdivision b provides in relevant part that when the governing board of a school district deems it necessary for specified reasons to decrease the number of permanent employees in the district,the governing board may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated employees of the district,permanent as well as probationary,at the close of the school year.except as otherwise provided by statute,the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any probationary employee,or any other employee with less seniority,is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.subdivision c provides further that t he governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.
reading the statutory language literally,there is considerable force to appellants position.though,both appellants are permanent employees certificated to render the services of a school psychologist that commanday performs.although the district argues that they are not competent to render those services because they are only employees and not entitled to a position that is not how competence is normally understood for purposes of the education code.see,forker board of trustees d.the term competent as used in section relates to specific skills or qualifications required of the applicant duax kern community college dist.d.and,as stated in krausen solano county junior college dist.d,and repeated in numerous subsequent decisions,the language of the statute is not ambiguous.it contains a mandatory directive to the board to determine whether any employee whose employment is to be terminated for a reduction in attendance or for a reduction in a particular type of service possessed the seniority and qualifications which would entitle him to be assigned to another position.it seems clear that the provision in question does confer seniority rights and bumping privileges upon probationary,as well as permanent employees.the provision has been interpreted to mean that when a particular service is eliminated or reduced the holder of the position is not necessarily terminated,but is entitled to another assignment to which his seniority and qualifications entitled him,campbell elementary teachers,abbott d.
in rejecting appellants contention,both the administrative law judge and the superior court relied primarily on two decisions rendered under section,which confers on permanent employees terminated under section a preferred right to reappointment if the discontinued service is reestablished within months of the employee termination.like section,this section provides that no probationary or other employee with less seniority shall be employed to render a service which said employee is certificated and competent to render,subd.a.
in king berkeley unified school dist.d,a certificated school counselor who had previously been terminated because of a reduction in services sought to enforce her right to preferential employment under what is now section the school district hired a new employee to fill a new position that involved percent counseling duties,and percent teaching duties for which the former employee was not certificated.in rejecting her petition for a writ of mandate,the court observed that the former employee was not qualified for the teaching half of the new position and that n o cited authority compels the school district to offer two separate positions in order to accommodate those previously laid off.id.at.
in murray sonoma county office of education d.murray,a school nurse was employed by the sonoma county office of education in a permanent fte position that was discontinued for budgetary reasons.she sought a writ of mandate when the office of education created a nursing position the following year but employed another person with less seniority to fill the position and refused to reinstate her to a fte position.the nurse contended that under section she is entitled to be rehired as a school nurse before an employee with less seniority may be hired to fill a school nurse position.id.at.in rejecting this contention,the court stated,first,the purpose of section is to give a permanent employee the same employment rights that she would have had if no layoff had intervened,but to no greater rights.waldron sulphur springs union school dist.d,italics added.thus,when a employee is laid off he or she is not entitled to a position which subsequently opens up.section only requires that the employee be returned to his or her prelayoff status.id.at.moreover,in our view the nurse did not have the right to force the office of education to divide the position to accommodate her desire for a position.ibid.
the court in murray also rejected the nurse claim on the additional ground that section did not apply to her situation because the fte school nurse position was not the same service as the nursing position that became available.according to the court,the resolution of this issue depends on how we define the service which was discontinued.the nurse contends that the service is the one day per week of nursing provided to a particular school district.the office of education,on the other hand,suggests that the service is the fte position which was discontinued but never reestablished.we believe that the office of education interpretation of service is more reasonable.the nurse service one day a week of nursing to be used by the office of education was discontinued but has not been reestablished.instead,a nurse has been assigned to cover the particular school district,a function formerly covered by the service the nurse provided.since the discontinued service her fte position has not been reestablished,we conclude that the nurse is not entitled to reemployment under section.murray,supra,d at.
appellants in the present case dispute the applicability of king and murray because those cases concerned the right to reinstatement under section,rather than the right to retention under section.appellants assert that the inclusion in section of the additional provision not found in section,that t he governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render,indicates that in a layoff situation a employee with greater seniority is entitled to require the splitting of a position held by an employee with less seniority,even though the former employee may not do so in a rehiring situation.
there is no reason to draw such an implication from the additional provision in section.the provision is meaningful in that section because when layoffs are being made,employees who lose their position are entitled to displace,or bump,employees with less seniority from their positions hence the requirement that the school district make assignments and reassignments to respect the employees relative seniority rights.however,ordinarily there is no bumping when a former employee is rehired under section because the rehiring occurs only when the discontinued service is reestablished or the number of employees is increased hence,there is no reason for a similar reassignment provision in section,and the inclusion of such a provision in section does not suggest any intent to require the splitting of positions when layoffs occur that is not required in the case of reinstatement.
more telling is the similarity between the language of sections and related to the order of layoff and reemployment.as pointed out above,section,subdivision b provides that the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any probationary employee,or any other employee with less seniority,is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.section,subdivision a provides that no probationary or other employee with less seniority shall be employed to render a service which said employee is certificated and competent to render.a statute should be interpreted with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part.people comingore cal d,see also,vasquez happy valley union school dist.th,d.the provisions in the two sections should be read together and applied consistently if reasonably possible to do so.bettencourt city and county of san francisco th,d.the purpose of the provision in both sections is the same to give preference to qualified employees based upon their relative seniority.if this preference does not entitle an employee with seniority to compel a school district to split a position held by an employee with less seniority in the case of a reinstatement,we see no reason why a district should be compelled to split the position in the event of a layoff.
the heart of the dispute lies within the alternative ground on which the decision in murray is based.the provisions in both section and quoted above prohibit a school district,under the circumstances to which the sections apply,from employing a person with less seniority to render a service that an employee with greater seniority is qualified to perform.murray held that a position to perform a particular assignment is not the same service as a position to perform the same assignment.appellants argue that murray misinterpreted the word service.a teacher service has no relation to the time spent in his or her position.instead,a teacher service is the same as a teacher position,or the subject matter or grade level at which the teacher teaches.
school districts have broad discretion in defining positions within the district and establishing requirements for employment.martin kentfield school dist.cal d,duax kern community college,supra,d at.this discretion encompasses determining the training and experience necessary for particular positions,so long as the district does not impose requirements for reemployment under section that are not imposed on other employees who have not been subject to layoff.martin kentfield school,supra,at.similarly,school districts have the discretion to determine particular kinds of services that will be eliminated,even though a service continues to be performed or provided in a different manner by the district.campbell elementary teachers,abbott,supra,d at.see also id.at.gallup board of trustees th,d.
within the scope of a school district discretion,there is little reason why a district should be unable to define a position as full time if the district concludes that the assignment can not be as well performed on a basis.no less than in determining the qualifications necessary to render a person competent to perform a particular assignment,this determination falls within the special competence of school district officials.king berkeley unified school,supra,d at.duax kern community college,supra,d at.as the court held in murray,a district may define a service in terms of the hours required to perform it,so that two employees performing the same responsibilities do not necessarily perform the same service as one employee.a school district need not define a service in such a manner,and in many situations may well determine that an assignment can equally effectively be shared by two or more employees.however,so long as the determination is reasonable and made in good faith,neither section nor any other provision of the education code precludes a school district from defining a position,or a service,as full time.
this conclusion is consistent with the legislature finding in section that school districts have diverse needs unique to their individual communities and programs i n addressing their needs,common as well as unique,school districts should have the flexibility to create their own unique solutions,subd.a.the legislature has stated explicitly its intention to give school districts broad authority to carry on activities and programs which,in the determination of the governing board of the school district are necessary or desirable in meeting their needs,subd.b.
at the administrative hearing in this case,the assistant superintendent of the district testified that the district considers the psychologist to be programmatically what we need for the students in our district for program continuity and for a variety of other reasons.this testimony was amplified by the testimony of the psychologist retained in the position in question the administrative law judge accepted this testimony as did the trial court that adopted her findings.amicus curiae the education legal alliance of the california school boards association argues that even on the assumption with which it disagrees that the single school psychologist position could be split into separate positions without disrupting the educational program of the district,such is not always the case.at the elementary school level,where school districts generally employ a single fte employee to teach a particular class,requiring a district to split a teaching position into two or more positions to accommodate the fte of senior employees would be extremely difficult,if not impossible.fn.omitted.
neither appellant here asserts that by virtue of her seniority she is entitled to the psychologist position commanday holds.we have no occasion to consider what the appellants rights would have been had such a demand been made appellan
