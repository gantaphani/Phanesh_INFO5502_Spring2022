the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,requires that states,as a condition of receiving federal funds,provide each disabled child within their school system a free appropriate public education.in this action,the parents of an autistic child,robert brown bobby,were unhappy with the individualized educational program iep that their school district,the bartholomew consolidated school corporation bartholomew,proposed for the school year to address bobby autism.unable to settle their differences through negotiation,the parties proceeded before a state administrative officer,who ruled in favor of bartholomew.bobby parents appealed to the state board of special educational appeals bsea,which upheld the hearing officer determination.the browns then filed this action in the district court,requesting reversal of the administrative decisions.after hearing new evidence on bobby academic progress following the bsea decision,the district court affirmed the bsea.the browns then filed this appeal.in the meantime,while this appeal has been pending,the browns enrolled bobby to a different school district and agreed to a new iep for bobby upcoming school year.as we explain further in the following opinion,this change in circumstances renders bobby case moot.we therefore vacate the order of the district court and remand with the direction to dismiss this action on that ground.
backgrounda.facts 
bobby brown was born on march,and is currently old.at age two,he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder,a condition that severely impaired the development of his linguistic and social abilities.bobby autism qualified him as a child with a disability under the idea,see a,and when bobby was three,the browns sought free appropriate educational assistance from their local school district,bartholomew.bobby was evaluated and determined to be eligible for the district early childhood special education ecse,a developmental preschool program for disabled children.once a child is designated disabled under the idea,the act requires that the child receive an individually tailored instruction program,or iep,that first is developed and then annually reviewed by a committee,or iep team,composed of parents and educators.see id.d a.consistent with this statutory directive,bartholomew convened a case conference on april,to develop an initial iep for bobby.the iep team recommended that bobby attend ecse services three days per week,receive sessions of therapy two times per week,and a session of occupational therapy once a week.the browns agreed.
subsequently,the browns began researching alternative educational approaches to treating bobby autism.they learned of an approach developed by ivar lovaas known as discrete trial training,which emphasizes heavy parental involvement,early intervention and treatment in the home and elsewhere in the community,rather than in professional settings.the browns,without consulting bartholomew,hired janet rumple,who had been trained in a variation of the lovaas approach known as applied behavior analysis aba.with the help of rumple,the browns began a aba program for bobby and hired two additional aba aides to carry out bobby instruction with oversight and training from rumple.
bartholomew held a second case conference on april,to revise bobby iep in contemplation of the upcoming school year.the committee agreed that bobby aba instruction should substitute for the occupational therapy and fine motor skills services that bobby was receiving through the school.in an effort to cover the increased cost of the program,the browns and bartholomew submitted an application for alternative services to the indiana department of education doe,requesting approval of funding of bobby aba program.the application listed bobby major behavioral impediments such as fecal smearing,temper tantrums,physical aggression and behavior,all of which,it submitted,prevented bobby from learning in a school environment.the doe denied the request,noting that bobby behavioral difficulties were not,at that point,occurring at school.the doe encouraged the browns and bartholomew to try increasing bobby school hours and assistance before requesting additional funding.
the case conference reconvened,and bartholomew proposed a revised iep that would allow bobby to attend school accompanied by a,aide who would provide necessary assistance and behavioral intervention.the browns objected to this proposal because the aide recommended by bartholomew had not been trained in aba instruction.instead,the browns proposed that bobby receive instruction by an educator for eight hours per day,five days a week.
as the school year went forward,negotiations between bartholomew and the browns continued to stall.bobby was reevaluated by a private child development center,and the evaluation suggested that bobby aba treatment was producing some positive results.yet,bartholomew still would not agree to an iep that included aba treatment.typically,when disputes arise over an iep,they are resolved through the impartial due process procedures prescribed by the idea.see id.f.the browns filed a request for a due process hearing,but before it got underway,the parties reached a settlement,the terms of which were memorialized in an agreement dated february.the agreement provided for a schedule of three hours of,aba instruction in the morning,three hours of aba instruction at school,followed by two hours of aba instruction after school.on fridays,bobby would receive six hours of,aba instruction,and this schedule would continue throughout the summer during which all instruction would take place at bobby home.pursuant to the settlement,bartholomew entered into service contracts with rumple and two aides to oversee and assist in bobby aba instruction and to train bobby teachers at smith elementary school in aba methods.the terms of the settlement were formalized as bobby iep for the remainder of the school year and the following summer.bartholomew also agreed to reimburse the browns for attorneys fees,school supplies and the costs incurred in providing private aba instruction going back to june.
for the month of june,rumple was unable to maintain the level of hours expected of her due to personal and professional commitments.interested anyway in shifting bobby program to a more approach,the browns retained the services of carl sundberg,a professor at western michigan university who specialized in applied verbal behavior avb,a variant of aba instruction.sundberg avb methods emphasized rudimentary conversation skills that are taught through a sequence of steps,with each step building on the ones before it.in sundberg view,bobby would need instruction in these basic conversation skills for his upcoming transition from early childhood education to kindergarten.sundberg believed that bobby had to raise his conversational skill level,as measured under the avb program,from its current level to before he would be ready to enter kindergarten.the browns transitioned bobby from his aba program to sundberg avb instruction,and janet rumple continued to oversee the program and arranged training for school personnel and aides.bobby entered kindergarten at the start of the school year,attending the program on a basis at richards elementary school.all other terms of the parties settlement agreement remained in place,and bartholomew continued to pay the salaries of bobby aba aides and janet rumple.
the idea requires that each child with a disability be evaluated at least once every three years to assess the child status as disabled and to evaluate the child progress in the school curriculum.id.a a.when bobby reevaluation came due in april,both parties recruited outside specialists to undertake independent evaluations.one of bartholomew two specialists,john umbreit,was an expert in aba methods and a professor of special education at the university of arizona.he observed bobby in the classroom and at home and interviewed brown and bobby teachers.based on his evaluation,umbreit made several recommendations,the most important of which was that bobby attend a full day of kindergarten class at richards elementary,assisted by an instructional aide for most of the school day.in umbreit opinion,bobby would benefit from learning the necessary functional skills,such as communication,self care and motor abilities,in a classroom setting that involved materials and activities.to the greatest extent possible,according to umbreit,bobby instruction should be embedded within typical activities that were provided to other students in his general education class.
the browns experts disagreed.james mulick,professor of pediatrics and psychology at the ohio state university,observed bobby at home and in school.he concluded that,although both settings were appropriate and beneficial,bobby was not ready for kindergarten.mulnick recommended that bobby remain in a program identical to his iep that remained in place at the time.according to mulnick,a full school day would be detrimental,given that bobby was unable to carry on a conversation and appeared disengaged in a classroom setting.instead,the intensive,instruction was necessary to correct bobby significant language deficit,which,at the time,placed him near the range of mental retardation.
the parties met in case conference on may.the browns were accompanied by their attorneys and sundberg.also in attendance was george van hom,bartholomew special education director,in addition to a number of richards elementary administrators,teachers,aba aides and psychologists.bartholomew proposed a placement for bobby school year that consisted of kindergarten classroom education at richards elementary,five days per week,from to each day.under the proposed placement,bobby would participate in all kindergarten activities with support from a,teaching assistant,in addition to special education staff.the kindergarten placement also provided for special instruction from the learning resource teacher for minutes each day,minutes per week of direct instruction from the kindergarten teacher,three speech therapy sessions per week,and occupational therapy sessions twice a week.when bartholomew finished outlining this proposal,the meeting effectively ended.by all accounts,the browns were so profoundly opposed to this proposal that they simply stated their disagreement with bartholomew and left the meeting.
the browns then filed their second request for a due process hearing.their complaint to the independent hearing officer iho alleged that bartholomew conduct in negotiating bobby placement violated both the procedural and substantive requirements of the idea.the browns asserted first that bartholomew had predetermined bobby iep before the may case conference without soliciting input from the browns and their experts the iho disagreed,noting that it is permissible for case conference participants to approach negotiations with drafts of a proposed iep,as both parties did in this case.according to the iho,there was no evidence that bartholomew approached the case conference unwilling to review,discuss or compromise on its proposal.because the browns halted negotiations before any could occur,in the iho view,they had no basis to claim that bartholomew proposal was set in stone.the iho next considered the browns protest that the iep,as proposed by bartholomew at the may conference,did not contain a plan to transition bobby into the placement.although the iho recognized that no transition plan was proposed,he concluded that impasse on the placement itself preempted any discussion of transition methods accordingly,bartholomew failure to offer such a plan did not violate the idea.finally,the iho addressed the browns substantive contention that bartholomew proposal was not reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.bd.of educ.rowley,d after reviewing the record and hearing testimony from both parties experts,the iho concluded that the proposed kindergarten placement was appropriate under the circumstances.the iho recognized that,as bobby grows older and his peers outpace his development,bobby may require more schooling.nevertheless,according to the iho,bartholomew should have been given the opportunity to try a program with appropriate support in order to determine bobby suitability to that type of placement.
on appeal to the indiana board of special educational appeals bsea,the iho decision was upheld in all respects.the browns had argued to the board that the parties dispute was not,at bottom,a dispute over conflicting methodologies rather it turned on whether bartholomew proposal was appropriate.the bsea rejected this characterization of the dispute.in its estimation,the parties were arguing simply about which program was better.appellant app.at.the idea,according to the bsea,did not require bartholomew to provide bobby with the better or best possible education bartholomew duty was only to tender a program that was reasonably designed to produce meaningful educational results.the bsea concluded that bartholomew had fulfilled this obligation.
district court proceedings 
a party aggrieved by the decision of a local educational agency may bring a civil action for review of that decision by a federal district court.see i a.the browns exercised their right to judicial review and brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana.count i of their complaint sought redress for the denial of bobby right to a free appropriate education,and repeated allegations of both substantive and procedural violations of the idea on the part of bartholomew.count ii invoked the browns right to a or pendency injunction that would preserve bobby iep and the incorporated terms of the parties february settlement agreement.see id.j d uring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,the child shall remain in the educational placement.in other words,the injunction would keep bobby in a kindergarten placement pending the resolution of the browns action in the district court and any subsequent appeal.the browns complaint alleged that bartholomew was not prepared to honor bobby pendency entitlements.at.therefore,in their prayer for relief,the browns not only sought reversal of the administrative decisions,but also continuation of the kindergarten placement and the terms of the settlement agreement,in addition to attorneys fees and costs.
the district court upheld in full the state administrative decisions in favor of bartholomew.on the issues relevant to this appeal,the district court determined that bartholomew officials had not the proposed change to bobby program without involving the browns in the process that bartholomew did not violate the idea by failing to provide adequate means to transition bobby into the proposed placement and that the proposed placement was reasonably calculated to provide bobby a free appropriate education within the meaning of the idea.
with respect to improper,the browns argued to the district court that bartholomew officials had finalized bobby iep before the may,meeting.as evidence,they invited the court attention to the notes,memoranda and of several bartholomew officials discussing,in concrete terms,bobby placement.the browns also introduced evidence of a visit to the browns home by umbreit,who,at this visit,allegedly possessed a finalized version of bartholomew proposed iep.at the due process hearing,umbreit denied that he had finalized the iep before the may,meeting.the district court considered the evidence and testimony and disagreed with the browns that the record indicated on the part of bartholomew.instead,the court saw the evidence as reflecting bartholomew thoughtful preparation for the may,meeting,consistent with the school district obligations under the idea.see at noting that the idea requires a school district to devote meaningful individualized consideration to a child needs.the court acknowledged that a lack of adequate preparation for a case conference could violate this requirement,just as a final decision without meaningful input could violate the statute in a different way.id.descriptions of the meeting itself,moreover,persuaded the district court that the parties,in fact,engaged in a meaningful that resulted in compromise on certain issues.that bartholomew ultimately was unwilling to yield on the particular issue of placement did not,in the court view,by itself establish or any other denial of the parental right of involvement.id.at.
the browns contended that,without designing a means to ease bobby transition into the proposed placement,the iep was not reasonably calculated to enable bobby to receive educational benefits.the district court,however,agreed with the conclusions of the iho on this issue and held that bartholomew was not obliged to design a transition plan until the parties had agreed on bobby actual placement,a goal that they never could accomplish.according to the court,t he discussion simply never got far enough to work out a transition plan to a new program that the browns adamantly opposed.id.at.
finally,in considering the browns substantive attack on the proposed iep,the district court emphasized that,under applicable standards of review,the browns were forced to show that the proposed iep was not reasonably calculated at the time of its drafting.id.at see generally roland concord sch,cir a ctions of school systems can not be judged exclusively in hindsight.the district court concluded that the browns had failed to satisfy this burden.in the court view,the evidence demonstrated only an honest disagreement among professionals who have devoted their careers to educating children with autism.at.
discussion 
the browns now have presented to us their claims of idea violations,both substantive and procedural,related to the proposed placement for bobby school year.we can not address these claims,however,without first ascertaining whether there remains a live controversy between the parties.
article iii,of the constitution grants jurisdiction to federal courts to adjudicate only actual,ongoing controversies.see honig doe,d.for a case to be justiciable,a live controversy must continue to exist at all stages of review,not simply on the date the action was initiated.lewis cont l bank,d jordan by through jones indiana high sch.athletic ass n,cir.a case becomes moot when a court decision can no longer affect the rights of litigants in the case before them and simply would be an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.north carolina rice,d internal quotation marks omitted.in an action seeking only injunctive relief,this requirement ordinarily means that,once the threat of the act sought to be enjoined dissipates,the suit must be dismissed as moot.see,wernsing thompson,cir.if,however,a plaintiff also seeks monetary damages,his case is not moot even if the underlying misconduct that caused the injury has ceased.see powell mccormack,d holding that,although injunctive relief was moot,a case or controversy still existed because the plaintiff requested declaratory relief and damages crue aiken,cir when a claim for injunctive relief is barred but a claim for damages remains,a declaratory judgment as a predicate to a damages award can survive.
soon after the district court rendered its decision in this action,and immediately following bobby ninth birthday,the browns moved from columbus,indiana,to greensburg,indiana,and enrolled bobby in a new elementary school operated by the greensburg community school corporation gcsc.shortly thereafter,the browns and the gcsc agreed to a new iep to govern bobby school year at greensburg elementary.bartholomew contends that the browns relocation to a different school district and an acceptance of a new iep in that district renders any dispute over bobby iep in bartholomew moot because a judicial decision in the browns favor could no longer benefit bobby.
in reply,the browns maintain that they continue to possess a claim for monetary damages.the nature of this claim,according to the browns,originated in their rights under the injunction that held in place bobby iep and under the parties settlement agreement that bartholomew was to cover the expenses related to bobby aba instruction.the browns contend that bartholomew breached this obligation when it failed to reimburse the browns for the salary they had paid to sundberg,who substituted as bobby aba consultant when janet rumple professional obligations required that she reduce her time commitment to bobby.the idea gives a district judge the discretion to order school authorities to reimburse parents for their expenditures on private special education for a child if the court ultimately determines that such placement,rather than a proposed iep,is proper under the act.see burlington sch.comm.massachusetts dep t of,d interpreting h b.indeed,other circuits have held that a claim for reimbursement can defeat a mootness challenge in an iep placement dispute.lillbask ex rel.mauclaire.dep t,cir collecting cases.
a review of the record,however,demonstrates that the browns failed to articulate a claim for damages in the district court they sought only injunctive and declaratory relief.the record of the browns proceedings before the iho and the bsea contains vague indications that,at some point,the browns sought reimbursement for the salary they paid to sundberg.the iho decision lists,as primary issue number one,what are the student continuing rights of pendency and stay put under the statute,regulation,decisional law and the express written settlement agreement between the parties,at.it then dispensed with this issue by noting 
by stipulation primary issue number one concerning had been resolved by parties prior to hearing and was withdrawn.pursuant to agreement of parties stay put placement was the day lea kindergarten and the applied verbal behavior avb program after school,including services of program overseer janet rumple and two aides libby springmeyer and sara miller,and the placement was funded by bartholomew.
id.at.on appeal to the bsea,the browns asked that these stipulated pendency entitlements be converted into bobby placement for the school year,with the added requirement that bartholomew cover the cost of continuing the role of sundberg as bobby program consultant,tab at see also,tab at.
at the district court level,the browns apparently abandoned this claim for reimbursement.their prayer for relief asked,in addition to reversal of the administrative decisions,that bobby preexisting program be continued in full force and effect,funded by bartholomew.at.the browns complaint did not assert that the preexisting program was inadequate,nor did it ask for reimbursement for sundberg services.also absent from the browns lengthy trial briefing before the district court was a claim for reimbursement.the closest the browns ever came to asserting a right to compensatory education was when,in their trial brief,they described the relevant supreme court precedent that allows a district court to award reimbursement to a parent who spends her own money on private education that the court finds appropriate.see at discussing burlington,at,and florence county sch.dist.four carter,d.the trial brief never went on to apply this precedent to the facts in bobby case nor to explain why it entitled the browns to reimbursement for sundberg services.
relief in the form of reimbursement for educational expenses,or compensatory education as it is formally called,is,as we have said,indeed exceptional and nowhere expressly authorized by the statute.bd.educ.oak park river forest high sch.dist.todd,cir.the idea only authorizes a district court to award aggrieved parents such relief as the court determines is appropriate.h b.consistent with the supreme court reading of this provision in burlington,at,courts have held that a district court authority encompasses a range of equitable remedies and therefore empowers a court to order compensatory education if necessary to cure a violation.todd,at see also g ex rel.rg fort bragg dependent,cir collecting cases from different circuits.however,as an equitable remedy,awarding compensatory education is a decision that rests in the sound discretion of the district court.see lester gilhool,cir.
here,the browns complaint deprived the district court of an opportunity to exercise that discretion.as we have pointed out,the complaint contains no specific
