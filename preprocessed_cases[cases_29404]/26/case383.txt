edward myers,on behalf of himself and his minor children,appeals the dismissal of his action,alleging that ann.c michie the recitation statute,which provides for daily,voluntary recitation of the pledge of allegiance the pledge in virginia public schools,violates the establishment clause.the district court,applying the three part test of lemon kurtzman,d,upheld the recitation statute,concluding that the statute did not have a religious purpose or effect and did not create an excessive governmental entanglement with religion.because the pledge is not a religious exercise and does not threaten an establishment of religion,we affirm.
myers belongs to the anabaptist mennonite faith,which condemns the mixture of church and state.anabaptist mennonites are a christian sect that left central europe in late because of religious persecution for belief in the separation of church and state.at.according to the mennonite confession of faith,t he primary allegiance of all christians is to christ kingdom,not the state or society.because their citizenship is in heaven,christians are called to resist the idolatrous temptation to give to the state the devotion that is owed to god.at.
myers resides in loudoun county,virginia,and,at the time he filed his complaint,his two sons attended loudoun county public schools,one in first grade and one in third grade.because of myers belief in a separation of church and state and his fear that loudoun county was indoctrinating his children with a god and country religious worldview,at,myers objected to loudoun county policy of having all children recite the pledge each school day.
loudoun county policy was enacted pursuant to the recitation statute,which provides 
each school board shall require the daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance in each classroom of the school division and shall ensure that the flag of the united states is in place in each such classroom.each school board shall determine the appropriate time during the school day for the recitation of the pledge.during such pledge of allegiance,students shall stand and recite the pledge while facing the flag with their right hands over their hearts or in an appropriate salute if in uniform however,no student shall be compelled to recite the pledge if he,his parent or legal guardian objects on religious,philosophical or other grounds to his participating in this exercise.students who are thus exempt from reciting the pledge shall remain quietly standing or sitting at their desks while others recite the pledge and shall make no display that disrupts or distracts others who are reciting the pledge.school boards shall provide appropriate accommodations for students who are unable to comply with the procedures described herein due to disability.
the school board code of conduct shall apply to disruptive behavior during the recitation of the pledge in the same manner as provided for other circumstances of such behavior.

on october,myers,who is not an attorney,filed a lawsuit under west against the loudoun county school board the board in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.acting pro se on behalf of himself and his two minor children,myers alleged that the daily recitation of the pledge in loudoun county schools violated the establishment clause,and,accordingly,that the recitation statute was facially unconstitutional the district court interpreted myers complaint to provide that the recitation statute,by requiring recitation of the pledge,was attempting to establish a civil religion of god and country as a state supported religion.at.the commonwealth of virginia intervened to defend the constitutionality of the recitation statute,and moved,in conjunction with the board,for dismissal of myers action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b west.following a hearing,the district court granted the motion to dismiss,concluding that,under the lemon test,the recitation statute was constitutional on its face and as applied by the board.myers noted a timely appeal on appeal,myers contends that because of the inclusion of the words under god,the pledge is a religious exercise and that,accordingly,the recitation statute violates the establishment clause.we possess jurisdiction under west.
as noted,myers filed his complaint pro se on behalf of himself and his minor children.although the appellees did not argue that the district court erred in allowing myers to litigate pro se below,we nevertheless raised this threshold issue at oral argument sua sponte because an infant is always the ward of every court wherein his rights or property are brought into jeopardy,and is entitled to the most jealous care that no injustice be done to him.doe bd.of,cir quoting wenger canastota cent.sch,cir holding that appellate court has an obligation sua sponte to inquire into whether pro se parent had authority to litigate claims on behalf of his minor children.
in addressing this issue,it is useful to delineate the nature of the claims that myers presses.first,myers alleges that he himself has suffered an injury cognizable under the establishment clause from his children daily exposure to the pledge,that the pledge policy infringes his right to direct the religious education of his children.second,myers alleges that his minor children have suffered an injury cognizable under the establishment clause from their exposure to the daily recitation of the pledge in loudoun county school classrooms.while myers had the authority to litigate his own claim below,we conclude,for the reasons that follow,that myers did not have the authority to litigate his children claim below.we believe,however,that remand of their claim is not necessary.
the federal rules of civil procedure,incorporating virginia law,authorize myers to raise his children claim despite the fact that their claim seeks to vindicate their rights the difficulty therefore is not that myers asserted his children claim,but rather that he attempted to litigate that claim pro se.an individual unquestionably has the right to litigate his own claims in federal court,before both the district and appellate courts.see west in all courts of the united states the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel united states lawrence,cir under a litigant in federal court has long been guaranteed the right to.this right reflects a respect for the choice of an individual citizen to plead his or her own cause.cheung youth orchestra found.of buffalo,cir.it is a right of high standing,not simply a practice to be honored or dishonored by a court depending on its assessment of the desiderata of a particular case.id.
the right to litigate for oneself,however,does not create a coordinate right to litigate for others.see oxendine williams,cir holding that a pro se prisoner may not litigate the interests of other prisoners in class action.the reasoning behind this rule is it protects the rights of those before the court,see id.the competence of a layman litigating for himself is clearly too limited to allow him to risk the rights of others,and jealously guards the judiciary authority to govern those who practice in its courtrooms,see collinsgru palmyra bd.of,cir requiring a minimum level of competence protects not only the client but also his or her adversaries and the court from poorly drafted,inarticulate,and vexatious claims.
myers contends that federal rule of appellate procedure c west supp,which provides that a pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer spouse and minor children if they are parties,unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise,implicitly contemplates that a pro se parent may litigate the claims of his minor children.we do not believe,however,that rule c bears the inference myers draws.instead,that rule implicitly acknowledges that an appellant must file his notice of appeal within a certain limited time after the district court has entered judgment,see fed.a a west supp,and that at that time the appellant,who presumably lost before the district court and may accordingly be dissatisfied with counsel performance,may be without counsel.rule c therefore simply allows a pro se litigant proceeding on behalf of his minor children to file a timely notice of appeal before securing appellate counsel 
we therefore join the vast majority of our sister circuits in holding that parents generally may not litigate the claims of their minor children in federal court.see shepherd wellman,cir navin park ridge sch,cir devine indian river county sch,cir johns county of san diego,cir med,cir cheung,at meeker kercher,cir applying this rule here,we conclude that myers was not authorized to litigate pro se the claim of his minor children.
we suspect that in the rare cases in which a parent litigates his children claim in the district court,remand for further proceedings will be the only course of action on appeal that ensures the children interests are not prejudiced by their,but legally untrained parents.see,cheung,at remanding child claim litigated by a parent for retention or appointment of counsel,or,failing either of these options,for dismissal of the claim without prejudice.we do not believe,however,that remand is warranted here.the children,like their father,now have competent counsel,and they have specifically asked us to decide the appeal.moreover,as discussed in more detail below,our resolution of the children claim is based purely on an issue of law,and that claim is in no meaningful way prejudiced by myers pro se representation below.
with this threshold issue resolved,we now turn to the merits of this appeal.

as justice holmes recognized in new york trust eisner,sometimes a page of history is worth a volume of logic.and,in the context of this case,the establishment clause of the first amendment must be viewed in the light of its history and the evils it was designed forever to suppress.everson,at.a review of the establishment clause historical setting reveals that the first and most immediate purpose of the establishment clause rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion.engel vitale,d.the primary evil the establishment clause was intended to combat was the practice of european nations compel ling individuals to support and attend government favored churches.id.at.with that evil in mind,
the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment means at least this neither a state nor the federal government can set up a church.neither can pass laws which aid one religion,aid all religions,or prefer one religion over another.neither can force nor influence a person to go or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.no person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs,for church attendance or nonattendance.

the paradigmatic example of the role of history in the court establishment clause jurisprudence is marsh chambers,d.in marsh,a nebraska taxpayer brought suit alleging that nebraska policy of using public funds to pay for a chaplain to open each state legislative day with a prayer violated the establishment clause.id.at.in upholding this practice,the court drew heavily upon the fact that the first congress,as one of its early items of business,adopted the policy of selecting a chaplain to open each session with prayer.marsh,at.the court held that,far from being unconstitutional 
opening legislative sessions with prayer has become part of the fabric of our society.to invoke divine guidance on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not,in these circumstances,an establishment of religion or a step toward establishment it is simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.
apart from the practice of legislative prayer upheld in marsh,the history surrounding our nation founding is filled with activities similar in kind that illuminate our resolution of this case.the declaration of independence,composed by thomas jefferson in,asserted that all men were endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,and claimed that the colonists had the right to dissolve the political bands because of the laws of nature and of nature god.the declaration of independence para.the constitution itself claims it was completed in the year of our lord,and exempts sundays from the president period to exercise his veto power.const.art.vii art.i.

i need not catalogue exhaustively the list of official acknowledgments of religion in american life that have not been challenged as establishments of religion.for purposes of my discussion,it suffices to note that o ur history is replete with official references to the value and invocation of divine guidance in deliberations and pronouncements of the founding fathers and contemporary leaders.lynch,at.we have an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in american life from at least.id.at.if the founders viewed legislative prayer and days of thanksgiving as consistent with the establishment clause,it is difficult to believe they would object to the pledge,with its limited reference to god.the pledge is much less of a threat to establish a religion than legislative prayer,the open prayers to god found in washington prayer of thanksgiving,and the declaration of independence.
in addition to this history of religious acknowledgment,in the specific context before us,the court and the individual justices thereof have made clear that the establishment clause,regardless of the test to be used,does not extend so far as to make unconstitutional the daily recitation of the pledge in public school.beginning with engel,in every case in which the justices of the court have made mention of the pledge,it has been as an assurance that the pledge is not implicated by the court interpretation of the establishment clause.see engel,at.stewart,dissenting wallace jaffree,d,concurring in my view,the words under god in the pledge serve as an acknowledgment of religion with the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing public occasions,and expressing confidence in the future internal quotation marks omitted wallace,at.rehnquist,dissenting holding pledge unconstitutional would of course make a mockery of our decisionmaking in establishment clause cases lynch,at.brennan,dissenting such practices as the references to god contained in the pledge of allegiance can best be understood,in dean rostow apt phrase,as a form of ceremonial deism,protected from establishment clause scrutiny chiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any significant religious content county of allegheny am.civil liberties union,d kennedy,concurring in part and dissenting in part noting the pledge can not be construed as an establishment of religion lee weisman,d scalia,dissenting same.in lynch,the court described the pledge as an example of reference to our religious history,and noted that it is recited by many thousands of public school year.lynch,at.in county of allegheny,the court took pains to remark that there is an obvious distinction between creche displays and references to god in the motto and the pledge,and noted that prior decisions,in dicta,had characteriz ed the motto and pledge as consistent with the proposition that government may not communicate an endorsement of religious belief.county of allegheny,at.
in fact,just last term,in elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d,several justices offered lengthy defenses of the constitutionality of a state policy requiring daily,voluntary,recitation of the pledge by public school children.michael newdow,like myers,objected to a public school policy which mandated daily,voluntary,recitation of the pledge by school children.id.at.although the court held that newdow lacked standing,several justices,took the opportunity to address the question of the pledge constitutionality.id.at.each justice who did so concluded that the pledge was constitutional.id.
although we are not bound by dicta or separate opinions of the supreme court,observations by the court,interpreting the first amendment and clarifying the application of its establishment clause jurisprudence,constitute the sort of dicta that has considerable persuasive value in the inferior courts.lambeth bd.of county comm n,cir.see also sherman,at if the court proclaims that a practice is consistent with the establishment clause,we take its assurances seriously.moreover,in the context of this case it is perhaps more noteworthy that,given the vast number of establishment clause cases to come before the court,not one justice has ever suggested that the pledge is unconstitutional.in an area of law sometimes marked by befuddlement and lack of agreement,such unanimity is striking 
myers primary argument in attempting to avoid this weight of dicta and history is that daily recitation of the pledge amounts to daily recitation of prayer in public schools in violation of lee.according to this argument,even if recitation of the pledge is voluntary,students will be indirectly coerced into accepting its religious message in violation of the establishment clause.
the court has reflected upon the important role that indirect coercion plays in determining if a public school activity violates the establishment clause.see lee,at.p rayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion.engel,at.t he indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to prayers is plain.for instance,in lee,a public high school selected a rabbi to give a prayer,pursuant to written guidelines provided by school officials,at high school graduation.at.students were to remain standing during the prayer,which followed the recitation of the pledge.although high school students were not required to attend graduation to receive their diplomas or to participate in saying the prayer,the court found the practice unconstitutional.id.at.the court explained that indirect coercion may be unconstitutional when government orchestrates the performance of a formal religious exercise in a fashion that practically obliges the involvement of.id.at.
of course,as this statement makes clear,all of the cases holding that indirect coercion of religious activity violates the establishment clause presuppose that the challenged activity is a religious exercise.see,lee,at.t he sole question presented is whether a religious exercise may be conducted at a graduation ceremony emphasis added.see also newdow congress,cir,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc noting the crucial factor in school prayer cases is the nature of the exercise in which the students were asked to participate,rev by elk grove unified sch,d.our precedent also recognizes this distinction u nder the supreme court decisions school officials may not,consistent with the establishment clause,compel students to participate in a religious activity.mellen bunting,cir emphasis added.moreover,in all of the cases involving school prayer,the court iterated that fleeting references to god in the were not unconstitutional.see lee,at.we do not hold that every state action implicating religion is invalid if one or a few citizens find it offensive.schempp,at.the reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance,for example,may merely recognize the historical fact that our nation was believed to have been founded under god.brennan,concurring engel,at.p atriotic or ceremonial occasions like the recitation of the declaration of independence bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned religious exercise that the state has sponsored in this instance.
thus,although religious exercises in public schools,even if voluntary,may violate the constitution because they can indirectly coerce students into participating,nothing in any of the school prayer cases suggests the same analysis applies when the challenged activity is not a religious exercise.and distinguishing this case from engel and its progeny is the simple fact that the pledge,unlike prayer,is not a religious exercise or activity,but a patriotic one.the very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of our country texas johnson,d.pledging allegiance to that flag is a common public acknowledgment of the ideals that our flag symbolizes.its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles.elk grove unified sch.at see also engel,at.sherman,at noting founding fathers did not deem ceremonial invocations of god,like the pledge,as establishment.indeed,the recitation statute itself appears in a statutory section mandating that virginia public schools teach the history and importance of the flag in school in order to promote better citizenship among students.ann.
undoubtedly,the pledge contains a religious phrase,and it is demeaning to persons of any faith to assert that the words under god contain no religious significance.see van orden,slip op.at june,thomas,concurring words such as god have religious significance.the inclusion of those two words,however,does not alter the nature of the pledge as a patriotic activity.the pledge is a statement of loyalty to the flag of the united states and the republic for which it stands it is performed while standing at attention,facing the flag,with right hand held over heart.see also west virginia barnette.referring to the pledge as a patriotic ceremony.a prayer,by contrast,is a solemn and humble approach to divinity in word or thought.webster third new int l dictionary.it is a personal communication between an individual and his deity,with bowed head,on bended knee.newdow,at,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.the prayers ruled unconstitutional in lee,schempp,and engel,and were viewed by the court as distinctly religious exercises.it was the religious nature of these activities that gave rise to the concern that students would be indirectly coerced into accepting a religious message.the indirect coercion analysis discussed in lee,schempp,and engel,simply is not relevant in cases,like this one,challenging activities.even assuming that the recitation of the pledge contains a risk of indirect coercion,the indirect coercion is not threatening to establish religion,but patriotism.separation of church from state does not imply separation of state from state.sherman,at.thus,the fact that indirect coercion may result from voluntary recitation of the pledge in school classrooms is of no moment under the establishment clause.because the pledge is by its nature a patriotic exercise,not a religious exercise,the school prayer cases,lee,schempp,and engel,are not controlling.moreover,as the history of our nation makes clear,acknowledgments of religion by government simply do not threaten to establish religion in the same manner that even voluntary school prayer does.
in sum,the measure of constitutional adjudication is the ability and willingness to distinguish between real threat and mere shadow.schempp,at.goldberg,concurring.we feel confident in stating that it is difficult to detect any signs of incipient theocracy springing up since the pledge was amended in.newdow,at fernandez,dissenting see also van orden,slip op.at breyer,concurring in the judgment finding relevant,in holding that ten commandments display outside of texas state capitol constitutional,that forty years had passed before a constitutional challenge was raised to the display.the notion that official acknowledgments of religion and its role in the founding of our nation such as that in the pledge pose a real danger of establishment of a state church is simply farfetched.lynch,at.the establishment clause works to bar sponsorship,financial support,and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.walz,at.the pledge,which is not a religious exercise,poses none of these harms and does not amount to an establishment of religion.accordingly,the recitation statute,requiring daily,voluntary,recitation of the pledge in the classrooms of virginia public schools is constitutional.
for the foregoing reasons,the opinion of the district court is affirmed.
i write to join in all but part of judge williams fine opinion.i agree,of course,with her conclusion in that section that the pledge does not violate the establishment clause.i am concerned,however,that the as it does from the premise that history tells us that some government invocations of religion are insulated from the strictures of the establishment closer to crossing the line drawn by the supreme court majority in mccreary county am.civil liberties union,d,than is necessary to sustain the state law at issue here.
one of the most significant points of contention between the majority and the dissent in mccreary focuses on whether official acknowledgments of god catalogued at length by justice scalia in dissent and cited here in part prove that government may espouse submission to the divine will without offending the principle of governmental neutrality that undergirds the establishment clause.mccreary.at.whereas the dissent relied upon historical evidence tending to show that the founders believed that some official acknowledgments of religion were compatible with the establishment clause,the majority cited other evidence suggesting that the framers intended the establishment clause to require governmental neutrality in matters of religion,including neutrality in statements acknowledging religion.id.at.accordingly,a majority of justices agreed that,beyond the broad principle of governmental neutrality,t he fair inference is that there was no common understanding about the limits of the establishment prohibition at the founding.id.
as justice observed,r easonable minds can disagree about how to apply the religion clauses in a given case.but the goal of the clauses is clear to carry out the founders plan of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.id.at,concurring.mccreary thus reaffirmed the principle that the first amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion,and between religion and nonreligion.id.at quoting epperson arkansas,d.mindful of mccreary lessons,i believe that this case is best resolved by reliance upon the supreme court repeated assurances,albeit in dicta,that the pledge does not violate the establishment clause,and authority suggesting that recitation of the pledge is not a religious activity,but rather a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in the ideals that the flag symbolizes.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.i do not believe that we need to go any further to resolve the issue before us.
the supreme court has spoken repeatedly on the precise issue we address today.the court has consistently said that inclusion of the phrase under god in the pledge of allegiance does not offend the establishment clause.for this reason,i concur in the only the judgment.
in a series of cases beginning with engel vitale,d,and continuing through elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d,the court and many justices individually have unequivocally stated,albeit in dicta,that the pledge of allegiance to a nation under god does not violate the constitution.moreover,no member of the supreme court has ever suggested the contrary.see ante.
we and our sister circuits have frequently noted that lower federal courts generally must treat the carefully considered language of the supreme court,even if technically dictum,as authoritative.wynne town of great falls,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted collecting cases.such deference is especially appropriate when,as here,we encounter a succession of statements from the court that answers the specific question before us.see lambeth bd.of comm rs,cir noting the considerable persuasive value of repeated supreme court dicta stating that the national motto,in god we trust,does not violate the establishment clause.
we need not search further than these assurances to resolve the issue before us,and i would not do so.for without the court explicit guidance,this could be an extremely close case,requiring navigation through the supreme court complicated establishment clause jurisprudence.at least one justice has recognized the difficulties involved.see newdow.at thomas,concurring in the judgment.
first,a pledge to a country under god might be regarded as religious activity.certainly,the supreme c
