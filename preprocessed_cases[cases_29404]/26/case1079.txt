we must decide whether the district court fulfilled its obligation to ensure that the testimony of an expert witness was sufficiently reliable before it was presented to the jury.
california state university,hayward csuh hired mohamed osman elsayed mukhtar elsayed,a muslim of sudanese origin in as a professor in its mass communications department to teach broadcast television and other foundational courses.he was the first black professor hired by the department.csuh eventually denied elsayed application for tenure.csuh claims it did so because he lacked sufficient scholarly activity elsayed contends it was because of his race,religion,and national origin.due to the nature of the dispute,it is helpful to trace elsayed career at csuh,starting from the time of his hiring.
while the degree is normally a for hire in csuh positions,the university makes exceptions for applicants close to completing the doctorate.candidates,such as elsayed when he started at csuh in,are generally expected to complete the within their first year of employment.elsayed,however,did not receive his from the university of missouri until december.his consistent failure to obtain his during his probationary period at csuh was a source of great concern among elsayed superiors.during that period,he did not publish a single article.he did,however,consistently receive positive student evaluations and was named departmental teacher of the year for the and academic years.he mentored students of color,served on the multicultural council,and was active in the black faculty association.elsayed also participated in international humanitarian and community organizations,such as the islamic african relief agency and the american society of humanitarian aid and development.he made oral presentations in numerous workshops and seminars,but none involved presenting written work.
during elsayed first year at csuh,he received a reduced teaching load to enable him to complete his dissertation,as is customary.in his first annual evaluation in january,alan smith,dean of the school of arts,letters,and social sciences alss,noted that if elsayed has not completed his degree by the time of his evaluation for retention,the dossier should include a statement from the candidate concerning the schedule for the completion of his degree.he also commented that elsayed was an enthusiastic,conscientious,and accessible teacher with a genuine interest in the education of his students.finally,he noted that elsayed had an article accepted for publication by gazette,a mass communications journal.however,at trial elsayed admitted that the editor had simply showed interest,and the article was never published.
in elsayed second annual evaluation in january,robert terrell,chair of the department of mass communications,expressed concern at elsayed failure to obtain a 
we feel it incumbent upon us to point out at this juncture that significant were made particularly during the first year of employment to free elsayed from the traditional obligations of the appointment in order that he might be encouraged to complete the degree.such was not the case.we are now informed that completion is anticipated during the summer.we point out the seriousness of the condition to recommend to elsayed that future evaluations will bear heavily on his showing good faith and meeting this obligation by this new target date.
emphasis added.terrell noted the uniformly positive response to elsayed as a teacher his evaluations were more than generally enthusiastic.terrell also encouraged him to broaden his horizon and seek positions in the faculty governance structure,rather than limiting himself to the multicultural council.finally,he recommended that elsayed adhere more stringently to the specific obligations attendant to a faculty appointment namely,keeping posted office hours and regular attendance at departmental meetings.
dean smith also warned elsayed in january that failure to complete this essential task of finishing his will negatively influence his chances of maintaining his current relationship with the university.while noting his impressive classroom skills,smith also recommended that elsayed assume more responsibility for the department administrative obligations.
in his third evaluation in april,terrell expressed frustration over elsayed lack of a,going so far as to recommend that his employment at csuh be terminated at the end of the academic year if he did not complete his dissertation by the end of summer.
last year professor elsayed was informed that the failure to complete his dissertation would negatively influence his chance of maintaining his current relationship with the university.this observation has been repeated on numerous occasions since.professor elsayed was released from all responsibilities during the summer of so he would have ample time to complete his dissertation.at the end of the summer,he promised to be finished by december.in december he promised to be finished by june.he currently promises to be done by the end of the summer of.professor elsayed failure to complete his dissertation,despite numerous chances to do so,raises serious questions regarding his continued employment at csuh.
emphasis added.while recognizing that elsayed was popular with many students,terrell noted that his teaching evaluations indicate an ongoing problem with organization.furthermore,elsayed has done little or no publishing since arriving at csuh three years ago.finally,he rarely participates in mainstream faculty governance procedures,despite being strongly urged to broaden his involvement with the campus community.
in april,mary cullinan,interim dean of alss,echoed terrell concern regarding elsayed lack of a.she noted that elsayed was a popular instructor,but should create detailed syllabi for his classes,provide ample office hours for students,and give students early and ample feedback on how they are doing.she also highlighted his failure to complete a number of professional works in progress.
the fourth evaluation,in march,noted that elsayed did not meet the summer deadline and set the new deadline for summer.terrell again stated that elsayed failure to complete his dissertation might have significant,negative consequences.he observed that although elsayed was a sensitive,caring professor,he did not grade assignments in a timely fashion and taught in a disorganized fashion.terrell encouraged him to devote more time and attention to becoming a better organized teacher and expressed concern over elsayed practice of occasionally having students do portions of his work,which,terrell felt,came perilously close to being a violation of professional ethics.
terrell wrote that t oo many of the activities elsayed cites as evidence of his professional achievement are insufficiently centered on mass communication.he recommended that elsayed devote more time and attention to producing articles and other texts such that he can clearly demonstrate his mastery of scholarship.he continued to note elsayed lack of campus involvement,stating that he needs to get more directly involved in advising students,working with alumni,participating in faculty governance,and representing the department at campus and professional meetings.in short,professor elsayed is not pulling his fair share of the department load at this time.terrell ended his evaluation with this stern warning i strongly recommend that elsayed be the bluntest possible prolonging completion of his dissertation will be a mistake of the most serious sort.
the new dean of alss,carlos navarro,reiterated terrell concerns,stating that elsayed needed to make dramatic improvements in the area of campus involvement.he also noted that elsayed position would be strengthened if he contributed to scholarly publications and organizations.
elsayed fifth evaluation in march indicated that the mass communications promotion and tenure committee tenure committee was troubled by elsayed lack of progress toward attaining a doctorate.it urge d him to complete some of his works in progress,and advised that it was important for him to publish in the appropriate journals in his field or show evidence of completed scholarly productivity.
dean navarro may evaluation recommended that elsayed be retained for a sixth year,but not without grave reservations about the quality of his faculty profile,including the lack of the.dean navarro again recognized that elsayed received strong teaching evaluations however,unfortunately,there were no peer evaluations which allow him to be evaluated by professionals in his area of expertise.in his letter,dean navarro recommended that an independent outside reviewer assess elsayed professional achievement.again noting that elsayed has not played any significant role in the life of the department and the university,despite being advised to,he warned that elsayed needs to make dramatic improvement in this area.
with respect to elsayed scholarly activities,dean navarro wrote 
there is very little evidence,if any,that the candidate has made any serious efforts to publish or to present papers or productions at professional meetings this candidate has not apparently seen this area as part of his professional responsibility to strive towards excellence.certainly papers based on his dissertation in progress might have been presented at scholarly meetings.it would not be unfair to argue that this candidate has demonstrated weakness in his scholarly activity.
emphasis added.elsayed testified that it took him five years to receive his because one committee chair died,the second left to teach elsewhere,and the third took a sabbatical.thus,he had to take frequent trips to missouri to recruit three new chairs and familiarize them with his methodology,literature review,and preliminary analysis and findings.
in the fall of,elsayed applied for tenure.csuh tenure policy states t enure constitutes more than a recognition of past teaching performance and scholarly work.it is a judgment by the faculty that the individual will contribute in the future to the development of the university.faculty are evaluated on five criteria,which are ranked in order of most to least weighty possession of a degree required,instructional achievement,professional achievement,internal university contributions,and external representation.a candidate must clearly satisfy all the criteria,but the tenure policy provides that e xceptional ratings on one or more of the criteria may offset minor deficiencies with respect to other criteria.emphasis added.
csuh president norma rees has the ultimate authority to make tenure decisions.prior to her review,a candidate dossier is reviewed by three separate tenure department committee,the school committee,and the university well as the department chair and school dean.each makes an independent assessment of the candidate without relying on the previous evaluation.
at the time he applied for tenure,elsayed reported completing his dissertation and anticipated receiving his in december.he also reported that his article,elijah,wallace and farrakan the growth and schism of the black muslims as reflected in their newspapers,had been accepted for publication in the refereed journal of the international institute of islamic thought,the american journal of islamic social sciences ajiss.contrary to his original report,the article had simply been recommended for publication sometime in.it was never published.elsayed testified that he asked ajiss to suspend publishing his article because dean navarro and president rees had told him that ajiss was not an appropriate scholarly publication.
the mass communications departmental committee,by a vote of,recommended elsayed for tenure.the person voting against tenure believed that the delayed activity toward achieving the degree signals a lack of promise in professional achievement.the alss school committee,by a vote of,also endorsed elsayed.the dissenter found that the areas of teaching strength did not compensate for an overall weak profile of achievement and contribution.csuh provost frank martino testified that departmental and school recommendations for tenure are typically unanimous,and a split vote signals trouble.
dean navarro recommended against tenure,finding a dearth of evidence in the area of professional achievement.he did not regard ajiss as a journal of elsayed peers,and elsayed had not produced any other papers or documentary films during his five years at csuh.also lacking was any significant evidence of contributions in the area of committee or faculty governance work.dean navarro received the report of an outside reviewer he commissioned to evaluate elsayed,professor john hewitt hewitt found elsayed professional achievement a bit thin,but would expect him to blossom out in the next few years with more work.regarding internal university contributions,hewitt noted that he would expect more from a junior faculty member.nevertheless,hewitt recommended elsayed for tenure.
the university committee voted in favor of tenure.the dissenters found that elsayed instructional achievement did not offset serious deficiencies in the area of professional achievement and internal university contributions.president rees was troubled by the split votes ten faculty including hewitt,the outside reviewer had recommended tenure and five had not.rees was not impressed with elsayed professional achievement,and she found little evidence that elsayed challenged his students or developed creative learning procedures.in her letter to elsayed informing him of her decision,she wrote that the reason for denial was that he did not meet university standards in the areas of instructional and professional achievement.
elsayed grieved the denial of tenure.the arbitrator found procedural errors in the tenure review process and remanded for further consideration.in late,the new interim dean of alss,james fay,conducted a second tenure review.this time,both the departmental and school tenure committees recommendations were against granting elsayed tenure.
dean fay found that elsayed failure to publish,or to present alternative evidence of sufficiently vigorous scholarly endeavor,renders his professional achievement below the standard needed for tenure.as of december,elsayed still had no publications to his credit,and no one at the ajiss could confirm that elsayed article was going to be published.in april,the university committee unanimously recommended against tenure,finding insufficient documentation of instructional or professional achievement.
in may,rees again denied tenure.elsayed grieved the second denial,and the same arbitrator again found in his favor,directing that elsayed be awarded tenure.however,a state court vacated the arbitration award.
elsayed then brought this employment discrimination action under title vii of the civil rights act of,against csuh and navarro,rees,and martino in their official and individual capacities.at trial,both sides presented witnesses who testified as to whether elsayed was qualified for a tenured appointment.david wellman,an expert witness who has devoted much of his career to investigating how racism persists without open bigotry,testified that race was a factor in csuh decision to deny elsayed tenure.after a jury trial,the jury found for elsayed and awarded him in economic,emotional distress,and punitive damages 
csuh timely appeal followed.
on appeal,csuh challenges two of the district court evidentiary rulings,which,it argues,were not harmless.
first,csuh contends that the district court erred by allowing elsayed to testify that,after the second round of arbitration,the arbitrator ordered that he be granted tenure because csuh did not have reasonable support for its decision having the jury hear the decision of a factfinder caused unfair prejudice,csuh argues federal rule of evidence provides that evidence,even if relevant,may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.we have emphasized that it is important to view the challenged evidence in light of the record as a whole.united states nguyen,cir.
here,the district court allowed the testimony because it did not want to artificially exclude facts in the narrative,so the arbitration could be mentioned,but not played up in any way.when elsayed testified about the arbitrator decision,the judge explicitly told the jury that it had been vacated by a state court,and elsayed himself also testified that the arbitrator grant of tenure had been vacated.finally,the jury instructions included the information that t he university asked the state court to vacate the arbitrator award,and the state court did so.
while we agree that the prejudice of having the jury hear this marginally relevant evidence would normally outweigh the value of providing the jury with the case entire factual history,the jury repeatedly heard that a state court had vacated the arbitrator decision.because it had the full story,we believe that the jury was able to give the arbitrator decision the weight it little.as such,any prejudice flowing from learning about the arbitrator ruling was immediately and repeatedly minimized by the revelation that a state court had vacated it.csuh argument fails the district court did not abuse its discretion under these circumstances.
second,csuh challenges the admission of testimony by wellman,elsayed expert on racial discrimination.wellman has developed eight criteria for decoding white of which he found present in csuh decision to deny elsayed tenure 
a.the university justification for denying tenure lacked credence 
tenure criteria were applied inconsistently 
inconsistent tenure criteria advantaged whites and disadvantaged blacks 
tenure criteria shifted when challenged 
statistical evidence showed disparate treatment 
procedural violations occurred in the tenure process 
university officials trivialized and dismissed elsayed qualifications and accomplishments and 
university officials failed to follow procedures for reducing racial inequality.
as a threshold matter,elsayed argues that because csuh failed to make a contemporaneous objection to wellman testimony,we should review the district court decision to admit his testimony for plain error.see united states,cir see also sablan dep t of finance,cir a plain error standard requires us to consider whether the alleged error was highly prejudicial and whether the error affected the substantial rights of the appellant.however,csuh made explicit objections to wellman testimony in its motion in limine,which the district court denied.
contemporaneous objection is not required where,as here,the trial court definitively ruled on a motion in limine after exploring csuh objection.see.a once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence,either at or before trial,a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.see also,at scott ross,cir.
here,the district court made clear at the outset of the trial that it was admitting wellman testimony subject to the limitation that he not offer a legal conclusion.however,it declined to exclude wellman testimony concerning an ultimate factual issue,whether race was a factor in csuh decision to deny elsayed tenure.wellman testimony stayed within these parameters,and because he did not violate the district court in limine ruling,no additional objection was necessary.therefore,we are satisfied that csuh properly preserved the arguments it now makes before us,and,thus,we review the district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion see,at.
federal rule of evidence allows admission of scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge by a qualified expert if it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.expert testimony is admissible pursuant to rule if it is both relevant and reliable.daubert merrell dow,d.the trial court must act as a gatekeeper to exclude junk science that does not meet rule reliability standards by making a preliminary determination that the expert testimony is reliable.see kumho tire carmichael,d joiner,d daubert,at.as the supreme court emphasized,however,t he inquiry envisioned by rule is a flexible one,daubert,at,and must be tied to the facts of a particular case.kumho tire,at.quotation marks omitted.
the trial court special obligation to determine the relevance and reliability of an expert testimony,kumho tire,at,is vital to ensure accurate and unbiased by the trier of fact.kumho tire described the importance of daubert gatekeeping requirement to make certain that an expert employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.id.at.or,more specifically,the trial judge must ensure that junk science plays no part in the decision.maintaining daubert standards is particularly important considering the aura of authority experts often exude,which can lead juries to give more weight to their testimony 
daubert provided a list of factors for determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence,including whether the scientific theory or technique can be and has been tested,whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication,whether there is a known or potential error rate,and whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community.daubert,at.see also kumho tire,at.holding that daubert factors apply to testimony based on technical and specialized knowledge,not just scientific knowledge.
a trial court not only has broad latitude in determining whether an expert testimony is reliable,but also in deciding how to determine the testimony reliability.united states hankey,cir see also kumho tire,at.indeed,a separate,pretrial hearing on reliability is not required,united states alatorre,cir nowhere in daubert,joiner,or kumho tire does the supreme court mandate the form that the inquiry into relevance and reliability must take.hopkins dow corning,cir.surely,however,the trial court broad latitude to make the reliability determination does not include the discretion to abdicate completely its responsibility to do so.
thus,the question we must answer did the district court fulfill its gatekeeping function and determine that wellman testimony was reliable in response to csuh motion in limine to exclude wellman testimony,the district court ordered each side to submit daubert briefs.before ruling that wellman testimony was admissible,the district court reviewed two briefs in support of csuh motion,three opposition briefs,two declarations from wellman,excerpts from wellman deposition,his preliminary report,and his curriculum vitae.on the first day of the trial,the district court decided to admit his testimony,but without any discussion of its reliability.
the district court analysis of and ruling on csuh motion in limine consisted in its entirety 
well,i see wellman and csuh expert witnesses on elsayed academic qualifications as essentially parallel,and i would prefer that none of them express their own opinion about whether this decision was right or wrong.but if any of them are going to,then i guess all of them have to.
and since both sides have prepared on the basis that they all will,i suppose you would prefer that i let all of them do it,rather than none of them do it.but i really would want to downplay as much as possible any of them substituting their judgment for what the jury ultimately has to find,which is whether,in fact,this decision was based on race discrimination or based on legitimate academic concerns.
they each have their own opinion,which is essentially what the jury will have to decide,so i do exactly know how we going to avoid having each of them go through all of the evidence and essentially deliberate as jurors and argue about means what and what factor goes which way.
it not really appropriate,so i guess we just have to try to keep it as brief as possible,in wellman case,on general factors that would lead to such decisions,and likewise in csuh expert case on general factors that would lead to such decisions,as opposed to their trying to convince the jury of their own view of what the truth is of what the underlying state of mind was.
so that about all the guidance i can give on that.
then,in response to a comment from csuh counsel,the district court commented that 
each expert is op
