nolan richardson,appeals the district court dismissal,following a bench trial,of his and claims arising out of his termination as the men head basketball coach for the university of uaf razorbacks.richardson brought suit against alan sugg,president of the university of arkansas john white,chancellor of uaf frank broyles,athletic director of uaf and the university of arkansas board of trustees defendants defendants the district court decision that a clause in richardson october employment contract applied only to claims accrued up to the date of execution of the agreement,and not to prospective claims.we affirm.
background 
richardson had a basketball coaching career with uaf that spanned seventeen years and spawned an impressive record of ncaa playoff and championship appearances,and one national championship.he was hired as the razorbacks head men basketball coach in.broyles,a caucasian,hired richardson,who became the first black head coach in uaf history.broyles had been at uaf since,starting as the head football coach and eventually becoming the athletic director.white,also a caucasian,has been uaf chancellor since and reports to sugg.sugg,a caucasian,has been the university president since and reports to the university board of trustees.
the events leading to this appeal occurred principally in and after.in october,richardson executed a new employment contract contract with the university of arkansas,and a personal services and guaranty agreement guaranty with the razorback foundation,foundation.the execution of these compacts followed the airing of a number of issues between richardson and broyles over the years,including control over shoes and apparel and the contracting process for such nolan hiring of his son,nolan richardson iii,as an assistant basketball coach the nature of richardson appointment as an assistant athletic director and alleged pay disparity between football assistant coaches and basketball assistant coaches and.the record is replete,however,with correspondence from broyles,white,and sugg supporting and encouraging richardson in his run up to making the razorbacks national champions in,as well as during the years following,when the team fell short of recapturing that same glory.
on february,the razorbacks lost to kentucky at kentucky,near the end of a season where the razorbacks went.at a press conference,richardson was asked what he and kentucky coach tubby smith discussed on the floor prior to.richardson replied that the two acknowledged the pressures they felt to win games,and that they would each do the best they could.richardson said,
but we certainly understand the pressures,and that what we talked a little bit about,is that,hey,you do the best you can and i do the best i can and we leave the rest to the good man upstairs.we ai going to have to worry about all that.if they go ahead and pay me my money,they can take the job tomorrow.that the bottom line because it is a business and we got to work hard and try to get our kids to play the best they possibly can.
appellant app.at.following the press conference,richardson twice more commented that uaf could replace him by buying him out.
white became aware of richardson comments the next day,february,when asked about them by news reporters.white responded that he thought richardson had made the comments in the heat of the moment out of frustration over a difficult season.he also stated that he expected richardson to complete his contract.meanwhile,that same morning,broyles had read three press accounts of richardson statement.later that day,broyles asked to meet with white to discuss richardson comments.before meeting with broyles,white spoke with fred vorsanger,manager of uaf bud walton arena,at a women basketball game.in their conversation,vorsanger told white that he was not surprised by richardson comments at the press conference because richardson had made the same comment to vorsanger several times.vorsanger told white that richardson had once said,if they do think i doing a good job or do want me here,they can buy me out.id.at.
broyles and white talked about richardson comments four times on february.at one meeting,broyles told white that he had spoken with someone with an athletic background,who told broyles that when a coach says something like richardson had said at the press conference,it means the coach want s out.id.at.later that day,white impression of richardson statement changed,and he felt the statement was all about the money and showed a lack of commitment to the university.id.at.white believed richardson statement was damaging to basketball recruiting.id.
at a final meeting on february,broyles expressed to white that he thought richardson wanted to retire but was trying to find a way to be fired in order to take advantage of the buyout clause in richardson contract.broyles told white that what richardson had publicly said was so damaging,it was irreparable,and that he should be terminated under the contract.id.at.broyles testified that his comment was in concurrence with white suggestion to broyles that richardson be terminated because of the statement.
after the meetings with broyles,white called sugg the evening of february.white told sugg that he and broyles had conferenced,and that white decided,with broyles concurrence,to fire richardson.sugg agreed.he had seen richardson comments on television,and was stunned and shocked.id.at.
i could believe he was saying it.i said to the television,coach,why are you saying that i thought it was a to the fans of arkansas,to the basketball program,and to the university of arkansas.and i said,i just can not believe you saying that.
id.at.sugg contacted the members of the board of trustees that he could locate that evening to let them know of the decision.each board member who was contacted testified that they agreed with the decision.
on the morning of february,white told gail moore,his executive assistant dave gearhart,vice chancellor for university advancement and roger williams,associate vice chancellor for university relations that a decision had been made to give richardson a chance to resign or retire,and failing that,to fire him.that afternoon,richardson held another press conference,which turned into a lecture of the press corps about the fact that he did not ask to be hired by uaf but that they had recruited him,how from that day forward he was shutting off press access to himself and his team except in press conferences,and that during press conferences they would have twenty minutes to ask as many questions as you possibly can.id.at.he also opined about a lack of racial diversity among the press corps and racial inequality in his job.richardson reiterated that when they broyles,white,and sugg decide that it enough,then that when they can pay me off and i be on my way.id.at.
white and broyles met with richardson on february,following richardson return from an away basketball game.the two told richardson that they had concluded it was time for a change in leadership of the basketball team,and attempted to get richardson to retire so that they would not have to fire him.richardson was offered the buyout under his contract,amounting to annually for six years,as well as full retiree benefits.richardson refused to retire and told the two they would have to fire him.
the next day,march,white dispatched a letter to richardson stating that,given white decision that new leadership was needed for the basketball team,and since richardson had declined to retire,he was terminated effective immediately.the letter informed richardson he had the right,under his employment contract,to request that sugg review the decision.sugg did so,and on march issued a letter to richardson confirming the decision.
ii.discussion 
because this case was tried to the judge,we review the trial court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.tadlock powell,cir.using this standard,we will overturn a factual finding only if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,if it is based on an erroneous view of the law,or if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that an error was made.id.citing estate of davis delo,cir.we afford due regard to the district court judgment of the credibility of the witnesses.id.a factual finding supported by substantial evidence,as well as a district court choice between two permissible views of the evidence,are not clearly erroneous.id.
we deal first with defendants,for if it is successful,richardson claims are barred.
does richardson contract bar his claims 
section of the contract provides that should richardson be terminated by the university at its convenience meaning at any time,for any reason,he would accept the guaranty of the razorback foundation,inc as full and complete satisfaction of any obligations of the university.that guaranty is defined in section of the guaranty agreement if richardson is terminated for the convenience of the university of arkansas,the foundation shall pay to richardson the sum of five hundred thousand dollars per year for the remaining period left on the employment agreement.the contract also provides that i n consideration of such guaranty richardson will,and does hereby,release and discharge the university,its officers,trustees and employees from and against any liability of any nature whatsoever related to or arising out of this agreement and richardson termination for convenience of the university hereunder.defendants argue that through this clause,richardson agreed to forgo any employment claims,accrued or prospective,he had or might have against the university.
the district court held that title vii rights may not be prospectively waived and held the clause effective only as to any claims richardson had at the time of executing the contract.the court also held that the common law doctrines of tender back and ratification did not commit richardson to the release clause.on appeal,defendants argue that richardson is bound by the release clause because persons may contract to waive prospective claims under title vii,or richardson acceptance of the guaranty payments after he was fired and failure to tender them back constitutes ratification of the release.
prospective waiver of title vii claims 
defendants begin their argument by trying to deal with the elephant in the supreme court case that apparently forecloses their assertion.they acknowledge the court statement in alexander,d that we think it clear that there can be no prospective waiver of an employee rights under title vii,but claim this pronouncement is limited to collective bargaining agreements cbas.id.at.but the context of the supreme court statement does not limit it to cbas.in,the plaintiff brought suit against his employer for discrimination after having pursued arbitration under the cba negotiated by his union.the court rejected and waiver arguments.regarding the purported waiver,the court stated w e are unable to accept the proposition that petitioner waived his cause of action under title vii.to begin,we think it clear that there can be no prospective waiver of an employee rights under title vii.id.emphasis added.the court said only that the rights conferred by title vii can form no part of the process since waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind title vii.in these circumstances,an employee rights under title vii are not susceptible of prospective waiver.id.at.emphasis added.the court was applying a general title vii rights can not be the cba context.later in the opinion,the court noted that while presumably employees could waive title vii as part of a settlement agreement,submitting the claim to arbitration did not constitute such a waiver.since an employee rights under title vii may not be waived prospectively,existing contractual rights and remedies against discrimination must result from other concessions already made by the union as part of the economic bargain struck with the employer.id.at.emphasis added contrasting the collective rights of employees such as the right to strike,which a union may relinquish in the process of bargaining with an employer for collective economic benefits with individual rights conferred by title vii,which belong to the individual and may not be collectively bargained.
a number of other circuits have also held,relying on,that persons may not contract away prospective claims under title vii.adams philip morris,cir the supreme court has stated that an employee rights under title vii are not susceptible of prospective waiver.it is the general rule in this circuit that an employee may not prospectively waive his or her rights under either title vii or the adea age discrimination in employment act.quoting,at.cole burns int l sec,stating,in support of the proposition that arbitration agreements are not always enforceable,that employees can not be held to an agreement that waives their right to be free from discrimination as a condition of employment,and citing adams for the rule that employees may not prospectively waive title vii rights thompson plante moran,wl,at,unpublished citing adams for the proposition that a n employee may waive rights under title vii or the adea that have already accrued,but an employee can not waive claims arising from conduct that has not yet occurred kendall watkins,cir citing in holding that an employee may agree to waive title vii rights that have accrued,but can not waive rights that have not yet accrued rogers,cir a n employee may validly release only those title vii claims arising from discriminatory acts or practices which antedate the execution of the release.thus,an otherwise valid release that waives prospective title vii rights is invalid as violative of public policy.quoting united states,cir.
the public policy concerns that inhere in allowing prospective waivers of title vii rights support the conclusion that such waiver is invalid.first,congress designed title vii so that the enforcement of its substantive measures against employers would be effected,at least in substantial part,through private individuals asserting a claim.in such cases,the private litigant not only redresses his own injury but also vindicates the important congressional policy against discriminatory employment practices,at.allowing an employee to bargain away the right to pursue a prospective discrimination claim frustrates this statutory scheme.second,allowing employers to ink a deal with an employee to waive prospective claims strikes at the heart of congress aim to deter discriminatory conduct by employers.an employer can not purchase a license to discriminate.an employment agreement that attempts to settle prospective claims of discrimination for job applicants or current employees may violate public policy under adams,at.
defendants cite gilmer lane,d for the proposition that so long as an employee may vindicate statutory rights by any other means even by contracting to waive prospective claims in return for monetary compensation,the goals of civil rights statutes are preserved.this is an overly broad reading of what the court said.gilmer does not say that persons may waive prospective civil rights claims.rather,gilmer stands for the proposition that employees may make the individual decision to contract away a right to have a federal court hear a civil rights claim in favor of an arbitration forum.citing cases where it had recognized that statutory rights may be subject to an arbitration clause,the court said i n these cases we recognized that by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.id.at.emphasis added internal quotations and alterations omitted.see taylor progress energy,cir an agreement to arbitrate preserves the claim the agreement simply shifts the forum for resolving the claim from a court to an arbitration setting.the upshot is that so long as some forum is available to hear prospective claims,civil rights statutes are not violated.the court later said that s o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.gilmer,at.emphasis added second alteration in original quoting mitsubishi motors soler,d.
defendants also cite this court decision in patterson tenet healthcare,cir,for the proposition that an employee may contractually waive his right to vindicate a prospective title vii claim in court.it is true patterson says that,but only where an alternative arbitration forum is available.in that case,a forum was still available to hear prospective claims.that is not the case here.defendants assert that richardson could and did waive any prospective claims under title vii.existing supreme court precedent forecloses that assertion.we hold that richardson could not,and thus did not,waive his prospective claims under title vii.
and ratification 
defendants argue in the alternative that under general contract law,since richardson has retained moneys under the guaranty,he has ratified the waiver clause,making it applicable to his prospective claims,and that unless he tenders back the moneys received,he may not bring suit.we likewise reject this argument.
the supreme court has not addressed the applicability of the and ratification doctrines to title vii claims,but in oubre entergy operations,d,the court addressed their applicability to claims under the adea.while oubre involved considerations not directly implicated in this case,the court decision persuasively guides us to ours.
in oubre,the plaintiff signed a release as part of a termination agreement from her position with entergy that purported to discharge entergy from any claims arising from her employment.oubre later brought an age discrimination claim under the adea.entergy asserted that the claim was barred by the release she signed.but the release did not comply with a provision in the adea created by the old workers benefit protection act owbpa that prescribes standards that must be followed for a release of claims to be valid.entergy admitted the release was defective,but argued the doctrines of and ratification still barred oubre suit.the court held otherwise.the statutory command is clear an employee may not waive an adea claim unless the waiver or release satisfies the owbpa requirements.id.at.in the instant case,title vii does not have a similar statutory requirement for releases.but the court,in analyzing the waivability of prospective discrimination claims,has stated in equally strict terms w e think it clear that there can be no prospective waiver of an employee rights under title vii,at.emphasis added.in taylor,the fourth circuit held that because the family medical leave act fmla prohibits waiver or release of fmla claims,such waivers or releases could not be ratified.because fmla claims are not waivable by agreement,neither are they waivable by ratification.at.we apply the same reasoning.since prospective title vii claims are not waivable by virtue of the supreme court command in,neither are they susceptible to ratification.
moreover,the reasoning the court used in oubre is equally applicable to title vii 
applying the and ratification doctrines would frustrate the statute practical operation in many instances a discharged employee likely will have spent the moneys received and will lack the means to tender their return.these realities might tempt employers to risk noncompliance with the owbpa waiver provisions,knowing it will be difficult to repay the moneys and relying on ratification.we ought not to open the door to an evasion of the statute by this device.
oubre,at.the same applies to prospective releases under title vii.to forbid them as a matter of policy,but then allow them to be saved under the doctrines of or ratification,would frustrate the rule,and thereby title vii objectives.
few other courts have dealt with the applicability of the and ratification doctrines to title vii claims.in fleming united states postal service amf,cir,the court held that the plaintiff in a title vii case had to tender back payments received under a settlement agreement with the postal service before she could bring an employment suit.the court decided that,since title vii does not statutorily regulate releases like the federal employers liability act fela,the jones act,or the adea,ordinary contract rules like and ratification apply.this is a rescission case requiring tender back of consideration received.id.at.
however,two important caveats counsel that we not rely on fleming.first,the case deals with a settlement agreement executed by both parties to dispense with accrued employment claims,which agreements are not invalid under title vii as the supreme court recognized in.p resumably an employee may waive his cause of action under title vii as part of a voluntary settlement,at.in the instant case,we deal with a prospective waiver,not a settlement of accrued claims.second,fleming was decided without the aid of oubre policy underpinnings to the effect that releases of claims under remedial statutes like the adea and title vii frustrate the purposes of those statutes.
given the policy concerns that rendered invalid the release at issue in oubre,and the fact that the release of prospective claims is invalid under,we find that the doctrines of and ratification do not bar richardson suit.given that richardson could not prospectively waive his title vii claims,and the inapplicability of the and ratification doctrines,we hold that richardson claims in this case are not barred.
richardson race claims 
the district court found that richardson had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that his firing was because of his race.richardson argues that under either a analysis or the familiar framework,the evidence proves that he was a victim of race discrimination.
richardson first argues that the district court erred in not applying a analysis.a case is one in which it has been shown that an employment decision resulted from a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.price waterhouse hopkins,d.to qualify for application of the analysis,the plaintiff must demonstrate that an illegitimate criterion was a motivating factor in the employment decision.stacks sw.bell yellow pages,cir m.once that has occurred,the employer may come forward with an affirmative defense that it would have made the same decision absent the illegal criterion.price waterhouse,at.t he employer burden is most appropriately deemed an affirmative defense the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point,and then the employer,if it wishes to prevail,must persuade it on another.the employer affirmative defense does not absolve it of liability,but restricts the remedies available to a plaintiff.desert palace,costa,d g b.
the principal evidence meriting a analysis was an incident that occurred at a sports banquet in february,some two years before richardson ultimate termination.on february,richardson contacted wally hall,a sports writer,to complain about an article hall had written that was critical of richardson son.in the course of the conversation,richardson called hall a redneck.hall wrote an article on february about the exchange,and said richardson had called razorback fans redneck sob.fans from east arkansas called jim lindsey,a former member of the board of trustees,complaining about richardson comment.lindsey contacted broyles and told him he thought the statement justified richardson being fired.the night of february,broyles attended a sports banquet and sat next to members of the media.broyles asked clay henry,a sports columnist,if he would write a column equating richardson calling white people rednecks with a white person calling richardson a nigger.henry told broyles he wanted to avoid controversy.henry later told richardson about the conversation.at trial,henry testified that broyles was quoting someone else when he used the word nigger,and that it was not a direct statement from broyles.the district court credited the testimony of paul eels,also seated next to broyles at the banquet,who said that broyles was not quoting someone else,but the court did not find the distinction noteworthy,finding the fact that broyles solicited the article at all the important evidence.
the district court found that broyles statement was direct evidence of discrimination and is sufficient to require a mixed motive analysis of any employment decisions made by broyles before october the court later stated that w hile i do believe the statements at the banquet would have required a direct evidence standard of review to any claims,i do not believe that they carry over for the reasons stated below.the court then held the statement could not be viewed as bearing on decisions made after that date because it found that broyles and richardson had buried the hatchet just after the signing of richardson new contract in october.the record contains cordial letters and statements between broyles and richardson at that time,prompting the district court to hold that t here is substantial evidence that demonstrates that the problems between broyles and richardson had been resolved.
the district court use of the term direct evidence is best understood in the context of legal causation,and not to distinguish it from circumstantial evidence.in stacks,the court noted 
we use the term demonstrate in the context of racial bias advisedly,in order to avoid the thicket created by some courts use of the term direct evidence to describe the plaintiff initial burden of proof in a price waterhouse case.we conclude that there is no restriction on the type of evidence a plaintiff may produce to demonstrate that an illegitimate criterion was a motivating factor in the challenged employment decision.the plaintiff need only present evidence,be it direct or circumstantial,sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the challenged decision.
at citation omitted.in the context of determining whether the evidence warrants an application of a analysis,direct refers to the causal strength of the proof,not whether it is circumstantial evidence.griffith city of des moines,cir emphasis added.with that in mind,we find no error in the district court evaluation.
in order to merit a inquiry,the plaintiff must show a specific link between the discriminatory animus and the challenged employment decision.philipp anr freight,cir quoting stacks,at.the required causal link renders stray remarks,statements by nondecisionmakers,or statements by decisionmakers that are unrelated to the decisional process insufficient to require a analysis.id.and though the district court discounted it,we find the span of time between broyles remarks and the decision to fire richardson relevant to a determination of whether discriminatory animus motivated the firing.see simmons,cir.
we need not weigh in on the correctness of the district court finding that broyles remarks at the sports banquet were direct strong enough to causally link the statement to adverse employment racial animus in employment actions taken before october.that is because richardson was fired nearly two years later,and we agree with the district court finding that richardson and broyles had made amends by then.the importance of the ample record evidence of the goodwill between broyles and richardson is that it substantially severs any possible causal link between the comments broyles made at the sports banquet,and any animus broyles allegedly might have had toward richardson at that time,and the decision to fire richardson in further,the between the comments and richardson firing required richardson to establish a causal link.because the statements by a supervisor and the adverse employment decision were not close in time,separated by some two years,plaintiff must establish a causal link between the comments and his termination.id.at.see hutson mcdonnell douglas,cir w e have held that a gap between the statement and the termination rendered the statement effectively stale when it came to allowing an inference of intentional discrimination.because these statements had an insufficient causal relationship to the actual decision to terminate,we have ruled that they could not support a jury finding of intentional discrimination.
richardson asserts that the district court was wrong in not considering or erroneously discounting other scattered evidence purporting to discredit the notion that richardson and broyles had made amends.reviewing the district court factual determinations in these matters,we can not say it clearly erred.
richardson also asserts that the district court erred in not applying a cat paw analysis to the evidence he presented at trial.it does not appear richardson squarely raised this argument below.w e will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.alexander pathfinder,cir.nonetheless,the district court conclusion that the clincher in support of the articulated reason for firing richardson was sugg who had to approve the firing and who the court found was not motivated by race view of richardson comments,is not clearly erroneous,and forecloses a cat paw evaluation.
this circuit cat paw rule provides that an employer can not shield itself from liability for unlawful termination by using a purportedly independent person or committee as the decisionmaker where the decisionmaker merely serves as the conduit,vehicle,or rubber stamp by which another achieves his or her unlawful design.dedmon staley,cir.where a decisionmaker makes an independent determination as to whether an employee should be terminated and does not serve as a mere conduit for another discriminatory motives,the cat paw theory fails.lacks ferguson reorganized sch.dist,cir.in this case,any claim that broyles used white sugg as a cat paw to advance any animus he might have held fails.richardson contract provided for independent review by sugg of any decision to fire richardson,which review was amply undertaken,and sugg own impression of richardson comments at the press conference provided an independent basis for his decision to approve richardson termination.as such,sugg,who had the final say on richardson termination,was not used as a cat paw to carry out someone else alleged discriminatory motive.
the mcdonnell douglas framework 
richardson argues alternatively that this case should be analyzed under the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework.under mcdonnell douglas,when a plaintiff meets his burden of establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination,a presumption of such discrimination is created.davis,cir.to establish a prima facie case,the plaintiff must show he is a member of a protected class,he met the legitimate expectations of his employer,he suffered an adverse employment action,and similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class received different treatment.id.once a plaintiff successfully establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,reason for its adverse employment action.id.quoting williams ford motor,cir.if the employer meets its burden,the presumption of discrimination disappears,requiring the plaintiff to prove that the proffered justification is merely a pretext for discrimination.the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion at all times.id.quoting pope esa,cir.
richardson challenges the district court conclusion that defendants stated reason for firing buy me out comment at the february press not pretext for a racially discriminatory action.richardson asserts that the district court essentially found that the reason given for terminating richardson was false,but this finding.br.of appellant at.the district court made no such finding and,by weighing all of the evidence as it related to the february comments,found quite the opposite.
at trial,richardson asserted that the buy me out reason was pretext because he had made a similar remark in a press conference in and was not terminated.the district court considered defendants reply that the contexts in which both comments were made were quite different.the court stated,quite frankly,i am not convinced.it could be argued that the remarks were worse according to the testimony of richardson secretary,and scott cain,a news reporter,richardson made this type of statement often.the court said only that it was not convinced the two statements were substantially differ
