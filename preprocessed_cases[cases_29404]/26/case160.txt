thomas pursued parallel lawsuits against the defendants in federal and state court.
what became the federal lawsuit was first filed in the superior court for the state of connecticut.based on assertion of,inter alia,causes of action under federal law,the action was removed by the defendants to the united states district court for the district of connecticut.when the case stalled,the plaintiff filed a second complaint in superior court in which he limited himself to the assertion of state law claims only.this lawsuit went to trial.a jury found in favor on one of his claims,but against him on the others.both sides appealed.
shortly after the state trial court judgment was entered,the district court in the pending parallel federal action robert chatigny,chief judge entered judgment for the defendants on all of federal claims,and remanded the pendent state claims to state court.the district court did not reach an issue raised by the defendants whether the state court judgment had a res judicata or claim preclusion effect on the claims pending in the federal action.that district court judgment was appealed to this court.
while the federal appeal was pending here,the connecticut appellate court reversed the judgment based on the jury verdict with respect to the one claim on which had been successful invasion of privacy and affirmed the remaining claims on which the defendants had prevailed.the connecticut supreme court denied petition for certification for appeal.all of claims in the lawsuit were therefore unsuccessful.
shortly after the connecticut supreme court ruled,we vacated the district court decision in the federal case in part,and remanded for further consideration of substantive due process claims.we declined to reach the defendants res judicata argument,concluding that it had not been sufficiently presented to the district court.pierson,cir.
following our remand,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on substantive due process claims on the ground that in light of the state court decision,they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.pierson,d.
the plaintiff appeals.we affirm.
background 
on january,brought this action in connecticut superior court,judicial district of hartford,against the wethersfield board of education,members of the board in their official capacities,and lynne pierson,the superintendent of schools,in both her individual and official capacity.pierson,no,a teacher,alleged that the defendants had acted unlawfully by conditioning his return to work following administrative leave on his agreement to undergo a psychiatric examination and to release all of his medical records to the defendants.he contended that these conditions violated his rights under both the united states constitution and the constitution of the state of connecticut he also asserted state claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,invasion of privacy,and intentional interference with beneficial and contractual relations.the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the district of connecticut on the basis of federal question jurisdiction arising out of assertion of federal constitutional claims.see.
in february,magistrate judge donna martinez filed a recommended ruling in the removed case,concluding that summary judgment should be granted in favor of the defendants on the federal constitutional claims and that the court should dismiss the pendent state law claims without prejudice.see c.the following month,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation in part,dismissing federal procedural due process claim but declining to dismiss his federal substantive due process claim and deferring decision on that claim pending further briefing.in light of the fact that a federal claim remained before it,the district court declined to dismiss the pendent claims.see,d at.
in june,initiated a second action in state superior court against the wethersfield board of education.wethersfield bd.of,no,june,see also,d at.it was based on the same facts as the first,previously removed,action,asserting many of the same causes of action along with several new ones.the second action contained no claims under federal law and was therefore not subject to removal on that basis,d at.
later that year,the board unsuccessfully moved in state court to dismiss the pending action based on the pendency of this case in federal court.see wethersfield bd.of.rptr,wl,at.lexis,at.may,unpublished opinion discussing denial of the motion to dismiss in.after several of the claims in the action were dismissed by the trial court in its decision on a motion for summary judgment by the defendants,mem.of decision on def mot.for summary judgment,wethersfield bd.of,wl,july,three claims remained tortious invasion of privacy,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and a statutory claim based on,which prohibits employers from disciplining or discharging employees in retaliation for exercising their right to free speech.they were tried to a jury beginning in september.
in october,the jury returned a verdict in favor of on his claim for tortious invasion of privacy,awarding him in damages,but in favor of the board on the other two claims.see,d at describing proceedings.the trial court entered a judgment based on the verdict.both parties appealed from the judgments against them.
on july,the connecticut appellate court decided that the judgment for on his invasion of privacy claim was barred by the board governmental immunity.it therefore reversed the judgment of the superior court insofar as it had been in favor.bd.of.it affirmed the remainder of the judgment against him.id.on september,the connecticut supreme court denied petition for certification for appeal.bd.of.
soon after the jury reached its verdict,the defendants in the action that remained pending in federal district one now on appeal before a letter to the federal district court requesting a conference regarding their intention to file a supplemental motion to dismiss based on a theory of res judicata,d at.the letter complied with a provision in a previous district court order regarding case management,which required the parties to request a conference before filing dispositive motions,d at.
on december,the district court held a conference as requested.in the course of the conference,the court orally granted summary judgment to the defendants on the remaining substantive due process claims.later,in a ruling and order,the court explained its rationale for this dismissal.pierson,civ.it decided,inter alia,that the board was both justified and had a legitimate interest in requesting the medical records and therefore did not violate substantive due process rights.see also,d at.the issue of whether the state court judgment precluded a federal judgment on the claims based on res judicata principles was unnecessary to the resolution of the motion,and the district court did not reach it.
on december,a final judgment was entered in favor of the defendants on all of the federal claims against them,and the pendent state claims were remanded to connecticut superior court.on january,appealed the judgment of the district court to this court.
we affirmed the judgment with respect to procedural due process claim,but vacated it as to the substantive due process claims.we concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether,in insisting that release his medical records,the board acted out of spite,or to keep from teaching by whatever means necessary,such that the board action would shock the conscience.id.at.such a finding of fact could have served as a basis for a viable substantive due process cause of action.see id.at.we declined to address the issue of res judicata because it had not been preserved for appeal id.at a motion by the board raising the defense when it became available would have preserved the issue for appeal a letter asking for a briefing schedule,which was not followed up,did not.
on remand,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the remaining substantive due process claims were barred by the doctrine
