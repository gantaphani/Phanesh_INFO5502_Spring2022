defendant,a former student of plaintiff forest grove school district,appeals the district court denial of reimbursement under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,for his expenses in attending a private school.we must decide whether a student who never received special education and related services from a school district nevertheless may recover reimbursement for the costs of private school education.we conclude that such a student is not barred as a matter of law from receiving reimbursement.in the idea,congress conferred broad discretion on the courts to provide appropriate equitable relief,including reimbursement for attendance at a private school.later amendments clarifying the relevant considerations for those students who previously received special education and related services do not apply to students,like,who never received special education and related services.because the district court applied an improper legal framework to claim for reimbursement under general principles of equity,we reverse and remand for reconsideration.
factual and procedural history 
was born on september.he resided at all relevant times in the forest grove school district.was enrolled in the school district from kindergarten until the spring semester of his junior year in high school,when his parents removed him from public school and enrolled him in a residential private school.throughout his time in public school,experienced difficulty paying attention in class and completing his school work,but he successfully passed from grade to grade due,in part,to extensive help from his parents and sister.never received special education and related services from the school district.
during his time in public school,the school district evaluated for a disability only once,in.in december,guidance counselor suspected that might have a learning disability and referred him for an evaluation for special education services.in internal meetings in early,the school district staff discussed the possibility that might have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.the notes from a january,meeting state maybe and the notes from a february,meeting mention suspected adhd.parents were neither present at the meetings nor informed of the school district staff suspicion that might have adhd.parents did not request evaluation for adhd,and was evaluated only for a learning disability 
several psychologists and educational specialists examined and administered tests throughout the first half of.on june,the team of specialists unanimously concluded that did not have a learning disability and therefore was ineligible for special education.mother,who attended the meeting,agreed with that determination.the school psychologist completed his report in september,stating that was not eligible for special education under the idea on the basis of a learning disability,but p ossible.no one ever followed up on either the reference to p ossible in the psychologist report or the references to suspected adhd in the school district staff meeting notes.
at some point during,began using marijuana.in early,his use became regular,and he exhibited noticeable personality changes.on february,ran away from home.the police brought him back a few days later.parents took him to a psychologist and,eventually,to a hospital emergency room.
fulop,a psychologist hired by parents,met with a number of times in early.fulop held several lengthy sessions immediately after ran away from home.on march,fulop diagnosed with adhd,depression,math disorder,and cannabis abuse.fulop recommended a residential program for because of failure to live up to his potential in school,his difficulties at home,his attitude toward school,his sense of hopelessness,and his drug problem.
in response to behavior,parents removed him from the school district public high school and,in march,sent him to a program at catherine freer wilderness therapy expeditions.the discharge report written by freer staff identified primary diagnosis as cannabis dependence and his secondary diagnosis as depression.
soon after completed the freer expedition,on march,his parents enrolled him in mount bachelor academy,a residential private school that describes itself as designed for children who may have academic,behavioral,emotional,or motivational problems.although committed a number of serious rule violations at mount bachelor academy,he graduated in june.he also would have graduated from public high school in had he remained there.
on march,four days after enrolling at mount bachelor academy,parents hired a lawyer.on april,they requested a hearing pursuant to f and sought among other remedies an order requiring the school district to evaluate in all areas of suspected disability.the office of administrative hearings for the state of oregon initiated a hearing in may,but the assigned hearing officer continued the matter to allow the school district to evaluate 
during the summer months of,several medical and educational specialists from the school district evaluated on july,a team of school officials convened to determine eligibility under the idea.the team acknowledged learning difficulties,his diagnosis of adhd,and his depression,but a majority found that did not qualify under the idea in the areas of learning disability,adhd,or depression,because those diagnoses did not have a severe effect on educational performance.on august,a similar team convened and determined that was ineligible for services or accommodations under of the rehabilitation act of.
the administrative hearing then resumed in september.both parties submitted evidence.the evidence included the extensive history recounted above.in addition,another psychologist,callum,examined records and testified at the hearing that adhd seems to be more of a secondary,possibly,tertiary cause of his difficulties.she concluded that would be able to complete public high school without any services beyond those given to all students.she did state,however,that the references to the possibility of adhd in the meeting notes following the referral would have caused her to evaluate for adhd.
on january,the hearing officer issued a lengthy opinion that contained extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law.she held that was disabled and therefore eligible for special education under the idea and of the rehabilitation act of that the school district had failed to offer a free appropriate public education that the school district was not responsible for the costs of the freer expedition or the evaluation by fulop but that the school district was responsible for the costs of sending to mount bachelor academy.monthly tuition at mount bachelor academy was.
the school district appealed to the district court pursuant to i,arguing that the hearing officer erred by granting reimbursement for tuition at mount bachelor academy according to the school district,reimbursement was unwarranted because unilaterally withdrew from public school without providing prior notice to the school district,he never received special education and related services from the school district,and he withdrew for reasons unrelated to his disability that is,substance abuse and behavioral problems.
the district court reversed the hearing officer grant of reimbursement to.the court adopted all of the hearing officer findings of fact,but held that the hearing officer had erred as a matter of law in granting private school reimbursement.the district court held that was statutorily ineligible for reimbursement under a c.the court also held that,e ven assuming that tuition reimbursement may be ordered,under general principles of equity,the facts in this case do not support such an exercise of equity.
timely appealed to this court.this case was originally scheduled for oral argument on may.on may,we granted the parties joint motion to waive oral argument and,at the same time,ordered supplemental briefing.on august,we referred the case to mediation and deferred submission pending the supreme court decision in frank board of education,cir,petition for cert.filed,cert.denied,d.on september,we granted the parties joint motion to defer mediation until after the supreme court resolution of a different second circuit case addressing the same issue.see bd.of educ.tom,wl unpublished decision,vacated.cir unpublished decision summarily reversing the district court decision and remanding in light of frank,cert.granted,d,aff,d per curiam.
on october,the supreme court affirmed without opinion the second circuit decision in tom by an equally divided court.at.justice kennedy took no part in the decision of the case.id.at.the next week,the supreme court denied certiorari in frank.at,again with justice kennedy taking no part in the decision.thereafter,the parties informed us that they were unable to reach agreement through mediation,and we subsequently heard oral argument and submitted the case.
standards of review 
we review de novo questions of law.gregory longview sch,cir.we therefore review de novo the legal question whether a c creates a categorical bar to reimbursement of private school tuition for students who have not previously received special education and related services.
we review the district court factual findings for clear error.capistrano unified sch.dist.wartenberg,cir.
we review for abuse of discretion the district court determination under principles of equity to grant or deny reimbursement for private school tuition.the text of the idea makes clear that the district court exercises its discretion in fashioning appropriate relief 
in any action brought under this paragraph,the court 
i shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings 
ii shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party and 
iii basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.
i c emphases added the supreme court has interpreted the emphasized provision as conferring broad discretion on the court.see sch.comm.of town of burlington dep t of,d the statute directs the court to grant such relief as it determines is appropriate.the ordinary meaning of these words confers broad discretion on the court.alteration in original see also burlington dep t of,cir holding that reimbursement is a matter of equitable relief,committed to the sound discretion of the district court,aff,d.in florence county school district four carter ex rel.carter,d,the court summarized 
o nce a court holds that the public placement violated idea,it is authorized to grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.i c.under this provision,equitable considerations are relevant in fashioning relief,and the court enjoys broad discretion in so doing.courts fashioning discretionary equitable relief under idea must consider all relevant factors

this court therefore has applied an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a district court grant or denial of equitable relief.see parents of student puyallup sch,cir the district court exercised its discretion in denying this equitable remedy,and this court reviews for abuse of that discretion.see also park ex rel.park anaheim union high sch,cir per curiam we review the hearing officer and the district court award of compensatory education services for abuse of discretion.citing parents of student,at.although we have not been entirely consistent in applying a standard of review to the district court grant or denial of an equitable remedy no case supports contention that we review the hearing officer decision for abuse of discretion in any event,to the extent that our cases are unclear,we reaffirm that the text of the statute and supreme court precedent dictate that we review for abuse of discretion the district court determination of appropriate equitable relief.a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.koon united states,d.
discussion 
the idea was enacted to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.d a.the hearing officer in this case held that qualified as disabled under the idea and that the school district had failed to offer him a free appropriate public education.those issues are not before us on appeal instead,we must determine the availability,if any,of private school reimbursement for a student,like,who never received special education and related services from a school district.
concedes that,as the district court held,he does not meet the statutory requirements under a c,because he had not previously received special education and related services.he argues that reimbursement is nevertheless available as a remedy under general principles of equity pursuant to i c.further argues that the district court erred in its analysis under general principles of equity.we will address each of those two arguments in turn.
private school reimbursement under a c 
before,the idea was silent on the subject of private school reimbursement,but courts had granted such reimbursement as appropriate relief under principles of equity pursuant to i c.see burlington,at.w e are confident that by empowering the court to grant appropriate relief congress meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available remedy in a proper case.i c in any action brought under this paragraph,the court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.congress amended the idea in to include a new section entitled payment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency.a c.clause ii of the new statutory section states 
if the parents of a child with a disability,who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency,enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency,a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.
a c ii emphasis added.clause iii further states that t he cost of reimbursement described in clause ii may be reduced or denied if certain requirements,such as notice,are not met.id.a c iii see also id.a c iv stating exceptions to the requirements in clause iii.
in this case,the hearing officer and district court found,and neither party challenges,that never received special education and related services from a public agency.accordingly,we must decide whether the reference in a c to students who previously received special education and related services bars private school reimbursement for students who have not previously received special education and related services,or whether those students remain eligible for private school reimbursement,as they were before,under principles of equity pursuant to i c.in other words,did congress revoke,categorically,private school reimbursement for students who have never received special education and related services from a public agency,or did congress simply legislate concerning students who had previously received special education and related services,leaving discretion in cases such as in the hands of courts applying principles of equity 
we are not the first circuit court to have addressed this question.in frank,at,the second circuit thoroughly analyzed the question and concluded that the reference in a c ii to students who previously received special education and related services does not create a categorical bar to recovery of private school reimbursement for all other students.we agree with and adopt the analysis and conclusion of the second circuit.
the second circuit first examined the text of the statute.the court concluded that a c ii is ambiguous because its text does not clearly create a categorical bar and because such an interpretation is in tension with the broader context of the statute.id.at.the second circuit then applied traditional canons of statutory construction to the ambiguous text and reasoned that reading a c ii to create a categorical bar would defeat both purposes of the idea,which are to give children with disabilities an appropriate and free education would not produce a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law and would lead to absurd results.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the second circuit noted that its interpretation was consistent with that of the department of education office of special education rehabilitative services,id.at and held that neither the ambiguous legislative history of a c ii nor the first circuit decision in greenland school district amy,cir,altered its conclusion.frank,at.
we see no reason to disagree with the second circuit analysis of this issue.we emphasize in particular that the express purpose of the idea is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.d a emphasis added see also burlington,at.emphasizing this purpose interpreting the amendments to prohibit categorically reimbursement to students who have not yet received special education and related services runs contrary to this express purpose.additionally,it would lead to the absurd result that the parents of a child with a disability must wait an indefinite,perhaps lengthy period until the child has received special education in public school before sending the child to an appropriate private school,no matter how uncooperative the school district and no matter how inappropriate the special education.further,if the school district declined to recognize a student as occurred in this student would never receive special education in public school and therefore would never be eligible for reimbursement under a c ii.the act was intended to give handicapped children both an appropriate education and a free one it should not be interpreted to defeat one or the other of those objectives.burlington,at.
in amending the idea in,congress chose to specify in a c the requirements and factors to be considered by district courts and hearing officers when deciding whether to award reimbursement to students who previously received special education and related services.for students who never received special education and related services,however,the new provisions of a c simply do not apply.for those students,reimbursement may be sought only under principles of equity pursuant to i c.because never received special education and related services,a c does not apply in this case he may recover reimbursement,if at all,only under principles of equity pursuant to i c.
in conclusion,we hold that students who have not previously received special education and related services are eligible for reimbursement,to the same extent as before the amendments,as appropriate relief pursuant to i c the statutory requirements of a c do not apply.we therefore reverse the district court holding that failure to meet the requirements of a c prevents private school reimbursement as a matter of law,and turn to the district court alternative holding that was not entitled to reimbursement under general principles of equity.
private school reimbursement under principles of equity pursuant to i c 
parents have an equitable right to reimbursement for the cost of providing an appropriate education when a school district has failed to offer a child a free appropriate public education.the conduct of both parties must be reviewed to determine whether relief is appropriate,at citation omitted.the district court exercises its discretion in granting or denying appropriate equitable relief under i c,and we may reverse only if the district court has abused that discretion.we hold that the district court in this case abused its discretion in denying private school reimbursement to,because the district court made two distinct legal errors in its discussion of the relevant equitable considerations.we therefore reverse the district court denial of private school reimbursement and remand for consideration of claim under the proper legal framework.
first,the district court erred by considering the a c statutory requirements in its analysis under principles of equity.in particular,the district court found that the equitable considerations in favor of granting reimbursement did not override the statutory requirements for tuition reimbursement.as discussed above,there are no statutory requirements for tuition reimbursement for students,like,who never received special education and related services in public school.congress choice to legislate concerning students who previously received special education and related services did not alter the proper analysis for students who have not received special education and related services in public school,under general principles of equity pursuant to i c.
second,the district court applied the wrong legal standard by asserting that tuition reimbursement may be ordered in an extreme case for a student not receiving special education services.emphasis added.the court cited greenland,at,for that proposition,not having the benefit of our opinion today,which rejects greenland in favor of the second circuit approach.nothing in i c,supreme court precedent,or our own precedent suggests that tuition reimbursement is available only in extreme cases for parents who place their child in private school before receiving special education and related services in public school.
in summary,the district court erroneously considered the inapplicable statutory requirements of a c and applied an incorrect legal standard.we therefore reverse the district court denial of reimbursement and remand for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.on remand,the district court should consider all relevant factors in determining whether to grant reimbursement and the amount of the reimbursement,including those factors that we have identified in the past.for example,we have previously recognized that notice to the school district is a relevant equitable consideration.in ash,the disabled student attended private school beginning in,but his parents did not provide meaningful notice to the school district until.ash lake oswego sch.dist,see also ash,at incorporating the district court account of the facts.in response to the parents request,the school district offered to provide certain special education services,ash.at,but the district court found that the offered services were inadequate to meet the student educational needs,id.at.the district court awarded reimbursement beginning in,but rejected the parents claim that private school reimbursement should be given for the whole period beginning in.id.at.we affirmed the district court conclusion that reimbursement was warranted only beginning in,after the school district had been asked to provide services to the student and had been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the process of evaluating the student and making a placement recommendation.ash,at quoting ash.at.
in this case,parents did not notify the school district before removing from public school.instead,shortly after enrolling in private school,parents notified the school district,attended several meetings with school officials,and made available for evaluation.at the conclusion of its evaluation in july,the school district nevertheless concluded that was not disabled and therefore declined to offer him special education services under the idea.in other words,after the school district had been asked to provide services to and had been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the process of evaluating and making a placement recommendation,id.internal quotation marks omitted,the school district still failed to recognize as disabled or to offer him a free appropriate education.thus,the district court would be within its discretion to consider notice as a relevant factor in its reimbursement determination.
additionally,as we have noted in other cases,f actors to be considered by the district court include the existence of other,more suitable placements,the effort expended by the parent s in securing alternative placements,and the general cooperative or uncooperative position of the school district,at internal quotation marks omitted accord adams oreg
