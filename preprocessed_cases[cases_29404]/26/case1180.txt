plaintiffs brought this action against defendant,the board of public education for bibb county,to recover for violations of the fair labor standards act.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the board,and this appeal followed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court decision in part and reverse in part.
background 
plaintiffs are defendant employees or former employees.they are or were bus drivers,bus monitors or aides,paraprofessionals,secretaries,and custodians.plaintiffs claimed that the board failed to pay overtime wages and failed to pay the appropriate regular rate of pay in violation of the fair labor standards act.the bus drivers and monitors moved the district court for partial summary judgment,claiming that the board methodology for computing their regular rate of pay,and for computing overtime in general,violated the flsa.the board moved for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs claims and argued that its practices were in compliance with the flsa.
the district court denied the motion for partial summary judgment filed by the bus drivers and bus monitors and granted the board motion for summary judgment.all plaintiffs now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment and raise the following issues whether the district court erred in granting the board motion for summary judgment in connection with the claims of the bus drivers and bus monitors,where the bus drivers and bus monitors received different rates of pay depending on the type of route driven,and the overtime rates reflect the differing rates of pay and whether the district court erred in granting the board motion for summary judgment in connection with the claims of those plaintiffs who assert that they have worked unpaid overtime hours.

the grant of summary judgment is subject to de novo review and the circuit court applies the same standard used by the district court.elan pharm.research employers ins.of wausau,cir.
iii.analysis 
as noted,this case involves two different groups of plaintiffs.the first group,which consists of bus drivers and bus monitors,alleges that the board violated the flsa by paying different rates for regular and other routes,and calculating overtime through the use of a blended rate.the second group,which consists of paraprofessionals,secretaries,custodians,bus drivers,and bus monitors,asserts that they worked uncompensated overtime in violation of the flsa.although both groups appeal from the district court ruling on the board motion for summary judgment,the two have distinct facts and legal issues that are treated separately here.
different rates for different routes 
the first issue we address is whether the district court erred in granting the board motion for summary judgment in connection with the claims of the bus drivers and bus monitors.plaintiffs argue that the board violated the flsa when it paid a driver or bus monitor different rates of pay depending on the type of route driven.on a regular route,the rate of pay is based largely on the employee years of service to the school.on an additional route,the rate of pay is per hour rate for field trips and a per hour extended day rate that applies to everything other than the regular route and field trips.in its brief,the board utilized the following example to explain its current pay policy of blending these rates when calculating overtime 
bus drivers and aides earn straight time at the rate of pay applicable to the particular duty they are performing.for example,if a driver drives a regular route for hours in a week,and the driver rate of pay for work is an hour,he will earn.if that driver also drives hours of field trips during the same week,he will earn an additional hours x.if the driver also cleans his bus for hour,drives an route taking students home following an program for hours,and attends a for hours,he will earn an additional hours of work at the extended day rate of an hour for a total of.therefore,in this example,the driver has worked a total of hours in a week and earned a total of straight time.
because the driver in this hypothetical worked over hours in the week,he is also entitled to hours of overtime or an additional time.the overtime rate of pay is based on the blended or weighted rate of pay.the total compensation is divided by the total hours worked to determine the blended rate of pay at which to pay the overtime.in this example,the blended rate is.because this driver has already been paid straight time or time for those hours,he is entitled to of the blended rate for a total additional overtime compensation of.
the district court found that this policy of paying different rates for different types of routes,and paying overtime based upon a blended rate,did not violate the flsa because the routes constituted different types of work.while we disagree with the district court analysis,we nonetheless affirm its grant of summary judgment for the board on this issue because we believe that the board policy is in accordance with the flsa.
when congress enacted the fair labor standards act in,its goal was to provide minimum wage and maximum hour protections for workers.moreau klevenhagen,d.by establishing a floor for wages and a ceiling for hours worked without overtime compensation,lawmakers attempted to compensate those who labored in excess of the statutory maximum number of hours for the wear and tear of extra work and to spread employment through inducing employers to shorten hours because of the pressure of extra cost.bay ridge operating aaron.to that end,of the flsa establishes that an employee must receive no less than the minimum wage and mandates that an employee who works for more than forty hours a week is entitled to overtime compensation equal to one and a half times his regular rate of pay.
in the present case,plaintiffs argue that the board has violated the flsa mandate that overtime be paid at one and a half times the regular rate.specifically,they assert that the board policy of blending the rates for regular and other routes,and calculating overtime based on the blended rate,does not satisfy the flsa.plaintiffs cite to g and for the proposition that the use of a blended rate is improper because different rates of pay and the resulting blended overtime rate are only permitted if the employee is engaged in two or more different types of work.we disagree.
we begin by noting that plaintiffs argument is predicated on their assumption that the rate paid by the board for regular routes is their regular rate.under the flsa,the regular rate is derived from all remuneration for employment paid to,or on behalf of,the employees.e.for this reason,the rate of pay plaintiffs receive for regular routes is only the regular rate when plaintiffs do not drive any of the other types of routes or receive any other rate of pay.when a driver drives a combination of regular and other routes,and receives two different rates of pay,then the combined pay for those rates must be used in calculating all remuneration for employment.the total remuneration for employment is then divided by the total number of hours actually worked in that workweek.see overnight transp.missel.w age divided by hours equals regular rate.the number resulting from this equation is the employee regular rate,and the result is unaffected by any designation of a contrary regular rate in the wage contracts,walling hardwood.
section g of the flsa states that an employer does not violate the requirement that overtime payment be time and a half of the employee regular rate,if 
the amount paid to the employee for the number of hours worked by him in such workweek in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employee under such subsection in the case of an employee performing two or more kinds of work for which different hourly or piece rates have been established,is computed at rates not less than one and times such bona fide rates applicable to the same work when performed during hours.
g.section g,therefore,alerts employers to an acceptable alternative method of calculating overtime for employees who are paid at more than one rate.the board did not utilize the method described in this section,and we do not believe that the language contained therein should be construed as a requirement that different types of work be performed if different rates are paid.section regulates hours.it was not created as a way to regulate an employee compensation,nor was its purpose to prescribe that an hourly wage be set at any particular level it is its purpose to require that an hourly wage be set at some level and that it be scrupulously adhered to,with augmented payments for overtime work.nunn battery goldberg,cir.indeed,the supreme court has said that a s long as the minimum hourly rates established by are respected,the employer and employee are free to establish this regular rate at any point and in any manner they see fit.walling,at.accordingly,g does not require that different types of work be performed in order for employers to lawfully pay different rates.
neither do the regulations mandate that different types of work be performed if different rates are paid.plaintiffs state that it is under that different rates of pay and the resulting blended overtime rate is only permitted if the employee is engaged in two or more different types of work.br.of appellants at.the relevant portion of states that 
w here an employee in a single workweek works at two or more different types of work for which different nonovertime rates of pay of not less than the applicable minimum wage have been established,his regular rate for that week is the weighted average of such rates.that is,his total earnings except statutory exclusions are computed to include his compensation during the workweek from all such rates,and are then divided by the total number of hours worked at all jobs.
plaintiffs argue that this section creates a requirement that,in order for a blended rate to be used in calculating the regular rate,different types of work must be performed.however,when viewed in the proper context,it is apparent that section contains no such mandate.section states that 
t he regular hourly rate of pay for an employee is determined by dividing his total remuneration for employment in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid.the following sections give some examples of the proper method of determining the regular rate of pay in particular instances 
following section is a list of different employment arrangements and the proper method for complying with the flsa for each type of arrangement.that list includes section.thus,reading section in the context of section,it becomes apparent that the former is one of the examples mentioned in the latter as a way that the regular rate may be calculated in certain cases.while it exemplifies one way that a regular rate may be determined,it does not mandate that differing rates of pay are only permitted when different types of work are performed.
for the reasons stated above,we hold that the flsa does not contain a requirement that employees perform different types of work in order for employers lawfully to pay them different rates,and we believe that the board current policy is in accordance with the flsa.with respect to this issue,the district court ruling is affirmed.
uncompensated overtime 
the second issue we must address is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the board in connection with the claims of those plaintiffs who assert that they worked uncompensated overtime hours.
according to federal rule of civil procedure,the district court should grant summary judgment only upon a showing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.the moving party bears the burden of proof,and the district court should view all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.whatley cna ins,cir anderson liberty lobby,d.
summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.entry of summary judgment is appropriate after adequate time for discovery and upon motion,against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.
the movant bears the responsibility for demonstrating the basis for the summary judgment motion.id.a factual dispute alone is not enough to defeat a properly pled motion for summary judgment only the existence of a genuine issue of material fact will preclude grant of summary judgment.anderson,at.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.mize jefferson city bd.of,cir citing hairston gainesville sun publ g,cir.a fact is material if it may affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.allen tyson foods,cir.the moving party bears the initial burden of showing the court,by reference to materials on file,that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial.hickson crossarm,cir citing anderson,at.
when a moving party has discharged its burden,the party must then go beyond the pleadings,and by its own affidavits,or by depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.jeffery sarasota white sox,cir citing celotex,at.if there is a conflict between the parties allegations or evidence,the party evidence is presumed to be true and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the party favor.shotz city of plantation,cir.
in the present case,the district court held that summary judgment was appropriate,and that no genuine issues of fact remained.specifically,the district court found that when employees work overtime and record that time on their time sheets,the board pays the overtime compensation the board expended a significant amount of time and resources training the employees on how to properly record and turn in their time sheets all of the plaintiffs acknowledged in their depositions that they were instructed on how to record their hours worked,how to report a problem with their time cards or paychecks,and not to work overtime unless it had previously been approved by a supervisor some of the employees were allowed to take flex time,where if they worked more than forty hours in a week,they could take a corresponding amount of time off in flex time during that same pay period no employee was able to state with any clarity the hours he or she allegedly worked overtime each plaintiff testimony was so vague and contradictory that it is impossible to determine whether they have claims against the board because of the nature of plaintiffs work,their supervisors could not monitor them all the time and there was an absence of anything to put the board on notice that overtime was worked.
plaintiffs now urge us to reverse this ruling,arguing that the district court erred in finding no remaining questions of fact regarding their entitlement to compensation for unpaid overtime.plaintiffs argue that they have set forth sufficient evidence to demonstrate that they worked unpaid overtime,and are permitted to approximate the number of hours they have worked.they also assert that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the board actual or constructive knowledge of their uncompensated overtime work.
under the flsa,an employer may not employ his employee for a workweek longer than forty hours unless his employee receives overtime compensation at a rate not less than one and a half times his regular rate.a.a person is employed if he or she is suffered or permitted to work.g.it is not relevant that the employer did not ask the employee to do the work.the reason that the employee performed the work is also not relevant.i f the employer knows or has reason to believe that the employee continues to work,the additional hours must be counted.reich dep t of conservation and nat,cir citing.
in order to prevail on their claim in this case,plaintiffs must prove that they were suffered or permitted to work without compensation.et.courts have interpreted this to mean that a flsa plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she worked overtime without compensation and the board knew or should have known of the overtime work.see reich,at see also interpreting the suffer or permit to work requirement to mean that an employer violates the flsa when it knows or has reason to believe that he is continuing to work and the time is working time.in granting summary judgment for the board,the district court noted that it believed plaintiffs could prove neither that they worked overtime without compensation,nor that their supervisors knew or should have known of this overtime work.examining these issues in turn,we review the district court ruling de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court.
performance of uncompensated overtime work 
in granting the board motion for summary judgment,the district court stated that plaintiffs had failed to state with any clarity the hours they allegedly worked overtime and had provided testimony that was so vague and contradictory that it is impossible to determine whether they have claims against the board.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in finding that their approximations did not provide a sufficient basis to survive summary judgment.we agree with plaintiffs.
to the extent that evidence conflicts at summary judgment,the district court has an obligation to view all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.whatley,at anderson,at.if a reasonable fact finder evaluating the evidence could draw more than one inference from the facts,and if that inference introduces a genuine issue of material fact,then the court should not grant summary judgment.samples ex rel.samples city of atlanta,cir citing augusta iron steel works,employers ins.of wausau,cir.credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge,whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict.the evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.see anderson,at.
although a flsa plaintiff bears the burden of proving that he or she worked overtime without compensation,t he remedial nature of this statute and the great public policy which it embodies militate against making that burden an impossible hurdle for the employee.anderson clemens pottery.it is the employer duty to keep records of the employee wages,hours,and other conditions and practices of employment.id.the employer is in a superior position to know and produce the most probative facts concerning the nature and amount of work performed and e mployees seldom keep such records themselves.id.
in anderson,the court noted that if an employer has failed to keep proper and accurate records and the employee can not offer convincing substitutes,
t he solution is not to penalize the employee by denying him any recovery on the ground that he is unable to prove the precise extent of uncompensated work.such a result would place a premium on an employer failure to keep proper records in conformity with his statutory duty it would allow the employer to keep the benefits of an employee labors without paying due compensation as contemplated by the fair labor standards act.
thus,in situations where the employer records can not be trusted and the employee lacks documentation,the supreme court held that an employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.id.the burden then becomes the employer,and it must bring forth either evidence of the precise amount of work performed or evidence to negate the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee evidence.id.at.if the employer fails to produce such evidence,the court may then award damages to the employee,even though the result be only approximate.id.at.
plaintiffs deposition testimony calls into question the board records.some employees testified that they were told not to record their overtime hours because the board would not pay them overtime.some recorded their overtime hours,but were made to take back their accurate time sheets and resubmit new time sheets that reflected their scheduled,not actual,hours.at least one plaintiff said that time sheets were torn up if they reflected overtime work.another said that the individual in charge of time sheets would white out time worked on his time sheets.
if true,these facts indicate that the board records can not be trusted.according to anderson,in this type of situation the employee carries its burden of proving that he or she performed work without proper compensation if he or she produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.
plaintiffs made statements regarding the amount and extent of their uncompensated work in declarations and in deposition testimony taken by the board.the board argues that plaintiffs declarations should be disregarded because they are unnotarized,unsworn,and because they contradict plaintiffs deposition testimony.
in van junkins,cir,this court affirmed a district court finding that an affidavit that contradicted testimony on deposition was a sham when the party merely contradicted its earlier testimony without giving any valid explanation.there,we said that w hen a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact,that party can not thereafter create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts,without explanation,previously given clear testimony.id.at.
this rule is applied sparingly because of the harsh effect it may have on a party case.rollins techsouth,cir.furthermore,
to allow every failure of memory or variation in a witness testimony to be disregarded as a sham would require far too much from lay witnesses and would deprive the trier of fact of the traditional opportunity to determine which point in time and with which words the affiant was stating the truth.
tippens celotex,cir.as such,our cases require the court to find some inherent inconsistency between an affidavit and a deposition before disregarding the affidavit.id.at.
we do not believe that the sort of inherent inconsistency exists between the deposition testimony and declarations that would require us to find plaintiffs declarations a sham.the declarations were made before the deposition testimony,and to the extent an individual plaintiff varied from the statements made in his or her declaration about hours worked,it was to admit that he or she lacked certainty about the number of hours worked,and on what days they had worked those hours.this is the type of inconsistency that the board should test through at trial and allow the jury to weigh in determining the credibility of each plaintiff testimony in support of his or her claims 
it is not insignificant that plaintiffs inability to state the hours they worked may be at least partly the fault of the board after all,several plaintiffs have testified that when they submitted time sheets to the board that showed overtime work,those time sheets were destroyed.because the board seems to bear at least partial responsibility for the lack of documentation,we must reject its assertion that newton city of henderson,cir,supports summary judgment here.in newton,the court found no violation of the flsa because plaintiff failed to record his overtime work on his time sheets.id.at.yet,unlike the plaintiff in newton,several plaintiffs in this case testified that they were discouraged from accurately recording overtime work on their time sheets,and were encouraged to falsify their own records by submitting time sheets that reflected their scheduled,rather than actual,hours.it can be inferred that these plaintiffs would have reported their overtime if they had not been discouraged from doing so.
furthermore,it is possible that plaintiffs burden at trial may ultimately be met with evidence other than precise,written documentation.for example,while could not produce documents proving her overtime work,she testified to certain triggering factors,such as occasional ice cream sales,dances,and occasions when parents were late to pick up their children that helped her recall when she worked overtime.the ice cream sales occurred two to four times a week and wesley would witness selling ice cream because she would come in to buy ice cream from her.pto meetings occurred every six weeks beginning in,and on the dates that pto meetings were held would be at school from the time school ended until after the pto meeting,which would be usually about to.testified that she only missed two pto meetings,and that the school had a calendar of pto meetings,which had created.furthermore,the board elicited from that numerous individuals,including the assistant principal,the school secretary,numerous,and her husband would be able to support her claim that she worked beyond her scheduled hours.we believe anderson demonstrates that plaintiffs may ultimately be permitted to show the amount and extent of their unpaid overtime as a matter of just and reasonable inference based on facts such as these.
thus,it is clear that the board was not entitled to summary judgment based on plaintiffs lack of documentation and inability to state with precision the number of uncompensated hours they worked and the days on which that work was performed.we believe that plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.see anderson,at.we also believe that there is no merit in the board contention that plaintiffs can not recover because any work was of such short duration or sporadic that it was negligible.the evidence presented in the declarations and deposition testimony in this case indicates that the amounts in question are not negligible therefore,mitchell adams,has no application here.
the board actual or constructive knowledge 
the board claims that even if unpaid hours can be shown,plaintiffs can not demonstrate that their supervisors knew that they were working overtime without pay.plaintiffs claims were viable if a reasonable jury could conclude from the evidence that the board had actual or constructive knowledge.
actual knowledge 
two plaintiffs testified that they worked overtime and notified their supervisors that they had not received pay.angela testified that her supervisor,wesley,who was the principal of the school,told her that she could not continue to be paid overtime,and would need to take comp time.this indicates that wesley was aware that was working overtime hours.however,even though wesley told that she would need to take comp time,when earned and tried to use hours of comp time,on at least one occasion wesley could or did not allow to take comp time testimony raises a genuine issue of material fact as to the board actual knowledge,because wesley was aware that had been told that she could not be paid overtime,and was aware that she had earned hours that she could not be compensated for with comp time see reeves int l,cir knowledge will generally be imputed to the offending employer.
clara patterson claims that she also worked for wesley.patterson deposition testimony revealed that patterson attended a meeting in which wesley stated that she could not approve overtime however,wesley did not say that employees should not work beyond their scheduled hours.although patterson does not specifically recall wesley telling her that she was required to work without pay,she stated that it was her understanding that when wesley asked her to stay late,it would be without pay.patterson recalls that she worked three or four saturdays to prepare paperwork for returning teachers,and on maybe all except one of those saturdays,wesley was also at the school.patterson states that she told wesley that she also brought work home with her.patterson testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact as to the board actual knowledge,because patterson supervisor told her that she could not be paid overtime,but observed her working beyond her scheduled hours.as a jury could reasonably conclude that wesley knew that patterson was working without pay,summary judgment as to patterson was improper.
in both cases,actual knowledge can be presumed and summary judgment was not appropriate.
constructive knowledge 
other plaintiffs testified in their depositions that although they could not be sure that the board had actual knowledge of their overtime work,circumstances should have alerted the board that they performed work beyond their scheduled hours without pay.these circumstances,they argue,provided the board with constructive knowledge.
an employer is said to have constructive knowledge of its employee overtime work when it has reason to believe that its employee is working beyond his shift.the employer knowledge is measured in accordance with his duty to inquire into the conditions prevailing in his business.gulf king shrimp wirtz,cir quoting people ex rel.price sheffield.
there is no violation of the flsa where the employee performs uncompensated work but deliberately prevents his or her employer from learning of it.forrester foodliner,cir.however,our predecessor court stated that when an employer actions squelch truthful reports of overtime worked,or where the employer encourages artificially low reporting,it can not disclaim knowledge.brennan motors acceptance,cir.
at summary judgment,it was the board burden to support the motion by reference to materials on file that demonstrated the absence of any genuine issue of material fact as to its knowledge.to that end,it referred the trial court to portions of some of plaintiffs depositions indicating that the board lacked actual or constructive knowledge.these deposition excerpts supported the board argument that some plaintiffs had not informed their supervisors of their overtime work,or had not told them that they had not recorded or been paid for hours that the supervisor may have known they worked beyond their scheduled hours.plaintiffs responded with specific references to testimony that tended to create a dispute of fact as to whether the board knew or should have known that plaintiffs were working without pay.we believe that summary judgment as to some plaintiffs was inappropriate,but affirm the grant of summary judgment as to others.
several plaintiffs testified that their supervisors were aware of their work beyond their scheduled hours.an issue of fact exists as to the board knowledge that these plaintiffs were performing work without compensation.alicia allen is one such plaintiff who testified that her supervisors knew that she had worked beyond her scheduled hours.she testified that bob donaldson,the transportation department director,clocked her out when he knew she was still working.she also testified that bernard kitchens,a route supervisor,knew she was working off the clock.
timothy brown testified that he recorded certain hours on his time sheets that patti allen removed from or changed on his time sheet.brown stated that he told donaldson that allen had altered his time sheets,and donaldson told him that he did have time and go back to patty.
wilbert jones testified that he worked without pay on several occasions,such as when his lunch break was interrupted and when he worked late.he stated that he told spies,his principal,that he was working late.
vera long testified that she had to supervise children on her lunch break and the secretary told her she needed to sign out regardless of whether she had to work during lunch.she stated that her supervisors knew she was working at lunch because they would be in the lunch room when she and the children were there.long also testified that she worked overtime when buses broke down or were late,and when she needed to attend meetings.
