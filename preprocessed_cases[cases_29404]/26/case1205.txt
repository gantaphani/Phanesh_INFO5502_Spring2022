background 
statutory framework of the idea 
the idea creates a federal grant program to assist state and local agencies in educating disabled children.see.to receive funds under the idea,states must provide disabled children with the opportunity to receive a free appropriate public education by offering each student special education and related services under an individualized education program iep.see a,a.to ensure children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to each iep,the idea requires states to establish,and abide by,certain measures.see a.among these measures is a requirement that if parents of a disabled child disagree with their local educational agency regarding the appropriateness of the child current iep,and informal review procedures have failed,the parents have the right to resolve the matter in an impartial due process hearing to be conducted by the agency.see f see also.moreover,following a final administrative determination,the parents retain the right to challenge the decision of the educational agency through a civil action brought in either state or federal court.see i.while such administrative and judicial review proceedings run their course,absent a contrary agreement by the parties,the child shall remain in the educational placement.see j the idea stay put provision see also.the idea,however,imposes no time limit in which parents must exercise their right to judicial review.see generally i.
factual background 
appellant is a boy who suffers from mild mental retardation,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,seizures,and chronic depression.as such,he qualifies for special education and related services under the idea.see generally.appellant receives his services through the burke county school district.
from through,appellant experienced repeated behavioral problems at school,including incidents of shoving and threatening fellow students and teachers.on december,appellant again pushed a teacher,who had found him wandering the halls and disrupting classes during his scheduled lunch period.in accordance with the idea,appellee assembled a manifestation determination team mdt and set a manifestation determination hearing for december.see k a.the mdt determined appellant behavior was unrelated to his disability the mdt finding was then referred to appellee disciplinary tribunal.based on the mdt finding,the tribunal expelled appellant on december.
five days after appellant expulsion,his mother filed a request for an administrative due process hearing under the idea to challenge the mdt procedures and ultimate finding.see k.during the hearing,appellant claimed he was not receiving the free appropriate public education mandated by the idea as a result of appellee actions.see a.he further claimed he should stay put in his iep until the appeals process was exhausted.see generally j.on january,an administrative law judge alj upheld all procedures and findings of the mdt.
on february,appellant filed an action in the superior court of burke county,georgia,challenging the alj decision.three months later,however,appellant filed a voluntary dismissal of his state court action.on august,nearly seven months after the alj final ruling,appellant filed the instant action in federal court.borrowing the statute of limitations applicable under the georgia administrative procedure act georgia apa,ann.b,the district court concluded appellant failed to timely seek judicial review.accordingly,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee.
ii.discussion 
statute of limitations 
when congress fails to specify a limitations period in federal legislation,courts must borrow the statute of limitations from the most analogous state statute,provided the borrowed limitations period is not inconsistent with underlying federal policies.see,oneida county oneida indian nation,d.accordingly,we must determine which georgia statute is most analogous to the idea,and ensure the applicable limitations period is not inconsistent with the idea objectives.
most analogous state statute 
this court must first decide whether a personal injury claim,advocated by appellant,or a request for judicial review under the georgia apa,applied by the district court,is most analogous to requests for judicial review under the idea.in making this determination,courts look to whether the scope of judicial proceedings available to a plaintiff under each state act is similar to the review available under the idea.livingston sch.dist.keenan,cir quoting dep t of educ.carl,cir.
both the georgia apa and the idea provide for judicial review of agency determinations under both statutes,the reviewing court acts in a manner,scrutinizing the underlying proceedings for procedural regularity and substantive validity.see,spiegler district of columbia,adler educ.dep t,cir.further,under both statutes,reviewing courts rely heavily on the administrative record.see ann.g i.although the idea permits the reviewing court to accept additional evidence at the request of a party,this fact does not significantly distinguish the nature of the proceedings from appellate review of agency decisions because,in both cases,the primary evidence relied upon is the administrative record itself.see bd.of educ.rowley,d.
additionally,both the georgia apa and the idea mandate some level of deference to the findings of an agency.under the georgia apa,an agency decision is scrutinized only for abuse of discretion.see ann.permitting reversal of agency decisions that are made in excess of the agency statutory authority based upon unlawful procedure affected by other error of law clearly erroneous on the whole record or arbitrary or capricious.similarly,under the idea,a district court is required to respect a state hearing officer findings when they are thoroughly and carefully made.see bd.of educ.rowley,at.at stating reviewing courts must give due weight to the administrative proceeding.the idea provision that a reviewing court base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence is,therefore,no invitation to substitute the court own notions of educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.id.
by contrast,an action for personal injury is an independent claim which does not involve review of administrative decisions.thus,such an action does not involve either review of a record assembled in underlying proceedings or any level of deference to administrative findings.see,livingston sch,at.a civil action under the idea challenging an administrative hearing officer education decision after a due process hearing,therefore,is more analogous to judicial review of an administrative appeal than to causes of action for personal injury.as a result,the georgia apa is the most analogous state statute.unless inconsistent with the policies underlying the idea,therefore,the georgia apa limitations period should be applied to appellant cause of action.
consistency with underlying federal policies 
the fundamental objective of the idea is to empower disabled children to reach their fullest potential by providing a free education tailored to meet their individual needs.see generally d.there is a split between the circuit
