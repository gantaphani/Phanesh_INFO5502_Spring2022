the issue in this insurance coverage dispute is whether a fund composed of local political subdivisions enjoys governmental immunity against a fund member school district coverage claim.in the suit underlying this appeal,fund member ben blanco consolidated independent school district ben bolt sued the texas political subdivisions joint fund the fund after the fund denied a claim for benefits under its policy.the fund asserted immunity in a plea to the jurisdiction,which the trial court denied.a divided court of appeals reversed,concluding that the fund is immune from suit.we agree that the fund possesses governmental immunity.however,after the court of appeals rendered its judgment,the legislature enacted a limited immunity waiver for breach of contract claims against governmental entities we conclude that the statutory waiver applies to this dispute.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.
background 
the texas interlocal cooperation act the act allows political subdivisions to contract with one another to more efficiently share resources and responsibilities.gov t code the purpose of this chapter is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of local governments by authorizing them to contract,to the greatest possible extent,with one another and with agencies of the state.id.under the act,a local government may contract with another local government to perform authorized governmental functions and services.id.local governments under the act include municipalities,special districts,counties,and other political subdivisions,as well as combinations of such entities.id.
local governmental entities formed the fund involved in this dispute by entering into an interlocal cooperation agreement to pool funds to provide casualty insurance to participants.the fund provides a risk pool and claim administration for its members.participants in the fund include eight counties,six municipalities,independent school districts,and various special districts and other political subdivisions.
ben bolt,a small school district in jim wells county,purchased an insurance policy from the fund for a coverage period between april and.in december of,ben bolt sustained extensive water and mold damage to one of its school facilities and submitted a claim to the fund.until that point ben bolt had paid,and the fund had accepted,all premiums due under the policy.the fund denied the claim on the basis that the alleged loss was not covered under ben bolt policy.ben bolt then filed a action seeking a determination that the loss was a covered occurrence under the insurance agreement terms,and any other further relief to which it might be entitled.in response,the fund asserted immunity in a plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss,which the trial court denied.the fund then filed an interlocutory appeal.civ.prac.a.the court of appeals held that,as a governmental entity,the fund is entitled to immunity from suit finding no legislative waiver of that immunity,the court of appeals reversed and dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction.
in its petition to this court,ben bolt contends the fund is not a governmental entity entitled to immunity.alternatively,ben bolt claims that any immunity the fund may possess derives from its member political subdivisions and can not be asserted against its source.and even if the fund may assert immunity against its members,ben bolt argues,that immunity has been waived in a number of ways first,recently enacted section of the local government code is a clear expression of legislative intent to waive governmental immunity from suit on contract claims.loc.gov t code second,the act contains an implied waiver of immunity from suit for governmental units that contract under its authority.gov t code and third,even absent a statutory waiver,the fund waived its immunity from suit by accepting payment of ben bolt premiums and inducing reliance.finally,ben bolt argues that the legislature waived governmental immunity for actions brought under the uniform declaratory judgments act udja.
the fund counters that it is a governmental entity existing under the legislature authority and thus enjoys immunity in its own right irrespective of its members.moreover,the fund argues that chapter is not a clear and unambiguous waiver of immunity because it is unclear whether that waiver applies to the fund insurance agreement with its members,some of which are excluded from the waiver.the fund also contends there is no implied waiver or waiver by conduct,and that the udja does not prevent the fund from asserting immunity here.we granted ben bolt petition for review to determine the nature and extent of the fund alleged immunity from suit.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
governmental immunity from suit defeats a trial court jurisdiction.dep t of transp.jones.whether a trial court has jurisdiction is a question of law subject to de novo review.see.natural res.conservation comm.because the issue in this case is whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to the fund assertion of immunity,our review is de novo.
sovereign and governmental immunity 
sovereign immunity protects the state,its agencies,and its officials from lawsuits for damages see tooke city of mexia,at serv.comm insulation,fed.sign.university.under this doctrine,the sovereign is immune from liability and also from lawsuits.see,at,at fed.sign,at.immunity from liability shields the state from judgments,at,at fed.sign,at.immunity from suit prohibits a suit against the state unless the legislature grants consent,at.by entering into a contract the state waives its immunity from liability but not its immunity from suit.id.thus,even if the state acknowledges liability on a claim,immunity from suit bars a remedy until the legislature consents to suit.taylor,at.
the state sovereign immunity extends to various divisions of state government,including agencies,boards,hospitals,and universities.tooke,at taylor,at.the appurtenant doctrine of governmental immunity similarly protects political subdivisions of the state,including counties,cities,and school districts.taylor,at see also harris county sykes.a political subdivision enjoys governmental immunity from suit to the extent that immunity has not been abrogated by the legislature.see,at.
it is clear that the fund in this case is composed of members which,like ben bolt,are themselves governmental units entitled to immunity.however,the fund asserts discrete status in its own right separate and apart from its members.if it is true,as the fund contends,that the fund itself enjoys immunity from suit,then the extent to which the fund might derive immunity from its members is immaterial.accordingly,we begin by examining the nature of the fund.
c.the fund 
chapter of the texas government code authorizes governmental unit s,which include local government s,to self insure.gov t code.the issuance of public securities or use of money for the purpose of funding self insurance is a public purpose of the governmental unit.id.chapter specifically provides that a governmental unit establishment and maintenance of a program is not a waiver of immunity.id.types of local governments able to under chapter include a municipality or other political subdivision of this state or a combination of political subdivisions,including a combination created under chapter.id.
chapter of the government code,known as the interlocal cooperation act,allows local governments to contract with each other to collectively perform certain governmental functions.id.a.the act defines the term local government to mean a county,municipality,special district,or other political subdivision of this state or another state or a combination of two or more political subdivisions.id.a,e.because the term local government includes a combination of political subdivisions,the fund itself would appear to enjoy status under the act further indication that the legislature intended such pooled entities to operate as distinct governmental units is found in the provisions of chapter,which allows local governments to,together with the provisions of chapter allowing local governments to pool resources for that purpose.
we have said that where the governing statutory authority demonstrates legislative intent to grant an entity the nature,purposes,and powers of an arm of the state government,that entity is a government unit unto itself.see harris county flood control dist.mann,holding statute creating district demonstrated legislative intent that the district be a state agency and a political entity distinct from the county,despite the identical boundaries of the district and county.a district with s uch powers of government and with the authority to exercise such rights,privileges and functions to achieve its purpose is considered a governmental unit.id.quoting.const.art.xvi b.in mann,the district had a governmental prevention,reclamation and conservation of public funding to carry out its mission.id.we reasoned that the nature,purposes and powers of the act creating the district showed legislative intent that this district shall exist and function as a governmental agency and a body politic and corporate,separate,independent,and distinct within itself.id.
similarly,chapter and the interlocal cooperation act imbue pools with nature,purposes,and powers reflecting the legislature intent that the fund exist as a discrete governmental unit.an interlocal contract may provide a governmental function that each contracting party is authorized to individually perform.gov t code c.the legislature has expressly authorized combinations of political subdivisions formed under the act to perform governmental functions and services.gov t code e,a.the act defines governmental functions and services to include any governmental functions in which the contracting parties are mutually interested.id.n.local governments clearly have an interest in guarding against risk,and the legislature has explicitly authorized combinations of political subdivisions created under the interlocal cooperation act to provide.gov t code.the legislature has also authorized these combinations to issue public securities and use available money to finance a pool,which is defined as a public purpose of the governmental unit.id,b.in sum,the legislature has determined to be a function of local governments,and we see no reason why legislatively approved pooling of resources to perform this function would diminish its governmental character.see op.att y no.at stating s is a function of local governments if the government does not have insurance.
many of our courts of appeals have considered pools,though composed of political subdivisions,to be distinct governmental entities apart from their membership.see,campbell.employers ins.ass n,dist,no writ citing with approval a texas court of appeals case that refers to a risk pool as a governmental entity to hold that a private company that contracted to provide services to the texas association of school boards fund was not entitled to governmental immunity tml intergovernmental employee benefits pool prudential ins.of,pet.denied holding an insurance pool bringing a declaratory judgment waived immunity from suit,necessarily implying possession of immunity in order to waive it milner city of leander,no pet.treating fund as governmental entity and concluding that the legislature did not waive its immunity campbell,at suggesting that school boards fund was a governmental entity,but immunity did not extend to private company providing services to the fund.workers comp.comm city of bridge city,writ denied holding that because municipalities risk pool derived its existence and powers from legislative enactments,it was subject to legislative control and supremacy to the same extent as other political subdivisions gab bus,moore,no writ intimating that municipalities risk pool was a governmental entity,but holding that immunity did not extend to private company that contracted with pool to adjust claims see also.mun.league intergovernmental risk pool.workers comp.comm n,noting that,in determining whether certain labor code provisions applied to the risk pool itself in addition to its member municipalities,the commission did not dispute that the risk pool itself qualifies as a political subdivision within the meaning of those provisions.
we conclude that the fund nature,purposes and powers demonstrate legislative intent that it exist as a distinct governmental entity entitled to assert immunity in its own right for the performance of a governmental function.with regard to that function,the fund enjoys the same governmental immunity as other political subdivisions.having concluded that the fund enjoys immunity in its own right,we need not decide whether the fund immunity is also derivative of its members.
waiver of immunity 
with the fund governmental immunity shield,ben bolt claims are barred absent a waiver of that immunity.it is the province of the legislature to consent to a suit against a governmental entity,at.we have consistently deferred to the legislature to waive sovereign immunity from suit,because this allows the legislature to protect its policymaking function,at.because immunity from suit protects the public coffers,the claims process is tied to the appropriations process,and the priorities that guide the latter should also inform the former.tooke,at.the exposure of governmental entities to liability may shift tax resources away from their intended purposes and toward defending lawsuits and paying judgments,thereby hampering government functions,at.for this reason,the legislature is better suited than the courts to weigh conflicting public policies associated with waiving immunity and subjecting the government to increased liability,the burden of which the public must bear.id.
ben bolt argues that section of the local government code provides a clear and unambiguous waiver of the fund immunity from suit for breach of its insurance agreement with ben bolt.that section provides 
a local governmental entity that is authorized by statute or the constitution to enter into a contract and that enters into a contract subject to this subchapter waives sovereign immunity to suit for the purpose of adjudicating a claim for breach of the contract,subject to the terms and conditions of this subchapter.
loc.gov t code the statute plain language allows for enforcement of contracts against local governmental entities by waiving their immunity from suit.the fund does not dispute that the statutory waiver language itself is clear and unambiguous.however,the fund argues that section provides only a limited waiver for some governmental units in certain circumstances,and does not apply to the fund or its insurance agreements.
first,the fund points out that section defines a c ontract subject to this subchapter subchapter i of chapter as a written contract stating the essential terms of the agreement for providing goods or services to the local governmental entity that is properly executed on behalf of the local governmental entity.id.emphasis added.the fund argues that its insurance contract with ben bolt is not a c ontract subject to this subchapter because,under the policy,no goods or services are provided to the fund rather,the fund provides insurance to its contracting members in exchange for payments.consequently,the fund contends,the insurance agreement is not subject to the statutory waiver.
it is true that ben bolt is a consumer of insurance that the fund offers.but the relationship between the fund and its members differs from the ordinary relationship.as the fund has acknowledged,its members elect a governing board,and a board subcommittee resolves claims disputes.to that extent,at least,the fund members provide services to the fund.moreover,the statute legislative history indicates that,by enacting section,the legislature intended to loosen the immunity bar so that all local governmental entities that have been given or are given the statutory authority to enter into contracts shall not be immune from suits arising from those contracts.house comm.on civil practices,bill analysis,emphasis added.there is no indication that the legislature intended to exclude fund agreements from enforcement.while the mere act of does not itself constitute a waiver o
