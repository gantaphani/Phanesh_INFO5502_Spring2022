a donor contributed million to establish an endowed chair at the ucla school of medicine,which ucla accepted along with the conditions imposed by the donor.the primary question on this appeal is whether the agreement created a contract subject to a condition subsequent or a charitable trust,the answer to which supposedly determines whether the donor has standing to sue ucla and the regents of the university of california to enforce the terms of the gift.we find there is a contract subject to a condition subsequent,not a charitable trust,and also find that,in either event,the donor has standing to pursue this action.because the trial court reached a contrary result,we reverse.
in july,the research and education foundation a public benefit corporation gave the ucla foundation a fully qualified public charity a contribution of million to establish an endowed chair,the julien hoffman,chair in cardiothoracic surgery.by the terms of the parties agreement which was signed by both research and the ucla foundation,the fund thereby created must be used by chair holders who meet specified criteria to support basic science research activities that may have the potential for clinical applications.annual financial accounts must be provided to research,along with a brief report of the work accomplished,both in perpetuity.in this regard,the writing provides 
it is research wish that the hoffman chair exist in perpetuity.research understands,however,that unforeseen circumstances may alter the academic plan of the university or remove the subject area from the campus academic plan.in such circumstances,if the cardiothoracic surgery program shall cease to exist at ucla,or in the event that ucla does not meet the terms and conditions of this agreement,any and all funds shall be transferred to support an endowed chair in cardiothoracic surgery,on the same terms and conditions as herein set forth,in the division of cardiothoracic surgery in the department of surgery at the university of california,san francisco,school of medicine.in the event that the cardiothoracic surgery program shall cease to exist in the department of surgery at the university of california,san francisco,school of medicine,any and all funds shall be transferred by the president of the university of california to another university within the university of california system to support an endowed chair in cardiothoracic surgery on the same terms and conditions as herein set forth.in the event that the cardiothoracic surgery program shall cease to exist within the university of california system,the president of the university of california is authorized to redesignate the purpose of the chair fund,taking into consideration research expressed wishes regarding the designated purpose described in this document.emphasis added.
the chair was funded as promised.
in october,research sued the ucla foundation and the regents of the university of california for specific performance of the agreement,declaratory relief,and breach of contract,alleging that the ucla foundation and the regents had failed to employ personnel meeting the criteria of the chair failed to account to research offered the chair to individuals and,over the objection of research and the attorney general of the state of california,elected an unqualified person to the chair withdrawn unearned fees from the chair fund and refused to deliver the chair fund to the department of surgery at the university of california,san francisco,school of medicine.
in its first amended complaint,research alleges that it through its own personnel and through the attorney general office brought these alleged violations to the attention of the appropriate people at ucla and demanded performance in accordance with the terms of the gift,but that no response was forthcoming.the parties agreement is an exhibit to the complaint.
the ucla foundation and the regents answered,alleging among other things that research had created a charitable trust which only the attorney general had standing to enforce,then moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that research lacked standing to prosecute this action.over research opposition,the motion was granted,and this appeal is from the judgment thereafter entered.
discussion 
research contends it has standing to bring this action,and that the motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been denied.we agree.
a charitable trust is defined as a fiduciary relationship with respect to property arising as a result of a manifestation of an intention to create it,and subjecting the person by whom the property is held to equitable duties to deal with the property for a charitable purpose.rest d trusts.hardman feinstein d.see also.to create a charitable trust,there must be a proper manifestation by the settlor of an intention to create a trust,a trust res,and a charitable purpose.city of palm springs living desert reserve th,d.
but a gift may have a charitable purpose and yet not constitute a charitable trust.thus,the owner of property may,rather than create a trust,transfer it to another on the condition that if the latter should fail to perform a specified act,the transferee interest shall be forfeited either to the transferor or to a designated third party.citation.in such a case the interest of the transferee is subject to a condition subsequent and is not held in trust.rest d trusts,supra,com.a.city of palm springs living desert reserve,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted walton city of red bluff th,d.
the gifts at issue in the red bluff and palm springs cases a public library and a desert wildlife preserve were of land,not money,but were as here for charitable purposes and are otherwise indistinguishable from our case.as the court explained in city of palm springs living desert reserve,supra,th at pages,d,a gift of property in fee subject to a condition subsequent differs from a gift of that same property in trust in at least two ways.first,the transferee of a conditional gift receives both legal and equitable title to the property.unless and until the transferee breaches the conditions imposed by the transferor,he or she is in the same position as an owner in fee simple absolute.citation.second,the transferee has no enforceable duties.the breach of condition may result in the termination of the transferee interest,but it does not subject the transferee to actions for damages or to enforce the condition.citation.
whether a trust or a condition is created depends upon the manifested intention of the transferor the mere fact that the word condition is used does not necessarily indicate that a condition and not a trust is intended.citation.trusts can be created by words of condition.citation.property given upon condition that it be applied to certain charitable purposes is especially likely to be construed as having been given in a charitable trust.citation.the question in each case is whether the donor intended to provide that if the property were not used for the designated charitable purposes it should revert either to the donor estate or to a contingent donee,or the donor intended to impose an enforceable obligation on the donees to devote it to those purposes.citation.
courts favor the construction of a gift as a trust over a conditional gift for several reasons.because forfeiture is a harsh remedy citation,any ambiguity is resolved against it citation.moreover,the transferor objective is to use the transferee to confer a benefit upon the public.to ensure that the benefit is conferred as intended,the transferor ordinarily wants the intended beneficiary to be able to enforce that intent.because the only remedy for the breach of a condition is a forfeiture,a condition is not a very effective method of accomplishing those goals.for both of those reasons,courts will generally construe a conveyance as one upon trust rather than upon condition.citation.city of palm springs living desert reserve,supra,th at,d.
