the securities and exchange commission imposed sanctions on ira weiss after finding that he had violated securities laws.at the time of the violations,weiss was serving as bond counsel for a school district.the issue in weiss petition for judicial review is whether substantial evidence supports the sec decision.
the internal revenue code excludes interest on local government bonds from the gross income of bond purchasers.a.this federal tax exemption makes it possible to sell municipal bonds at a lower interest rate than other bonds.it also presents issuers with arbitrage opportunities.a local government entity might be tempted to issue bonds with an interest rate of,say,four percent,and then invest the proceeds in treasury bonds earning five percent.if the entity invests the proceeds in appropriately structured derivatives,such as treasury strips,it can earn an instant,profit on the transaction.
statutory and regulatory restrictions are designed to minimize the arbitrage benefits from investing gross proceeds of bonds in higher yielding investments and to remove the arbitrage incentives to issue bonds earlier than is otherwise reasonably necessary to accomplish the governmental purposes for which the bonds were issued.a.an issuer failure to abide by the restrictions renders the bonds arbitrage bonds,the interest on which is not.b.
although investing bond proceeds in higher yielding investments normally causes the bonds to become arbitrage bonds,treasury department regulations contain an exception.up to million of bonds may remain and the issuer may retain any profits earned during a temporary period after the issue date if the issuer reasonably expects to satisfy three tests the expenditure test,the time test,and the due diligence test.e.the expenditure test requires the issuer to spend at least percent of the bond proceeds on capital projects within three years.id.e a.the time test requires that the issuer incur within months of the issue date a substantial binding obligation to spend at least percent of the bond proceeds on capital projects.id.e b.the due diligence test requires that completion of the capital projects and the allocation of the funds to expenditures proceed with due diligence.id.e c.
because the treasury regulations look to whether the issuer reasonably expected to satisfy the three tests as of the issue date,id.b,not to whether it actually satisfied them later,there is potential for abuse.to assuage the concerns of investors,issuers retain bond counsel to provide an unqualified legal opinion that the interest on the bonds will be exempt from federal taxation.according to the national association of bond lawyers,the purpose of an unqualified bond opinion is to assure investors that there is no reasonable risk of taxability that the investors should take into account in making an investment decision,except for risks disclosed in the opinion.ass of bond lawyers,statement concerning standard applied in rendering the federal income tax portion of bond opinions nabl statement.because investors rely so heavily on unqualified bond opinions,bond counsel must apply a high standard of professional conduct.id.at.in particular,a bond opinion should be based upon a reasonably sufficient examination of material legal and factual sources and reasonable certainty as to the subjects addressed therein.id.at.both parties in this case agree that the association has articulated the applicable standard for rendering unqualified bond opinions.
the neshannock township school district of lawrence county,pennsylvania,operates an elementary school and a junior and senior high school.in early,the school district recognized that the elementary school building was in need of substantial renovations and repairs.the school board also considered building a separate middle school for students in grades six through eight.by february,the board had compiled a wish list of projects,but there was no consensus among board members about which projects should be undertaken.in april,in response to the concerns of some residents about the middle school concept,the board announced that it would hold public hearings before making any final decisions on projects.
in may,andrew shupe ii read in a newspaper that the school district was contemplating some capital projects.shupe was president of quaestor municipal group,an investment banking firm in the business of arranging municipal financings.shupe called ronald mento,the superintendent of the school district,and arranged to make a presentation before the board to propose a bond transaction.
shupe also called his friend ira weiss,a pittsburgh attorney,to ask if weiss would be interested in acting as bond counsel and writing the bond opinion.weiss had worked with shupe on about twenty bond deals prior to the neshannock transaction.shupe offered weiss the deal,but also told weiss that he could get it done elsewhere if weiss was comfortable writing the opinion.weiss called superintendent mento to find out what capital projects the school district was planning.mento told weiss that the school district needed to do some smaller projects and was committed to doing a larger project,renovation of the high school.after this conversation,weiss told shupe that he felt comfortable writ ing the opinion.
on may,shupe and weiss attended a board meeting at which shupe proposed that the school district issue million in bonds.shupe distributed a written proposal stating in current market conditions,school districts have and are borrowing in advance of projects just to invest the proceeds for three years and legally keep the positive investment earnings.this arbitrage concept was the main topic of conversation during shupe presentation.shupe written refers to bonds as notes illustrated the concept as follows 
a school district borrows million for three years on a basis and pays an annual interest rate of.
the school district invests the net proceeds from the note issue in treasury securities over the same period and the securities yield.
the excess earnings,less any costs of issuance,will be available to the school district on the day of closing the note issue.

weiss advised the board that this concept was exactly the case.weiss told the school board that they had to have projects they had to reasonably expect to proceed with them and do them within three years.weiss said that if this was not the case,then he should be there.weiss never explained with any specificity two of the three time test and the due diligence treasury regulations require issuers to have a reasonable expectation of satisfying.according to richard flannery,the school district lawyer,if weiss had mentioned the time test,it would have raised a lot of flags because of concerns that the board had not reached any agreement about capital projects.
according to board member gina hennon,others attending the meeting expressed incredulity and skepticism about the arbitrage opportunity and wondered whether it was too good to be true.weiss responded,absolutely,it was legal it was an opportunity not to be missed.one of the board members asked about the potential ramifications if the school district failed to spend the bond proceeds.hennon recalls being concerned because she was not ready to commit to a building project and did want to tacitly be voting for a building project that she was not ready to vote for.weiss advised the board that there would be no problem so long as you intend to do the projects.according to harry flannery,the board president,we were advised that we just needed to have the intent to do the projects even if we did follow through with the projects.weiss gave the impression that there was no need to proceed and that the projects did even have to occur.
according to weiss,board members discussed various projects at the meeting and all nodded they were going to do them.weiss asked whether there was an architect on board for the projects,and there were nods of assent that there was an architect in place.in fact,although the school district had a longstanding relationship with eckles architecture and had received a proposal for a constru
