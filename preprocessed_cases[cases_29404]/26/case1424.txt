the salinas city elementary school district,its superintendent,and its governing board collectively,the district seek review of an order requiring them to pay attorney fees under code of civil procedure section based on the district improper layoff of three district employees,the successful petitioners in the underlying mandamus proceeding on appeal,the district contends that no reasonable basis exists for recovery of attorney fees under this statute.we agree that the fee award is not supported by the record or the purposes and policies of the private attorney general doctrine.accordingly,we will modify the judgment to delete these fees from the amount awarded to petitioners.
background 
petitioners are three school psychologists who were employed by the district.in early,in the face of decreasing student attendance and a revenue shortfall,the governing board of the district adopted a resolution reducing certain services and terminating the employment of certain certificated employees.the superintendent thereafter sent a notice of layoff to certificated employees,including petitioners,pursuant to education code section.
respondents requested a hearing,which took place in april before an administrative law judge alj pursuant to education code section,subdivision c.respondents contended that the layoff was procedurally defective and that the district had improperly deviated from the seniority list to retain certain psychologists with advanced spanish l anguage proficiency skills.the alj,however,rejected petitioners arguments,finding insufficient evidence that they were more skilled in the spanish language than the psychologists the district had decided to retain.the governing board adopted the proposed decision of the alj,effective june.
petitioners then sought a peremptory writ of mandate in superior court.in their amended petition they challenged the alj decision with respect to several points,including the finding that they lacked sufficient spanish language skills to allow the district to lay them off before less senior psychologists.
the superior court agreed with petitioners that the district had improperly deviated from seniority order in implementing the layoff.petitioners,the court found,were all bilingual.the district thus had failed to demonstrate that the petitioners did not have the necessary bilingual skills.furthermore,the district failed to produce evidence that there exis t any objective criteria for determining language skill levels for school psychologists,such as petitioners.the court directed the district not only to set aside the alj decision and reinstate petitioners,but also to pay them damages for past and future lost wages,the value of lost benefits,and other damages pursuant to code of civil procedure section as well as costs and attorney fees.
in the ensuing motion for damages and attorney fees,petitioners asserted that they were entitled to attorney fees under education code section and under code of civil procedure section addressing the latter statute,petitioners asserted that whenever particular school employees enforce the specific provisions of the education code and force the district to comply with that,it benefits every school employee in the state whom sic is entitled to that protection.so it is a very large group of people.petitioners further argued that the financial burden of the litigation was out of proportion to the damages they were asserting.in response,the district maintained that petitioners had not satisfied all the prerequisites for recovery of attorney fees under section,particularly the necessity and burden of private enforcement in relation to the petitioners individual interests in the litigation.
after considering the written and oral arguments of the parties,the superior court ruled that petitioners were not entitled to attorney fees under the education code statutes pertaining to layoff,particularly sections and.they did,however,meet the requirements for such fees under section.accordingly,on may,the court entered judgment awarding damages to two of the petitioners and costs and attorney fees to all three.
discussion 
section permits an award of attorney fees to a successful party in an action that has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
the statute,a codification of the private attorney general doctrine,recognizes that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills see also bell vista unified school dist.th,d private attorney general doctrine is designed to encourage private enforcement of important public rights and to ensure aggrieved citizens have access to the judicial process where statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.accordingly,private attorney general fees may be awarded when the plaintiff action served to vindicate an important public right conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons and imposed a financial burden on plaintiffs which was out of proportion to their individual stake in the matter.baggett gates cal d,press lucky stores,cal d,
trial court decisions on requests under section have traditionally been reviewed deferentially and upheld absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.see,baggett gates,supra,cal d at,galante vineyards monterey peninsula water management dist.th,d.our supreme court recently clarified,however,that the proper standard of review depends on the extent to which there were issues of fact below.if the issue is whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied,this may be a mixed question of law and fact and,if factual questions predominate,may warrant a deferential standard of review.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,d.if,on the other hand,the underlying facts are largely undisputed and the issue calls for statutory construction,it is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.id.at,d.
the application of section in this case involves mixed questions of law and fact.but even giving all possible deference to the superior court exercise of discretion and drawing reasonable inferences in favor of its ruling,we can not uphold the judgment.
important right 
the first prong of the section test for private attorney general fees requires a determination of the strength or societal importance of the right involved.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.that right may be constitutional or statutory,but it must be an important right affecting the public interest it can not involve trivial or peripheral public policies.ryan california interscholastic federation th,d.where,as here,the right vindicated is conferred by statute,courts should generally realistically assess the significance of that right in terms of its relationship to the achievement of fundamental legislative goals.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
