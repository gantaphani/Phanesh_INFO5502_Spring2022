discussion 
a.the statutes governing late claims by minors 
as a general rule,a plaintiff must present a public entity with a timely written claim for damages before filing suit against it.shirk vista unified school dist.cal th,shirk.if a complaint does not allege facts showing that a claim was timely made,or that compliance with the claims statutes is excused,it is subject to demurrer.id.at.at issue here are the statutes governing relief from failure to present a timely claim on behalf of a minor.
section,subdivision b section b states that a public entity shall grant a late claim application if t he person who sustained the alleged injury was a minor during all of the time for the presentation of the claim.b.a minor is entitled to relief whether or not the minor parents or counsel acted diligently,so long as the application is made within the year after the cause of action accrued.hernandez,supra,cal d at see rousseau city of san carlos d.as noted,if the entity fails or refuses to act on a late claim application,it shall be deemed to have been denied on the day after it is presented.c.principal contention is that the terms of section b,which required the district to grant his application,supersede the deemed to have been denied terms of section c.he argues that the two subdivisions are irreconcilable,and the specific terms of subdivision b must be given precedence over the general default provisions of subdivision c.the premise is faulty.these provisions are readily reconciled.
a minor is ordinarily entitled to relief upon a timely application under section b.we do not suggest it would be proper for an entity to routinely ignore late claim applications and resort to the deemed denied provision of section c as a default procedure.such applications should normally be reviewed and acted upon.but an entity may fail or refuse to act for a variety of reasons.ibid.the timeliness of the application may be questionable due to uncertainty over when the cause of action accrued.the applicant status as a minor during the relevant period may be disputable.the entity may have been unable to complete its investigation within the allotted time the entity might also simply fail to act on an application through inadvertence.in all circumstances,a late claim application is deemed denied after days,even though section b would entitle the minor to relief if the application had merit.by placing this limitation on the entity time to act,the legislature ensured that applications would not languish.
the procedure for determining the merit of a late claim application after days of entity inaction is provided in section b.the applicant has six months to seek relief in court after the application to the entity is denied or deemed to be denied,italics added.the period operates as a statute of limitations.it is mandatory,not discretionary.oakdale joint unified school dist.th,citing cases.section,subdivision c section c,in terms parallel to those of section b,states that the court shall grant the petition if t he person who sustained the alleged injury was a minor during all of the time for the presentation of the claim.c.thus,the statutory scheme operates to keep the process moving,and allows an action to go forward if a court determines that a minor late claim application is meritorious.
insists there was no need for him to seek relief in court under section,because the district was required to grant his application.presumes his application was sufficient,but his counsel failed to make a record to support that conclusion.only allegations are before us.while section b says that an entity shall grant a minor late claim application,the legislature also contemplated that the entity might fail or refuse to act c.the record does not indicate the reason for the district inaction here.in any case,it was responsibility to seek relief in court from the district deemed denial of his late claim application,even if the district was required to grant it.the court could readily have determined the merits of a timely application.
section c directly addresses circumstances.the legislature would not have created a specific but superfluous provision for relief from the deemed denial of a minor late claim application.suggests the statute was intended to allow an applicant to seek a remedy based on minority for the first time in court,after presenting some other ground for relief in an application to the entity he offers nothing in the way of legislative history to support this suggestion,and its logic is difficult to discern.section c gave a clear avenue to challenge the denial of his application.his counsel simply failed to take advantage of it.
correctly notes that the statutes before us are liberally construed in favor of minors.s ections and indicat e that the legislature intended to accord special solicitude to the claims of injured minors hernandez,supra,cal d at.however,the legislature solicitude is manifested in a specific statutory framework.the deemed denied provisions of section c are part of that framework,and can not be construed away.interpretation does not square with the plain meaning of the statute.he would read into section b a provision for the deemed grant of a minor late claim application when the entity fails to act,but section c unambiguously provides for a deemed denial.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.shirk,supra,cal th at.construction would permit a plaintiff to sue a public entity without presenting either a timely claim or a timely petition for relief under section,based on assertions that have neither been accepted by the entity nor proven in court.the statutes do not permit such a procedural shortcut.we note that the minor in hernandez,unlike,sought timely relief under section from the denial of his late claim application.hernandez,at.
in the trial court did not rely on,supra,th,which would have supported his position.in the plaintiff applied to present a late claim based on her minority during the claims period.the entity expressly rejected the application.five months later the plaintiff sued.after another two months,she filed a petition under section.the trial court denied the petition because more than six months had elapsed after the late claim application was rejected,at.the court of appeal reversed,reasoning that the claim presentation requirement was satisfied by the plaintiff attachment
