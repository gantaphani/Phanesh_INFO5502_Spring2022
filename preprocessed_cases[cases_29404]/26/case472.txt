murphy describes a uniform procedure for receiving the loans he appeared at the financial aid office,discussed his needs,and signed a promissory note.the lender disbursed the loan to the school,which withheld tuition and expenses and gave murphy the remainder for discretionary spending.murphy used the money to purchase a car,housing,and food and to pay fraternity dues and other ordinary living expenses.

murphy filed and obtained a consumer chapter discharge,then filed an adversary proceeding against pheaa and ecmc,alleging that the portion of the student loans spent on living expenses was dischargeable.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of pheaa and ecmc.
the bankruptcy code prevents former students from discharging educational loans in bankruptcy.a.courts have divided over whether students who use a portion of their student loans for room,board,and living expenses can discharge that portion of the debt in bankruptcy.some courts have held that when the lender makes the loan available for educational purposes,no part of the loan can be discharged in bankruptcy,regardless of the actual use other courts have held that when the student spends the money on noneducational items and services,that portion can be discharged we conclude that the text of the bankruptcy code,the federal family education loan program ffelp,and murphy promissory notes support nondischargeability.in other words,it is the purpose,not the use,of the loan that controls.treating ffelp guaranteed loans uniformly,regardless of actual use,is true to the text and will prevent recent graduates from reneging on manageable debts and will preserve the solvency of the student loan system.
we review the bankruptcy and district court interpretation of a de novo that section explains that a discharge does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an education benefit scholarship or stipend,unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.
a.the section exempts educational loan s made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit.the plain language suggests two adjective educational and the requirement that a governmental or nonprofit body make or guarantee the loan.
at first cut,pheea and ecmc loans satisfy these two limits.pheea and ecmc made the loans to murphy pursuant to a federal statute that provides for educational loans the government also insured the loans against murphy default.
murphy insists,however,that we should read another limit into a.he contends that students may discharge the portion of their educational loans not spent or tuition or books.he points to cases holding that t he test for determining whether a loan is a student loan is whether the proceeds of the loan were used for educational purposes,in re ealy,at citations omitted.none of these cases considers a loan made pursuant to a federal student loan statute,but murphy would have us extend their reasoning.he variously argues that the word educational or phrase educational benefit permits students to discharge the portion of student loan proceeds spent on living or social expenses.
the textual hook for murphy argument is puzzling he reads too much into the adjective educational.section a does not expressly state that only loans used for tuition are nondischargeable.nor does it define educational loans as excluding living or social expenses.barth.higher educ.in re barth,the language of section a does not refer to whether the debtor or anyone else derived educational benefits.loans for room and board facilitate an education and meet expenses incidental to attending school 
in the alternative,murphy argues that the phrase educational benefit modifies both overpayment and loan.he infers that the resulting phrase educational benefit loan requires not only that the lender intend that the funds go towards educational purposes but also that the borrower spend the funds on tuition or books.for three reasons,murphy interpretation is strained,at best.
first,the word educational,rather than educational benefit,modifies loan.when congress amended a in,it replaced educational loan with educational benefit overpayment or loan.courts have interpreted the phrase educational benefit overpayment to include a category of governmental programs that pay students for the anticipated cost of future tuition after the amendments,courts continued to examine loans to determine whether they were educational loans no court has suggested that the word benefit should reduce the scope of covered loans.
additionally,a second use of the word educational benefit before stipend creates a serious problem for murphy interpretation.the section employs a parallel structure when describing another type of nondischargeable debt as arising from an education benefit scholarship or stipend.
stipend is defined in part as a regular allowance paid to defray living expenses esp.a sum paid to a student under the terms of a fellowship or scholarship.webster third new international dictionary at ed if educational benefit modifies both scholarship and stipend,then murphy interpretation of the phrase educational benefit would eliminate a core meaning of the word stipend.if the second educational benefit modifies only the word scholarship and not the word stipend,then it is difficult to understand why the second invocation of educational benefit should have more limited scope than does the first.
in other words,why would congress have placed the phrase educational benefit before two separate series of items in the same paragraph and intended for it to modify different elements in each series the inclusion of the word stipend proves either that educational benefit includes living expenses or that it describes only the type of overpayment and not the type of loan.
finally,even if we were to interpret a to require an educational benefit loan,murphy does not explain why that phrase requires us to look to use rather than purpose.all stafford loans are intended to convey educational benefits,and a grant of living expenses enables a student to attend school,which certainly has educational benefits.we now turn to the ffelp to examine the unique features of loans made pursuant to that federal statute.
the ffelp includes living expenses in its loans to students for educational purposes.first,the ffelp contemplates that students can use federal loans to finance a education.the statute distinguishes between students who take heavier course loads
