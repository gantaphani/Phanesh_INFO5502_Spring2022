in the present case,this court is presented with the question of whether the texas education agency tea neutrality policy constitutes an establishment of religion,in violation of the first amendment establishment clause.because we find no evidence to support the conclusion that the principal or primary effect of tea policy is one that either advances or inhibits religion,we conclude that the policy does not violate the establishment clause.as such,we affirm the decision of the district court.
facts and procedural background 
this case arises out of tea decision to terminate plaintiff christina castillo comer comer after she violated tea neutrality policy requiring staff to remain neutral and refrain from expressing any opinions on any curricular matter subject to the texas state board of education board jurisdiction.
the board and tea are independent state actors,with distinct but overlapping responsibilities for administering public education in texas.the board is statutorily tasked with establish ing curriculum and graduation requirements and determining which textbooks shall be purchased by the state for school use.c.tea is led by the commissioner of education in this case,defendant robert scott,who is appointed by the governor subject to senate confirmation.id.
because the board has no staff of its own,the commissioner provides tea staff that assist the board with the administrative,procedural,and clerical tasks necessary to develop the curriculum and specific requirements for graduation.id.b.tea role during the curriculum development process is to facilitate the curriculum review meetings,provide resources for the board advisors,and to accurately draft and neutrally compile all of the recommendations to the board and the board resulting decisions.
as a result of the function tea serves in relation to the board,tea staff are directed not to advocate a particular position on curriculum issues under deliberation,or participate in any way that could compromise the agency ability to fairly and accurately implement the policy choices made by the board.thus the record reflects,and comer does not dispute,that tea maintains a neutrality policy.in accordance with this neutrality policy,tea staff can describe the contents of board policy to others in neutral terms,if their jobs call for it,but they may not express opinions on the wisdom of any particular policy option in their capacity as tea employees.the record also reflects that the neutrality policy has been enforced across a variety of different curriculum issues subject to decision by the board.
comer was employed as tea director of science for the curriculum division from may to november.as a part of her duties as director of science,comer directed the kindergarten through twelfth grade science program in texas public schools.more specifically,comer was charged with providing guidance concerning the state curriculum and support and guidance regarding the board texas essential knowledge and skills teks compliance.on october,comer received an email from glenn branch branch email,addressed to her tea account,advising her about an upcoming event in austin entitled inside creationism trojan horse.the email explained that the featured speaker would give a presentation critical of teaching creationism in public schools.comer responded to the email by promising to help get the word out,and on that same day,comer forwarded the branch email from her tea email account to science teachers in the austin area and leaders of science teacher organizations.
comer direct supervisor,monica martinez,determined that forwarding the branch email violated tea neutrality policy,in addition to a directive martinez had previously issued to comer based on her past misconduct.martinez previous directive to comer had prohibited comer from communicating with anyone outside tea in any way that could imply endorsement of a position on any curriculum issue that may be considered by the board thus,on november,in response to comer act of forwarding the branch email,martinez drafted a memorandum recommending comer termination.after receiving this memorandum,comer was told to resign or be fired.the next day she resigned.
on june,comer filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court,western district of texas,asserting two claims under the first amendment establishment clause as well as one claim under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.in her complaint,comer averred that tea termination of her employment violated her due process rights.additionally,she asserted that tea neutrality policy violates the establishment clause because it has the effect of endorsing religion.according to comer,terminating her employment deprived her of her right to carry out her duties free of a state policy that has the effect of promoting religion.
both sides filed motions for summary judgment.the district court heard oral argument on the motions on december,and on march,the court issued its order and judgment dismissing all of comer claims.specifically as to comer establishment clause claims,the district court found that comer provide d no proof raising an issue of material fact regarding whether tea neutrality policy has a primary effect of advancing or endorsing religion.
