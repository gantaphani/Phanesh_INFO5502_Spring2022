jamel whatley and his grandmother and guardian,esther williams,appeal the district court denial of their motion for attorneys fees in excess of the limits or caps imposed by congress for actions against the district of columbia district under the individuals with disabilities education act,et.idea.in the district appropriations acts of,and,congress capped attorneys fees the district could pay parties who prevailed against it in judicial and administrative idea actions.in of the appropriations act of,congress extended the application of those caps indefinitely,mandating that no subsequent appropriations act may fund attorneys fees above the caps for actions brought or work completed during the previously capped fiscal years.
appellants argue that despite its plain language,did not amend idea,because it was included in an appropriations act.in addition,even if congress intended to suspend the courts ability to award such fees indefinitely,appellants contend that should be construed narrowly so as to avoid potential constitutional infirmities.according to appellants,if is read to extend beyond fiscal year fy,it would unconstitutionally bind future congresses and violate the separation of powers doctrine by encroaching on the exclusive domain of the judiciary.
the district court disagreed with appellants,finding that unambiguously amended idea and that no serious constitutional issues were at stake.see whatley district of columbia,d,armstrong vance,d.in the district court view,undeniably limited the award of certain attorneys fees indefinitely for actions under idea.we affirm.
the language of makes it perfectly clear that congress intended to limit indefinitely the award of fees for work performed on actions brought under idea from to.although there is a very strong presumption that appropriations acts do not substantively change existing law,see calloway district of columbia,quoting constr.trades dep t,martin,that presumption may be overcome,as it has been here.we also find,in agreement with the district court,that raises no constitutional issues.
background 
congressional fee caps 
in,congress expressed its dismay over the growth in legal expenses and litigation associated with special education in the district of columbia,at.due to the proliferation of suits brought against the district under idea,congress believed that the district sizeable annual legal bills began usurping resources from education to pay attorney fees.id.in an effort to address this issue,the house committee on appropriations added a rider to the appropriations act of which was intended to limit the district ability to pay opposing parties attorneys fees for the fiscal year fy.this rider stated 
none of the funds contained in this act may be made available to pay the fees of an attorney who represents a party who prevails in an action,including an administrative proceeding,brought against the district of columbia public schools under the individuals with disabilities education act et if 
the hourly rate of compensation of the attorney exceeds or 
the maximum amount of compensation of the attorney exceeds,except that compensation and reimbursement in excess of such maximum may be approved for extended or complex representation in accordance with section c,district of columbia code.
section of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of,stat.this rider was enacted by congress in.congress enacted similar provisions in and for the fiscal years of and,respectively.see section of the district of columbia appropriations act of,stat,section of the district of columbia appropriations act of,stat.
in early,a group of disabled students and their parents challenged cap on attorneys fees.they argued that violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment and that it was preempted by idea.they also sought a declaratory ruling that limited only the district ability to pay attorneys fees,not the courts authority to award them.in calloway district of columbia,this court rejected the group constitutional and preemption claims,but agreed that limits only district authority to pay fees from fy appropriations,not court authority to award fees under idea.at.in so finding,the court noted that there is a very strong presumption that appropriations acts do not amend substantive law,and that did not unambiguously express an intent to limit court authority to award fees under idea.id.
in direct response to calloway,congress sought to fortify its regime in the appropriations act of appropriations act.rather than simply incorporating another fee cap,congress mandated 
notwithstanding,or any other law,none of the funds appropriated under this act,or in appropriations acts for subsequent fiscal years,may be made available to pay attorneys fees accrued prior to the effective date of this act that exceeds a cap imposed on attorneys fees by prior appropriations acts that were in effect during the fiscal year when the work was performed,or when payment was requested for work previously performed,in an action or proceeding brought against the district of columbia public schools under the individuals with disabilities education act et.

jamel whatley the district of columbia public schools 
in,esther williams became increasingly concerned about her grandson jamel lack of progress at school.he was in the process of repeating first grade,although the public schools dcps had not undertaken a formal evaluation of his academic development.on february,williams filed a form,which triggers dcps evaluation and possible placement of students that may have special academic needs.dcps thereafter began an assessment of jamel that lasted approximately two years.as a result of this delay,on february,williams requested that the dcps student hearing office conduct a due process hearing in accordance with idea.see f.
