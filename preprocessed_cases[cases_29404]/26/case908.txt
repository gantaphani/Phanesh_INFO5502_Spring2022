hirchag made several recommendations for goals,modifications,or accommodations based on weaknesses in manual dexterity,registration and sensitivity,remembering content during written language assignments,spelling,and desk organization,but she did not recommend whether any direct ot services were needed.the iep,informed by the ot assessment,recommended a one collaboration between an ot therapist and teacher to evaluate strategies for going forward,as well as two minute individual ot consults per year.
hirchag presented the ot assessment at a january,iep meeting,and responded that it was stupid.also expressed shock that the ot assessment concluded that was able to appropriately cut a shape from paper,and said that at home,holds scissors incorrectly.

on february,the district denied the request for an independent educational evaluation at public expense.the district filed its complaint initiating a due process hearing before an administrative law judge alj on march,
the due process hearing concerned two issues whether the ot assessment was appropriate and whether the district committed a procedural idea violation by delaying unnecessarily in filing its due process complaint.the alj reviewed the records and took testimony,principally from hirchag.the alj concluded that the ot assessment was administered properly pursuant to the correct test manual and in compliance with the statutory requirements.the alj also concluded that the forty days between the iee request and the filing of the due process complaint was not unnecessary delay.
because the alj concluded that the district ot assessment was appropriate,remained able to obtain an independent assessment,but not at a public expense.remedy was to appeal the alj decision in federal district court.on july,attorney wrote to the district indicating that would forego an appeal if the district agreed to fund the iee for occupational therapy and pay in attorney fees and costs to her attorneys,the special education law firm.counsel noted that legal fees will continue to increase as this matter proceeds to federal litigation if the parties do not achieve a settlement agreement.the district attorney responded in a letter dated july,

the district moved under federal rule of civil procedure b for dismissal of the ada,and claims.the district court dismissed the ada claim with prejudice dismissed the claim with prejudice,except to the extent injunctive relief was sought and dismissed the claim because,as pled,it failed to meet the standards articulated in bell atlantic twombly,d and ashcroft iqbal,d,but granted leave to amend the claim because an amendment might not be futile.
on january,filed an amended complaint alleging the and ada claims once more and pleading the claim with more particularity.in response,the district filed a second motion to dismiss on january,and on january,the parties stipulated to dismiss the and ada claims with prejudice.the district court dismissed the claim with prejudice on march.
on july,moved for summary judgment,arguing the alj incorrectly ruled on the adequacy of the ot assessment because it failed to recommend that may need special education and related services and that the district had not unnecessarily delayed in filing the due process complaint.
on august,the district court affirmed the alj decision,finding that it contain ed no factual errors and was thorough and careful,and concluding that the disputed occupational therapy report did not violate the idea and the district did not unnecessarily delay its due process complaint.the court further denied request for attorney fees and invited the district to file a request for attorney fees because the bases for appeal were frivolous.
the district accepted the court invitation and was awarded in attorney fees and in costs.the district court found that each of the claims was frivolous,unreasonable,and without foundation.further,the court concluded that these claims were brought by for the improper purpose of harassment,unnecessary delay,and needlessly increasing litigation costs,exposing to potential personal liability for the fees.

we have previously noted that there is little case law governing fee awards to prevailing defendants under the idea,at.in,though we rejected the autistic child claim that he was denied a fair and appropriate education in violation of the idea,we reversed the district court award of attorney fees to the school district because it applied an improper and unsupported legal standard.there,we concluded 
t he language of the idea statute is nearly identical to,the general provision for federal civil rights cases.and the idea language granting fees to prevailing defendants is nearly identical to the standard the supreme court developed in christiansburg garment eeoc,d,which is now the standard for awarding fees to prevailing defendants in civil rights cases.

frivolousness 
idea claims 
in assessing the frivolousness of the idea claims,the district court abused its discretion by failing to properly apply the christiansburg standard,at.when the correct legal standard is applied,it is clear that the claims were not frivolous within the meaning of the statute.
under christiansburg,a prevailing defendant is entitled to attorney fees only if plaintiff claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.at.in considering what constitutes a claim that is frivolous,unreasonable or groundless,it is important that a district court resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that,because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.id.at.and,if a plaintiff is found to have brought or continued such a claim in bad faith,there will be an even stronger basis for charging him with the attorney fees incurred by the defense.id.at.
applying the christiansburg frivolousness standard,we have held that a case may be deemed frivolous only when the result is obvious or the arguments of error are wholly without merit.karam city of burbank,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.moreover,when there is very little case law on point and a claim raises a novel question,the claim is much less likely to be considered frivolous.id.
to the extent that the district court implied that the idea claims were frivolous at the administrative hearing stage,it erred first,the district,not,filed the due process complaint after it decided not to address two concerns regarding the ot assessment that was provided.second,the alj inquiry focused narrowly on w hether the district january,occupational therapy ot assessment was appropriate.contended that the ot assessment was not appropriate because the testing used and the scoring of at least one of the ot tests underlying the ot assessment was inappropriate and the report failed to comply with statutory requirements because the report omits the assessor conclusion about whether actually required special education services.the alj conducted a thorough review of these claims,taking testimony from the ot assessor,and ultimately rejected arguments.nothing in the alj decision hints that these claims were frivolous indeed,the alj careful analysis,findings of fact,and conclusions of law indicate the seriousness of claims.
nor were the idea claims frivolous as the litigation continued.in the motion for summary judgment before the district court,argued that the requirement of california education code that a written assessment of a student include a statement of whether the pupil may need special education and related services was not met in this case.disagreed with the report because it did not adequately address situation.specifically,it was undisputed that the ot report did not include any specific recommendation and evinced concern that the subsequently recommended collaborative ot would merely take the form of ad hoc informal conversations between the ot therapist and teacher rather than any actual occupational therapy.
claims relating to the ot assessment were poorly plead and argued and she ultimately lost however,this does not mean they were frivolous.as we said in at,l awyers would be improperly discouraged from taking on potentially meritorious idea cases if they risked being saddled with a judgment for bringing a suit where they have a plausible,though ultimately unsuccessful,argument,as here.there was some basis for belief that the ot assessment was inappropriate,some basis for concluding that the report failed to meet the procedural requirements of california education code,and some basis for believing that the iep failed to provide with a free and public education fape.in its decision on the merits,the district court concluded that because the district did not dispute eligibility at the time the disputed report was written,the procedural violation alleged is especially frivolous.this conclusion misapprehended the fact that the ot assessment itself could be read to violate california education code,which requires anyone who assesses the pupil to prepare a written report which includes w hether the pupil may need special education and related services,and t he basis for making the determination.in reviewing the ot assessment,hirchag never states whether is or is not eligible for ot services and on what basis.while the district court appropriately notes that the ot assessment mentions that was eligible for special education services,by its own terms also states that the report should note whether the pupil may need related services.given the dearth of cases citing or interpreting requirements it was hardly a foregone conclusion that a challenge to the ot assessment on the basis of its failure to include a section recommending what ot services should be provided to or seeking an independent evaluation to ascertain which services should be provided,could not prevail.see karam,at a case is less likely to be considered frivolous when there is very little case law directly apposite.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as in karam,t hese circumstances furnish some basis,albeit somewhat tenuous,at,for the conclusion that there was some factual basis for claim.the factual basis for the claim in concert with the lack of apposite demonstrates that this claim is not frivolous.
in its analysis of the frivolousness of the day unnecessary delay claim,the district court also failed to cite any case law setting forth the standard for frivolousness.under christiansburg,claim that the day delay between parent request for an iee and the district filing for a due process hearing was unnecessary in violation of b was not frivolous.although other courts have held that periods of time longer than days do not constitute an unnecessary delay,those same courts have highlighted the inquiry necessary to determine whether the delay violated the regulation.see,ripon unified sch,cv mce dad,wl,at.
retaliation based claims 
the district court did not discuss christiansburg in concluding that the three claims were frivolous.nonetheless,our review of these claims under the proper legal framework demonstrates that two of the three claims were frivolous,and we affirm the district court finding as to these claims 
the ada intimidation claim and the claim lack any legal foundation and the result is obvious.karam,at.the ada intimidation claim filed under b had an outcome that was clear at the time it was filed.section b states it shall be unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed,or on account of his or her having aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,any right granted or protected by this chapter.emphasis added.by its own terms,protection under the ada against intimidation does not extend to a plaintiff attempts to exercise rights granted or protected by the idea the basis of claim in this case.see morse coast opportunities,cir because plaintiff complaint against defendant is completely barred by the terms of the statute,we find that her claim is unreasonable and meritless.the district court concluded as much in dismissing the claim with prejudice.despite this dismissal,attorneys pled the same claim in their first amended complaint requiring the district to respond once again to this frivolous claim 
the claim seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief is likewise frivolous,its outcome predetermined by a review of relevant law.it is that a school district can not be sued for damages under.belanger madera unified sch,cir holding that in california,school districts are state agencies for purposes of eleventh amendment immunity,and concluding that school districts can not be liable for damages under.the district court dismissed this claim with prejudice,except insofar as sought some sort of injunctive relief against the district.the request for injunctive relief,however,also is frivolous because failed to indicate what she sought to enjoin or what injunctive relief would be possible in this case.see hudson moore bus.forms,cir f ailure to justify the basis for the damages sought only serve s to support the district court conclusion that the damage claims were frivolous and brought to harass.finally,despite the district court dismissal with prejudice of this claim,reasserted the claim in her amended complaint,including a request for damages 
the final claim based on of the rehabilitation act of,in contrast,is not frivolous.although the district court ultimately granted the district rule b motion to dismiss,it did so after careful consideration,ultimately concluding that the specific facts of this case would not dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in a protected activity.as the district court own reasoning made clear,present ed evidence that,if believed by the,would have entitle d her to relief,at.under such circumstances,the case is per se not frivolous and will not support an award of attorney fees.id.moreover,although k.did not ultimately prevail on this case,dismissal under rule b is not the same as the standard for frivolousness.see,neitzke williams,d discussing at length the difference between failure to state a claim under rule b and a finding of frivolousness.
improper purpose 
the district court also concluded that claims were brought for an improper purpose,thus exposing to liability for attorney fees an extreme result that not even the district sought a finding of frivolousness,without a finding of improper purpose,allows a school district to recover fees from the attorneys,not the parents.see i b i iii.it therefore harder for a school district to collect attorney fees against parents than against their lawyers collecting against parents requires a showing of both frivolousness and an improper purpose,while collecting against their attorneys requires only a showing of frivolousness.this makes sense,since parents are not usually in the position to assess whether a claim is frivolous,at.
we have held,as a matter of law,that a claim is never filed for an improper purpose.id.therefore,we consider only whether the and ada claims were brought for an improper purpose.federal rule of civil procedure b governs our analysis.see id.at.we have recognized that under rule b,a n improper purpose is a purpose to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation,wilson,cir quoting rule b.an improper purpose is tested by objective standards,id.quoting zaldivar city of los angeles,cir,and may be found where a motion or paper,other than a complaint,is filed in the context of a persistent pattern of clearly abusive litigation activity.aetna life ins.alla med.servs,cir.
the district court concluded that demonstrated her improper purpose by her attempt to extort fees from district to which mother was not legally entitled in exchange for mother foregoing an appeal.the district court stated in short,mother offer to ransom her child idea appeal in exchange for money to which her advocate was not entitled shows that the purpose of this appeal was not to vindicate the rights of her disabled child.there is no basis in the record for this finding.
first,a reading of the terms of the settlement offer reveals no attempt by to ransom the appeal in exchange for any improper gain.in that settlement offer,sought both the district funding of an iee and the attorney fees and costs incurred by the special education law firm.her settlement offer clearly contingent upon her child receiving the iee that believed deserved can not be characterized as an effort to improperly extort funds.
second,from the start,all sought was a proper ot recommendation for her child.when the district refused to provide the requested recommendation,she defended against the district due process complaint,and then,prior to appealing the adverse decision,provided,through the settlement offer,an option to avoid further litigation should the district agree to fund the iee that she sought for.when the district refused to settle the dispute,appealed.the record fails to reflect the effort to unnecessarily increase the litigation costs incurred by district until it acquiesced to lining the pockets of her advocate described by the district court.nor do the july letters counsel exchanged reflect clearly abusive litigation activity they were,rather,a sideshow by overzealous advocates.aetna life,at.
furthermore,the district court order shows a degree of frustration with and her counsel.finally,mother latest salvo against this court is entirely consistent with her strategy throughout this appeal of casting unfounded aspersions on the expertise or reasoning of others to deflect from her own shortcomings.district court order.to the extent that the district court frustration with and counsel colored its legal conclusions that these claims were brought for an improper purpose,this was error.as already discussed,no evidence supports an alleged improper purpose.instead,the record compels the conclusion that was simply attempting to vindicate the rights of her disabled child,at.steadfast determination to ensure that her child received the appropriate ot is not an improper purpose justifying an award of attorney fees.indeed,we have made clear that anger is a legitimate reaction by parties who believe that their rights have been violated or ignored.id.at.
where a plaintiff has asserted both frivolous and claims,a prevailing defendant may recover attorney fees under for the time attributable to defending against solely the frivolous claims.fox vice,d.we have held that,f ees may be awarded only for frivolous claims,and a defendant bears the burden of establishing that the fees for which it is asking are in fact incurred solely by virtue of the need to defend against those frivolous claims.harris maricopa,cir see also tutor saliba city of hailey,cir following other circuits in permitting defendants to recover fees under for those claims that were frivolous,even when related to the claims,so long as the claims were distinctive.because congress modeled the provisions of on,we conclude that this principle is equally applicable in the context.see,at.accordingly,we refer this case to the appellate commissioner for a determination of which fees are attributable solely to litigating the frivolous claim and ada claims in this case,subject to reconsideration by this court,and affirm the award of attorney fees against attorneys to that extent.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court order awarding attorney fees and costs is reversed in part,affirmed in part,and referred to the appellate commissioner.the mandate is stayed pending final disposition of the fee award.
affirmed in part reversed in part.
this case is about a mother who engaged in idea litigation principally to secure an independent educational evaluation for occupational therapy for her child,who indisputably has special education needs.in the course of litigating her idea claim,the mother alleged that her child school district violated not only the individuals with disabilities education act idea,but also the rehabilitation act,the americans with disabilities act ada,and by improperly threatening to seek sanctions against her and her counsel if they appealed the administrative denial of the child idea claims.
at the conclusion of the mother unsuccessful attempt to obtain an independent educational evaluation in the district court,the district judge of his own accord invited the school district to file a motion for attorney fees.the district judge expressing a degree of frustration with the child mother and her counsel,op.at then awarded the school district nearly in fees and costs,finding not only that each of the mother claims was frivolous,but that they were brought for improper purposes namely,to harass,cause unnecessary delay,and needlessly increase the costs of litigation citing i b i iii.under the idea,the latter finding exposed the mother herself to potential liability.
in almost all respects,the majority correctly finds that the district court was wrong.specifically,the majority holds that the claims under the idea and the rehabilitation act were not frivolous,and it holds that none of the claims was brought for any improper purpose.to that extent,i agree completely with the majority.my colleagues,however,perhaps out of a desire to give something to both sides,partially affirm the district court decision by holding that the claims under the ada and were frivolous,although those claims were based entirely on the very same facts that underlay the claim under the rehabilitation act.this holding represents more than what some might call legalistic.to hold that when a litigant has a claim and pleads it under the wrong legal label as well as under the right one,the pleadings under the wrong statutes are frivolous and warrant the imposition of sanctions runs contrary to the spirit and purpose of the idea.such sanctions,if upheld,would not only penalize both civil rights litigants and lawyers for good faith efforts to correct perceived violations of statutes designed to help some of those most in need of help from our judiciary,but would chill the filing of civil rights here,disability claims in the first instance.although the majority opinion should ultimately result in a very small award for the additional legal work necessary to obtain the dismissal of the ada and claims,the majority decision to impose sanctions on a small special education law firm for mere overpleading is important,as it creates extremely bad law.i strongly disagree that the plaintiff filing of her ada and claims justifies any sanctions at all,and i dissent from that portion of the majority opinion.
under the idea,a prevailing defendant agency or district can recover fees only in rare circumstances.prescott unified sch,cir.such circumstances generally involve conduct so offensive to the fair and honorable practice of law that it merits sanctioning of the offending attorneys.an attorney who files a legitimate action for a client does not exceed the bounds of honorable lawyering when he adds to the complaint an allegation that the same conduct violates related statutes as well,whether doing so results from a disagreement with prior case law,the offering of a novel though erroneous legal theory,or an inability to thoroughly research every possible legal theory before filing the complaint.although law firms with thousands of attorneys may be able to fully research every legal claim they assert,a small,and law firm seeking to protect the rights of children with disabilities should not be held to so rigorous a standard.as a lawyer with obligations to his client,counsel from such a firm is following his professional duties far better by possibly overpleading the number of statutes the defendant unlawful actions may violate than by underpleading them.the former does far less harm to the defendant who may readily have the extraneous counts stricken than the latter does to the plaintiff who may lose a legitimate claim should the lawyer fail to include all potentially applicable statutes.counsel action of referring to too many statutes,rather than too few,is not the type of rare circumstance that warrants the sanctioning of a lawyer asserting a legitimate idea claim.
that is particularly true in this case,as counsel may have had an entirely reasonable ground for bringing claims under and the ada,despite the fact that the law appear ed quest
