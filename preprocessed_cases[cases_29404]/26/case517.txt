this case presents the question of whether it is constitutional for a public middle school to regulate the time,place,and manner of a student speech by preventing him from handing out leaflets in school hallways between classes and instead allowing him to post his leaflets on hallway bulletin boards and to distribute them during lunch hours from a cafeteria table.the district court held that such a regulation of student speech is unconstitutional absent a showing that the speech is likely to cause a material and substantial interference with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,citing the supreme court decision in tinker des moines independent community school district,d.the district court permanently enjoined enforcement of jefferson middle school distribution policy and its prohibition on the student hallway distribution.the court also awarded the student one dollar in nominal damages.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court entry of a permanent injunction and its award of nominal damages.
michael,a,student participated in the nationwide annual day of silent solidarity organized by the national group stand true.on the designated day,middle and high school students across the country express their views against abortion by wearing red armbands,distributing literature detailing various facts about abortion,and remaining silent throughout the school day with red tape over their mouths to symbolize that they speak for unborn children.michael arrived at school on october,with red duct tape over his mouth and wrists,wearing a sweatshirt that said pray to end abortion.before school started,michael also distributed leaflets containing abortion statistics to those who approached him.
during michael class,his teacher,gary boudrie,sent him to the principal office,stating that michael sweatshirt and tape were causing a disruption.because the principal was not yet in that morning,michael was sent to andrea werner,a guidance counselor.after speaking with the school district superintendent,timothy fitzpatrick,werner told michael that he must remove the duct tape and either turn his sweatshirt,take it off,or wear a different shirt.according to michael,werner explained to him that his message was political and that the school could speak about abstinence,but not about abortion,and that the school had to remain neutral and people could take sides.neither werner nor boudrie discussed michael leaflets,and michael eventually returned to class.
michael claims that later that day,in the cafeteria,he wished to use the front pocket of his sweatshirt to carry his school binder so that he could use his hands to carry his saxophone to band class.michael turned his sweatshirt and began covering its pray to end abortion message with a piece of paper and tape.werner saw michael switching his sweatshirt and sent him to the principal office,where principal stephen kinsland reiterated to michael the previously issued sweatshirt directives.
while in principal kinsland office michael raised the issue of leaflet distribution.principal kinsland informed michael that his leaflets had to be before he could distribute them and that,because michael leaflets had not been approved,he could not distribute them that day.kinsland testified that students typically ask his permission before posting or distributing literature,and that michael had asked kinsland earlier that year for permission to post flyers about forming a student christian club and was granted permission.michael testified,however,that although he had asked for permission to post materials in the past,he did not think he needed permission to distribute leaflets.no disciplinary action was taken against michael on october,and principal kinsland spent part of the afternoon picking up leaflets from hallway floors and removing those that had been taped to drywall and appliances.
on january,michael and his parents filed the instant lawsuit expressing an urgent need for injunctive and declaratory relief so that michael could engage in a similar protest on january.michael also sought damages to vindicate his constitutional rights which were violated by defendants.on january,the parties made the following stipulations regarding the january protest 
plaintiff can not wear tape on his mouth.
plaintiff may wear red tape on his wrists.
plaintiff may wear a black hooded sweatshirt which says on the front,pray to end abortion.
jefferson school district retains the right to control the conduct if there are material and substantial disruptions or the reasonable forecast of such disruptions.
plaintiff may engage in until final judgment is entered by the court.
for purposes of the equitable relief sought,defendants are not taking the position that the literature plaintiff seeks to distribute would cause a substantial disruption or a material interference with the normal operation of the school or school activities.
the parties did not reach agreement,however,on whether michael would be allowed to distribute his leaflets in the school hallways.
in pertinent part,the school distribution policy provides that 
students will have the right to distribute and possess in or on school premises,school buses,or at school sponsored activities any form of literature,including but not limited to newspapers,magazines,leaflets,and pamphlets.students shall be responsible for the content of such materials.this right is,however,subject to limitation in accordance with standards of responsible journalism and in consideration of the rights and welfare of the entire student community.
in order to ensure that the welfare and rights of the community are adequately protected,the following will apply in the case of any distribution of literature on school premises or at times students are under the jurisdiction of the school

would cause a substantial disruption of or a material interference with the normal operation of the school or school activities.

distribution is defined as giving out or division among a number of persons,sharing or parceling out,allotting,dispensing,apportioning,either by physically doing so or placing the material to be distributed in any public area so that another person may obtain the same either for a free sic or without charge.
if the principal gives approval,may designate a time a place at which the distribution may take place.the distribution shall be orderly and the designated area for distribution shall be kept free of loosely scattered material.
although the policy is not formally distributed to students,principal kinsland testified that he reads any amendments to the policy to the students at an assembly at the beginning of each school year.
neither michael nor his parents provided michael proposed leaflets to the school before filing suit on january,and michael did not formally seek permission to distribute them on the the school nevertheless offered to allow michael to post his leaflets on bulletin boards in the hallways and to distribute them in the cafeteria during lunch,reasoning that the school is entitled to place reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions on the distribution of literature.michael was dissatisfied with the school offer,however,and argued pursuant to tinker des moines independent community school district,d,that the school may only regulate the time,place,and manner of his speech if his leaflet distribution is likely to cause a material and substantial disruption.the parties agreed that michael leaflet distribution was not likely to cause a disruption,and michael accordingly argued that he has a constitutional right to distribute his leaflets in the school hallways.
the district court rejected the school district arguments and entered a preliminary injunction on january prohibiting the school from restricting michael leafleting in the hallways.the court concluded that,because the school had not demonstrated that the leafleting had caused or would cause a material and substantial disruption under tinker,restricting michael distribution to hallway bulletin boards and the cafeteria violated michael first amendment rights.the court also concluded that the school distribution policy was unconstitutionally overbroad because it applies to any distribution of literature on school premises,which the court reasoned could potentially prohibit students from distributing car or music magazines to their friends without prior approval.
the district court converted its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction on march,permanently enjoining the school enforcement of its distribution policy and specifically stating that the school could not restrict michael literature distribution absent a showing that his distribution would materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of jefferson middle school,or intrude upon the rights of other students.the court also awarded michael nominal damages of one dollar.
on appeal,the school district argues that it is entitled to place reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions on students distribution of literature and that the district court erred in applying the heightened tinker to content and viewpoint specific its distribution policy.the school additionally argues that the district court award of damages was inappropriate and that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.

repeated statements by the supreme court and multiple circuits,including this one,make it clear that school areas such as hallways constitute nonpublic forums.as the supreme court explained in a case involving a school newspaper 
the public schools do not possess all of the attributes of streets,parks,and other traditional public forums that time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public questions.hence,school facilities may be deemed to be public forums only if school authorities have by policy or by practice opened those facilities for indiscriminate use by the general public,or by some segment of the public,such as student organizations.if the facilities have instead been reserved for other intended purposes,communicative or otherwise,then no public forum has been created,and school officials may impose reasonable restrictions on the speech of students,teachers,and other members of the school community.the government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.

the school in this case offered to allow michael to post his leaflets on bulletin boards in the hallways and to distribute them in the cafeteria during lunch,despite the fact that michael has never sought permission to distribute his leaflets in accordance with the school distribution policy.this minor regulation of michael speech is eminently reasonable.prohibiting handbilling in the hallway between classes is reasonable to avoid congestion,confusion,and tardiness,to say nothing of the inevitable clutter caused when the recipient indiscriminately discards the handout,muller,at,and there is no indication that jefferson proposed time,place,and manner regulation of michael speech is based on a desire to suppress michael viewpoint.indeed,as the school district noted in its brief,the school regulation allows michael ample opportunity to express his viewpoint to his fellow schoolmates 
interested individuals will be able to obtain copies of the literature he wishes to distribute,either from appropriate bulletin board or hallway postings,or from a cafeteria table.by those means,the entire middle school population will have access to this information during virtually all time.
it is also reasonable for the school to require prior approval before permitting students to distribute literature.there is nothing unconstitutional per se in a requirement that students submit materials to the school administration prior to distribution,shanley ne.indep.sch,cir,and the particular distribution policy at issue in this case is well within constitutional boundaries.jefferson distribution policy is viewpoint and content neutral and it provides clear standards against which the principal must exercise his discretion to approve or disapprove of a proposed distribution.indeed,without such standards,the policy would be more open to attack as subject to arbitrary enforcement.heffron,at.noting,in the context of public forums,the constitutional problems inherent in policies providing broad,standardless discretion to implementing officials ater armstrong,cir rejecting argument that statute forbidding literature on public roadways vested officials with arbitrary discretion putnam pit,at child evangelism fellowship of,montgomery county pub,cir noting broad agreement that even in limited public and nonpublic forums,investing governmental officials
