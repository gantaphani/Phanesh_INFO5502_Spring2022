background 
in,boulder county adopted its comprehensive plan,an advisory land use scheme with the goals of curbing urban sprawl,maintaining open space to preserve the county rural character,and sustaining agriculture.the county amended its land use code the code in to implement the comprehensive plan.id.at.the code divides the county into thirteen categories of zoning districts,including agricultural districts.id.at.rmcc is located in an agricultural district,where offices,warehouses,and retail stores are prohibited.id.at.in,the county amended the code to require all facilities in an agricultural district with occupancy loads exceeding people to apply for a special use permit.id.at.the special use process entails an application to the county land use office,and public hearings and votes before both the planning commission and the county commission.id.at.the county uses eleven criteria to evaluate special use applications,including objective criteria like height requirements and subjective criteria such as harmony with the character of the neighborhood and compatibility with the surrounding area,accordance with the comprehensive plan,and not an use of land or excessive depletion of natural resources.id.at.
rmcc is located in a rural,agricultural zone in niwot,an unincorporated part of the county.id.at.in the general area are several planned unit development subdivisions,a wastewater treatment facility,a high school,and the square foot boulder technology center id.at.since its founding in,rmcc has grown in stages to its current state as the county largest church complex a square foot main building,a square foot maintenance building,and square feet of temporary modular units on acres.id.at.rmcc campus also includes its school,the rocky mountain christian academy.id.at.although rmcc was allowed to expand without any special use applications until the amendments to the land use code,after rmcc was a use.id.at.rmcc applied in for a special use permit to make the existing structure conforming and to construct a square foot school.the county commission approved the application over the opposition of the county land use office.id.at.the county again approved rmcc special use application against the land use staff recommendation,this time for an expansion of the student body by students and the placement of temporary modular units on the campus.id.at.the county attached two conditions to its approval that rmcc remove the modular units after three years,and that rmcc submit a master plan outlining future development.id.at.the county denies imposing the master plan condition.id.at aplt.reply at.
the special use application at issue in this case,submitted in,initially sought approval for additional square feet.rmcc scaled that request back by square feet.id.at.the final application proposed a square foot gymnasium,a square foot chapel,expanding the school building by square feet,gallery space connecting the buildings,and an expansion of the main worship building seating capacity by seats.id.at.the scale of rmcc proposal was based on an outside consultant estimate of the church needs over the next twenty years.id.at.
the special use application met opposition at each level of review.the county land use staff found that the application met the objective requirements,but conflicted with the subjective goals of the comprehensive plan.id.at.in particular,the land use staff deemed the proposed expansion incompatible with the surrounding area,an use of the land,likely to cause undue traffic congestion,and likely detrimental to the welfare of the residents of boulder county.id.at.the staff report used an unusual method to find that the expansion would be an use typically,a proposed use is not if less than of the site surface area would be covered by a structure or a parking lot,and in this case the expansion would only result in coverage.id.at.instead,the land use staff deemed the expansion an use because it doubled the church square footage and significantly increased the parking area.id.at.the planning commission voted against the application after a public hearing,at which one commissioner privately greeted rmcc consultant by saying,rosi,you can bring in your christians now.id.at.the public hearings and other public input,both before the planning commission and county commission,confirm that the application was a divisive issue,and many of those opposed voiced concerns similar to those which both bodies found persuasive.id.at.the county commission issued the final partial denial,denying the application except for the capacity increase of seats and the square foot building to replace the modular units.id.at.

discussion 
the county argues that evidence at trial was insufficient to show that it violated the substantial burden,equal terms,and unreasonable limitations provisions of rluipa.if we find that sufficient evidence existed for the jury substantial burden verdict,the county argues that the substantial burden provision of rluipa is unconstitutional facially and as applied to this case.finally,the county challenges the court entry of a permanent injunction requiring it to grant rmcc its special use permit.aplt.br.at.
