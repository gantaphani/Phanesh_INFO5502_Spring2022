procedural history 
franzosi filed a petition for writ on mandate on march,seeking reinstatement to his former position pursuant to section.
the trial court heard the matter on june,and denied franzosi petition on july.respondents gave notice of entry of judgment on july,and franzosi timely appealed from the judgment on july.
in denying franzosi petition for writ of mandate,the trial court ruled the plain language of section required franzosi to request reinstatement within months from the start of his disability.the court rejected franzosi contention that the period starts to run within months from the date the strs granted his disability application,may,stating it would render the term of disability language in section superfluous.the court found that the strs granted franzosi application effective october,and that is when franzosi term of disability began for purposes of section.
the trial court found january,was the expiration of months from the october,disability effective date.the court further found that since franzosi admitted the first contact with the district regarding reinstatement was not made until april,the contact was not made within months even assuming it was a proper reinstatement request.the court thus found franzosi request was untimely,and he had no further reemployment rights by virtue of his disability.because franzosi cited no authority that the district must continue to employ him beyond months,or into perpetuity,franzosi had failed to demonstrate the district had a mandatory duty to reemploy him full time or that he had such a right to reemployment.
contentions 
franzosi contends that under section an academic employee who has been granted a disability leave of absence must request reinstatement within only months of the date he or she is determined to be eligible for a disability allowance by the strs.he also contends that because he applied for reinstatement within months after the strs determined he was eligible for disability the trial court should have granted his petition for writ of mandate.
