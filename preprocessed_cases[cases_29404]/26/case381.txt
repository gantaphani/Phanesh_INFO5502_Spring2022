plaintiffs,aclu student of maryland,college park,daniel sinclair,matthew fogg,and michael reeves appealed from the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment and the district court grant of summary judgment to defendant,mote,president of the university of maryland,college park.the underlying case was a challenge,on first amendment grounds,of the university policy that restricted speech in outdoor areas of the campus.the only issue that remains is the university policy restricting speech in outdoor areas by members of the general public.we affirm.
the state of maryland has established a system of higher education i n order to foster the development of a consolidated system of public higher education,to improve the quality of education,to extend its benefits and to encourage the economical use of the state resources.ann.educ.college park is considered the state flagship campus in that endeavor.ann.educ.a iii a.its campus occupies over acres in college park,maryland,enrolls students,approximately a quarter of which live on campus,and employs approximately faculty and staff members.defendant mote,is the president of the university at college park and approved and issued the regulation challenged in this case.
the policy at issue provides for access to the campus facilities by outsiders.the policy recognizes that u niversity facilities are available primarily for programs offered by and intended for the campus community.the policy goes on to authorize the use of nyumburu amphitheater,for public speaking,and designated sidewalks outside the stamp student union,for distribution of literature,by persons or groups other than students,faculty,and staff,and not otherwise sponsored by a department or registered student organization.hereinafter outsiders the stamp student union is the single most trafficked place by a of the campus,and nyumburu is next to it.if a member of the general public is sponsored by a member of the campus community they have the same access to facilities as their sponsor.the only requirements for an outsider to engage in public speaking or distributing literature on campus is that they reserve space at the appropriate location by registering with the campus reservations office up to five days in advance.under the policy,reservations are to be approved on a basis with priority given to university departments,registered student organizations,students,faculty,and staff.lack of available space is the only acceptable reason to deny a permit.unsponsored public speaking and distribution of literature by outsiders is prohibited away from nyumburu and stamp student union,respectively.failure to follow the university regulations will result in revocation of an approved reservation other appropriate administrative action.if the violator is a member of the public,they may be required to leave the campus.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of,cir.when,as here,a party appeals the denial of summary judgment together with an appeal of the granting of a for summary judgment,we have jurisdiction to review the propriety of the denial of summary judgment by the district court.monahan county of chesterfield,cir citing sacred heart med.ctr.sullivan,cir.summary judgment under rule c is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
the issue in this case is plaintiff assertion that the university policy violates the speech clause of the first amendment.the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.under our decision in goulart meadows,cir,when a first amendment claim is asserted the court must begin the inquiry by determining whether the plaintiff had engaged in protected speech.goulart,at citing cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.if that is the case,the court next must identify the nature of the forum,because the extent to which the government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.goulart,at quoting cornelius,at.after determining the type of forum,the court must determine whether the justifications for the exclusion satisfy the requisite standard for that forum.goulart,at citing cornelius,at.the first step in the analysis is easily answered here.reeves attempted to engage in speech of a political nature,which the parties agree is protected speech.
we next turn to the second question in the analysis,what is the nature of the forum.there are three different types of forums in first amendment cases,traditional public forums,forums,and limited or designated public forums.warren fairfax county,cir citing.educ.television comm forbes,d.a traditional public forum,such as streets,sidewalks,and parks,requires the government to accommodate all speakers,because these places have the characteristics of a public thoroughfare,a purpose that is compatible with expressive conduct,as well as a tradition and history of being used for expressive conduct.warren,at.the government can restrict speech in a traditional public forum on the time,place and manner of expression only,if the restriction is,is narrowly drawn to serve a significant state interest,and leaves open ample channels of communication of the information.warren,at see also.
conversely,a forum is one that has not traditionally been open to the public,where opening it to expressive conduct would somehow interfere with the objective use and purpose to which the property has been dedicated.warren,at.restrictions on speech in a forum should be upheld if they are viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.warren,at quoting cornelius,at.
the third type of forum,a limited or designated public forum,is one that is not traditionally public,but the government has purposefully opened to the public,or some segment of the public,for expressive activity.warren,at citing,at.once a limited or designated public forum is established the government can not exclude entities of a similar character to those generally allowed.goulart,at citing warren,at.
plaintiff argues that the outdoor areas of the college park campus should be considered public forums.to support this argument plaintiff points to the fact that access to the outdoor areas are not limited to students,faculty and staff,but instead are generally open to any member of the public,and that the university allows members of the public to engage in any lawful activity in these open areas except public speaking and handbilling.while this is true,it is not determinative because t he government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.cornelius,at.plaintiff argument is also answered by looking to the supreme court decision in widmar vincent,d,which recognized that the campus of a public university,at least for its students,possesses many of the characteristics of a public forum.at.citing police of chicago mosley,d.the court then went on to say that a university differs in significant respects from public forums such as streets or parks or even municipal theaters.widmar,at.
examining the circumstances of this case,we are of opinion and agree with the district court that the college park campus is a limited public forum.contrary to plaintiff arguments,the campus is not akin to a public street,park,or theater,but instead is an institute of higher learning that is devoted to its mission of public education.this mission necessarily focuses on the students and other members of the university community.accordingly,it has not traditionally been open to the public at large,but instead has been a special type of enclave that is devoted to higher education.united states grace,d.there is nothing in the record to indicate that until the policy at issue here was implemented,the campus was anything but a forum for members of
