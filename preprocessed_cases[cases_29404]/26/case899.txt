background 
in early february,then a sophomore in high school,was involved in a disciplinary incident at kennedy high school kennedy in the district.the district instituted disciplinary procedures against,removed him from kennedy,and placed him at a community day school.in late february,beauchamp requested that the district evaluate for special education services the district performed an evaluation and was found eligible under the categories of emotional disturbance and other health impaired based on a diagnosis of anxiety and attention deficit disorder.beauchamp subsequently filed an idea due process complaint against the district on march,arguing that the district had evidence of disability as far back as march,and that the district failure to evaluate him until march violated idea and denied a free and appropriate public education fape for the two intervening years.
pursuant to idea,the administrative proceeding was bifurcated.the first hearing was expedited and examined whether the district had a basis of knowledge that was a child with a disability at the time it removed him from kennedy.on may,the administrative law judge alj issued a favorable decision for j.e.the district appealed to the district court and the alj findings were affirmed on may.the district court also awarded attorney fees for whiteleather work in the expedited proceeding,but lowered her requested hourly rate,and rejected a request for paralegal fees.that decision was affirmed by this court in related appeal anaheim union high school district,wl cir.
while the appeal was pending before the district court,the parties engaged in settlement discussions with regard to the proceedings,which focused on whether the district violated its obligations under idea by failing to timely evaluate for special education services.by letter dated september,the district made a settlement offer to beauchamp and that included the following relief hours of individual tutoring by a credentialed special education teacher reimbursement of the costs of a private evaluation conducted by perry passaro,hours of compensatory counseling services by a credentialed school psychologist and reimbursement of reasonable attorney fees and costs.the offer was made with the understanding that the district would not make an admission on the issue or abandon its appeal from the expedited hearing.the district offer further stated that t he terms offered above will be incorporated into an industry standard general compromise and release agreement that will effectuate the offer outlined and permit the district to provide the offered reimbursements and services.
beauchamp rejected the offer and the hearing was held over seven days between january,and february.on march,the alj issued a favorable ruling for and awarded six hours of individual counseling by a credentialed mental health professional and reimbursement for the cost of passaro examination.neither party appealed the alj decision.thereafter,beauchamp filed a motion in the district court for an award of attorney fees at a rate of per hour,paralegal fees,and costs under i a.the district moved for summary judgment,arguing in relevant part that under i d,beauchamp was not entitled to fees incurred after she rejected the district september,offer the requested hourly rate was too high and an award of paralegal fees was barred by collateral estoppel because the district court had already ruled on the issue in the appeal.beauchamp filed a for summary judgment,arguing that whiteleather was entitled to fees incurred both before and after the settlement offer at a rate of per hour,as well as paralegal fees.the district court issued an order on june,awarding in fees incurred before the district settlement offer at an hourly rate of,and concluding that the issue of paralegal fees was barred by collateral estoppel.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
attorney fees 
under idea,a court may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.i b i i.but fees and costs may not be awarded for services performed subsequent to a written settlement offer if 
i the offer is made within the time prescribed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or,in the case of an administrative proceeding,at any time more than days before the proceeding begins 
ii the offer is not accepted within days and 
iii the court or administrative hearing officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement.
id.i d i i iii.notwithstanding subparagraph d,an award of attorneys fees and related costs may be made to a parent who is the prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer.id.i e.
the settlement agreement 
there is no dispute that beauchamp is a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees.it is also undisputed that the district offer was made more than ten days before the hearing,and that beauchamp did not accept the offer within ten days.instead,beauchamp argues that the relief she obtained at the administrative hearing was more favorable to her than the settlement offer because she obtained a ruling that the district violated its obligations.alternatively,beauchamp argues that she was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer.
a.the relief obtained at the administrative hearing was not more favorable to beauchamp than the settlement offer.
the district court concluded that the outcome at the administrative hearing was not more favorable to beauchamp than the relief offered in the district september,settlement letter.beauchamp does not dispute that the district offer contained more counseling and tutoring hours for than what was awarded by the alj.nonetheless,beauchamp argues that without a ruling from the alj on the issue in the hearing,she risked reversal in the pending appeal.for the reasons discussed below,we find beauchamp argument to be without merit because the two proceedings were not legally dependent upon one another.
the appeal focused on whether,on the date was removed from kennedy,the district had a basis of knowledge that was a student with a disability.under k a,a student like,who has violated a code of student conduct but has not yet been identified for special education services,can claim protection under idea if it can be shown that the school district had knowledge that the child was a child with a disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred.in
