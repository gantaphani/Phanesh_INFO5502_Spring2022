background 
in accepted a faculty position in the school of education at saint xavier university in chicago.beverly gulley,the dean of the school of education,recommended be hired and served as her supervisor.initially split her time between administrative duties as the coordinator of urban initiatives and a teaching position in the esl bilingual program.in she received a teaching position,and in she applied for an associate professor position.gulley wrote a letter to the university rank tenure committee supporting application,and in march was promoted to associate professor.shortly thereafter,gulley formally evaluated for the first time,and in the evaluation suggested she attend service functions that support the school of education and university from time to time.
applied for tenure in the fall of,triggering the university tenure evaluation process.at xavier,a tenure candidate dossier is first evaluated by the candidate college rank tenure committee,which makes a recommendation to the college dean for review.the dean,in turn,prepares a recommendation letter to the university rank tenure committee university committee.the dean recommendation,along with the candidate dossier,is forwarded to the university committee for consideration and decision.the university committee decision is then sent to the vice president of academic affairs,who makes a recommendation to the president,who formally confers or denies tenure.
in this instance,the school of education rank tenure committee soe committee recommended receive tenure,rating her teaching as good,her scholarship as excellent,and her service to the school of education and the university as good.this information was forwarded to gulley.at this point in the process,the vice president of academic affairs,christopher chalokwu,met with gulley to discuss tenure application.chalokwu perceived a personality conflict between gulley and and warned gulley not to make the tenure process political.during this conversation,gulley told chalokwu that missed work or other university events due to the celebration of jewish holidays.
gulley ultimately recommended against tenure.her formal letter to the university committee rated teaching as good,her scholarship and professional development as very good,and her service as fair.gulley commented negatively about service on committees and mentioned negative student comments had received in previous years.gulley also cited declining enrollment trends in the program,although had no direct responsibility for program enrollment or marketing.
after reviewing tenure dossier,the soe committee positive recommendation,and gulley negative recommendation,the university committee rated teaching as fair,her scholarship and professional development as good,and her service as good.the university committee recommended not receive tenure chalokwu and the president agreed.muhammad chishty,a university committee member,characterized the deliberations on tenure application as considerable,extremely emotional,and heated.chishty also told that gulley negative recommendation weighed heavily in the university committee decision to deny tenure.this is consistent with chalokwu statement that a dean recommendation on tenure is ordinarily very central and very crucial to the tenure process.
filed a formal grievance with the university challenging the denial of her tenure application.she alleged that gulley discriminated against her because of her strong advocacy stance for educational equity via bilingual education and her subsequent attempts to bring the content of the approval program out of the margins and into the mainstream of the school of education.significantly,did not allege discrimination on account of her religion.the faculty grievance committee concluded that gulley letter contained some unsupported assertions regarding qualifications for tenure nevertheless,a formal hearing committee,which included one member selected by,voted to uphold the denial of tenure.the president in turn upheld this decision.
then filed suit against the university and gulley,and for the first time,accused the university of religious discrimination under title vii.the district court,granting the university motion for summary judgment,held that failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and failed to show that the university reasons for denying tenure were pretextual.the district court also granted gulley motion for summary judgment on tortious interference claim because did not raise any facts from which a reasonable jury could infer that gulley acted with the state of mind required for this claim.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts,and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of.peele country mut.ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.t o avoid summary judgment,the nonmovant bears the burden of setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.vanasco louis,cir quoting fed.civ.e.
religious discrimination claim 
presents her title vii religious discrimination claim under the mcdonnell douglas green,d,indirect method of proof.she therefore has the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing she is a member of a protected class,she was qualified for tenure,she was denied tenure,and a similarly situated applicant not in the protected class was granted tenure.namenwirth bd.of regents of of,cir.if she establishes a prima facie case the burden shifts to the university to offer a nondiscriminatory reason for denying tenure.if the university does so,the burden shifts back to to submit evidence that the university proffered explanation is a pretext for religious discrimination.
the prima facie case and pretext inquiries often overlap we may skip the analysis of a plaintiff prima facie case and proceed directly to the evaluation of pretext if the defendant offers a nondiscriminatory explanation for its employment decision.abioye sundstrand,cir.we find it unnecessary here to evaluate whether established a prima facie case the university has said it denied tenure because did not show promise of continued contribution to the intellectual life of the university.this is a nondiscriminatory explanation,and has not submitted evidence to create a triable issue as to whether this reason is a pretext for discrimination on account of her religion.
important for the pretext analysis in this case,does not claim the president or any member of the university committee was motivated by religious bias in denying her tenure claims only that gulley was so motivated accordingly,we will focus our attention on whether has come forward with sufficient evidence to create a factual dispute on whether gulley reasons for recommending against tenure were pretextual.
a pretext is a deliberate falsehood.forrester,cir.to show pretext,must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the university,gulley were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.gulley recommended against tenure because of lack of service on school of education and university committees,certain negative student comments,and declining enrollment trends in the program.evidence is insufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that these reasons were deliberately false.
