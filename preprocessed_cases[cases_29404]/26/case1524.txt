background 
dlse is a division of the state department of industrial relations authorized to enforce provisions of the labor code and orders,including wage orders,issued by the industrial welfare commission iwc,subd.b.specific to the issue presented in this appeal is the application of iwc wage order,exempting professional employees from entitlement to overtime wages.in relevant part subsection a of the wage order provides 
professional exemption.a person employed in a professional capacity means any employee who meets all of the following requirements 
a who is licensed or certified by the state of california and is primarily engaged in the practice of one of the following recognized professions teaching 
c who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment in the performance of duties set forth in subparagraph a 
d who earns a monthly salary equivalent to no less than two times the state minimum wage for employment 
section of the wage order defines teaching as r the profession of teaching under a certificate from the commission for teacher preparation and licensing or teaching in an accredited college or university.
csca is a private entity operating a culinary school and employs instructors.it contends that its instructors are exempt from entitlement to overtime wages based on its interpretation of the terms of iwc wage order.in essence,csca asserts its instructors are teachers in an accredited college and fall within the order provision for the professional exemption accorded to teachers.
dlse disagreed and sent csca a letter informing it that csca instructors are not classified as exempt from the overtime provision of iwc wage orders.dlse determination was based on the on the opinion of its counsel,thomas kerrigan.he opined that csca is a cooking school that claims its teachers are exempt from existing overtime requirements as teachers at an accredited college or university within the meaning of iwc,sections a and r.while i agree that the statement in our policies and procedures manual limiting the exemption to institutions that grant bachelor or higher degrees does not have the force of law,and is an underground regulation,this definition would be upheld by the courts as consistent with generally accepted usage of the words college or university.the teachers at this institution are accordingly not exempt from the overtime laws.
in response to dlse contention,csca filed a complaint for a declaration and judgment that pursuant to iwc wage order sections a a and r,csca and its instructors are exempt from overtime wage laws.dlse answered and csca filed a motion for summary judgment.
in support of its motion for summary judgment,csca filed the declaration of christopher becker as the evidentiary foundation for csca separate statement of undisputed material facts.becker is the founder and president of csca,and in summary,describes the school organization and operation as follows 
csca was founded in,offering instruction and postsecondary degrees in the field of culinary arts and management of commercial restaurants.its campus is located in pasadena,california,and operates in an square foot facility.it has classrooms and an extensive library.in addition to its senior administrative staff,it employs instructors.twelve are academic instructors,are chef instructors,and seven are department chairs hot foods production,restaurant practical,garde manger,academics,introduction to culinary arts i,introduction to culinary arts ii,and baking pastries.
the workweek of each csca instructor varies from week to week and course to course.most are in the classroom approximately five days a week conducting six and a half hour long classes excluding breaks.when not teaching,csca instructors hold office hours at which time they counsel students with respect to their progress a class typically involves approximately an hour of lecture and demonstration by the csca instructor,several hours of meal preparation with guidance from the csca instructor,and an hour of evaluation by the csca instructor of the students performance.there are no set hours or express direction on how a n instructor is to conduct his or her work.
csca curriculum consists of a rigorous weeks of coursework.included are contact hours,which are classroom hours and labs,and quarter credits,which is the minimum number of credits to graduate.students are given a required reading list,regular homework assignments,quizzes,midterms,and final examinations.the students are graded and must maintain a grade point average of on a grade scale to graduate and receive a le cordon bleu culinary arts diploma.
since,csca has been accredited by the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools acics.acics is an independent,national,institutional accrediting agency.it has been recognized by the united states secretary of education and the council for higher education accreditation since.acics accredits approximately institutions in the united states and abroad with students in.over percent of institutions are colleges.the secretary of education recognized acics as a national accrediting body for postsecondary institutions offering primarily business and programs of study at nondegree and associate,bachelor,and master degree levels http as of,
csca has been approved by the california bureau for private postsecondary vocational education cbppve pursuant to education code section,subdivisions b and f,and title of the california code of regulations,section.each csca instructor holds a valid and applicable certificate of authorization for service pursuant to education code section,subdivision b.on february,the cbppve approved csca to operate as a institution,and on april,acics approved csca to grant an associate of occupational studies degree.
in opposition to csca motion for summary judgment,dlse requested the trial court to take judicial notice both of passages in encyclopaedia britannica describing colleges and universities see fn,post and the fact that csca is not listed in any of the standard lists of colleges and universities,such as,the arco field guide to colleges,and the directory of american colleges and universities.
dlse dispute of csca separate statement of undisputed material facts is based on bald assertions that underlie its legal argument,made without reference to any supporting evidence.in summary,it argues csca does not provide a four year baccalaureate program of education acics is not an accrediting body for four year academic colleges universities,but only for career schools and colleges csca is approved by the state of california through the cbppve solely as a vocational institution for purposes unrelated to applicable iwc orders and finally,csca faculty is not sufficiently educated or academically trained.
the present dispute puts in issue whether csca is a college to qualify its instructors as teachers within the professional exemption provided by iwc wage order dlse contends that csca instructors do not fall within the exemption because t he division has historically defined college or university to mean a school of higher learning teaching academic subjects which grants at least the bachelor degree in arts and science or both.
the trial court issued an extensive order granting summary judgment.it found csca statement of undisputed facts was admitted and established csca possessed all the indicia of a college.the trial court applied the provisions of the federal labor standards act,and by a comparative analysis with california law,declared csca is a college and its instructors are exempt from being paid overtime in accord with iwc wage order.it also rejected dlse contention that the term college is by definition a qualified institution of higher learning offering a four year course of study leading to a bachelor degree and does not apply to vocational schools.the trial court found that there is no common meaning for the term college.
dlse appeals the judgment on the grounds that the trial court erred by applying federal law to make a comparative analysis with california law and by declining to take judicial notice of commonly accepted definition s of college and university.
discussion 
the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.the court must grant the motion if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact citation that is,there is no issue requiring a trial as to any fact that is necessary under the pleadings and,ultimately,the law citations and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,citing code civ.summary judgment is properly granted when the evidence in support of the moving party establishes that there is no material issue of fact to be tried.citations.the trial court must decide if a triable issue of fact exists.if none does,and the sole remaining issue is one of law,it is the duty of the trial court to determine the issue of law.citation.suzuki city of los angeles th,d.as a corollary of the de novo review standard,the appellate court may affirm a summary judgment on any correct legal theory,as long as the parties had an adequate opportunity to address the theory in the trial court.citation.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals writs the rutter group a,to.
csca statement of undisputed material facts is uncontroverted.dlse response consisted only of legal conclusions,unsupported assertions,and the opinion of its counsel.it purported to dispute some of csca statements of material facts without reference to any evidence.this approach is totally deficient.without a separate statement of undisputed facts with references to supporting evidence in the form of affidavits or declarations,it is impossible for the opposing party to demonstrate the existence of disputed facts.lewis county of sacramento th,d.
csca statement of undisputed material facts include statements that its instructors are academically and experientially appropriate,it devotes its full attention to educational activities,student financial aid,financial operations,plant and equipment,and student services,and it has established and administered measures of satisfactory academic progress including the maintenance of a grade point average.dlse disputes each statement with the contention plaintiff faculty is not sufficiently educated or academically trained.in support of such assertion it references the declaration of its counsel,thomas kerrigan.kerrigan declaration has no evidentiary content because it simply incorporates as an exhibit csca responses to interrogatories.the declaration is deficient as an evidentiary predicate to a separate statement of material facts.united community church garcin d.
csca has therefore established it has all the indicia of a college.it has an extensive facility with a large and relevant library.the faculty is composed of instructors.its formal curriculum requires completion of weeks of instruction at an established level of performance,consistent with a commitment to provide a comprehensive education to students seeking a career in the restaurant and hotel industry.
csca has obtained accreditation by acics,an independent national institution accrediting organization recognized by the united states secretary of education.it has also been approved by the cbppve pursuant to education code section and title of the california code of regulations section.
in order for an entity to be designated a college,it must apply to and be approved by the cbppve to fulfill the declared legislative intent.section of the education code provides it is the intent of the legislature to promote the effective integration of private postsecondary education into all aspects of california educational system and to foster and improve the educational programs and services of these institutions while protecting the citizens of the state from fraudulent or substandard operations.
it is abundantly apparent that california encourages and validates institutions offering a variety of fields of study and,in compliance with the operative regulation,permits institutions to be designated and recognized as a college.csca has complied with the statutory requirements to be designated a college and,based on its accreditation by acics,it is an accredited college.the fact that it does not include the term college in its name is irrelevant since the issue here is not how it is identified,but what it is in substance.because dlse failed to dispute any of csca statement of undisputed material facts,we resolve this appeal as a question of law.
preliminarily,we address dlse contention that the trial court historical comparative analysis of wage order and the federal labor standard act is,in this case,flawed.we conclude dlse is correct,but,as we shall explain,this error is not dispositive.
the federal and california laws providing for professional exemption from overtime wages,especially as applied to teachers,are significantly different.accordingly,we do not agree that the issue is appropriately addressed by a comparative analysis of the federal and california law.
title of the united states code section a provides an overtime exemption for any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools.the regulations at include in the definition of professional,any employee whose primary duty consists of teaching,tutoring,instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge and who is employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in the school system or educational establishment or institution by which he is employed the federal regulations at g provide that teaching personnel may include,inter alia,teachers of music,trades,automobile driving,and aircraft flight instructors.wilks district of columbia.
california provision for overtime exemption is much narrower than the federal law.iwc wage order,section a includes a person employed in a professional capacity,licensed or certified by the state of california,engaged in teaching in an accredited college or university,and who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment in performing his or her duties.
the trial court held that the rationale and purpose behind exempting professional employees is derived from the fair labor standards act,et it analyzed the issue by a comparison of federal authority with california law,noting that because there is a dearth of california law which specifically addresses whether teachers at an institution like csca are exempt,it is appropriate to look to parallel federal law,here the flsa.the trial court relied on nordquist broadcasting th,d,for the proposition that b ecause the california wage and hour laws are modeled to some extent on federal laws,federal cases may provide persuasive guidance.but the trial court failed to consider the remainder of the paragraph in the appellate opinion however,california professional employee exemption is narrower than that in the flsa,and the administrative employee exemption is somewhat different exemptions are narrowly construed against the employer and their application is limited to those employees plainly and unmistakably within their terms.id.at,d.
