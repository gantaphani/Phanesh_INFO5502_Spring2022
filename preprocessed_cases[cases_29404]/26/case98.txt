ii.statement of facts 
a.the student 
in may,at the time the cse convened,was a boy diagnosed with autism.suffers from global developmental delays,significantly impaired communication and social functioning,and substantial language impairments.he also exhibits physical stereotypy,t apping on surfaces or part of the body and vocal stereotypy,palilalia,which is characterized by n on contextual vocalizations or vocalizations emitted in a high pitched tone.suppl.app.
before turned five years of age,he attended a private preschool,where he was placed in a special education class with a ratio of.thereafter,once transitioned to school age,he attended a public community school,where he was placed in a special education classroom.in,began attending manhattan children center mcc,a private special education school,after determined that the iep produced by the doe for the school year denied a fape.at mcc,received schooling in a classroom with six students and six teachers,a ratio of,and received,among other things,applied behavioral analysis aba therapy,which is an intensive therapy that involves breaking down activities into discrete tasks and rewarding a child accomplishments,at quoting cty.sch.bd.ex rel,cir.

may individualized education program 
in may,a cse team convened for its annual meeting to develop an iep for for the academic year.the cse team was composed of the following members nessan,the school district representative and a doe school psychologist judy sommers schneid,a doe special education teacher mother,parent member marie wise samantha solow,an assistant educational coordinator at mcc marisa savard,one of lead teachers at mcc carrie friedman,occupational therapist at mcc and amy hunt,pathologist at mcc.
prior to the cse meeting,neither nor schneid met with,nor did the doe conduct any evaluation of on its own,aside from a report from march conducted as part of a mandatory review some two years before the cse convened to formulate iep for the school year.rather,the evaluative materials present at the meeting were produced largely by mcc educators and medical professionals who had evaluated or treated based on the recommendations of the doe representatives,who relied on the evaluative materials present at the cse meeting prepared by others,and over the objections of and mcc staff,the iep recommended a placement in a public special education program with a ratio of.moreover,despite and mcc staff urging that the doe incorporate aba therapy into the iep,the iep was silent as to the use of any particular methodology for treating educational needs.the iep did,however,recommend that receive a number of related services three weekly,sessions of individual therapy one weekly,session of group therapy two weekly,sessions of individual physical therapy two weekly,sessions of individual occupational therapy and one weekly,session of group occupational therapy.the iep also recommended that be equipped with a tablet computer with specialized software and voice output in order to increase his independence and social interactions and to serve as a model for language.suppl.app.
because the cse team concluded that behaviors seriously interfered with instruction,the iep required the development of a behavioral intervention plan bip,which was incorporated into the iep.the bip,which is generally used to develop strategies to deal with problem behavior s,dep t of,cir.alterations in original quoting,at,identified physical and vocal stereotypy and noted that it sought to achieve a s ignificant decrease in target behaviors through t ime sampling and partial interval recording,suppl.app.although the bip was based on a functional behavior assessment fba,which was developed and incorporated into the iep,the doe did not conduct an fba of.an fba is an assessment designed to identif y the problem behavior,defin e the behavior in concrete terms,identif y the contextual factors that contribute to the behavior including cognitive and affective factors and formulat e a hypothesis regarding the general conditions under which a behavior usually occurs,at alterations in original quoting comp.codes regs.tit,r.in this case,the fba was based on the draft fba submitted by mcc to the cse.suppl.app.further,iep did not provide for parental counseling or training services,nor did it include any transitional support services for to change schools and programs.
administrative review 
upon receipt of a final notice of recommended placement,advised the doe that she disagreed with recommended placement and that would continue his education at mcc for the academic year.thereafter,filed a due process complaint,claiming that the doe had failed to provide with a fape for the school year,and she consequently sought private school tuition reimbursement at mcc.as relevant here,alleged four separate deficiencies in the iep developed for the doe failed to conduct an fba and failed to develop an appropriate bip the iep failed to provide parent counseling and training as a related service the iep failed to offer transition services and the iep failed to provide a placement in a classroom that implement ed an aba or substantially similar methodology.suppl.app.
impartial hearing officer decision 
following a hearing the iho denied reimbursement request.the iho rejected contention that the fba and bip developed for deprived him of a fape.although the fba for that was contained in the iep was based entirely on the fba prepared by mcc,the iho determined that this did not result in a fape deprivation because t he fba prepared by the cse t ook the information from the fba prepared by mcc and use d it appropriately.suppl.app.the iho observed that the fba appropriately listed the target behaviors it sought to eradicate,identified their root causes,and developed adequate strategies to address those problem behaviors.
the iho also concluded that,although no services were included in iep to assist with his transition from mcc to the proposed public school placement,the doe did not deprive of a fape.the iho relied on hearing testimony that generally did not struggle with transitioning between classrooms in the past,and also pointed to testimony from,that the doe felt that the services that we re recommended would enable to make the transition from where he presently was to a public school setting.suppl.app.
the iho additionally considered the iep recommendation of a classroom and found it to be appropriate.the iho was persuaded that observation that need ed the interaction with peers would argue for a classroom setting where there was an abundance of interaction,rather than primarily one to one instruction.suppl.app.the iho also noted that attention had vastly improved and that the child was less in need of that intervention,and that,in any event,even if poor attending skills persisted,this would not demand attention,as such skills could be adequately addressed in a class.suppl.app.
finally,the iho rejected view that required intensive aba therapy.in rejecting this argument,the iho noted that t here was no requirement that a particular methodology be set forth on the iep or provided to a s tudent,or that the preference as to the methodology of any particular evaluator or p arent be adopted.suppl.app.it thus concluded that the methodology should be left to the discretion of the professionals who w ould be working with.suppl.app.
although the iho concluded that the iep complied with the idea,the iho did not address contention that the omission of parental training and counseling services in the iep deprived of a fape.
state review officer decision 
appealed the iho decision to an sro,who affirmed.as to the lack of parent counseling and training services in the iep,the sro faulted the iho for not addressing its absence in the iep,but nonetheless determined that,although the iep should have provided for such services,its omission did not result in a fape deprivation.suppl.app.it based this conclusion on iho hearing testimony that it was explained to the parent at the outset that parent counseling and training was one of the defining features of the recommended special class placement.suppl.app.quoting suppl.app.further,the sro reasoned that the presence or absence of parent training and counseling in an iep does not necessarily have a direct effect on the substantive adequacy of the plan.suppl.app.citing,at.
next,the sro rejected claim that required a classroom with aba therapy in order to progress and was denied a fape when he was assigned to a classroom that lacked an aba program.as to the adequacy of the class size itself,the sro credited testimony that the special class was an intens ive behavioral intervention,in that it was a rigorous program in a small special education classroom that employed a variety of methodologies to treat each student educational needs.suppl.app.quoting suppl.app.the sro also found persuasive testimony that he believed could make meaningful progress had the may iep been implemented as written because special education services needed to be delivered within some social context to allow for modeling and shared instruction.suppl.app.
moreover,the sro found methodology argument equally unavailing because,in the sro view,a cse is generally not required to specify methodology on an iep,and the precise teaching methodology to be used by a student teacher is usually a matter to be left to the teacher.suppl.app.the sro reasoned that,although the may cse did not recommend aba therapy services,it also did not disapprove of the methodology or say aba should not be used with the student.suppl.app.the sro also observed that,t he doe school psychologist,indicated that the may cse recommendations incorporated behavioral methodologies,and the special class recommendation was not contrary to aba.suppl.app.thus,the sro concluded that the absence of aba therapy in iep did not deprive the child of a fape.
the sro did not,however,address challenge to the adequacy of fba and bip or the lack of transitional services contained in the iep.
district court review 
thereafter,brought suit in the district court,claiming procedural and substantive violations under the idea,resulting in the deprivation of a fape for.the parties each separately moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the doe motion,affirming the sro decision and denying claim for tuition reimbursement,wl,at.
as to the procedural adequacy of the iep,the district court considered and denied challenge to the adequacy of the fba and bip contained in the iep,because the fba and bip incorporated into the iep were c onsistent with the mcc,and adequately identifie d the problem behavior and prescribe d ways to manage it.id.at quoting,at.the district court rejected claim that,because the cse had inadequately reproduced the mcc draft on which the iep fba and bip were based,was deprived of a fape.the district court reasoned that,so long as the doe own is adequate,it does not matter that the doe draft omitted mcc charts,citations to academic support,or other information.id.the district court thus concluded that the fba and bip were suitable to needs.id.
the district court also concluded that the failure to provide parent counseling and training in the iep,although a violation of new york law,was not fatal to the adequacy of the iep.the district court observed that it was explained to the parent at the outset that one of the defining features of this program was that it did have a parent training component to it as well,as part of the program,id.quoting suppl.app,and thus was unable to demonstrate in what manner either she or her son were injured as a result of the omission of parental counseling and training services in the iep.
in addition,the district court rejected contention that the lack of a formal transition plan for into his new public school program deprived of a fape,because ha d not identified any legal requirement that an iep contain a transition plan,nor ha d articulated why the absence of such a plan was so significant as to deny him a fape.id.at third alteration in original quoting,at.
the district court then turned to the iep substantive adequacy and rejected claim that required a classroom that guaranteed aba therapy all day,because t hat dispute is a debate over educational methodology,based on the record before the sro,in which case courts typically defer to the decision of the sro.id.at citing dep t of,cir.the district court noted that this court had held in that,where almost all of the reports before an iho find that a student needs aba therapy,and the remaining evidence emphasizes that the student needs a high level of support,the doe may not endorse a classroom with no guarantee of aba therapy or any meaningful support.id.quoting,at.the district court distinguished case from,however,because this was not,in its view,a case in which the doe ignored the clear consensus of the student evaluators.id.quoting,at.rather,according to the district court,although the sro and iho deviated from the consensus of the parent evidence,including the representatives from mcc,their conclusion was consistent with the views of the evaluator on the cse,who believed that a setting would better facilitate goals,particularly developing reciprocity,developing an awareness of peers,and maneuvering himself within the context of other children within a classroom setting,id.quoting suppl.app.thus,according to the district court,the cse may come to an independent conclusion of the student needs from the content of the evaluation reports the cse need not simply accept the conclusion of those reports absent an evaluation with the student.id.emphasis in original.
as to the iep silence on the provision of aba therapy,the district court observed that,although t he setting did not expressly include aba,it also did not exclude aba.id.the district court credited iho hearing testimony that the doe deliberately formulated the iep in this manner because it did want to tie the hands of the different disciplines that would be working with by requiring a specific methodology for part or all of the day.id.quoting suppl.app.the district court also agreed with the iho determination that mcc might have preferred a different methodology,but this preference d id not have to guide the decisions of the cse.id.quoting suppl.app.
discussion 
we undergo a circumscribed de novo review of a district court grant of summary judgment in the idea context because the responsibility for determining whether a challenged iep will provide a child with a fape rests in the first instance with administrative hearing and review officers,at alteration in original quoting,at.our review requires a more critical appraisal of the agency determination than review but nevertheless falls well short of complete de novo review,at alterations in original quoting lenn portland sch,cir.accordingly,our de novo review only seeks to independently verify that the administrative record supports the district court determination that a student iep was adequate,at.this verification requires that we engage in an independent review of the administrative record and make a determination based on a preponderance of the evidence.gagliardo arlington cent.sch,cir.quoting milford bd.of,cir.

issues for judicial review 
in order to determine whether parents of a disabled child are entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred at a private school in an idea challenge to a iep,we are guided by the test the doe must establish that the student iep actually provided a fape should the doe fail to meet that burden,the parents are entitled to reimbursement if they establish that their unilateral placement was appropriate and the equities favor them,at footnote omitted see also florence cty.sch.dist.four carter,sch.comm.of town of burlington dep t of.here,the parties dispute focuses entirely on the adequacy of may iep.in reviewing the adequacy of the iep,we make a inquiry that is,first,procedural,and second,substantive,to determine whether an iep complies with the idea,at,the burden of proof resting with the doe,see educ.law c.
procedural compliance 
at step one,we examine whether there were procedural violations of the idea,namely,whether the state has complied with the procedures set forth in the idea,at quoting cerra pawling cent.sch,cir.the initial procedural inquiry is no mere formality,walczak.union free sch,cir,as i t acts as a safeguard against arbitrary or erroneous decisionmaking,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting evans bd.of educ.of rhinebeck cent.sch,supp,parker.a procedural violation will entitle a parent to tuition reimbursement if it impeded the child right to a fape,significantly impeded the parents opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process,or caused a deprivation of educational benefits,at quoting f e ii ex rel.bd.of educ.of the chappaqua cent.sch,cir.that is,parents must articulate how a procedural violation resulted in the iep substantive inadequacy or affected the process,at.m ultiple procedural violations,however,may cumulatively result in the denial of a fape even if the violations considered individually do not,at alterations in original quoting,at.
here,alleges three procedural errors in the formulation of iep,which,in her view,independently and cumulatively deprived of a fape.
functional behavior assessment and behavioral intervention plan 
new york regulations require the doe to conduct an fba for a student whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others.comp.codes regs.tit,b v.an fba must include the identification of the problem behavior,the definition of the behavior in concrete terms,the identification of the contextual factors that contribute to the behavior,and the formulation of a hypothesis regarding the general conditions under which a behavior usually occurs and probable consequences that serve to maintain it.id.r.its purpose is to ensure that the iep drafters have sufficient information about the student behaviors to craft a plan that will appropriately address those behaviors,at.
in addition,where,as here,a student behavior impedes his learning,a bip must be developed with strategies to deal with the problem behavior s,at quoting,at citing comp.codes regs.tit,b.new york regulation requires that a bip be based on the results of a n fba and,at a minimum,include a description of the problem behavior,global and specific hypotheses as to why the problem behavior occurs and intervention strategies that include positive behavioral supports and services to address the behavior.comp.codes regs.tit,mmm.
where the doe fails to conduct an fba of its own,we must take particular care to ensure that the iep adequately addresses the child problem behaviors,at,but the iep will be rendered legally deficient only where it fails to adequately identif y a student behavioral impediments and fails to implement strategies to address that behavior,at.where the iep is found to be deficient in this regard,we have held this to rise to the level of a serious procedural violation because it may prevent the cse from obtaining necessary information about the student behaviors,leading to their being addressed in the iep inadequately or not at all,at.s uch a failure seriously impairs substantive review of the iep because courts can not determine exactly what information an fba would have yielded and whether that information would be consistent with the student iep.id.
here,the iep indicated that behavior seriously interfered with his instruction and therefore required the development of a bip.as noted,a bip must be based on the results of an fba.see comp.codes regs.tit,mmm.rather than conduct his own evaluation of,however,the school district representative and doe psychologist present at the may cse meeting,relied on an october fba and bip performed by mcc and submitted to the doe prior to the cse meeting in order to develop fba and bip for the iep.
contends that the doe failure to conduct an fba of its own and develop a bip from its own assessment of constitutes a serious procedural violation of the idea,which resulted in a fape deprivation.she argues further that the bip and fba incorporated into iep lacked certain information contained in the draft versions formulated by mcc.for instance,according to,the bip contains no intervention strategies that include positive behavioral supports and services to address the behavior,and the fba lacks any information about the use of functional communication training,intensive tact instruction,and matched stimuli.pl.br.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,for,the fba and bip incorporated into iep were inadequate and were thus not reasonably calculated to afford an opportunity to obtain educational benefits,resulting in a denial of a fape.
we note at the outset that argument is not without some persuasive force.described the fba included in the iep as more of a summary of mcc behavior assessment with the consensus of the meeting at the time,and stated that maybe minutes was spent by the cse creating this summary and developing the bip at the meeting.suppl.app.indeed,the barebones nature of the bip and fba included in the iep makes this apparent,particularly when compared with the bip and fba produced by mcc.this,of course,is not surprising,given that never actually met or evaluated until after the formulation of his iep,a violation of new york law.see comp.codes regs.tit,b v a n individual evaluation of the referred student shall be initiated by a cse and shall be completed within days of receipt of consent t he initial evaluation must include at least a n fba for a student whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others,as necessary to ascertain the physical,mental,behavioral and emotional factors which contribute to the suspected disabilities.
as to the bip incorporated into iep,we have no difficulty in concluding that it is legally inadequate.although it was based on the results of mcc fba and includes a description of the problem behavior,it does not provide certain minimum requirements,at,such as global and specific hypotheses as to why the problem behavior occurs and intervention strategies that include positive behavioral supports and services to address the behavior,comp.codes regs.tit,mmm.indeed,we recently expressed concern in situations such as this where the iep contains a bip that fails to attempt to identify the root causes of behavior deficiencies,because it deprives the cse of the ability to adequately provide effective treatment for these behaviors,thereby casting doubt on the adequacy of its provisions for treating them,at.
although deficient,we have also stressed that the inadequacy of an fba or bip will not necessarily render an iep legally inadequate under the idea so long as the iep adequately identifies a student behavioral impediments and implements strategies to address that behavior,at.here,the fba,which was also incorporated into iep,included the required information that was lacking in the bip.the fba hypothesizes that palilalia and physical stereotypy are caused by l ack of active engagement and that reacts in such a manner because of s ensory stimulation,task avoidance,and a ccess to preferred attention or toy.suppl.app.the fba further lists several strategies previously attempted,such as the use of r edirection and refocus,r eplac ing verbal stereotyp y with communication skills,and e xpand ing repertoire of reinforcer and play skills,and suggests continuing the use of such strategies moving forward.suppl.app.in addition,the fba lists positive behavioral techniques that have proven to be successful in the past,including providing with a ccess to certain toys,action figures,computer,dinosaur related toys and activities.suppl.app.last,the fba also identifies the end goal,seeking to decrease verbal and motor stereotyp y,and notes that it would measure progress and the success of these strategies through p artial interval recording and time sampling.suppl.app.these descriptions adequately identif y the problem behavior s and prescribe ways to manage them,in accordance with new york law,at.
although there are undeniable differences between the fba and bip included in iep and the far more detailed and thorough fba and bip created by mcc,iep incorporated the overall material substance of the mcc fba and bip,albeit in a more limited form.that the versions ultimately prepared and incorporated into iep were less comprehensive than those developed by current private school education provider does not mean that was deprived of a fape.indeed,aside from pointing to certain differences between mcc and the doe fbas and bips such as the lack of any mention of history of crying,which has been successfully treated,at times,through redirection and immediate return to activity,does not describe how such omissions rise to the level of a fape deprivation that is,in what manner ability to meaningfully progress would be delayed as a result of the deficiencies identified in the iep fba and bip.
accordingly,although the bip developed for is deficient in a number of important respects,when viewed together with the fba,the iep nonetheless adequately identifies behavioral impediments and implements strategies to address th ose behavior s,at.thus,was not deprived of a fape as a result of the fba and bip that were included in his iep.
parental counseling and training 
next,contends that the doe failure to provide for parental counseling and training services in iep constituted a violation of the procedures of the idea,thereby contributing to a fape denial.for educational programs for students with autism,new york requires that an iep include a p rovision for parent counseling and training for the purpose of enabling parents to perform appropriate intervention activities at home,at alterations in original quoting comp.codes regs.tit,d.the inclusion of such services in the iep is intended to assist parents in understanding the special needs of their child provid e parents with information about child development and help parents to acquire the necessary skills that will allow them to support the implementation of their child iep.comp.codes regs.tit,kk.although a violation of new york regulations,w e have repeatedly held that parental counseling and training omissions are less serious procedural violations because the presence or absence of a provision does not necessarily have a direct effect on the substantive adequacy of the iep,at second alteration in original quoting,at.this is so because school districts are required to provide parent counseling,and thus remain accountable for their failure to do so no matter the contents of the iep.id.alteration in original quoting,at.
here,the sro found that the doe erred by failing to provide for parent counseling and training in the iep,in violation of new york law.it appears that this may not be an anomaly.if the doe failure to comply with d in formulating the terms of ieps for students with autism has become a common practice,such a development would be cause for concern.see,at dep t of,cir.summary order dep t of,cir.summary order ex rel.dep t of,cir.ex rel.dep t of,cir.summary order,at ex rel.dep t of,cir.summary order ex rel.dep t of,region,cir.summary order,at.the sro nonetheless concluded,in accordance with this court caselaw,that this omission did not result in a fape deprivation.see,at.importantly,the sro also observed that,at the cse meeting,it was explained to the parent at the outset that parent counseling and training was one of the defining features of the recommended special class placement.suppl.app.quoting suppl.app.
we defer to that analysis.while its absence from the iep constitutes a violation of the procedures of the idea,evidence that program actually offered parental counseling and training services and that was made aware of its presence at the cse meeting makes clear that the omission of parental counseling and training in the iep itself was nothing more than an immaterial procedural violation.see,at.
transitional support services 
next argues that required support services to assist in his transition from his private school classroom at mcc to the less restrictive public school placement in his iep.contends that the inclusion of such transitional services in the iep was compelled by comp.codes regs.tit,a.she maintains that,a s a student with autism,resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines require d transitional support,and that the doe failure to address his transitional needs was likely to lead to regression in his behaviors,and thus in his educational performance.pl.br.thus,in view,because the iep was devoid of transitional support services for,as required by new york law,was deprived of a fape.the doe,on the other hand,insists that there is no legal requirement that an iep contain a transition plan,and even if there were,did not articulate why the absence of such a plan was so significant as to deny an appropriate education.def.br.quoting,at.
although we agree that the absence of a transition plan or services to assist with transition between classrooms did not deprive him of a fape,there is some confusion here that bears further explanation.comp.codes regs.tit,a,provides that,
i n those instances where a student with autism has been placed in programs containing students with other disabilities,or in a regular class placement,a special education teacher with a background in teaching students with autism shall provide transitional support services in order to assure that the student special education needs are being met.
comp.codes regs.tit,a.although the iho made no such finding the district court concluded that there was no legal requirement that an iep contain a transition plan,wl,at quoting,at.while this might be true,the district court nonetheless failed to appreciate that there remained a violation of a.that is,although the idea does not require the inclusion of a formal transition plan in an autistic student iep that describes services to assist with the child transition into a public school classroom or less restrictive educational setting,new york law imposes a separate requirement that,under such conditions,the iep describe support services to be provided to the student public special education teacher in the classroom,which were absent from iep.see comp.codes regs.tit,ddd transitional support services means those temporary services,specified in a student iep,provided to a regular or special education teacher to aid in the provision of appropriate services to a student with a disability transferring to a regular program or to a program or service in a less restrictive environment.emphases added id.c transitional support services prescribed in the iep shall be provided for a teacher upon the recommendation of the cse,and shall be specified in the student iep.emphasis added.
just as with an omission of parental training and counseling services in the iep,which concerns services that are to be delivered to an individual other than the child itself,the absence of such services that are expressly required by law to be included in a child iep constitutes a violation of the procedures of the idea.similarly,school districts are required by a to provide transitional support services,id.a,to an autistic student special education teacher in order to assure that the student special education needs are being met,no matter the contents of the iep,and they thus remain accountable for their failure to do so,permitting a parent of an aggrieved child to file a complaint at any time if they feel the ir child is not receiving this service,at citing comp.codes regs.tit,d.
importantly,these regulations contemplate that,where,as here,a student with a disability transfer s to a regular program or to a program or service in a less restrictive environment,the student new classroom teacher may require temporary services to ensure that the student particular educational needs are being adequately treated in the new learning environment.comp.codes regs.tit,ddd.this makes sense,as a classroom teacher may not necessarily be equipped or trained at the outset to treat certain conditions or behaviors that are unique to the new student joining his or her classroom.however,as with the inclusion of any other provision in the iep,the ultimate beneficiary of its presence,or the individual harmed by its absence,is the student,whose likelihood to progress under the proposed program becomes markedly less certain as terms and conditions imposed by law are wanting from the iep.
we note that this view is not in tension with our holding in,which held only that there was no legal requirement that an iep contain a transition plan that is,that there was nothing in the law that required a description in the iep of transitional support services to be provided directly to the student.see,at.we do not purport to suggest otherwise.rather,we hold that new york law requires an iep to identify temporary transitional support services to be provided to an autistic student new classroom teacher when that student is transferring from a private school to a public school program or to a less restrictive classroom setting.see comp.codes regs.tit,a id.ddd id.c.
moreover,in we rejected an argument concerning the absence of transitional support services for the student in the iep because the parents had failed to articulate why the absence of such services in the iep was so significant as to deny the child a fape,at.here,like there,has similarly failed to offer a persuasive reason why the absence of transitional services to be provided to public school classroom teacher deprived of a fape.indeed,the iho reached the same conclusion,based in part on hearing testimony from friedman,occupational therapist at mcc,who stated that,although had initially had a really hard time with transitions going from the classroom to occupational therapy or between different places,he had made really nice gains in that where he transitions not only from the classroom to occupational therapy,but between preferred and activities without any behavioral overreactions.suppl.app.this evidence suggests that,because had made significant progress in his ability to transition between classroom settings without resulting in any notable problems,the failure to specify transitional support services in the iep for teacher could not have deprived of a fape.
accordingly,we hold that,although the absence of transitional support services in the iep for public school classroom teacher was a procedural violation,it did not deprive of a fape.
cumulative effect 
although w e have previously held that m ultiple procedural violations may cumulatively result in the denial of a fape even if the violations considered individually do not,at quoting,at,that is not the case here.having identified four procedural errors the failure on the part of the doe to conduct an fba of its own,the development of an inadequate bip,the failure to include formal parent counseling and training services in the iep,and the omission of transitional support services in the iep for public school teacher,none of which affected the substance of program,this is not the rare case where the violations,when taken together,impeded the child right to a fape or caused a deprivation of educational benefits,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,no fape denial resulted cumulatively from the procedural errors committed by the doe in formulating iep.
substantive adequacy
