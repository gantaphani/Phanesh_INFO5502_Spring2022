the present action arising under the individuals with disabilities education act the idea,to,involves a dispute regarding who should bear the expense of in and occupational therapy services received by during the summer of,the summer between jh kindergarten and first grade school years jh suffers from a high functioning form of autism which is often referred to as asperger disorder.
jh and his parents,jd and ss,collectively the plaintiffs,contend the idea statutorily obligates the school board for henrico county,virginia the county to bear the expense of these services because they were necessary to prevent the gains that jh had made during his regular kindergarten school year from being significantly jeopardized.the plaintiffs have already paid for such services and seek reimbursement from the county in this action.the plaintiffs also seek attorney fees and costs in the matter.
the county,in contrast,contends that the lesser amount of and occupational therapy services prescribed in the individual educational program iep that it proposed for jh for the summer of,along with other services prescribed therein,met that goal and,therefore,it bears no reimbursement obligation and no obligation to pay the plaintiffs attorney fees and costs in the matter.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county.we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
before setting forth the relevant facts and lengthy procedural history of this case,an exposition of some pertinent statutory and regulatory background is in order.in general,the idea requires all states receiving federal funds for education to provide each child between the ages of three and,who has a disability,with a free appropriate public education a fape.a a.congress enacted the idea,in part,to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living.id.d a.significantly,however,while the idea requires states to provide specialized instruction and related services sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child,the idea does not require the furnishing of every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child potential.hartmann loudoun county bd.of,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the idea mandates that a school district receiving federal funds provide an appropriate iep for each disabled child.mm school dist.of greenville county,cir.an appropriate iep must contain statements concerning a disabled child level of functioning,set forth measurable annual achievement goals,describe the services to be provided,and establish objective criteria for evaluating the child progress.id.every iep is required to be prepared by an iep team,which team consists of at least one representative of the school district,the child teacher,the child parents or guardian and,where appropriate,the child himself.d b.
there is no dispute that jh suffers from a high functioning form of autism which qualifies him as disabled under the idea.as we observed in mm with respect to another child suffering from autism 
autism adversely impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills.individuals suffering from autism experience,inter alia,preoccupation with inner thoughts,daydreams,and fantasies,and they have difficulty communicating.
despite suffering from autism,jh attended kindergarten in a regular classroom setting during the school year.he did so at dumbarton elementary school dumbarton under an agreed iep with the county the kindergarten iep.as required by the idea,the kindergarten iep set forth specific goals for jh to master by the end of his regular kindergarten school year.in order to meet these goals,which numbered,the kindergarten iep provided jh six hours per day of services by an instructional assistant in addition to two hours of therapy per week one hour and one hour and two hours of occupational therapy per week thirty minutes,thirty minutes,and one hour integrated.
nancy smith slp smith,a county employee and pathologist with years experience,provided jh his therapy at dumbarton,while carolyn stone ot stone,a county employee and occupational therapist with years experience,provided jh his occupational therapy at dumbarton.during jh regular kindergarten school year,slp smith and ot stone each saw jh at least three times per week and talked regularly with his classroom teacher,howard everett teacher everett,and the instructional assistant the county assigned to jh,cara phillips instr.phillips.
testing at the end of jh regular kindergarten school year revealed that he had mastered three of the goals specified in the kindergarten iep and made progress in all but two of the others.nonetheless,although jh had improved his skills with respect to using language appropriately in social situations,referred to as social pragmatics,he remained seriously behind his peers in that area.jh also remained seriously behind his peers with respect to handwriting skills.
although children attending school in the county do not normally attend school during the summer,on june,the county members of jh iep team issued a final proposed iep for jh for the summer of the summer iep.in idea parlance,educational services provided to a disabled child during the summer in a school system where children do not normally attend school during the summer are called extended school year services esy services.
the summer iep provided that,while attending the regular ten week summer school session at dumbarton,jh would receive thirty minutes per week for the entire summer school session of consultation between the special education teacher and the regular classroom teacher assistance from an instructional assistant three hours per day,four days per week from june to june,assistance from an instructional assistant four hours per day,four days per week from july through august,assistance from an instructional assistant three hours per day,five days per week from august to august,ten hours per week of special education from august through september,integrated speech therapy conducted in four sessions over the course of the summer for a total of two hours direct occupational therapy conducted in five sessions over the course of the summer for a total of two and one half hours three sessions of consultative occupational and four sessions of consultative speech therapy.the may,cover letter accompanying the summer iep that slp smith and ot stone sent to the plaintiffs stated,inter alia s ocial language skills are best learned in social settings with peers a lthough handwriting is an area of weakness he seems to perform this activity best while in the classroom setting and not while under individual scrutiny jh needs to be with typically developing peers to work on social language and fine motor skills and p eer modeling with some direction from an instructional assistant under the direction of the speech pathologist and occupational therapist is appropriate to meet jh needs.
the plaintiffs objected to the summer iep on the ground that it provided jh inadequate amounts of direct and occupational therapy.the plaintiffs wanted such therapy to continue at the same level as the kindergarten iep.in response,the county steadfastly adhered to the summer iep as best for jh.based on slp smith and ot stone experience with jh during his regular kindergarten school year,both believed that jh had difficulty generalizing social language skills taught in therapy sessions to other real life settings such as the classroom,the playground,and home.therefore,rather than focusing on direct therapy services during the summer of,slp smith and ot stone believed that jh would best be served by receiving esy services focused on improving his peer communication skills.
when the county refused to amend the summer iep in response to their objection,the plaintiffs made up the difference in and occupational therapy services at their own expense.meanwhile,the plaintiffs pursued their administrative remedies before a state administrative hearing officer the hearing officer,inter alia,to obtain reimbursement from the county for the privately paid therapy services.
jh attended summer school at dumbarton during the summer of with nine other,rising first graders.patricia king summer teacher king taught the summer school class in a general education classroom setting.
this case has been before the hearing officer twice.the first hearing hearing i was held on july,and concluded on august.
before the hearing officer in hearing i,both sides offered several live witnesses and written evidence in support of their respective positions.the plaintiffs offered the live expert testimony of ronald david,david,or david,donald oswald,oswald,or oswald,and occupational therapist gerri allen ot allen.the county offered the live expert testimony of slp smith and ot stone.jh parents,instr.phillips,and summer teacher king also testified.
david,an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the medical college of virginia,is an expert in pediatric neurology and autism.he testified before the hearing officer and submitted a written report.prior to preparing his report testifying,david conducted an and lengthy interview of jh mother regarding jh,personally examined jh for an hour and a half,reviewed jh medical history,reviewed what appears to be all pertinent prepared by county personnel regarding jh reviewed jh ieps through the summer iep,and reviewed the private of jh prepared by jh private therapists.
david testified that autism is a social learning disability.according to david,children with autism,may have the words,they may have the lexicon,the internal dictionary,to be able to talk,but they ca,basically,put their thoughts into what we call pragmatic terms,that is,they can not initiate or respond to who,why,when,how,where questions.notably,david testified that children with autism have a profound ability to regress,and that if jh did not participate in an intensive program during the summer of,h e going to regress,such that you have to go back and reinvent the wheel,not completely,not from the ground up,but you are going to have to go back and basically retool.from the context of david full testimony,it is clear that he is referring to an intensive program regarding pragmatic language skills.for david,the four hours per day,four hours per week of summer school provided in the summer iep would not be appropriate for jh unless a pathologist was in the classroom as a monitor.
david also testified that children have a great window of opportunity for language learning that begins to close by age eight or nine,and thus,if you mark time with a child who has autism,you lose.if you decelerate services,you lose.and that if you going to make an impact,the only way to make an impact is to continually accelerate services within the child limit of tolerance.id.
oswald,a licensed clinical psychologist who works exclusively with autistic children and adults at the medical college of virginia,is an expert in autism.he testified before the hearing officer and submitted a report.
oswald had evaluated jh over the course of one year prior to the time the present dispute arose regarding the summer iep.in his report,oswald opined that r educing the frequency of related services represents a significant change and a threat to the progress that jh and his teachers have worked so hard to achieve.similarly,oswald testified that without receiving two hours of direct therapy and two hours of direct occupational therapy per week during the summer of,jh would not continue to develop and would likely experience regression.notably,in his report,oswald disagreed with the peer modeling approach recommended by slp smith and ot stone as an appropriate approach for jh to learn pragmatic language skills.oswald clearly stated in his report that c hildren with asperger disorder do not learn pragmatic language skills by exposure to typical peers or by participation in classroom group activities they learn these skills by intensive individual instruction and by rehearsal,prompting,and reinforcement in individual and small group settings.
while oswald did not observe jh in the school setting in formulating his conclusions,oswald did perform clinical interviews of jh in his office on three occasions over the course of a year for a total of five hours.he also reviewed a battery of tests that had been administered to jh,as well as the other relevant information reviewed by david.
ot allen,a licensed occupational therapist with years experience,served as jh private occupational therapist beginning in.in her testimony before the hearing officer,she recommended that jh continue to receive of direct occupational therapy two times per week for eleven weeks during the summer of so as not to regress.besides observing jh in occupational therapy sessions,ot allen observed jh in two occupational group therapy camps in the summer of.she reported that he did well in the camp with only five other children,but had much difficulty being in the camp with twelve other children.according to ot allen,in the larger group,jh became highly aroused,started a lot of behaviors of facial grimacing,anxious pacing,and pointing his finger at kids.because jh could not satisfactorily function in the larger camp,ot allen created and placed him in a therapy group,supervised by two occupational therapists.
ot allen also strongly disagreed with the peer modeling approach recommended by slp smith and ot stone in the summer iep as the appropriate approach for jh to work on fine motor skills associated with occupational therapy for children such as handwriting and.ot allen based her disagreement on her professional opinion that jh is easily over stimulated in any setting other than or small group,and he has no way to control his environment in the peer modeling approach espoused by slp smith and ot stone.in ot allen view,the over stimulation significantly interferes with jh ability to work on assigned tasks.
instr.phillips 
the county assigned instr.phillips to jh six hours per school day during his regular kindergarten school year.instr.phillips testified before the hearing officer that after an interruption in jh educational program such as thanksgiving break,christmas break,and illnesses,he suffered a major loss in his ability to perform.in regard to how long jh took to recoup from such a major loss,she testified that i t varied.after christmas break,it was about two months before his behavior started to get under control again.id.regarding what type of adverse behavior he had for two months,she testified 
screaming,throwing things,hitting me,kicking at me,ripping up paper,getting up and running out from me at different points in time.pretty much everything you can imagine,short never bit.he not a biter.but he would sometimes be aggressive towards me.he would often be,scratching himself,hitting himself,banging his head against the wall,poking at his eyes.and,at times,it got so bad that i took him out of the classroom and did all of his work in the room that we worked in the afternoon.so there were times where he was in the classroom pretty much the entire day.
inst.phillips also reported that,based upon her observations,jh behavior is generally better in a session than in a group.she explained what often happened with jh in group sessions with the county therapists 
often times in groups,jh would get very agitated.he would use inappropriate language.he would do this little hand thrust thing that he does when he very angry.several times he would have to be asked to sit down,away from the table,away from the group,because he could participate in the activities.
at the time of her testimony,instr.phillips was employed at the virginia autism center.she holds a bachelor of science degree from william and mary,where she graduated cum laude.prior to being assigned to jh,she had worked with other autistic children in massachusetts as well as richmond,virginia.
slp smith,a pathologist with years experience,provided jh his therapy at dumbarton during his regular kindergarten school year.thus,during jh regular kindergarten school year,slp smith saw jh at least three times per week and talked regularly with teacher everett and instr.phillips.
slp smith testified before the hearing officer that,in the area of pragmatic language skills,jh 
needs to learn in a small group setting of his peers.his deficit is in social pragmatics,that is,the interaction with other people.he think he been working with adults for so long,he needs now to learn how to work with his peers.that my area of concern,that he needs to work more with his peers.
according to slp smith,jh needs to interact with his peers in a natural setting,because he lacks the ability to generalize,to take what he has learned in therapy sessions and apply it in other settings such as the classroom,playground,or cafeteria.notably,slp smith testified that it was not her position that jh learned more or responded better in a group of peers rather than in a session with an adult.
on the issue of actual progress during the summer of,slp smith testified that,as of july,she had witnessed jh undergo an amazing growth in social pragmatics.she based her opinion on three integrated sessions that she had with jh in the classroom and an unspecified amount of time that she spent observing jh in the school cafeteria and on the playground.
ot stone,an occupational therapist with years experience,provided jh his occupational therapy services at dumbarton during his regular kindergarten school year.thus,during jh regular kindergarten school year,ot stone saw jh at least three times per week and talked regularly with teacher everett and instr.phillips before the hearing officer,ot stone was qualified as an expert in occupational therapy in working with autistic children.
ot stone concurred in the recommendation for peer modeling and testified that jh works best in the classroom which is the natural setting for him,that he needs to practice and reinforce what he has been taught in all settings,and that he does not need an occupational therapist while he does so.according to ot stone,after holiday breaks,jh only had a day or two where he had a difficult time performing to his maximum potential.on the issue of whether jh made actual progress in his occupational therapy skills during the summer of,ot stone testified that she had seen progress in jh handwriting,drawing,and cutting skills.
pathologist lisa wright 
as part of their case,the plaintiffs offered a report by lisa wright,jh private pathologist.lisa wright slp wright based her conclusions on twelve years experience as both a clinical and pathologist,her experience working with jh twice a week since march,her testing of jh,and her review of various documents about jh from the county,including the separate spring evaluations of jh conducted by slp smith and ot stone.according to slp wright,jh has shown a marked tendency to regress during previous breaks in services and,without an intensive esy program,he will definitely experience substantial regression over the summer.
slp wright regarded the summer iep as inadequate in the area of.she recommended that jh receive not less than sessions of speech therapy at least minutes each over the weeks of summer vacation compared to the hours proposed by the county.id.notably,while this was less than the number of hours sought by the plaintiffs,slp wright premised her lower recommendation on the condition that services from the county would be supplemented by jh parents.
special education teacher helen mcgrath 
the plaintiffs also submitted a questionnaire the esy questionnaire,completed by helen mcgrath,entitled consideration for extended school year esy henrico county public schools.as dumbarton special education teacher,helen mcgrath set mcgrath was responsible for completing the questionnaire.although set mcgrath did not actually teach jh,per the kindergarten iep,she did provide teacher everett and instr.phillips with one hour each week of special education consulting services regarding jh.set mcgrath reported on the esy questionnaire that teacher everett and instr.phillips both reported that jh experienced loss of social skills as well as performance after absences.
the esy questionnaire expressly states 
extended school year esy is designed to provide a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities who experience significant regression of critical life skills because of an interruption in the instructional program.the information you provide below will assist in determining whether the above named student qualifies for esy.
of relevance to the mm standard for esy services,the questionnaire asks w hat previous interruption in the educational program has caused a permanent,irreparable or major loss in this student ability to perform.mcgrath answered after illness.jh has great difficulty reorienting to the school environment,structure,and social settings.he seems to have anxiety,difficulty transitioning,and general performance in school setting.id.the questionnaire also asks what permanent,irreparable or major loss of critical life skills will occur as a result of interruption of this student education id.set mcgrath answered emerging communication,social,behavioral sensory skills,cognitive skills,and fine motor skills.id.
summer teacher king 
summer teacher king testified before the hearing officer that jh was doing well in the classroom with ten children,but had a hard time with the larger group of children on the playground.she reported that she had seen improvement in jh social pragmatic and occupational skills over the time during which she had taught him,which was four hours per day for twelve days spread over a three week period.
conclusion of hearing i 
following the contested hearing on the appropriateness of the summer iep,the hearing officer ordered the summer iep amended to provide jh with two hours of therapy per week and two hours of occupational therapy per week.he also ordered that the stated goal of the summer iep be amended from maintaining to making reasonable progress.the hearing officer did not actually address the reimbursement issue.
disposition of the district court the first time 
the case then came before the district court,which overturned the hearing officer decision and entered judgment in favor of the county.the plaintiffs appealed.
disposition of the fourth circuit the first time 
on appeal,we vacated the district court judgment in favor of the county and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to further remand the case to the hearing officer for a finding as to whether the level of services provided in the summer iep was adequate to prevent the gains that jh had made in his and occupational skills during his regular kindergarten school year from being significantly jeopardized.see jh henrico county sch.bd.jh i,cir.the remand was necessitated by issuance of our decision in mm,at,of which neither the hearing officer nor the district court had the benefit at the time of their respective decisions.in mm,the fourth circuit announced,for the first time,a formal standard for determining when a school district is obligated to provide esy services to a disabled child.id.at.
hearing ii 
on remand,the hearing officer held a hearing in august in which he did not hear or consider any new evidence,but did consider new written and oral arguments.on october,the hearing officer issued his written opinion on remand,again ruling in favor of the plaintiffs.the thirteen page opinion first sets forth background information regarding the case in general and then background information specifically regarding jh.the opinion is then broken down into two separate substantive sections,a conclusion,and a section entitled order.
the first substantive section outlines,in considerable detail,the evidence before the hearing officer on the question of whether the level of services provided in the summer iep was adequate to prevent the gains that jh had made in his and occupational skills during his regular kindergarten school year from being significantly jeopardized.in the second substantive section,the hearing officer,as we instructed in jh i,addressed the window of op
