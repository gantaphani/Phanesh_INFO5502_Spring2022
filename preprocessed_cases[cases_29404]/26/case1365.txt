the complaint alleged that was a student at a public high school operated by the william hart union high school district school district.the head guidance counselor and advisor at the high school an employee of the school district was assigned to counsel,advise and mentor.the complaint alleged that the guidance counselor sexually harassed,abused and molested on a number of occasions from january to september.the guidance counselor drove home from school and spent long hours with on and off the high school premises.the guidance counselor performed a variety of sexual acts on and required him to perform a number of sexual acts on her.suffered extensive physical,psychological and emotional damages as a result.the school district knew that the guidance counselor had engaged in unlawful conduct with minors in the past,was continuing to engage in such conduct,but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent further unlawful sexual conduct by the guidance counselor.
the complaint stated causes of action against the school district,the high school,and the guidance for negligence negligent supervision negligent hiring retention negligent failure to warn,train or educate constructive fraud intentional infliction of emotional distress sexual battery assault sexual harassment gender violence and unfair business practices.
the school district filed a demurrer to the complaint on february.the school district argued that it could not be held liable in tort in the absence of an authorizing statute or enactment,that it could not be held vicariously liable for the guidance counselor actions,and that allegations of negligent hiring,training,and supervision did not apply against a public entity defendant.the school district also demurred on behalf of the high school,which was not an independent public entity.the school district filed a motion to strike the portions of the complaint seeking punitive damages,attorney fees,injunctive relief,and restitution from the school district.
filed an opposition to the demurrer and the motion to strike,requesting an opportunity to amend if the demurrer were sustained.the school district replied.
the court heard the demurrer on may.at the hearing,the court stated government code section,subdivision a provided the public entity is liable for injuries proximately caused by an act or omission of employees but within the scope.here the employee was outside the scope of their employment.and the cases that were cited,they were unrelated to the duties of the counselor.and so the moving party ca be held vicariously liable for the misconduct under that government code.the court added o n the sexual harassment,civil code sections and do provide a statutory basis for those kind sic of claims against a public entity.the court also ruled that the high school was a part of the school district and not a public entity.the court sustained the demurrer in its entirety without leave to amend.the court found moot the motion to strike.

a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading as a matter of law,and we review the trial court sustaining of the demurrer de novo.holiday matinee,rambus,th.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
i.the facts alleged in the complaint do not support the vicarious liability of the school district.
except as otherwise provided by statute,a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person,subd.a.section,subdivision a sets forth an exception to the rule a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.this means that a public entity employer such as the school district is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the employment.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th.conversely,a public entity employer is not vicariously liable for the torts of its employees when they act outside the scope of their employment stated another way,respondeat superior should apply only to the types of injuries that as a practical matter are sure to occur in the conduct of the employer enterprise.id.at.where the facts of the case make it arguable whether the employee has acted within the scope of his employment,then the scope of employment issue is one properly decided by the trier of fact.however,where the facts would not support an inference that the employee acted within the scope of his employment and where there is no dispute over the relevant facts,the question becomes one of law.alma oakland unified school dist.d.
in john oakland unified school dist.cal d john,the california supreme court faced a question similar to that in this case the question before us here is whether an employer specifically,a school district can be held liable for a sexual assault committed by an employee here,a teacher on another person particularly,on a student committed to that teacher supervision.id.at.the complaint filed against the school district alleged that the minor plaintiff was sexually molested by his mathematics teacher,while at the teacher apartment participating in an officially sanctioned extracurricular program.id.at.concluding a more personal escapade less related to an employer interests is difficult to imagine,the court held that the respondeat superior doctrine should not be applied under those circumstances,and added t he prospect of such misconduct is conceivable,but that is a far cry from foreseeability,even under the broad meaning that concept is given in the respondeat superior context.id.at,fn.the court reasoned that the policies underlying the doctrine were not served by imposing vicarious liability,and saw a significant and unacceptable risk that school districts would be dissuaded from permitting teachers to interact with their students on any but the most formal and supervised basis if respondeat superior applied to hold the school district liable.id.at see alma oakland unified school,supra,d at school district not vicariously liable for sexual molestation by school custodian.
as in john,in this case the alleged sexual misconduct of the guidance counselor can not be considered within the scope of her employment.argues that the guidance counselor was a counselor,not a teacher,with job duties that may and may not apply to the position of teacher,but makes no effort to explain how sexual misconduct with a student could possibly fall within the scope of a guidance counselor employment.we agree with the trial court that as a matter of law no vicarious liability could be imposed on the school district on the causes of action for constructive fraud,intentional infliction of emotional distress,sexual battery,assault,sexual harassment,and gender violence,all of which would hold the school district liable for the guidance counselor actions.
ii.no statute allows a direct action for negligence against the school district.
the complaint stated causes of action against the school district for negligence,negligent supervision,negligent hiring retention,and negligent failure to warn,train or educate.as the complaint does not allege any statutory basis for these negligence causes of action,the trial court was correct in sustaining the demurrer as to the allegations of direct,rather than vicarious,liability for negligence.
sections,subdivision a and,require an authorizing statute or enactment before a governmental entity such as the school district can be liable in tort.searcy hemet unified school dist.d.does not identify any statute allowing a suit for direct negligence against the school district.
we find no relevant case law approving a claim for direct liability based on a public entity allegedly negligent hiring and supervision practices.de villers county of san diego th,de villers.further,there is no statutory basis for declaring a governmental entity liable for negligence in its hiring and supervision practices id.at.does not point to any statute or enactment.instead,he argues that language in john,supra,cal d and grudt city of los angeles cal d grudt supports the imposition of direct liability on the school district for negligent hiring and supervision.
in john,the plaintiffs complaint alleged that the school district was vicariously liable for the teacher acts,and directly liable for its own negligence.the trial court sustained a demurrer on the causes of action seeking to hold the school district vicariously liable,and the case proceeded to trial against the teacher and the district on the causes of action based on direct liability for negligent hiring and supervision.the district motion for nonsuit as to the direct liability claims was granted on the ground that the plaintiffs had not complied with the requirement that they present an application for leave to file a late claim,and judgment was entered in favor of the district on all grounds.the court of appeal reversed the grant of nonsuit and the order sustaining the demurrer to the causes of action seeking to impose vicarious liability.the california supreme court granted review on the unsettled and significant question of vicarious liability.john,supra,cal d at.
as an initial matter,the lead opinion,signed by two justices,addressed the timeliness issue because all the claims against the district would be barred if the plaintiffs did not present their claim to the district in a timely fashion.affirming the court of appeal on the timeliness issue,the supreme court remanded for a determination of whether equitable estoppel applied,leaving plaintiffs the opportunity to pursue their claims against the district premised upon its direct liability for negligen ce if they succeeded on the estoppel issue.john,supra,cal d at.the court then proceeded to reverse the court of appeal reversal of the trial court order sustaining the demurrer on the vicarious liability claims,thus leaving plaintiffs free to pursue only their claims against the district premised on its own direct negligence in hiring and supervising the teacher.id.at.
in grudt,the supreme court concluded that a complaint could be amended after the running of the statute of limitations in a case involving a shooting death by an officer,to add a claim asserting direct liability against the public entity for retaining officers it knew to be dangerous.grudt,supra,cal d at.
as the fourth district explained,in both john and grudt,the question was whether direct liability claims were timely,and the court did not reach the issue of the viability of a claim against a public entity for direct liability for negligent supervision.de villers,supra,th at.the statements relied upon by are thus dicta.further,as a concurring opinion in the california supreme court explained,t he policy discussion in john,supra,cal d,was in an opinion signed by only two justices of this court.there were four separate opinions.even the other three justices who agreed there should be no vicarious liability declined to sign the portion of the lead opinion dealing with that issue.instead,they chose to make clear that they concurred only in the majority holding of no vicarious liability.id.at conc.and dis.opn.of eagleson,italics added.except to its precise holding of no liability,the lead opinion stated a minority view and provides no authority for any proposition in a subsequent case.citations.this is hornbook law.no opinion has any value as a precedent on points as to which there is no agreement of a majority of the court.citation.mary city of los angeles cal d.
we agree with the fourth district reasoning distinguishing those cases.see de villers,supra,th at.we also agree with its conclusion a direct claim against a governmental entity asserting negligent hiring and supervision,when not grounded in the breach of a statutorily imposed duty owed by the entity to the injured party,may not be maintained.id.at.as a public entity,liability must be based on statutory not common law.munoz city of palmdale th.
iii.no mandatory duty subjects the school district to liability.
cites a list in the complaint of what he characterizes as mandatory duties that required the school district to protect and allow a direct action against the school district.section provides where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.t here are three elements to a cause of action under government code section.first,the enactment at issue must be obligatory,not merely discretionary or permissive in its directions to the public entity.citation.typically,an enactment imposing a mandatory duty also includes specific rules and guidelines for implementation.second,the duty imposed must be designed to protect against the particular kind of injury the plaintiff suffered the third and final requirement is that the breach of the duty must have been a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.bowman wyatt th.
most of the duties listed in the complaint are unaccompanied by any citation to a statute or enactment,and only a few cite general civil code sections.section requires that the mandatory duty be designed to protect against the particular kind of injury the plaintiff suffered.the plaintiff must show the injury is one of the consequences which the enacting body sought to prevent through imposing the alleged mandatory duty.citation.our inquiry in this regard goes to the legislative purpose of imposing the duty.that the enactment confers some benefit on the class to which plaintiff belongs is not enough if the benefit is incidental to the enactment protective purpose,the enactment can not serve as a predicate for liability under section.haggis city of los angeles cal th.the civil code statutes cited by do not command specific acts designed to prevent an employee from sexually molesting a student,and do not create a mandatory duty under section.see de villers,supra,th at.because the complaint does not identify a statute specifically imposing a mandatory duty on a public entity such as the school district,the complaint did not state a cause of action for direct liability against the school district.
relies heavily on the special relationship between the school district and its minor students,implying that the relationship itself creates an affirmative duty.we acknowledge that a special relationship exists,but such a relationship does not eliminate the requirement of a statutory basis for tort liability against a public school district.a school district owes a duty of care to its students because a special relationship exists between the students and the district.citation.the special relationship,by itself,does not create liability.tort liability for governmental entities is based upon statute.citations.citation.mosley san bernardino city unified school dist.th.
iv.other causes of action also fail to state a claim.
cause of action for constructive fraud cites civil code section,which provides constructive fraud consists.in any breach of duty which,without an actually fraudulent intent,gains an advantage to the person in fault,or any one claiming under him,by misleading another to his prejudice,or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him or.in any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent,without respect to actual fraud.constructive fraud is a unique species of fraud applicable only to a fiduciary or confidential relationship.citation.michel moore associates,th.complaint states that the school district entered into a fiduciary relationship and special confidential relationship with when it held the guidance counselor out as an agent and allowed her to instruct,and by holding itself out as an institution of learning.does not cite,and we have not found,any authority stating that a fiduciary relationship exists between a school district and an individual student.more importantly,however,this statutory language does not authorize the assertion of a claim of constructive fraud against a public entity,as required to find a mandatory duty under section.
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails because,like the negligence causes of action,it is a common law tort claim unsupported by a statute imposing liability on a public entity.causes of action for sexual battery citing civil code and assault without a citation to any statute are also unsupported by any statute holding a public entity liable for sexual battery or assault.
cites civil code section in support of his claim for sexual harassment,but that statute does not provide for a claim against a public entity rather than an individual teacher.civil code section,which cites in support of his claim for gender violence,also does not provide for a civil action against a public entity,and in subdivision d states t his section does not establish any civil liability of a person because of his or her status as an employer,unless the employer personally committed an act of gender violence,subd.d.
does not argue on appeal that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer as to his last cause of action,which alleges a violation of business and professions code section et the unfair practices act.we note,however,that a government entity is not a person subject to suit under the unfair practices act.people for ethical treatment of animals,california milk producers advisory bd.th,see wells learning foundation cal th.
further,to the extent that any of these causes of action seek to hold the school district vicariously liable for the guidance counselor actions,we have concluded above that the school district can not be held liable under respondeat superior.
v.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.
does not indicate how he could amend the complaint to state viable causes of action.he therefore has failed to carry his burden to show a reasonable possibility that he could cure the complaint defects by amendment.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.further,the complaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment.see california federal bank matreyek th,when demurrer is sustained as to original complaint,denial of leave to amend is abuse of discretion unless pleading is on its face incapable of amendment.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.
according to the complaint,the school district knew before and after hiring the guidance counselor that she had molested,and was continuing to molest,students.after hiring her,the district knew she was unfit for the job,but took no action to supervise,train,or discharge her.as a consequence,a high school student,was sexually molested.these allegations are accepted as true.see hensler city of glendale cal th,fn.thus,the school district may be liable for breaching its duty to protect students from physical harm.this court should clearly say so.
although the school district can not be held liable for the intentional misconduct of the guidance counselor,it may be liable through respondeat superior for the negligence of other employees who were responsible for hiring,supervising,training,or retaining her.
t he right of all students to a school environment fit for learning can not be questioned.attendance is mandatory and the aim of all schools is to teach.teaching and learning can not take place without the physical and mental of the students.the school premises,in short,must be safe and welcoming.in re william cal d.
under the california government claims act,et,a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute thus,in california,all government tort liability must be based on statute in the absence of a constitutional requirement,public entities may be held liable only if a statute is found declaring them to be liable.
government code s ection,subdivision a,is one such statute.it provides a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee through this section,the california government claims act expressly makes the doctrine of respondeat superior applicable to public employers a public entity,as the employer,is generally liable for the torts of an employee committed within the scope of employment if the employee is liable under government code section,subdivision a,e xcept as otherwise provided by statute,a public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.thus,the general rule is that an employee of a public entity is liable for his torts to the same extent as a private person and the public entity is vicariously liable for any injury which its employee causes to the same extent as a private employer 
through these statutes,the legislature incorporated general standards of tort liability as the primary basis for respondeat superior liability of public entities under them,a school district is vicariously liable for injuries proximately caused by the negligence of school personnel responsible for student supervision.hoff vacaville unified school dist.cal th,fn.citations omitted.undesignated section references are to the government code.
to say that someone owes another a duty of care is a shorthand statement of a conclusion,rather than an aid to analysis in itself d uty is not sacrosanct in itself,but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.
i n some instances the relationship of school personnel to students gives rise to a duty of care while school districts and their employees have never been considered insurers of the physical safety of students,california law has long imposed on school authorities a duty to supervise at all times the conduct of the children on the school grounds and to enforce those rules and regulations necessary to their protection the standard of care imposed upon school personnel in carrying out this duty to supervise is identical to that required in the performance of their other duties.this uniform standard to which they are held is that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence,charged with comparable duties,would exercise under the same circumstances.either a total lack of supervision or ineffective supervision may constitute a lack of ordinary care on the part of those responsible for student supervision hoff vacaville unified school,supra,cal th at,citations omitted.
the special relationship doctrine may serve as the basis for establishing negligence and liability on the part of a school district for breach of the long established duty of schools to supervise students in their charge and protect them against harm from others on school premises during the school day.searcy hemet unified school dist.d.this affirmative duty arises,in part,based on the compulsory nature of education.panama buena vista union school dist.th,accord,prosser keeton,torts ed,under special relationship doctrine,school duty to take reasonable precautions for safety of students includes obligation to exercise control over conduct of third persons.
the foregoing principles have been applied in four significant supreme court cases.in dailey los angeles unified sch.dist.cal d dailey,a high school student,michael dailey,was killed by another student while they were slap boxing during lunch period,unsupervised by school personnel.michael parents brought a wrongful death action against the school district and two teachers for failing to provide adequate supervision.the trial court granted a directed verdict for the defendants.the supreme court reversed,relying on a line of cases holding that a school district and its employees may be liable for negligent supervision.id.at.as the court explained section is one of the basic substantive provisions of the california government claims act it carries over to all public entities the respondeat superior liability that previously had been imposed upon school districts by education code section.that section,repealed concurrently with the enactment of the government claims act provided the governing board of any school district is liable as such in the name of the district for any judgment against the district on account of injury to person or property arising because of the negligence of the district,or its officers or employees.
all of the cases cited herein,which recognized a school district liability for its employees negligent failure to supervise and protect students,were decided under education code section or under one of its predecessor statutes while these cases may have been superseded in certain respects by subsequently enacted statutory provisions,they certainly have not been wholly abolished as precedent by the california government claims act.the pattern of vicarious liability for employees negligence is essentially identical under both statutes.we have found no evidence indicating an intention on the part of the legislature to alter the duty to provide supervision of students while on school grounds,the standard of care required of those undertaking to provide supervision,or the amount of evidence necessary to support a finding of negligence dailey,supra,cal d at,fn,citations omitted,italics added.
dailey continued the fact that another student misconduct was the immediate precipitating cause of the injury does not compel a conclusion that negligent supervision was not the proximate cause of michael death.neither the mere involvement of a third party nor that party wrongful conduct is sufficient in itself to absolve the defendants of liability,once a negligent failure to provide adequate supervision is shown nor is this a case in which the intervening conduct of the other student is so bizarre or unpredictable as to warrant a limitation of liability through the expedience of concluding,as a matter of law,that a negligent failure to supervise was not the proximate cause of the injury.there was testimony in the instant case that roughhousing and horseplay are normal activities for high school boys and it is the function of adult supervision to control just such conduct.dailey,supra,cal d at,citations fn.omitted,italics added.
thus,dailey recognized school employees may be personally liable for student injuries caused by the failure to provide adequate supervision,and the school district,in turn,may be vicariously liable for the employees failure to provide adequate supervision.dailey makes clear that in school district cases,the government claims act did not abolish precedent making school districts liable for negligent supervision,and,accordingly,it is not necessary to identify a statutory basis for the school district liability other than section itself.
in hoyem manhattan beach city sch.dist.cal d hoyem,the court addressed the question of whether,under california law,a school district may ever be held liable when,as a result of school authorities negligent supervision of students on school premises,a pupil leaves the school grounds during school hours and is subsequently injured by a motorist.id.at.in answering that question in the affirmative,the court stated o ur cases have long established that a school district bears a legal duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising students in its charge and may be held liable for injuries proximately caused by the failure to exercise such care.id.at.we entrust the safety of our children to our public school authorities during school hours.they are bound to exercise an amount of care for their safety during that period commensurate with the immaturity of their charges and the importance of their trust.id.at.the court rejected the school district argument that the conduct of the motorcyclist who hit the plaintiff constituted a superseding cause,precluding any liability on the part of the school district neither the mere involvement of a third party nor that party wrongful conduct is sufficient in itself to absolve the defendants of liability,once a negligent failure to provide adequate supervision is shown id.at,quoting dailey,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.
as to causation,hoyem commented w e certainly can not say that the risk of a student injury at the hands of a negligent motorist is,as a matter of law,not a foreseeable risk created by a school district failure to exercise due care in supervising its pupils thus,the subsequent negligence of the motorist does not necessarily relieve the district of all liability for the injury t he school district is entitled to join the motorcyclist as a in the action in order to pursue a claim for comparative indemnity thus,if the jury determines that the motorcyclist is principally responsible for the injuries,he will be the party who will bear primary responsibility for the lion share of the damages.hoyem,supra,cal d at.
in john oakland unified school district cal d john,a junior high school student was molested by a teacher while participating in an officially sanctioned extracurricular program.there,t he principal question was whether the school district that employed the teacher could be held vicariously liable for the teacher acts under the doctrine of respondeat superior.id.at,italics added.the court answered we hold that the doctrine is not applicable in these circumstances and that while the school district may be liable if its own direct negligence is established,it can not be held vicariously liable for its employee torts.ibid.
in john,justice arguelles wrote the lead opinion,in which justice broussard concurred,stating scope of employment is viewed broadly in this context.the fact that an employee is not engaged in the ultimate object of his employment at the time of his wrongful act does not preclude attribution of liability to an employer the employer is not liable if the employee substantially departs from his duties for purely personal reasons,but where the employee is combining his own business with that of his employer,or attending to both at substantially the same time,no nice inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury,unless it clearly appears that neither directly nor indirectly could he have been serving his employer.john,supra,cal d at,citations omitted.a lthough the facts of this case can be made to fit a version of the respondeat superior doctrine,we are unpersuaded that they should be or that the doctrine is appropriately invoked here.we draw our decision not from the various factual scenarios in which vicarious liability has or has not been imposed on employers for the torts of their employees,but instead from the underlying rationale for the respondeat superior doctrine.
the principal justification for the application of the doctrine of respondeat superior in any case is the fact that the employer may spread the risk through insurance and carry the cost thereof as part of his costs of doing business.although earlier authorities sought to justify the respondeat superior doctrine on such theories as control by the master of the servant,the master privilege in being permitted to employ another,the third party innocence in comparison to the master selection of the servant,or the master deep pocket to pay for the loss,the modern justification for vicarious liability is a rule of policy,a deliberate allocation of a risk.the losses caused by the torts of employees,which as a practical matter are sure to occur in the conduct of the employer enterprise,are placed upon that enterprise itself,as a required cost of doing business.john,supra,cal d at,citation fn.omitted,some italics added lead opn.of arguelles.
ultimately,justice arguelles concluded the only element of our analysis that might point in favor of vicarious liability here is the propriety of spreading the risk of loss among the beneficiaries of the enterprise.school districts and the community at large benefit from the authority placed in teachers to carry out the educational mission,and it can be argued that the consequences of an abuse of that authority should be shared on an equally broad basis.but the connection between the authority conferred on teachers to carry out their instructional duties and the abuse of that authority to indulge in personal,sexual misconduct is simply too attenuated to deem a sexual assault as falling within the range of risks allocable to a teacher employer.it is not a cost this particular enterprise should bear,and the consequences of imposing liability are unacceptable.john,supra,cal d at,italics added lead opn.of arguelles.
nevertheless,justice arguelles mentioned at least four times that the plaintiffs could seek damages based on the school district own alleged negligence.see john,supra,cal d at,fn.even if vicarious liability does not apply,the employer may be independently liable for its own conduct id.at,fn.discussing type of foreseeability relevant to whether the district itself acted negligently id.at careful selection of employees and close monitoring of their conduct are relevant to school district own direct negligence id.at,fn.discussing evidence concerning whether school district was liable for its own negligence.indeed,the court disposition in john directed the affirmance of the trial court order sustaining the demurrer to the vicarious liability claim,thus leaving plaintiffs free to pursue only their claims against the school district premised on its own direct negligence in hiring and supervising the teacher.id.at,italics added.
justice eagleson,with whom chief justice lucas and justice panelli concurred,wrote separately,agreeing that the school district could not be held vicariously liable for the molestation but disagreeing with the lead opinion on a procedural issue related to equitable estoppel.see john,supra,cal d at conc.dis.opn.of eagleson.yet,justice eagleson acknowledged,the majority implicit justification for its holdings is that the district may be independently liable for its own misconduct.that is correct but irrelevant.id.at,italics added.

in randi muroc joint unified school dist.cal th randi,the school district hired robert gadams as after receiving favorable letters of recommendation from several of gadams colleagues.plaintiff randi,a student,claim ed that gadams colleagues unreservedly recommended him for employment without disclosing to the placement service and thus to prospective employers facts defendants knew regarding prior charges or complaints of sexual misconduct and impropriety leveled against gadams.defendants letters allegedly induced randi school district to hire gadams,who later sexually assaulted randi id.at.randi filed suit against the individuals who provided the recommendation letters and their respective school districts.the trial court sustained a demurrer to an amended complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the case.the court of appeal concluded that the demurrer should have been overruled as to the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims.
the supreme court agreed with the court of appeal,explaining that defendants letters of recommendation,containing unreserved and unconditional praise for former employee gadams despite defendants alleged knowledge of complaints or charges of his sexual misconduct with students,constituted misleading statements that could form the basis for tort liability for fraud or negligent misrepresentation.although policy considerations dictate that ordinarily a recommending employer should not be held accountable for failing to disclose negative information regarding a former employee,nonetheless liability may be imposed if,as alleged here,the recommendation letter amounts to an affirmative misrepresentation presenting a foreseeable and substantial risk of physical harm to a third person.randi,supra,cal th at.
in reaching that conclusion,the randi court observed as for public policy,the law certainly recognizes a policy of preventing future harm of the kind alleged here.one of society highest priorities is to protect children from sexual or physical abuse.randi,supra,cal th at,italics omitted.further,the letters,essentially recommending gadams for any position without reservation or qualification,constituted affirmative representations that strongly implied gadams was fit to interact appropriately and safely with female students.these representations were false and misleading in light of defendants alleged knowledge of charges of gadams repeated sexual improprieties.id.at.
thus,in randi,the high court sanctioned the imposition of personal liability on school employees who,in recommending a colleague for employment,make false and misleading representations in light of their knowledge of complaints or charges of sexual misconduct involving the applicant.the defendants in randi had a duty to protect students at another school from an administrator previously charged with sexual improprieties.and randi would make little sense if a truthful disclosing an applicant past sexual simply be ignored by its recipient,namely,the employee making the hiring decision at the other school.the hirer necessarily has a duty to exercise ordinary care in using such information.
under the trilogy,a school employee may be held personally liable for his or her negligence in failing to supervise students adequately,and the school district may be vicariously liable for the employee negligence.
i n california,an employer can be held liable for negligent hiring if he knows the employee is unfit,or has reason to believe the employee is unfit or fails to use reasonable care to discover the employee unfitness before hiring him t he theory of negligent hiring here encompasses the particular risk of molestation by an employee with a history of this specific conduct.juarez boy scouts of america,th,italics added omitted.california school districts have long borne a legal duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising students on school premises during school hours.hoyem,supra,cal d at,italics added.
as noted,the school district in this case is not liable under section for the guidance counselor intentional misconduct in molesting t he police officer exception does not apply here.doe city of murrieta th,referring to mary city of los angeles,supra,cal d.in other words,molestation was not within the scope of the guidance counselor employment,subd.a.
in addition,a distinction must be made between a school district vicarious liability and its direct liability u nder the government claims act,public employees are liable for injuries caused by their acts and omissions to the same extent as private persons vicarious liability is a primary basis for liability on the part of a public entity,and flows from the responsibility of such an entity for the acts of its employees under the principle of respondeat superior as the act provides,a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would have given rise to a cause of action against that employee,unless the employee is immune from liability,subds.a,b.zelig county of los angeles cal th.in contrast,section imposes direct liability on a public entity for injuries proximately caused by a dangerous condition on property.see zelig,at.
here,the school district liability is based on the wrongful employees other than the guidance counselor.the school district knew before hiring the guidance counselor that she had molested students.yet,one or more school district administrators,with that knowledge,decided to hire her.after she was hired,one or more administrators knew that the counselor was continuing to molest students,but failed to supervise,train,or discharge her.
these administrators,who had a duty to protect students from harm,were required,within the scope of their employment,not to hire a guidance counselor they knew to be a child molester.after the counselor was hired,they had to take appropriate action within the scope of their employment to supervise,train,and,if necessary,discharge the counselor,whom they knew to be a continuing threat.under the trilogy,the administrators negligent acts and omissions in hiring,training,supervising,and retaining the guidance counselor may give rise to their personal liability,and,under section,the school district may be vicariously liable for the administrators negligence.
decisions of the courts of appeal are in accord.in leger stockton unified school dist.d,the court held that school employees who fail to provide adequate supervision may be liable for a student assault by a nonstudent in a restroom and that the school district may be liable for the employees failure to supervise.see id.at.the court stated as a general rule,one owes no duty to control the conduct of another,nor to warn those endangered by such conduct.such a duty may arise,however,if a a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person conduct,or b a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives the other a right to protection.
w e think it obvious that the individual school employees responsible for supervising plaintiff had a special relation with plaintiff upon which a duty of care may be founded a contrary conclusion would be wholly untenable in light of the fact that the right of all students to a school environment fit for learning can not be questioned the public school setting is one in which governmental officials are directly in charge of children and their environs,including where they study,eat and play further,the responsibility of school officials for each of their charges,the children,is heightened as compared to the responsibility of the police for the public in general.leger,supra,d at,citations omitted.
leger also held that the school district was not immune given that a statute imposed liability.in distinguishing another case,leger explained in rodriguez inglewood unified school dist.d,the court considered whether a school district could be held liable when a student was assaulted on campus by a nonstudent.on the question of duty,the court concluded that a special relationship is formed between a school district and its students so as to impose an affirmative duty on the district to take all reasonable steps to protect its students.leger,supra,d at.even though rodriguez determined a school district has a duty to protect students on campus from violent assaults by third parties,the court concluded the defendant school district was not liable because no statute provided for liability i n california,all government tort liability must be based on statute 
however,rodriguez did not examine government code sections and,imposing liability on a public entity for the torts of its employees 
here,plaintiff has sued employees of the district and pursues the district on a theory of respondeat superior section provides in relevant part that except as otherwise statutorily provided,a public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.section provides in pertinent part that the entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would have given rise to a cause of action against that employee thus,the general rule is that an employee of a public entity is liable for his torts to the same extent as a private person,subd.a and the public entity is vicariously liable for any injury which its employee causes,subd.a to the same extent as a private employer,subd.b.leger,supra,d at,citations omitted accord,virginia abc unified school dist.th,applying leger and section in concluding school district could be liable for teacher molestation of student if school employees responsible for hiring and supervising teacher knew or should have known of his or her prior sexual misconduct hanson reedley.school dist.d,affirming jury verdict against school district under predecessor statute to section where tennis coach told two students to ride home after practice with third student whom coach knew to be reckless driver,and ensuing car accident injured one passenger and killed the other.

courts in jurisdictions other than california have reached the same conclusions.in doe parents state,of educ.hawaii,the plaintiffs sued the hawaii department of education department,alleging that a school teacher,lawrence norton,had molested their children and that the department was liable for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress nied.the department argued that the suit was barred by the state tort liability act stla hawaii.et,specifically,the section precluding suits for intentional torts.the hawaii supreme court disagreed,explaining in the present matter,the plaintiffs negligence and nied claims are not duplicitous of their respondeat superior claim.under the latter,the plaintiffs posit that the department,as norton employer,is vicariously liable for his molestation of the girls because norton acts of molestation occurred within the scope of his employment with the department the conduct of other department employees,such as norton supervisors,is irrelevant to the department potential liability under respondeat superior,because the only material question is whether norton molestation of the girls constituted a negligent act that was within the scope of his employment it is precisely such a theory of liability that the stla intentional tort exception precludes,where the allegedly negligent act of the employee is asserted to be assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights.in other words,the plaintiffs respondeat superior claim must aris e out of norton assault and battery of the girls because his molestation of them is the sole basis of the plaintiffs claim against his employer,the department.
on the other hand,the plaintiffs negligence and nied claims are not predicated upon norton molestation of the girls per se.rather,the plaintiffs posit that other department employees breached a duty that legally caused the plaintiffs injuries.the plaintiffs theory of,as it is,upon the acts and omissions of norton not,therefore,arise out of norton molestation of the students.to the contrary,norton molestation of the students arises out of his supervisors antecedent negligent acts and omissions in reinstating and in failing to supervise him 
based on the foregoing discussion,we hold that,where a plaintiff negligence claim against the state seeks to hold the state vicariously liable for a state employee assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights under the doctrine of respondeat superior,the state is,pursuant to the stla immune from the plaintiff claim.however,where the plaintiff negligence claim seeks to hold the state liable for the conduct of state employees other than the alleged intentional tortfeasor,pursuant to theories of negligent hiring,retention,supervision,or the like,the plaintiff claim does not necessarily arise out of the hired,retained,or supervised employee intentional tort.rather,if the state knew,or reasonably should have anticipated,that one of its employees would commit an intentional tort against a person to whom the state owed a duty of care,the state is liable for the negligence of those employees who were in a position to take reasonable precautions against the anticipated harm.
in light of the foregoing,we further hold,to the extent that the plaintiffs predicate their negligence and nied claims upon the department negligent retention and supervision of norton,that the stla intentional tort exception does not insulate the department from liability given that the plaintiffs have alleged that the department reasonably should have anticipated that norton would molest the girls,their negligent retention and supervision claims do not arise out of norton acts of molestation.doe parents state,of,supra,at,fns.citations omitted.
in discussing the legal basis of the plaintiffs claims,the hawaii supreme court stated w e hold that the duty of care that the department owes to students and their parents is,on a general level,a duty to take whatever precautions are necessary reasonably to ensure the safety and welfare of the children entrusted to its custody and control against harms that the department anticipates,or reasonably should anticipate.although we have not expressly said so in the past,it is readily apparent that the foregoing duty arises from the special relationship that the department shares with its students and their parents thus,whether the department duty is characterized as one of reasonable supervision of its students,or as a special duty,in loco parentis,to exercise reasonable care to protect a student from foreseeable harm,does not alter what the department duty quintessentially exercise reasonable care in ensuring that students are educated in a safe environment free from any unreasonable risks of harm t he department duty stems from its custodial relationship,in loco parentis,with students and,thus,obligates the department reasonably to anticipate,as would a reasonably prudent parent,foreseeable harm and to take whatever action is reasonable to protect a student from that foreseeable harm.doe parents state,of,supra,at.
as a new york court stated in a suit involving a teacher molestation of a student under the doctrine of respondeat superior,an employer may be vicariously liable for the tortious acts of its employees only if those acts were committed in furtherance of the employer business and within the scope of employment an act of sexual assault by an employee is a clear departure from the scope of employment,committed solely for personal reasons,and unrelated to the furtherance of the employer business therefore,the district may not be held vicariously liable for a sexual assault committed by its employee.
even so,a school has a duty to adequately supervise students in its care,and may be held liable for injuries that are foreseeable and proximately related to the school failure to provide adequate supervision the standard to determine whether the school has breached its duty is to compare the school supervision and protection to that of a parent of ordinary prudence placed in the identical situation and armed with the same information where liability is imposed on a school for negligent supervision due to injuries related to an individual intentional acts,the plaintiff generally must demonstrate the school prior knowledge or notice of the individual propensity or likelihood to engage in such conduct,so that the individual acts could be anticipated or were foreseeable dia cc.ithica city school district.
in an idaho case,the state supreme court rejected the argument that the idaho tort claims act idaho code,et,which provides immunity for liability arising out of an assault or battery,protected a school district that hired and retained a teacher knowing of his prior sexual misconduct.the court said the school district contends that the plaintiffs action against it for negligent retention arose out of the teacher assault and battery on the plaintiff children,and therefore that the school district is immune from liability under the assault and battery exception.
there is a distinction between the conduct which forms the basis of a cause of action in negligence and one for assault and battery.a cause of action in negligence requires the breach of a duty which is the proximate cause of the plaintiff injury a battery,on the other hand,requires intentional bodily contact which is either harmful or offensive under the plaintiffs allegations,the children injuries arose out of the basic negligence of the school district.the injuries were the foreseeable consequence of the school district negligence in retaining the teacher despite full knowledge of his proclivities.
the fact that the plaintiffs injuries were caused by a third party does not absolve the school district from liability for its negligence.the concept of supervening causation is inapplicable,under the allegations of the present case.the teacher actions were the foreseeable result of the school district alleged failure to exercise due care to protect its students.the very risk which constituted the district negligence was the probability that such actions might occur.
it is clearly unsound to afford immunity to a negligent defendant because the intervening force,the very anticipation of which made his conduct negligent,has brought about the expected harm to do so would fly in the face of basic principles of tort law if the likelihood that a third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the school district negligent,such an act whether innocent,negligent,intentionally tortious,or criminal does not prevent the school district from being liable for harm caused thereby.doe durtschi idaho,citations omitted.the idaho supreme court succinctly concluded we do not believe that the idaho legislature,by creating an exception to governmental liability for actions arising out of assault and battery,thereby intended to relieve state agencies from any duty to safeguard the public from employees whom they know to be dangerous.the factual situation alleged in the present case presents a haunting example.surely the idaho legislature could not have intended that school districts could retain known child molesters in the classroom with total impunity under the idaho tort claims act,at.
under florida law,t he retention and supervision of a teacher by a school board are not acts covered with sovereign immunity.the school board has a common law duty to protect others from the result of negligent hiring,supervision,or retention which duty is identical to the duty upon private employers who hire,retain,or supervise employees whose negligent or intentional acts in positions of employment can foreseeably cause injuries to third parties.school bd.of orange county coffey so d,see hertzel palmyra school district,school district may be liable for sexual molestation of student by another student where school employee knew,prior to molestation,that had inappropriately touched but took no action to protect r.from further abuse by.
a school district liability for negligent hiring or supervision also finds support in the context of insurance defense.in board of educ.nat.union fire ins,a student had sued the board of education for molestation,alleging negligent supervision of the molester,rudolph walls,the president of the association.the complaint alleged the board knew walls had a history of convictions for committing sexual crimes against children,and he was on probation for those crimes,but the board allowed him to have unsupervised contact with students.id.at conc.opn.of del sole.the defendants sought a defense from their errors and omissions insurer,which denied coverage under exclusions for any claim involving a criminal act,arising out of an assault or battery,or arising out of bodily injury to any person.the trial court granted the insurer motion for judgment on the pleadings.
the appellate court reversed.the court initially commented that the insurance policy contained no express exclusions for negligent hiring,supervision,or control.board of educ.nat.union fire,supra,at.in discussing the criminal acts exclusion,the court stated the claim against the school district involves criminal acts,in that it is alleged that its negligence allowed walls criminal acts to occur,and that the plaintiff suffered thereby.however,the criminality alleged is one party removed from the insured it is not alleged the claim involved criminality by the insured school district itself.i f the criminal actor is not even an insured,we will not preclude coverage absent exclusionary language expressly dictating such a result.allowing the insurer to deny a defense against claims sounding entirely in negligence to an entire roster of people and groups because of alleged criminality by a single volunteer can not be what the parties bargained for.id.at,fn.omitted.in rejecting the applicability of the other policy exclusions,the court noted the injuries arise from the school district negligent acts and omissions the omissions and negligence the claim did not arise from the molestation.that is,walls acts arose out of the failings of the school district,not the other way around walls acts alone do not create or give rise to a claim against defendants that claim can not stand on allegations of assault alone.it arises,if at all,from other facts,grounded in negligence.id.at.
in durham bd.of educ.national union,the school board and four faculty members were sued by a student who had been molested by the boys basketball coach.the complaint alleged that the four faculty members failed to exercise due care for the health and safety of the student,negligently failed to reprimand or counsel the coach when they knew he was likely to engage in improper sexual conduct with a student under his supervision,failed to properly and timely investigate a sexual incident involving the coach and another student,and failed to establish proper policies and procedures in order to deal with incidents involving sexual contact between students and teachers.in addition,the complaint allege d the school superintendent negligently hired the coach when he knew of the coach propensity toward engaging in sexually provocative behavior with students,d at.
the faculty members turned to the school insurer for a defense,which was denied.in the declaratory relief action that followed,the court of appeals rejected the insurer arguments,stating as the superintendent,the assistant superintendent,the principal of the school,and the fourth faculty member,the duties of these four employees would include taking precautions to prevent sexually provocative behavior between a teacher and a student,investigating an alleged sexual incident between a teacher and a student,supervising an athletic coach,and exercising professionalism and confidentiality in the investigation of a sexual incident involving a teacher and a student.the acts alleged against the board,are,therefore,within the scope of the duties of those employees.
by its specific language,the policy covers hammonds,smith,and hunter as insured because they are the superintendent,the assistant superintendent,and the principal of the school.the policy also covers bradshaw,the fourth faculty member,as an insured by the language of the endorsement as any employee acting within the scope of his duties.additionally,these alleged acts fall into the definition of wrongful act s as any actual or alleged breach of duty,neglect,error,misstatement,misleading statement or omission committed solely in the performance of duties for the school district we hold,therefore,that the policy covers the board for these alleged acts and that the insurer has a duty to defend the board.durham bd.of educ.national union,supra,at.
and in watkins glen cent.nat.union fire watkins glen,the school district sought a defense and indemnification under its errors and omissions policy in connection with accusations it had negligently hired and supervised a teacher who had a history of sexual misconduct with students.in reversing summary judgment in favor of the insurer,the appellate division explained an errors and omissions policy is intended to insure a member of a designated calling against liability arising out of the mistakes inherent in the practice of that particular profession or business an errors and omissions policy effectively provides malpractice insurance coverage to members of professions other than those in the legal and medical fields errors and omissions policies are common in the field of education 
errors and omissions policies generally provide coverage for acts of negligence and do not insure against intentional acts furthermore,there is ample authority for the proposition that sexual assaults are intentional acts that ordinarily are excluded from coverage under a general liability policy however,none of the cases from this state applying the exclusion to acts of sexual misconduct have arisen within the context of direct allegations of supervisory negligence against school officials under an errors and omissions policy for the intentional sexual misconduct of a teacher.while the molester unquestionably committed intentional acts for which the insurer owes no duty of defense or indemnification in favor of him,to the extent that the district may be held liable for its negligent hiring and supervision of the molester,this risk falls squarely within the type of errors and omissions coverage provided by the policy to wit,professional malpractice liability insurance.watkins glen,supra,at,citations omitted,italics added.
in watkins glen,the court concluded a n errors and omissions policy issued to a school district that employs hundreds or thousands of teachers and other workers is expressly intended to provide coverage for negligent acts,including negligence in the hiring or supervision of employees while the molester may have acted intentionally in perpetrating the sexual assaults against the two plaintiff students in the underlying action,liability as against the school district is predicated upon its conceptually independent negligent supervision.watkins glen,supra,n.at.
in determining whether a school district is liable for negligence in a molestation case,the duty to exercise ordinary care may vary with the circumstances.for example,in panama buena vista union school,supra,th,a student who had been sexually assaulted by another student filed suit against the school district for negligent failure to supervise.in affirming a jury verdict in favor of the student,the court of appeal emphasized that some of the school students,including the victim,were special education students the minor,years old at the time,was enrolled in eighth grade at the school in a special education class.he had a mentality,and the school categorized him as mentally retarded,a designation that carried special concerns with regard to his safety and.the minor had unique vulnerabilities and was susceptible to being tricked and emotionally abused.the principal testified that sexual abuse of special education students was also a concern.id.at.the court continued w e find it reasonably foreseeable that,given the lack of direct supervision in the early morning hours,a special education student,such as the minor,was at risk for a sexual or other physical assault.the district superintendent acknowledged that supervision has a special meaning to educators on the issue of safety and entails observing the person being supervised.this simply did not occur at the school given the unique vulnerabilities of special education students,the district knew or reasonably should have known that the minor was subject to the risk of an assault,including a sexual assault by another student.id.at.when a school district instructs special education children,it takes on the unique responsibilities associated with this instruction and the special needs of these children.id.at.
a similar consideration is present here.the school district hired a guidance counselor,not a teacher,coach,staff member,or custodial worker.a school counselor often wears many hats and may work in elementary,middle,or high schools a professional school counselor must ultimately communicate with the students under her charge.specifically,the professional counselor takes on a dual role with respect to student interaction she is both an advisor on personal issues and an academic consultant.consequently,a school counselor can be one of the most important persons students will encounter during their educational development.
in many instances,the counselor is the person to whom students speak regarding personal problems that have affected,or may eventually affect,academic performance.in such instances,the counselor may make suggestions tailored to the individual student,such as having the student speak with the instructor at issue speaking with the instructor herself or convening a conference with the counselor,student,instructor,and,sometimes,the parent a student may come to a counselor seeking her opinion,anticipating that the counselor will take all the factors involved under consideration.note,iowa school counselors had better get it right iowa,fns.omitted.
a guidance counselor plays a crucial role in the development of a high school student future the interactions between student and counselor and their resultant decisions can have a impact on the life of the student the relationship between a guidance counselor and student is premised upon trust.the student relies on the counselor to give accurate and informed advice.note,school guidance counselors can be held liable when their erroneous advice prevents a from obtaining an athletic cedar rapids community school district,iowa seton hall sport,fn.omitted.in short,guidance counselors have the importan t task of advising students on personal,social,academic and vocational matters.luhm board of hot springs.sch.dist.
yet,in this case,the school district hired a known child molester to be a guidance position that,by definition,often brings the counselor and a student into confidential contact about the student personal concerns.
the restatement second of torts supports liability on the part of the school district,as follows,with appropriate alterations in brackets.there is no duty on a school to control the conduct of a third person,such as a guidance counselor,so as to prevent him from causing physical harm to a student unless a special relation exists between the school and the counselor which imposes a duty upon the school to control the counselor conduct,or a special relation exists between the school and the student which gives to the student a right to protection.rest d torts.a school,which takes charge of a third person,such as a guidance counselor,whom the school knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to students if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the counselor to prevent him from doing such harm.rest d torts,at.
further,a school,which is required by law to take custody of a student under circumstances such as to deprive the student of his normal power of or to subject him to association with persons likely to harm him,such as known child molesters,is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so as to control the conduct of child molesters to prevent them from intentionally harming the student if the school a knows or has reason to know that it has the ability to control the conduct of the molesters,and b knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.rest d torts.comment a to remarks that the rule is applicable,inter alia,to teachers or other persons in charge of a public school.id.at.comment b to clarifies that the foregoing is true because t he circumstances under which the custody of another is taken and maintained may be such as to deprive him or her of the protection of someone who,if present,would be under a duty to protect him or her id.at.because a child,while in school,is deprived of the protection of his or her parents or guardian,the actor who takes custody of the child is properly required to give him or her the protection of which the custody or the manner in which it is taken has deprived him or her.id.at.doe parents state,of,supra,at.and a schoolmaster who knows that a group of older boys are in the habit of bullying the younger pupils to an extent likely to do them actual harm,is not only required to interfere when he sees the bullying going on,but also to be reasonably vigilant in his supervision of his pupils so as to ascertain when such conduct is about to occur.rest d torts,com.d.
the school district reliance on de villers county of san diego th is misplaced.in de villers,a toxicologist who worked in a county coroner office stole poison from the laboratory and used it to murder her husband.the husband surviving family brought a wrongful death action against the county,alleging it had negligently hired and supervised the toxicologist.in reversing a jury verdict for the plaintiffs,the court of appeal commented that the toxicologist coworkers had no duty to protect the husband from murder.id.at.the court found no authority supporting a claim of negligent hiring or supervision based on a duty to protect an employee family members.id.at.the reason is simple no one in the coroner office had the responsibility,within the scope of his or her employment,to ensure that employees were not going to use laboratory poison to murder their relatives.as a result,section,authorizing the liability of a public entity under the doctrine of respondeat superior,did not come into play.
likewise,in mendoza city of los angeles th,an police officer,who was drunk,got into a domestic squabble with his fiancée and shot her in the face,killing her.he used a personal revolver,not his service weapon.the fiancée family brought an action against the city,alleging negligent hiring and supervision.the jury found the city percent at fault and awarded damages accordingly.the court of appeal reversed,explaining liability for negligent hiring and supervision is based upon the reasoning that if an enterprise hires individuals with characteristics which might pose a danger to customers or other employees,the enterprise should bear the loss caused by the wrongdoing of its incompetent or unfit emp
