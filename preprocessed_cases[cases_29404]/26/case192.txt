this appeal challenges a grant of summary judgment against hollie williams appellant or williams,who had originally brought negligence actions against utica college of syracuse university utica college and burns international security services corporation burns security after she was assaulted in her dormitory room by an unidentified assailant.the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,dismissed williams suit at summary judgment on the grounds that the risk of the attack on williams was not foreseeable and therefore that appellees duty to protect against the risk could not be established that there was insufficient evidence that the assailant was an intruder who had obtained access to williams room through a entrance and therefore that cause could not be shown and that the security measures adopted by utica college were sufficient,as a matter of law,so that a breach of duty could not be demonstrated by the evidence.
on appeal,while abandoning her claim against burns security,williams continues to argue that utica college acted negligently,and that its negligence was the cause of her injury.accordingly,she challenges the district court grant of summary judgment as to the college.for the reasons we give below,we conclude that the district court erred in its analysis of duty and breach.but,because we agree that williams failed to present sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment as to causation,we affirm the grant of summary judgment.
background 
nestled in upstate new york,utica college had a student body in of over students,of whom lived in one of five dormitories.during her sophomore year,williams shared a room on the second floor of north hall,where,on october,she and her a assaulted by a masked,unknown attacker.late that morning,at around,williams and her roommate returned to their dorm room and began to prepare lunch,leaving their door slightly ajar.moments after they returned,a male entered the room and locked the door behind him he had a gun that was plainly visible.the attacker threatened williams by pressing a knife against her neck.after forcing williams to undress and kiss her roommate,he fondled and physically rubbed up against both roommates,never removing his clothes or mask.the assailant left williams dorm room approximately thirty minutes after he arrived,having bound his victims wrists to a bed with duct tape.williams and her roommate reported that their attacker had seemingly recorded much of what transpired with a video camera he brought to the room.
according to williams description,the assailant was a white male with short,strawberry colored hair.dressed in a black sweater and carrying a gym bag,he had covered his face with a bandana during the encounter.neither williams nor her roommate recognized the assailant,and to this day,the individual has not been identified.
at the time of the attack,utica college had in place a security policy requiring,with one exception,that all outer doors to its five residential halls be locked hours a day.the exception was that during office hours,a breezeway entrance remained open,thereby allowing students to enter north hall from the open quadrangle created by the four other student dormitories.during the day,this entrance was supposed to be monitored by students.utica college officials could not confirm,however,that anyone manned this post on the day of williams assault,and williams and her roommate testified that they did not see anyone watching over the breezeway entrance when they returned to their room that morning.
the campus security section of the college student handbook,which is distributed annually to all students,outlined the school official policy 
residence hall outer doors are locked hours a day with the exception of the breezeway door closest to the residence life office in north hall security officers are stationed in each residence hall from to daily.in addition,these residences are staffed by professional resident directors who are on call hours per day each day visitors must register with personnel stationed at residence hall lobby desks.guests must be escorted at all times by the residential student is visiting 
despite these policies,students reportedly held and even propped open doors to the residence halls so that people could enter without registering.
in july,williams filed an amended complaint against appellees.in it,she alleged the october assault was made possible through the failure of appellees to take reasonable and proper care in training and supervising its personnel in negligently and carelessly failing to properly train its resident advisors in affirmatively encouraging students to leave there sic dormitory rooms unlocked in negligently and carelessly allowing said dormitories to be left open and available to anyone without any supervision in failing to undertake to protect said residents with due knowledge that people had previously entered said premises without authorization or justification failing to properly train its security personnel failing to have an adequate plan and in otherwise being negligent and careless in the premises.
in due course and after discovery,appellees sought summary judgment against williams.the district court granted appellees request,dismissing williams suit for three separate reasons.first,the court concluded that,because of the low history of violent crime on campus,the type of attack williams suffered was not foreseeable.utica college duty as landlord did not,therefore,extend to the circumstances of her assault.the court stressed that in the four years prior to the attack,there had been few significant criminal incidents on campus,and,with one exception,no crime involving intruders.the court discounted the february incident since the assault had been committed by a resident former boyfriend at a time when the doors to the dorms were permanently unlocked.in addition,the court did not find compelling either student complaints about safety,or the warnings issued by burns security,which,in a report,had called for additional protective steps to be taken.the court explained its conclusion with the statement that the college was required to provide reasonable security,not optimal security.
second,the court justified its grant of summary judgment on the ground that,because there was no proof that the attacker was an intruder from outside the school,williams could not establish that the alleged negligence was the cause of the assailant presence in the dorm or the subsequent attack.thus,the court held that there was insufficient evidence for one to conclude that it is more likely or more reasonable than not that the criminal who assaulted plaintiff was an intruder who gained access to the premises through the breezeway door.
finally,even to the extent that utica college had a legal duty,as the owner and manager of north hall,to take reasonable steps to minimize foreseeable danger to those residing on the premises,the district court decided that williams evidence of a breach of whatever duty existed was inadequate to survive summary judgment.in this regard,the court stressed the security precautions seemingly in effect in october.these included locks and peepholes on all dormitory room doors locked exterior doors with the exception of the breezeway entrance,which was unlocked during office hours the arrangement of the residential life office so that during office hours,the occupant of the front desk could see out into the hall and the contract with burns security to provide campus patrols around the clock and overnight security in each dormitory.on this basis,the district court found that the security measures maintained by utica college fulfilled its security obligations as a matter of law.emphasis added 
discussion 
to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must prove that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see celotex catrett,d.c.a dispute regarding a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,stuart am.cyanamid,cir internal quotation marks omitted,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that party,allen coughlin,cir.we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.see mccarthy am.int l group,cir.
both parties seemingly agree,and we therefore assume,that new york law governs this diversity action.in order to establish a prima facie case of negligence under that state cases,a claimant must demonstrate that the defendant owed the plaintiff a cognizable duty of care the defendant breached that duty and the plaintiff suffered damage as a proximate result of that breach.stagl delta airlines,cir citing solomon city of new york.
each of these requirements was a ground of decision for the district court,and so we consider them in turn.
the district court held that utica college duty as a landlord did not extend to the october assault on williams because that particular type of attack was not foreseeable given the history of crime at utica college.under the circumstances of this case,we can not accept the district court conclusion as to the scope of appellee duty.
under new york law,the question of the existence of a duty is a question of law that is to be answered by the court of appeals in a broad,categorical fashion.see di benedetto pan am world,cir citing stagl,at collecting new york cases.new york cases have usefully elucidated the relation between duty and foreseeability 
we have long held that new york landowners owe people on their property a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances to maintain their property in a safe condition.although landlords and permittees have a duty to minimize foreseeable dangers on their property,including the criminal acts of third parties,they are not the insurers of a visitor safety.as we have noted,however,foreseeability and duty are not identical concepts.foreseeability merely determines the scope of the duty once the duty is determined to exist.in cases arising out of injuries sustained on another property,the scope of the possessor duty is defined by past experience and the likelihood of conduct on the part of third persons which is likely to endanger the safety of the visitor.

there are several problems with the district court analysis of foreseeability.first,it is not clear why a few significant criminal incidents on campus are not enough to make the issue of whether the attack on williams was foreseeable at least a jury question.based on utica college own compilation,there had been significant events in each of the preceding five years moreover,as the dean of utica college as donald greene,president of strategic security concepts,a security consulting firm,are other,undocumented assaults that occur on utica campus that are not classified as aggravated assaults.as a result,a jury could readily have found that the utica college administration had been alerted to the presence of more crime than it publicly reported in its annual reviews.
moreover,in burgos aqueduct realty,the leading new york case on landlord duty with respect to finding that the evidence of duty and of breach was sufficient to justify reversing a grant of summary judgment in favor of a defendant landlord,the new york court of appeals pointed out that the plaintiff affidavit had stated,that despite repeated complaints to the superintendent and manager,and three robberies in the building over the prior three years,none of the entrances front door,back door and roof door had functioning locks.burgos,at,emphasis added.significantly,the court did not seem to consider foreseeability to have been a problem worthy of discussion.burgos therefore must be taken to indicate that even a few past incidents spaced over a few years may,in appropriate circumstances,be enough to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the relevant criminal activity was foreseeable.
the district court analysis in the instant case seemed to focus on the specific characteristics of the previous crimes to justify its foreseeability ruling.admittedly,none of the earlier crimes at utica college were committed in exactly the same way as the attack on williams.but the requirement of foreseeability does not perversely insist that a landlord be exposed to a crime that unfolds in precisely the same fashion in order to be forewarned of danger.that too is a lesson to be learned from burgos 
the district court attempt to justify its view on the ground that most of the earlier crimes were committed by residents of utica college,and not intruders,is also unavailing.first,the attack was committed by a resident who was himself not a student or resident of utica college.the district court seems to have assumed that,because of the relation to individuals on campus,he may have validly gained access to the dormitories,and hence,that utica college did not have notice of the dangers of illegal entries.but this was not how utica college perceived or reacted to the incident.on the contrary,the college responded by implementing measures designed to keep outsiders out.in other words,the school reaction makes clear that it conceived of the earlier assault as a crime committed by an intruder,not by someone who was,for practical purposes,a resident.only foreseeability of intruder danger can explain what the school did.
finally,the district court analysis of the foreseeability issue was flawed because it assumed that only actual prior crimes could put utica college on notice of the risk of future crimes.in fact,burns security had repeatedly raised security concerns with the college.and,it had specifically focused on the need to monitor the breezeway entrance more closely.accordingly,a jury could surely,reasonably,find that persistent suggestions by the security company hired by the school were enough to alert appellee to the possibility that intruders might take advantage of this vulnerability and commit a crime.
in sum,neither the relative infrequency nor the character of the crimes support the conclusion that the attack on williams was unforeseeable as a matter of law and that,therefore,the scope of utica college duty did not encompass criminal assaults.
we also conclude that the district court erred in finding that,on the facts of this case,the issue of breach of duty could be decided in appellees favor at summary judgment.this obviously implicates the debate as to when it is appropriate for a court to decide the question of a defendant due care as a matter of law,rather than allowing a jury to resolve it as an issue of fact.stagl,at.in stagl,we explained that,despite the venerable roots of this debate,justice holmes standards of conduct ought increasingly to be fixed by the court for the sake of been largely rejected.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in so doing,we underscored the position of the new york court of appeals 
it is particularly appropriate to leave a finding of breach to the jury,not only because of the idiosyncratic nature of most tort cases,or because there was room for a difference in view as to whether the defendant conduct in the particular circumstances of this case did or did not evidence a lack of due care,but,perhaps above all,because in the determination of issues revolving about the reasonableness of conduct,the values inherent in the jury system are rightfully believed an important instrument in the adjudicative process.

in the instant case,there is considerable evidence that calls into doubt the district court view that utica college safety measures were sufficient as a matter of law.for example,mark kovacs,who managed utica college residential halls as the director of residence life,explained that in allowing the breezeway exception,the school intended to the best of its ability to try to have students,work studies,sit at the front desk through various residence halls.when asked about who was stationed at the front desk on october,kovacs said there may or may not have been a work study student at the fron
