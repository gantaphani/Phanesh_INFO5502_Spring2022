or matthew has asperger syndrome,a high functioning form of autism for many years,his parents and the meridian school district msd have disagreed as to whether matthew was entitled to special education services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.the appeals before us were filed by msd and challenge the district court determination that matthew was entitled to the preparation of an independent educational evaluation iee at public expense award of attorneys fees to matthew parents and injunction against matthew graduation from high school.we affirm in part and reverse in part.we find no error in the district court affirmance of the hearing officer determination that matthew was entitled to an iee at public expense.however,we conclude that although the parents request for attorneys fees was timely,and that they are prevailing parties,they are not eligible for an award of attorneys fees under i b.finally,we vacate the injunction against matthew graduation.
matthew was born in.in,he moved from california to idaho.matthew had received special education in california,and his parents provided msd with information related to previous diagnoses of language disorder,central auditory processing disorder,possibility of dyslexia and dysgraphia,and possibility of asperger disorder.matthew received special education under the idea from fifth grade through eighth grade.in april,while matthew was in eighth grade,matthew individualized education program iep team determined,following a reevaluation of matthew,that he no longer needed special education services.his parents sometimes referred to as the parents disagreed with this decision and,at their own expense,obtained an evaluation from timothy leavell,who diagnosed matthew with asperger disorder.the parents asked msd to conduct an evaluation of matthew and reassess his eligibility for special education.msd,however,concluded that,rather than an iep under the idea,matthew would receive various accommodations starting in ninth grade under section of the rehabilitation act.
matthew freshman year was spent at centennial high school until april when matthew set a fire in a room in the family home,was arrested,and placed in the ada county juvenile detention center acjdc.while matthew was in the acjdc,his parents requested that the boise school district bsd,which had responsibility for the acjdc,evaluate matthew eligibility for special education services.on february,bsd issued an eligibility report finding strong indications of asperger syndrome,but concluding that matthew was not eligible for special education services because at this time,there is no evidence of the adverse effect of his disabilities on his current educational performance.however,the report noted that the evaluation was limited by the fact that the assessments were conducted while matthew was confined.the report stated 
in the event matthew is released from the acjdc and placed at another facility,or returns home to the meridian school district,matthew parents may wish to request an evaluation to determine whether his disabilities adversely affect his educational performance,and whether he needs specially designed instruction in order to access and progress in the general education curriculum.
matthew was released from the acjdc in september,and returned to centennial high school,several weeks after the school year had started.three days before he returned to the high school,his parents delivered a letter to msd requesting a comprehensive iep for matthew.msd considered the request,drafted a new section plan for matthew,and on september,denied the parents requests for additional assessments.msd stated that it was relying on the february report prepared by bsd and that the idea provides that reevaluation may not occur more than once a year.
matthew mother indicated that she disagreed with msd and sought a team meeting.meetings were held in october and november,and on november,but msd declined to perform an additional assessment of matthew.msd notice discussed matthew section plan and concluded that matthew did not need specially designed instruction at this time and therefore does not qualify for an iep.
in january,matthew mother sent msd a letter disagreeing with its conclusion and requesting an iee.she asserted that the prior evaluations were conducted in an extremely structured and regimented environment,the evaluations are not comprehensive,and do not adequately assess matthew unique needs.
msd denied the request for an iee and filed for a due process hearing pursuant to and b i,seeking confirmation of its decision from a hearing officer.the matter was assigned to special education hearing officer guy price ho price,who conducted three weeks of hearings on two issues i s the student entitled to an independent educational evaluation,as requested by his attorney on january,and d oes the student qualify for special education pursuant to the eligibility criteria set forth in the idea and the idaho special education manual.
in a june,decision,ho price found that msd had failed to conduct an appropriate evaluation,held that matthew was entitled to an iee at public expense,and declined to rule on whether he qualified for special education services,stating that such a determination would be premature prior to the completion of an appropriate evaluation 
in july,msd filed an action in the district court of idaho seeking judicial review of ho price decision.on may,the district court issued an order granting the parents motion to enjoin matthew graduation from high school.in march,the district court issued an order affirming ho price decision and dismissing msd appeal.on april,msd filed a timely notice of appeal appeal.thereafter,the district court conducted further proceedings on the parents request for attorneys fees.on october,the district court entered an order granting the parents attorneys fees.the final judgment was entered on november,and msd filed a timely notice of appeal from the award of attorneys fees on december,appeal.
meanwhile,pursuant to ho price directive,an iee was prepared for matthew and submitted to msd in september.msd proceeded to evaluate matthew eligibility for special education services under the idea.in january,the parents filed a request for a due process hearing alleging that msd had not timely evaluated matthew.in february,msd determined that matthew was not eligible for special education.the parents then filed a second due process complaint challenging that ruling.the two due process complaints were consolidated into a single case and were heard by hearing officer litteneker ho litteneker.ho litteneker conducted ten days of hearings over two months before issuing a decision on july,holding that matthew was not entitled to special education services under the idea.the parents then filed a complaint with the district court seeking review of ho litteneker decision.on january,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order affirming ho litteneker decision that matthew was not entitled to special education services.the parents filed an appeal from that decision 
in addition,the parents filed another action arising from the same background that is not before us.in february,the parents initiated administrative proceedings under the rehabilitation act and in march,initiated an action alleging that msd and bsd had violated matthew rights under the americans with disabilities act ada.meridian joint sch.dist.that action was ultimately resolved in an trial in the summer of.the jury answered no to the special verdict question was matthew denied a free and appropriate public education by the meridian school district.chief magistrate judge candy dale,who presided over all of the cases concerning matthew,issued a final judgment on july.there was no appeal from the judgment.

in addition,we have held that the party challenging the district court ruling bears the burden of proof on appeal.e,at quoting,at.
we initially turn our attention to msd challenges to ho price determination that matthew was entitled to the preparation of an iee at public expense.because we affirm that decision,we next address the district court award of attorneys fees.we first hold that despite msd arguments to the contrary,the parents request for attorneys fees was timely.this brings us to i b i,which grants the district court discretion to award reasonable attorneys fees as part of costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.we conclude that while the parents are a prevailing party,neither is a parent of a child with a disability for purposes of the statute attorneys fees provision.last,we address and vacate the district court injunction barring matthew graduation from high school.
a.the hearing officer and the district court properly determined the parents were entitled to an iee at public expense.
in his page memorandum decision,ho price carefully considered the evidence and arguments presented by msd and the parents.he first rejected msd argument that it could rely on bsd evaluation,noting that it appears to be at least as probable as not that the bsd suggestion that the setting might impact their findings was correct,and that a number of professionals had concern with evaluating a student solely within the confines of acjdc.second,he found that msd desire to perform additional observations was likely nothing more than an effort to put off the decision third,the hearing officer held that msd had relied too heavily on matthew ability to obtain good grades,and that msd accommodations did not address the problems matthew had with fluency and processing speed.ho price expressed concern that msd sought to use its acceptance of matthew diagnosis of asperger syndrome to allow it to focus solely on academic achievement.he commented that although numerous tests were given,if one looks closely,it is easy to see that the outcomes of those tests almost all show deficits which are probably attributable to the student disability and that it seems that the interpretation of those tests was predetermined to be interpreted as indicating that the student was not in need of special education.ho price concluded there are indicators that matthew has high intelligence and can do well in many academic arenas,but it does not appear that he has overcome his disability to the extent that it has no adverse effect on his performance.ho price concluded that a dditional evaluation and interpretation is necessary before such a conclusion could be reached,and because he did not have confidence in the eligibility report relied upon and interpreted by the district,the parent is entitled to an independent educational evaluation.
the district court carefully addressed msd objections to the hearing officer decision in a page memorandum decision.the district court emphasized that it was not deciding whether matthew was entitled to special education under the idea or even whether he suffered an adverse impact on his educational performance as a result of his disability.rather 
the only issue before the court is whether the school district adoption of bsd eligibility report and refusal to conduct an evaluation at mother request was appropriate.ho price found that the school district adoption of bsd report was not appropriate due to the setting in which bsd evaluation took place and because the school district improperly overemphasized grades in looking at whether suffered an adverse affect from his disability.the court finds no error with those findings.
on appeal,msd argues that it complied with the idea statutory framework and regulatory criteria and the district court failed to independently review the record.msd argues that the district court should have given more weight to its employees observations of matthew after he returned to the high school failed to appreciate that there is no relevant test that takes into account a more restrictive setting relied on the same unreliable testimony as the hearing officer and should not have accepted the hearing officer conclusion that msd relied solely on matthew academic performance.
msd challenges to the determination that matthew was entitled to an iee at public expense do not meet its burden of proof.one of the purposes of the idea is to free children and parents from total reliance on a school district assessment of a child.in honig.doe,the supreme court noted 
envisioning the iep as the centerpiece of the statute education delivery system for disabled children,and aware that schools had all too often denied such children appropriate educations without in any way consulting their parents,congress repeatedly emphasized throughout the act the importance and indeed the necessity of parental participation in both the development of the iep and any subsequent assessments of its effectiveness.
here,msd,in essence,argues that it was entitled to rely on bsd evaluation,and that the district court and the hearing officer should have given more weight to its witnesses.neither argument is persuasive.the bsd evaluation clearly stated that a further evaluation might well be appropriate when matthew returned to the public high school.it is common sense that a student public high school is a very different learning environment from a juvenile detention center.furthermore,here,matthew personal history which msd knew well strongly suggested that he would need assistance with the transition.indeed,msd does not specifically contend otherwise as it arranged to provide matthew with services under section.
the idea establishes a basic floor of education for children with disabilities.me.sch.admin.dist,cir quoting a a.title a i,and the implementing regulations,require that for a child with autism to receive educational services,his disability must adversely affect his educational performance.c i.the regulations further provide that states may develop standards for determining whether a disability adversely affects a child educational performance.idaho has done so.see idaho state dep t of,special education manual,available at,hereafter idaho manual.the district court noted that the idaho manual provides that e ducational performance includes both academic areas reading,math,communications,and nonacademic areas daily life activities,mobility,skills,social adaption,skills.msd does not deny that this is the applicable standard.
we conclude that the hearing officer,as well as the district court,carefully and thoroughly reviewed all the evidence and we also find that the evidence supports the conclusion that msd refusal to prepare an iee when matthew reentered high school was unreasonable.it was proper for the district court to credit ho price discussion of witness testimony that highlighted deficiencies in the bsd evaluation.both the hearing officer and the district court were careful to note that neither was determining whether matthew was entitled to special education services under the idea.rather,they concluded that the evidence presented did not establish that he did not need such services.their determinations are entitled to deference,but even on a de novo review we would affirm 
b.the parents request for attorneys fees was timely.
ho price issued his decision on june.on july,msd filed its complaint in the district court seeking review of that decision.the parents requested attorneys fees for the proceedings before the hearing officer in their answer to the complaint that was filed on july.
in the district court,msd argued that the request was untimely because the applicable limitations period was either or days,and both periods had expired.the parents asserted that the day limitations period for appealing an adverse decision from a due process hearing under the idea applied to claims for attorneys fees.the district court disagreed with both parties.
the parents position was based on i b,which provides that a party aggrieved by an administrative officer decision may bring an action in a district court within days of that decision.the district court reasoned that this section applied only to parties that are aggrieved by the hearing officer decision,not to those who prevailed and the section was added in but did not reference,or affect,the provision addressing attorneys fees.the district court noted that other courts had held that the day statute of limitations contained in i b does not apply to claims for attorneys fees under i b.see brandon dep t of,d,on appeal neither party questions the district court determination that the request for attorneys fees is not subject to the day limitations period.
msd assertion that a day or day limitations period applied was based on regulations promulgated pursuant to the idaho administrative procedures act.the day period applies to requests for attorneys fees from agency decisions when the agency has authority to award costs fees.idaho admin.code.the day period comes from the regulatory provision allowing appeals to a civil court from a hearing officer decision.idaho admin.code.g.however,that section does not appear to be applicable because it only applies to parties adversely affected by the hearing officer decision.
instead,the district court determined that the idea did not contain a limitation period governing the parents claim for attorneys fees,and followed the approach set forth in ostby oxnard union high,d.the district court in ostby had reasoned 
the idea specifies no limitations period governing a plaintiff suit for attorney fees.see i b zipperer sch.bd.of seminole county,cir powers indiana dep t of,cir.therefore,we must determine the most closely analogous state statute of limitations and apply that statute unless it would undermine the policies underlying the idea.livingston sch.dist.keenan,cir.in order to assess which state statute of limitations is most analogous,the court must characterize the essence of the claim in the pending case,and decide which state statute provides the most appropriate limiting principle.sherwood school,cir quoting wilson garcia.
d at parallel citations omitted.see also brandon,d at as such,when congress fails to provide a statute of limitations in federal statutes,the u.supreme court has indicated that the settled practice is to adopt the most analogous state time limitation,so long as it is consistent with federal policy to do so.
the inquiry as to the most analogous statute of limitations reveals a circuit split on the issue.the sixth and seventh circuits have characterized attorneys fees requests as ancillary to the dispute,and accordingly borrowed state statutes of limitations for judicial review of administrative agency decisions.king floyd cnty.bd.of,cir agreeing with the seventh circuit that the attorneys fee issue is ancillary to the administrative proceeding powers.dep t of,div.of special,cir viewing powers claim for attorneys fees not as an independent action but as a claim ancillary to the underlying education dispute however,the eleventh circuit in zipperer school board of seminole county,florida,cir,characterized an attorneys fee claim under the idea as an independent action and applied florida statute of limitations 
the district court in ostby preferred the eleventh circuit approach,noting that a an action for attorney fees is explicitly distinct from the administrative review process,and therefore could not be considered ancillary to that process b the administrative agency has no jurisdiction to award attorneys fees,and therefore there is no such thing as an action for review of an agency decision regarding fees c the resolution of claims for attorneys fees is less urgent and,in reality,is more likely to be resolved by the attorneys interest in prompt payment than by a short period of limitations and d the longer period of time is likely to encourage the involvement of parents,as represented by attorneys,in securing appropriate public educations for their children.d at.
the district court in ostby also found our opinion in dreher amphitheater unified school district,cir,instructive.in dreher,one question was the limitations period for filing a court action challenging a school district refusal to grant parents a due process hearing to determine financial responsibility for their child speech therapy at a private school.id.at.the idea did not specify a limitations period,and we chose to apply arizona limitations period for liabilities created by statute,rather than the day limitations period that applied to judicial review of administrative decisions.id.at.we reasoned that because plaintiffs were not granted a due process hearing,their action was not analogous to an appeal from a final administrative decision a longer limitations period was consistent with federal policies and the child education was not threatened by the duration of the claim.id.the district court in ostby found our reasoning in dreher persuasive,noting if the ninth circuit found that the action in dreher a challenge to a refusal to provide a due process hearing was not analogous to judicial review of an administrative decision,then the ninth circuit probably would also find that an action for attorney fees over which an administrative agency has no jurisdiction is also not analogous to review of an administrative decision.d at.other district courts have followed ostby 
faced with an existing circuit split,we agree with the position taken by the district court.as set forth by the district court in ostby,and consistent with the spirit of our decision in dreher,we conclude that a request for attorneys fees under the idea is more analogous to an independent claim than an ancillary proceeding.the fact that the hearing officer may not award attorneys fees weighs in favor of holding that a request for attorneys fees filed in the district court is not ancillary to the judicial review of the administrative decision.moreover,the longer time period promotes the purposes of the idea.indeed,the adoption of the state law limitations period for judicial review of administrative agency decisions might lead to the anomalous result that the party that prevailed before the hearing officer would have to decide whether to file an action seeking attorneys fees before the party that lost before the hearing officer decided whether to seek judicial review.accordingly,we affirm the district court determination that the parents request for attorneys fees was timely filed under the most analogous state statute of limitations 
c.the parents are prevailing parties.
the idea provides that reasonable attorneys fees may be awarded to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.i b i i emphasis added.the district court,citing weissburg lancaster school district,cir,held that the parents had prevailed because the hearing officer award materially altered the legal relationship between the parties.it found that i n obtaining the relief ordered by the hearing officer that the school district provide with an iee at public expense parents clearly secured a remedy that fosters the purposes of the idea.
the ninth circuit has determined that to be a prevailing party,a party must succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit.van duyn,at quoting parents of student puyallup sch.dist,cir.on appeal,msd contends that the parents were not prevailing parties because no material change to the legal relationship of the student and the school district resulted from the administrative proceeding.msd asserts that there was no material change in the legal relationship because matthew was never determined to be in need of special education services and that simply being awarded an iee is inarguably nothing more than a technical and de minimus result.
msd cites the controlling law but reaches an incorrect conclusion.here,the hearing officer decision that matthew was entitled to an iee at public expense did result in the requisite alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon bd.and care home,va dep of health and human.as a result of the hearing officer decision,msd had to pay for an iee and was required to consider the iee before it could determine whether matthew was entitled to special education services under the idea.indeed,msd thought this consequence of sufficient import that it filed an action in the district court seeking to reverse the hearing officer decision.the parents are prevailing parties as that term has been defined by the supreme court in hensley eckerhart,and the ninth circuit in van duyn,at.
d.the parents are not entitled to attorneys fees pursuant to i b i i.
section i b i i provides that attorneys fees may be awarded to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.emphasis added.section defines child with a disability as a child with an impairment or disability who,by reason thereof,needs special education and related services.msd contends that this definition of child with a disability limits the availability of attorneys fees under the idea to a parent whose child has been determined to need special education services.msd reasons that because matthew has not been determined to need special education services,the parents are not eligible for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to i b i i.
the fifth circuit adopted this approach in bryan independent school district,cir,relying,in part,on an unpublished opinion by the third circuit,neptune township board of education,app cir,which was factually similar to matthew case.the fifth circuit explained 
in neptune township,parents of a child with various disorders filed a due process petition to compel testing and services.the state administrative law judge ordered the school to conduct a evaluation but denied the other requested relief.the school evaluated the child and concluded that he was not eligible for services.the parents amended their petition for a due process hearing to challenge the school determination that the child was not eligible for services but subsequently withdrew the appeal and filed for attorneys fees under the idea.the district court denied the parents motion for attorneys fees because the child had not been determined to be eligible for services.
on appeal,the third circuit concluded that the text of the idea provision was unambiguous and interpreted the statute to bar recovery of attorneys fees because there was never a determination that the child needed special education,and therefore,the parents did not meet the plain language of the idea provision.in so holding,the court acknowledged that the school likely would have not completed the evaluations absent the alj orders and that b ut for retaining counsel,the parents would not have secured the evaluation for the child.but,the court also noted that its interpretation of the statute was consistent with the purpose of the idea provision to allow parents of disabled children to effectuate their right to a free appropriate public education.the court rejected the suggestion that the provision should apply to children merely suspected of having a disability.
at footnotes omitted 
the fifth circuit acknowledged arguments that a other provisions of the idea extended procedural rights to children who had yet to be found to be disabled,and b holding he is not eligible for recovery of attorneys fees will have a chilling effect on future idea cases,frustrate parents ability to hire counsel,and undermine the interests of the students and goals of the idea.at.the fifth circuit,however,reasoned 
arguments can not overcome the plain language of the statute.the supreme court has directed courts interpreting the idea to start with the text of the statute and has stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.the court has also stated that w hen the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.here,the plain language of the idea provision limits recovery of attorneys fees to the parent of a child with a disability.
id.at footnotes omitted.in further response to tb arguments,the fifth circuit noted 
congress has provided some protections for children not yet determined to fit the definition of child with a disability.section k and its protections in disciplinary proceedings might reflect a broader intent to protect children not yet determined to fit the definition of child with a disability.but just because congress has specifically extended some protections to children not yet determined to meet the definition of child with a disability does not mean that it has extended all protections.to the contrary,the language of the attorneys fee provision in i b i i specifically provides the district court with discretion to award attorneys fees to a parent of a child with a disability.unlike k,i b i i makes no reference to children not yet determined to be disabled.the idea can not be read to provide attorneys fees to,and any policies reflected in k can not overcome the express provisions in i b i i.
id.at.the fifth circuit concluded that regardless of the policy considerations and even if an alternate version of the statute would better serve the goals of the idea,that is a decision appropriately left to congress,not to this court.id.at.
in matthew case,the district court declined to follow the fifth circuit approach on the grounds that it could look beyond the language of a statute to avoid an absurd result or a decision that would violate congressional intent in enacting the statute.see barajas united states,cir.the district court reasoned that the provision was not as clear and unambiguous as the fifth circuit suggested,and that the term parent of a child with a disability is used in other parts of the idea to cover procedures that precede any determination of eligibility for special education services.the district court also found support for its approach in our opinion in hacienda la puente unified school district of los angeles honig,cir,where we held that although the idea referred to children with disabilities,a child not previously identified as disabled could raise his or her alleged disability in an idea administrative due process hearing.id.at.
having determined that the idea was subject to differing interpretations,the district court concluded that the restrictive interpretation of the attorneys fees provision was contrary to the congressional intent to encourage,assist and make whole parents and attorneys who work to vindicate the rights of handicapped children.the district court worried that msd interpretation would discourage parents from invoking their rights under the idea and create an incentive for schools to take an adversarial position early in the identification and evaluation process without fear of being liable for attorneys fees.
we appreciate the district court concerns,but agree with the fifth circuit that we are bound by the clear language in the idea limiting the award of attorneys fees to parents of a child with a disability,defined as a child determined to need special education services.abiding by the plain language of the statute will not thwart the purpose of the statutory scheme or lead to an absurd result.see barajas,
