this case involves application of the exhaustion requirement under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,l.we reaffirm the principle that plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies before filing a civil lawsuit if they seek relief for injuries that could be redressed to any degree by the idea administrative procedures.see robb bethel sch.dist,cir.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiffs complaint.
shane kutasi is an autistic boy who was years old when the disputes at issue here arose.he attended the round meadow elementary school in calabasas,california,from until he graduated in.in,shane and barbara the las virgenes school district school district agreed upon an individualized education program iep.in accordance with the iep,shane attended a general education class with an aide for most of the morning and received home schooling in the afternoon.the kutasis and the school district,however,were unable to reach agreement on a modified iep for shane for the succeeding school years.as a result of a stay put order issued by the california special education hearing office seho that extended the terms of the iep,shane continued to receive full inclusion in a classroom with a modified curriculum,as well as speech and occupational therapy services.
the complaint reveals a long history of apparently bitter disagreement between the kutasis and the school district,and their conflict came to a head in the fall of after shane graduation from round meadow elementary school.shane was scheduled to attend the wright middle school.but on august,three days before the school term began,the school district proposed an iep that required shane to be placed in a special day class,created for students with disabilities regardless of their age,grade or specific disability.the kutasis rejected the school district proposal,and the parties continued to differ over the kind of educational and related services to be provided shane.shane briefly attended general education classes at wright,but was denied access to the school after three days by principal steven rosensweig,who claimed that shane was not properly enrolled.since september,shane has been schooled at home by a team of behavioral therapists pursuant to the stay put order.
the kutasis filed a complaint in march in the federal district court for the central district of california,on their own behalf and as guardian ad litem for shane.their complaint charged the las virgenes unified school district,the board of trustees of the district,donald zimring acting superintendent of the district,john fitzpatrick acting superintendent of the district and joseph nardo director of special education services for the district collectively defendants with two counts of violating and one count of violating of the rehabilitation act of.the kutasis alleged that the defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of retaliatory and discriminatory actions against shane and his parents.the complaint identified alleged retaliatory and discriminatory actions

on april,the kutasis filed their complaint in federal court,but before the district court issued a school district filed an administrative hearing request,asking the seho to approve the august proposed iep.the school district request did not refer to any of the discriminatory acts alleged in the kutasis complaint.while the school district administrative hearing was still pending before the seho,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,holding that the kutasis failed to exhaust the idea administrative remedies before filing suit in federal court.recognizing that t he threshold question is whether the injuries alleged could have been redressed to any degree by the idea administrative procedures and remedies emphasis in original,the court found that e ven a cursory review of plaintiffs complaint makes clear that some of the alleged injuries could almost certainly be redressed by the idea administrative procedures and remedies.the court concluded that,for example,an administrative hearing could potentially be dispositive,or,at the least,would be helpful to this court analysis of the kutasis allegations that the defendants refused to allow shane to attend wright and repeatedly refused to reimburse them for shane therapy.the kutasis filed a timely notice of appeal.
after the district court dismissed the kutasis complaint,the seho issued a ruling against the school district on the august proposed iep,finding that it did not constitute a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.the seho opinion did not,however,address any of the issues raised by the kutasis complaint.thus,the kutasis claims still have not been exhausted.

whether exhaustion is required under the idea in a particular case is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.see witte clark county sch,cir.
discussion 
statutory framework 
the idea is a comprehensive educational scheme that confers on students with disabilities a substantive right to public education.see van duyn baker sch.dist,cir hoeft tucson unified sch,cir.the idea provides financial assistance to enable states to meet their educational needs,but conditions funding on the effectuation of a policy that assures all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education.see a.to that end,the idea requires that school districts develop an iep for each child with a disability.see winkelman parma city sch,d.
when parents are unsatisfied with the adequacy of the education provided,the construction of the iep,or some related matter,idea provides procedural recourse.id.at.participating states must establish procedures giving a n opportunity for any party to present a complaint with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.b a see also cal.a.after a complaint is filed,the local or state educational agency must convene a meeting with the parents and the
