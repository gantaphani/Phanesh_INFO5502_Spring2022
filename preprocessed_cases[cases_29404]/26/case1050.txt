dimitris desyllas,a student newspaper editor at portland state university psu,appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to four university officials on desyllas claims for violation of his first and fourth amendment rights.we must decide whether the district court correctly concluded that the university officials were entitled to qualified immunity.we conclude there was no error and affirm.
the united states district court for the district of oregon had jurisdiction in the underlying action pursuant to and based on desyllas claims under.we have jurisdiction to review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the university officials pursuant to.
in december,desyllas,editor of a psu student newspaper called the rearguard,found a box of confidential student records outside the rearguard office in the smith memorial center on campus.an anonymous note suggested that he would know what to do with the records.desyllas thumbed through some of the records and,realizing their confidential nature,locked the files in a cupboard inside the newspaper office and then consulted an attorney at the student press law center.
desyllas eventually compiled an electronic summary of the contents of the errant box.he said that he prepared this summary as part of an investigation for a news story,which he never finished,and he included student names and descriptions of disciplinary and other personal records.among the records were approximately files on psu students from to.the box contained mental health assessments,medical records and records of disciplinary action for student misconduct such as possession of illegal drugs and firearms,plagiarism,unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and sexual harassment.he found a notation inside the box to be destroyed.
although he had vague plans to write a news story about the university failure to keep the records confidential,he took no public action regarding the records for several months.on february,he wrote a letter delivered by a fellow student to psu president daniel bernstine advising that t he rearguard collective possessed the records and would be going forward with a press release on this matter within the next two weeks.he did not indicate that he intended to publish a news story in the newspaper,which has a sporadic publication schedule and no set deadlines,nor did he attempt to interview bernstine about how the records left the university possession.
when he received desyllas letter on the afternoon of february,bernstine feared that release of the confidential information would subject the university to liability under federal and state law.bernstine and two other university officials,special assistant to the president rod diman and public safety director john fowler,immediately sought legal advice from the oregon department of justice.
special assistant attorney general melinda grier concluded that the box of records had been stolen and advised bernstine,diman and fowler to retrieve the records from the rearguard office.grier advised that,as president of the university,bernstine had absolute authority to enter any portion of the smith center,including the rearguard office,or to lock the office door to ensure no one carried away the records.grier suggested that bernstine,diman and fowler attempt to convince desyllas to return the records.alternatively,grier said,a search warrant could be obtained.grier did not advise psu officials that they could detain or arrest desyllas.
after the telephone conversation with grier,at,bernstine instructed diman and fowler to retrieve the records in accordance with grier advice.accompanied by sergeant mike soto,who was a uniformed campus police officer,diman and fowler approached the rearguard office and found it empty and locked.fowler instructed soto to secure the door with a clam shell lock,a device that fits over a doorknob and prevents access.thereafter,fowler and diman located desyllas one floor up in the smith center at the student government office and asked to speak with him.
desyllas consented but requested that they remain in the student government office,where other students were present.when fowler asked desyllas to return the records,desyllas lied.he said that the records were not in the newspaper office and that the records were not in a place where he could be taken to retrieve them.moreover,he told fowler and diman that he realized the records were university property and that he ultimately intended to return the records,but that he needed the files temporarily in order to complete a news story.
fowler told desyllas that desyllas could be arrested for possession of stolen property and that police could obtain a search warrant to attempt to retrieve the records from the rearguard office.during this conversation,soto arrived to inform fowler that soto had requested another officer to bring a key for the clam shell lock.two police officers on bicycles were visible through a window of the student government office.
desyllas requested that he be allowed to telephone his newspaper advisor and a lawyer.fowler ordered soto to accompany desyllas to the rearguard office to unlock the clam shell lock so desyllas could enter.soto remained in the hallway and doorway outside the office,conversing with another officer while desyllas used the telephone.desyllas failed to reach his advisor but did speak with a lawyer for about minutes.desyllas and soto then returned to the student government office,where they were met by diman and fowler.desyllas told diman and fowler that desyllas wanted to wait an hour and try again to reach his advisor and another lawyer.
according to desyllas,fowler replied that we can stay here all night or wait here all night if we have to.desyllas was not told that he was not free to leave.
after a short wait in the student government office,desyllas stated that he wanted to go outside to smoke a cigarette.he left with student body president bar johnston,who had witnessed the events in the student government office,and with soto,who was acquainted with desyllas from their joint participation at several previous campus events.desyllas once had nominated soto for an award from the rearguard for outstanding work with students.
once outside,soto asked desyllas for a cigarette.while smoking outside,soto and desyllas discussed the box of records and desyllas jokingly asked if soto wanted to go have a beer.
johnston and desyllas then walked out of soto earshot,although the two students remained in soto view.after a short conversation between desyllas and johnston,student editor desyllas informed soto that desyllas would turn over the box of records.desyllas and soto then told diman and fowler and retrieved the records from the rearguard office.bernstine called grier at to say the records had been returned.
desyllas filed a complaint against bernstine,diman,fowler and psu in the united states district court for the district of oregon on march.desyllas alleged that psu officials unlawfully detained him and seized his property but not that psu officials engaged in prior restraint of speech by censoring news or thwarting publication of news.
on the morning of march,psu student kimmy beemon posted fliers at various points around campus announcing desyllas press conference to discuss his lawsuit against university officials.beemon was accompanied by student jeremy rosenbloom,who posted fliers for a students for unity movie night.
after posting fliers on columns between the smith center and neuberger hall,rosenbloom observed psu public safety officer joseph widner removing fliers announcing the press conference and the movie night.rosenbloom said that widner took down only the press conference and movie night fliers while leaving other fliers.upset that widner disposed of the fliers without recycling them,rosenbloom confronted widner and had a discussion about recycling.when rosenbloom returned to the area about one hour and minutes later,all the limited to the press conference and movie night had been on the columns were gone.there is no evidence regarding who removed the fliers after rosenbloom left the area.
rosenbloom said that in other areas of campus,fliers for the press conference and movie night were removed from hallways and doorways although fliers announcing other events remained.again,there is no evidence about who made these selective removals.
psu bulletin board posting policy states in part 
in general,it is not appropriate to post posters,banners or other materials in buildings,on doors,walls,elevators or other areas of the campus that are not designated bulletin boards.doing so causes damage to paint and windows and in most cases,your poster will be taken down by custodial staff all users are prohibited from posting any item on any unapproved surface,including walls,doors,windows,elevators,floors or.an identified campus department or unit administers all university boards.users must obtain proper approval before posting any item on any board,and must follow applicable guidelines.
desyllas filed a second amended complaint against bernstine,diman,fowler and rick roe on may.the second amended complaint alleged under that the appellees violated desyllas right to be free from unlawful detention,right to be free from unlawful seizure of property,right to freedom of the press and right to freedom of speech.rick roe was later identified as widner.
the appellees filed a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity on october.the magistrate judge granted the motion and dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice on february.desyllas filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.citation omitted.
summary judgment is proper on each of desyllas claims if there are no disputed material facts and if the appellees are entitled to qualified immunity.id.government officials who perform discretionary functions generally are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d citations omitted.
the material facts are undisputed.in the relevant substantive law of qualified immunity,we must examine first whether the appellees violated desyllas constitutional rights on the facts alleged and,second,if there was a violation,whether the constitutional rights were clearly established.saucier katz,d.
we first address desyllas claims under the fourth amendment.desyllas does not advance,and the record does not support,an allegation that he or the rearguard office was searched.desyllas does not claim that placing a clam shell lock on the rearguard door constituted a seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.desyllas contends only that he was unlawfully detained and that the box of confidential records was unlawfully seized.desyllas claim for unlawful seizure of the records derives from his primary claim that he was unlawfully detained because we conclude that desyllas was not detained in violation of the fourth amendment but rather remained voluntarily with the appellees until deciding to give up the box of records of his own choosing,we need not address desyllas contention that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for unlawful seizure of the records.
when law enforcement officers detain a person but stop short of making an arrest,the fourth amendment mandates that the officers act reasonably in light of all the circumstances.terry ohio,d.in assessing whether the appellees violated desyllas fourth amendment rights,we must address first whether there was a detention within the meaning of the fourth amendment and second whether,if there was a detention,it was reasonable in light of the circumstances.
for purposes of the fourth amendment,detention or seizure of a person occurs when the officer,by means of physical force or show of authority,has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen id.at.m ere police questioning does not constitute a seizure.florida bostick,d.consensual encounters with police likewise do not constitute investigatory stops.see united states kim,cir.questioning by law enforcement officers constitutes an investigatory stop only if in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident,a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.id.internal quotations omitted.
desyllas was never told he was not free to leave the presence of diman,fowler and soto.desyllas did not request to leave their presence altogether.rather,he only requested that he be allowed to leave the student government office to use the telephone and once to go outside to he was allowed to do so both times.desyllas was not shown a weapon or physically touched or restrained.desyllas was informed of the possibility that a search warrant could be obtained,but a reasonable person would have interpreted that not as a threat but rather as a option for university officials if desyllas decided not to voluntarily give up the records.we therefore conclude that desyllas was not detained within the meaning of the fourth amendment.
even if desyllas was detained,that detention was not unlawful if the appellees conduct was reasonable in light of all the circumstances.terry,at.the determination of whether the appellees conduct was reasonable requires us to balance the government need to detain desyllas,if indeed he was detained,against desyllas interest in maintaining liberty and privacy.id.at.see also ganwich knapp,cir we balance the and law concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable.quoting illinois mcarthur,d.government interests that may justify detention include crime prevention and detection as well as protection of the safety of law enforcement officers and others.terry,at.see also ruvalcaba city of los angeles,cir.
in this case,the appellees had a strong interest in recovering a box of confidential university records containing private information about former students.among the files in the box were medical records,mental health evaluations and disciplinary records relating to various forms of student misconduct.the appellees contend that,in addition to their interest in recovering the box to avoid university liability for disclosure of student records in potential violation of and law,they had an interest in enforcing oregon criminal statutes prohibiting theft 
given these asserted government interests,desyllas was not unreasonably detained.bernstine,fowler and diman acted only because desyllas sent bernstine an ambiguous letter advising of a press conference.bernstine telephone records show that no more than minutes passed between the time diman and fowler left bernstine office to speak with desyllas and the time the student records were secured.desyllas was not physically restrained nor prevented from making telephone calls.he did not undergo coerced interrogation,and his liberty was not contingent on handing over the confidential records.ganwich,at.if desyllas was detained,that detention was carefully tailored to its underlying justification,id.at quoting florida royer,d,because fowler and diman remained with desyllas only until he answered their question about whether he would willingly give them the box of confidential student records that desyllas readily acknowledged belonged to the university.
because desyllas was not unreasonably detained,and because desyllas voluntarily returned the box of records,the appellees did not violate desyllas fourth amendment rights under the facts as alleged by desyllas.accordingly,we need not consider the second part of the qualified immunity the constitutional rights were clearly established.saucier,at.the district court properly concluded that the appellees were entitled to summary judgment on desyllas unlawful detention and seizure claims.
desyllas first amendment claims address two separate contentions first,that placing the clam shell lock on the door of the newspaper office violated desyl
