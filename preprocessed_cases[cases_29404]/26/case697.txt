on july,deborah cullen,filed a complaint against the indiana university board of trustees the university,alleging violations of the equal pay act and of title vii,based on sex discrimination and retaliation.the university filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted on july.cullen filed this appeal on july.she appeals all of the district court determinations except for its grant of summary judgment in favor of the university on the retaliation claim.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
deborah cullen began her employment at indiana university indianapolis campus in may.she was appointed director of the respiratory therapy program,with the rank of associate professor.she also was credited with three years toward tenure.her salary was.cullen male predecessor had been paid.the respiratory therapy program operates as a department of the school of allied health sciences soahs,which has eighteen programs,including physical therapy.
cullen holds a bachelor of science degree in respiratory therapy,a master of arts in education and a doctor of education degree.she had fifteen years teaching experience prior to arriving at the university,including serving as director of grossmont college respiratory therapy program from.in,cullen was granted tenure at indiana university she was promoted to full professor in april.cullen has chaired numerous committees,authored articles and secured grants for the respiratory therapy program,including of annual funding from clarian health providers.in,acting soahs dean mark sothmann increased her salary from approximately to,so that she would be paid more than a male associate professor whom she supervised.from through,cullen annual salary increases averaged the average of soahs faculty increases was per year.
in july,sandy quillen,was hired by dean sothmann as program director for physical therapy and as a tenured associate professor at a salary of.his predecessor,a woman,had been paid.quillen holds five degrees a bachelor of science degree in health and physical education,a bachelor of science degree in physical therapy,a master of education in developmental and adaptative physical education,a master of public affairs in health services management,and a in sports medicine.before he was hired by the university,quillen was chair of the department of physical therapy at the college of mount joseph in cincinnati,ohio.in that post,he was paid a comparable salary in the high,ex at.
at the time of quillen hiring,dean sothmann conducted a national search,but received few applications for the physical therapy program director position.the physical therapy program was on probationary accreditation status and in danger of losing its accreditation.this situation presented a major problem for the university because students must graduate from an accredited program in order to be permitted to sit for the physical therapy licensing exam.upon assuming his responsibilities,therefore,quillen was required to extricate the program from probation and to create a graduate program in order to maintain accreditation.quillen has launched successfully a graduate program,which now offers the only doctoral program in the soahs.
the physical therapy program accounts for a significant amount of tuition in the soahs for example,in,it generated of the soahs tuition revenue.in fact,the soahs could not survive without a financially viable physical therapy program.in,physical therapy generated to respiratory therapy.physical therapy also has twice as many students and faculty as respiratory therapy,in,students as opposed to students and faculty as opposed to faculty.between and,physical therapy awarded two and a half times as many bachelor degrees as respiratory therapy.
during,cullen was paid quillen was paid.in,the comparison was to in,to and in,to.this disparity is in accord with the average differential between directors in these positions at other midwestern schools.that disparity was in,more than in,and approximately in.both cullen and quillen are compensated within the range of salaries paid for their respective disciplines.
in the early,a university professor of economics,paul carlin,conducted a pay equity study.the study found a statistically significant gap between the salaries of male and female faculty members,and carlin could not rule out discrimination as a cause.in,patrick rooney,special assistant to the chancellor,and paul carlin conducted a second study,which was controlled for a number of factors.the results found a gap between the salaries of male and female faculty members,at.cullen was identified as an outlier,which the study defined as more than one standard deviation below her predicted salary for.her predicted salary was.one standard deviation below this figure is.cullen actually earned.paul carlin testified that he could not rule out gender discrimination as the cause of cullen lower salary.it is notable that approximately of the outliers identified by the study were male.
the university submits that,although the study is a helpful tool,it fails to account accurately for the market at the time of hire and for an individual productivity.the study was not designed to ascertain the appropriate salaries of professors,but was to be used as a first step in the compensation analysis.it contemplated that committees in each department would undertake a further assessment that took into account individual factors.the university also notes that,for purposes of academic research,a figure of less than two standard deviations is not considered statistically significant however,it identified individuals of greater than one standard deviation as outliers in order to ensure a thorough analysis.cullen salary fell between one and two standard deviations.
the soahs ad hoc review committee strongly recommend ed that cullen pay be increased to rectify salary inequity,but concluded that her history of small incremental salary increases was not significantly less than the averages for soahs and respiratory therapy faculty,ex.dean sothmann informed cullen that he would recommend a raise to her predicted salary of,ex.this predicted salary is one standard deviation below the mean figure.dean sothmann also informed the chancellor office that cullen salary ought to be adjusted to the predicted level.cullen salary was then adjusted from to.
district court proceedings 
before the district court,cullen alleged that the university discriminated against her in violation of the equal pay act and on the basis of her sex in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.cullen claimed that the university employed a similarly situated male,quillen,to perform the same job as her own and paid him a higher salary.moreover,she argued that the university actions constituted indirect evidence of an intent to pay her less than male employees because of her gender.the university moved for summary judgment on both claims.the district court granted summary judgment for the university on the equal pay act claim because it determined that cullen failed to establish a prima facie case.see at.the court concluded that quillen had substantially more additional responsibilities than cullen which justifi ed his higher salary.id.
alternatively,the court concluded that,assuming a prima facie case,cullen evidence did not present a material dispute to contradict the university affirmative defense that the pay differential was based on factors other than sex.see id.at.the court noted the significance of disparate educational backgrounds and job responsibilities as reasons for its conclusion that the university had carried its burden of persuasion on the affirmative defense.see id.at.the court also concluded that the university pay equity study was not prima facie evidence of discrimination because it was not designed to prove or calculate discrimination alone but to identify cases that merited further inquiry.see id.at.
with respect to the title vii claim,the court concluded that cullen failed to establish a prima facie case because she did not identify an adverse employment action her salary was increased or present evidence of a similarly situated male that was treated more favorably.see id.at.the court also found it significant that there was no evidence of intent to discriminate.see id.at.
discussiona.equal pay act 
cullen submits that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the university on her equal pay act epa claim we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see boyce moore,cir.
prima facie case 
to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the epa,cullen must show higher wages were paid to a male employee,for equal work requiring substantially similar skill,effort and responsibilities,and the work was performed under similar working conditions.stopka alliance of am.insurers,cir.in determining whether two jobs are equal,the crucial inquiry is whether the jobs to be compared have a common core of tasks,whether a significant portion of the two jobs is identical.fallon illinois,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.once the plaintiff establishes a common core,the court must ask whether any additional tasks make the jobs substantially different.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.significantly,the epa does not require proof of discriminatory intent.see stopka,at.
it is undisputed that in this case the first element is established.in,cullen was paid and quillen,a male,was paid.see,ex.the disparity continued through the academic year when cullen earned and quillen earned.see,ex.nevertheless,cullen must establish that the jobs were equal.although the common core of the positions held by cullen and quillen suggests equality,quillen job entailed significant additional responsibilities,making it substantially different.the epa specifies three separate elements that are to be considered in comparing job duties skill,effort and responsibility.see d.each of these elements must be met individually to establish a prima facie case.see moreover,the jobs must be performed under similar working conditions.see d stopka,at.
first,we consider whether the positions required the same level of skill.skill includes consideration of such factors as experience,training,education,and ability.a.although cullen and quillen have different educational credentials,the comparison at this juncture is between positions,not individuals.see id.possession of a skill not needed to meet the requirements of the job can not be considered in making a determination regarding equality of skill.joseph cook john sobieski,civil rights actions b,at noting that the issue is comparison of jobs,individual qualifications are irrelevant at this point in the analysis although different educational levels required by different positions can be significant,there is no suggestion that physical therapy program directors are required to hold more degrees than respiratory therapy program directors.however,the positions did require different levels of ability,for the physical therapy program director was required to create a new graduate program,which the respiratory therapy program director position did not require.see horner mary,cir finding different skill requirements between positions of elementary school teachers when one teacher was required to develop and implement a physical education curriculum and the other was to teach courses selected by someone else.accordingly,the positions do not require equal levels of skill.
the second inquiry is whether the two positions require equal amounts of effort.quillen was appointed when the physical therapy program was on probation,and he was given the task of saving the program and creating a graduate course of study.see,ex at.cullen nevertheless submits that,although physical therapy has a strong tuition base,she had to exert more effort to secure outside funding to supplement her department resources,an effort,she claims,that quillen does not match.see,at,ex at.although this consideration may decrease somewhat the significance in the disparity between the effort required by the two positions,we think the district court correctly concluded that the effort required to create master and doctoral courses of study in a program on probation to be greater than that required to secure grants for the respiratory therapy department.see,ex at stating that physical therapy requires a graduate program to maintain accreditation,and failure to do so would preclude graduates from sitting for the licensure exam,ex at,ex at indicating that soahs would not be able to operate without a viable physical therapy program a job factors which cause mental fatigue and stress are to be considered in determining the effort required by the job.the jobs do not require equal effort cullen can not establish her prima facie case of equal positions.
third,we must determine whether the two positions impose the same level of responsibility.the respiratory therapy program at the university required quillen to create and launch a graduate program.cullen is not responsible for such a program.see,ex at.cullen argues that the creation of the graduate program was not an additional duty,for she was also required to meet accreditation requirements.however,this argument places too much emphasis on the job description or title of establishing program accreditation,see,at,instead of considering the duties actually performed by each employee.dey colt constr.dev,cir.
quillen supervises more students and faculty members.as of september,quillen was responsible for students to cullen,and quillen supervised six faculty members and two secretaries to cullen three faculty members and one secretary.see,ex at.cullen contends that the record contains no evidence that quillen exercises any supervision over students or that the additional faculty members create a greater burden in terms of responsibility.supervisory responsibilities must be real,significant,regular,and recurring.mack player,employment discrimination law b,at.nevertheless,it is reasonable to conclude that quillen management of a department twice the size of cullen is indicative of greater responsibility.see howard lear.eeds interiors,cir the additional skill,effort,and headache involved in managing three to six times the number of workers in a more complex employment environment rendered the positions substantially different orahood board of tr.of of arkansas,cir affirming a finding of unequal positions because male employee supervised a much larger department with more employees.
the most significant factor in this responsibility comparison is the differential in tuition revenue generated by each program.each school at the university must operate with budgets based on the tuition resources generated within the school.see,ex at.significantly,physical therapy generates nearly of soahs tuition revenue,and the school would not be able to operate without a viable physical therapy program.see,ex at,ex at.in,the physical therapy program produced more than six times the tuition generated by respiratory therapy.see,ex at.in stanley university of southern california,cir,the ninth circuit concluded that the additional pressure to win placed on the usc men basketball coach created a different job under the epa because the men program generated ninety times more revenue than the women program.see id.at.the court found that the relative amount of revenue generated should be considered in determining whether responsibilities and working conditions are substantially equal.id.in this case,the soahs dependence upon the revenue generated by the physical therapy program creates additional pressure and responsibility on the director of the physical therapy program,quillen.consequently,the positions do not have equal levels of responsibility therefore,cullen can not establish a prima facie case 
pay equity study 
cullen contends that the district court erred by failing to consider the pay equity study as evidence to prove her prima facie case under the epa.she argues that,because she has identified a specific male comparator,quillen,this court should adopt the second circuit rationale in marist college,cir,and permit her to rely on statistical evidence to support he
