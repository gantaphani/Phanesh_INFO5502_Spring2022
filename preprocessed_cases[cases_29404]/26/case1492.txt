in this negligence action against the vista unified school district district,plaintiff linda shirk alleges that years ago,as a teenage high school student,she was molested by a teacher then employed by the district,and that the district knew or must have known of the alleged molestation at the time but failed to stop it,causing her psychological injury that was only recently discovered.code civ.the trial court sustained the district demurrer without leave to amend due to shirk failure to file a timely governmental tort claim within six months of the accrual of her cause of action,as measured from the date the alleged molestation ended in.cal.tort claims act,et hereinafter,the tort claims act.
shirk appeals the judgment of dismissal,contending her complaint was timely filed within three years of the accrual of her negligence causes of action,as measured by section,allowing the bringing of an action and the revival of lost causes of action seeking compensation for childhood sexual abuse injuries.in her view,under this statute,she has successfully pleaded delayed accrual of her cause of action and adequate compliance with claims requirements,by alleging that she did not discover the alleged acts were the cause of her adult psychological injuries until she underwent a psychological examination in september of,subd.a.she also relies in part on amendments to the statute allowing persons over age to sue employing entities under certain circumstances,subd.b,and further,on its provisions for the revival of lost claims,subd.c.
in this unique set of factual circumstances,we agree that shirk has brought her pleadings within the scope of section and reverse the judgment of dismissal,directing the trial court to enter a new order overruling the demurrer.
background 
for purposes of analyzing the demurrer,the courts will accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint.john oakland unified school district cal d,fn.shirk,now in her,alleges that between may and november,while ages through,she was continuously sexually molested by a teacher employed by the district,jeffrey jones,on school premises,during school hours and school activities,and elsewhere.another female student was also previously molested by jones.shirk contends that the district negligently supervised jones and due to his readily discoverable failures to follow proper school policy,the district knew or should have known that he was sexually molesting her.
in june,shirk daughter was attending the same school,where jones still taught,and shirk encountered jones at school events.shirk became very upset about what happened to her earlier in her life and reported the molestations to law enforcement officials.jones met with her while she was wearing a law enforcement wire and he admitted these molestations occurred 
on september,shirk was examined by a psychologist who rendered the opinion that she had incurred psychological injuries due to this sexual molestation and it is the cause of her adult psychological injuries.shirk filed this complaint on september,against jones and the district.she alleged that she has adequately complied with governmental claims statutes.as against the district,she pled general negligence and negligent supervision of jones.
the district brought a general demurrer to the complaint,contending it should not properly be subjected to vicarious liability for sexual battery and the claims were and not subject to extension under section.lack of sufficient compliance with governmental tort claims requirements is also alleged.
shirk opposed the demurrer and submitted declarations by an attorney and a psychologist,intended to comply with the certification requirements of section.these certification requirements are not challenged here.
the trial court issued a telephonic ruling,which was confirmed after oral argument.the district demurrers were sustained without leave to amend and the complaint was dismissed.the order provides in pertinent part that plaintiff was required to submit a claim at some point in,and had not complied with the claims presentation procedure section does not revive this action either with respect to the statute of limitations or the failure to present a timely claim.the court explained its reasoning as follows section,subdivision c makes no reference to claims requirements,but only statutes of limitations,and there are different policy reasons for the two procedural devices.therefore,the court declined to interpret section as also applying to claims presentation.the court stated 
finally,the legislature was certainly aware of the government claims presentation procedure when it enacted and amended section.thus,this court must assume that the legislature purposefully decided not to revive untimely claims presumably it was unwilling to abrogate the special protections afford public entities,and the court is not at liberty to expand section.
the district obtained a judgment of dismissal pursuant to the demurrer ruling and shirk appeals 
discussion 
iintroduction and issues presented 
for purposes of analyzing the ruling on demurrer,we take as true the allegations in the complaint.blank kirwan cal d.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole,its parts in their context,to determine whether sufficient facts are stated to constitute a cause of action.ibid.for purposes of reviewing the trial court construction of a statute,we resolve pure questions of law on a de novo basis.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
the issue of whether a plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to demonstrate or excuse compliance with governmental tort claims presentation requirements may appropriately be addressed in a general demurrer to a complaint.see state superior court bodde cal th,d,bodde.even where a plaintiff should have made such a claim,but did not,and the trial court erred in not requiring one,the trial court does not lack jurisdiction to proceed with that plaintiff action against the governmental entity.id.at,fn,d.
before we address shirk substantive arguments on appeal that her government claim and complaint were timely filed,we first take note that on appeal,the district appropriately concedes that the trial court ruling was unduly restrictive insofar as it found the only timely claim that could have been filed would have been in,immediately after the molestation incidents ended.we agree with the district that the trial court erroneously focused on shirk adolescent frame of mind during the period,without adequately accounting for the express delayed accrual provisions of section.christopher,supra,th,d was relied on by the trial court here to say that a cause of action normally accrues for purposes of claim presentment when the molestation actually occurs,since a victim who is an older child should immediately become aware of harm caused by sexual molestation.see fn,ante.however,by focusing excessively upon shirk adolescent state of mind in,the trial court essentially disregarded all the relevant accrual provisions of section,which was error,as now properly conceded by the district.
nevertheless,the district inconsistently continues to argue that any reliance by shirk upon an equitable delayed discovery doctrine would be inappropriate,that since she was approaching adulthood when she was molested,she therefore must have known it was wrong and should not obtain any excuse for delay see curtis county of los angeles th,d curtis.this is simply irrelevant for purposes of the required statutory construction of section,because shirk does not actually appear to argue any such theory of equitable or nonstatutory delayed discovery.
rather,under the statutory scheme of section,the appropriate focus on the facts as pled in the complaint should be whether shirk causes of action accrued,as alleged,in september,when she received a diagnostic evaluation that her adult psychological injuries were caused by the earlier molestation incidents.we emphasize that shirk is apparently relying upon a purely statutory claim of delayed accrual of her cause of action under the terms of section,and we will review the allegations of the complaint,in light of the statutory terms,accordingly.the issue is whether,as a matter of law,she may claim the protection of section for statutory delayed accrual of her cause of action,and accompanying substantial compliance with government tort claims requirements.
before addressing the terms of the statute,we next seek to clarify that the district is not justified in arguing on demurrer that the only proper accrual date that can be gleaned from the face of the pleading is june,when shirk became upset and confronted the perpetrator jones.the district claims that shirk admitted june emotional upset and acts of going to law enforcement authorities could,in the alternative,be considered to be her first knowledge of her claim.however,these allegations of the events of june are not pled in the complaint as constituting the type of discovery of causation of adult psychological injuries,as expressly referred to in section,subdivision a,nor can we say as a matter of law that they amount to the same thing.we express no opinion on whether the district may in further proceedings seek to establish as a matter of law that shirk cause of action accrued in june,on the theory that those events were the functional equivalent of the discovery of causation event specifically referred to in the statute.at this point,on demurrer,the only proper inquiry was whether shirk could state a cause of action with adequate accrual allegations within the terms of section.
as noted by the court in curtis,supra,th,d,section represents very generous limitations periods for adults who belatedly realize that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse that occurred many years ago in childhood.curtis,supra,at,d.in this section,the legislature explicitly recognized that the comprehension of harm inflicted through childhood sexual abuse can be delayed even to adulthood.ibid.
we are required to determine the relationship of this recently amended limitations statute,with its liberal pleading rules,to the standard governmental tort claims requirements that are much more restrictive in terms of timing,in light of the vicarious liability theory that is pled.unfortunately,as recognized in the ceb treatise on government tort liability,the authors of the tort claims act in did not take the late discovery problem into account,nor provide any procedures for dealing with it,other than providing for late claims relief within a relatively short time frame unavailable here.ceb treatise,supra.
to determine whether this complaint states a cause of action for the plaintiff injuries attributable to a perpetrator childhood sexual abuse,against a public entity employer of the perpetrator,under a vicarious liability theory,in light of the allegation that a governmental claim was not brought until september,we will consider not only the statutory language but also the legislative history of section,with attention to the addition in of its vicarious liability language against an entity,subd.a.
section sets forth special rules for establishing the limitations periods for an action to recover damages for injury suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse.as originally enacted in,it targeted bad acts only by family and household members.in amendments,actions against any such perpetrator were authorized,scoutmasters see snyder boy scouts of america,d.tietge western province of the servites,th,d tietge.section initially provides in subdivision a that the time for commencement of the action shall be within eight years of the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority or within three years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse,whichever period expires later as explained by the court in debbie reynolds rehearsal studios superior court th,d debbie reynolds,the purpose of this section is to allow victims of childhood sexual abuse a longer time period in which to become aware of their psychological injuries and remain eligible to bring suit against their abusers.id.at,d.as further explained in tietge,supra,th at pages,d to,t he limitations period begins to run only after the victim,who is then an adult,appreciates the wrongfulness of the abuser conduct.
in,the legislature expanded the scope of the limitations periods provided by section to cover vicarious liability of an entity,to authorize,as relevant here a an action for liability against any person or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff,where a wrongful or negligent act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse which resulted in the injury to the plaintiff,subd.a italics added.
these limitations provisions must be read in light of the language of section,subdivision b,which generally prohibits the commencement of such an action on or after the plaintiff birthday added in,stats,ch.however,there is now an exception to this general rule,set forth in section,subdivision b added in and effective,stats,ch,this subdivision does not apply if the person or entity knew or had reason to know,or was otherwise on notice,of any unlawful sexual conduct by an employee,volunteer,representative,or agent,and failed to take reasonable steps,and to implement reasonable safeguards,to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct in the future by that person,including,but not limited to,preventing or avoiding placement of that person in a function or environment in which contact with children is an inherent part of that function or environment.for purposes of this subdivision,providing or requiring counseling is not sufficient,in and of itself,to constitute a reasonable step or reasonable safeguard.italics added.hence,plaintiffs over years of age such as shirk may now bring these vicarious liability actions under the specified circumstances 
the statute,as amended in,next requires us to turn to the provisions of section,subdivision c as follows notwithstanding any other provision of law,any claim for damages described in paragraph or of subdivision a that is permitted to be filed pursuant to paragraph of subdivision b that would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired,is revived,and,in that case,a cause of action may be commenced within one year of january.nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of january.italics added.
as explained in witkin,california procedure ed.actions,these amendments to section,subdivision a and do not create a new theory of liability,subd.t,added in and relettered in.witkin,cal.procedure supp.actions.however,they do make vicarious liability actions possible against a defendant other than the actual perpetrator of the abuse,based on a negligent act that was the legal cause of the abuse,and there must be a sufficient connection between the entity and the occurrence of the abuse such that it could have been prevented,subd.a com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july.
case law has interpreted the main delayed discovery provisions of the statute as intended to relate to injuries occurring after the age of majority.lent doe th,d.in that case,a plaintiff adequately pleaded facts supporting delayed discovery where he alleged he suffered psychological injury and illness as an adult resulting from defendant his uncle earlier sexual misconduct,but he did not discover the connection between that illness and the defendant acts of misconduct until adulthood,when he began counseling within three years before filing the action also,the delay in discovering the connection was reasonable.id.at,d.there is no requirement in section that,as a prerequisite to making a delayed discovery claim,a plaintiff have repressed the memories of the abuse,in order to plead such delayed discovery.witkin,cal.procedure supp.actions.rather,the legislature appears to have accepted the concept that a plaintiff may not be able to make the connection between early mistreatment and adult psychological problems until reaching adulthood and obtaining insights gained through,for example,counseling.the legislature intended that qualifying plaintiffs should be able to take appropriate legal action at that time,according to the terms of the statute.
the initial portion of section,subdivision a thus defines the accrual date of such an action as the date the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the causation of the adult psychological injury from the earlier sexual abuse.by adding subdivision a,the legislature obviously intended to allow plaintiffs to bring actions against certain entities who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff,if the entity negligent act was a legal cause of the injurious sexual abuse.the legislative history discloses that this vicarious liability provision was added in in response to certain cases that interpreted the original version of section as authorizing an action against and thus applying only to the individual perpetrator of the abuse.debbie reynolds,supra,th,d private dance studio tietge,supra,th,d religious organization and school.those cases held that section originally only enlarged the statute of limitations as to the actual perpetrators of the abuse,and not with regard to any negligence of the employers of such abusers,due to the principle that at that time section applies only to intentional acts of sexual abuse,and does not apply to actions seeking damages for negligent acts.tietge,supra,at,d.
the legislative history of the amendments discloses that the proponents of the amendment to allow vicarious liability were suggesting that churches and private schools,as well as some public schools,might harbor individual perpetrators of abuse,and might be negligent if they did not discover and prohibit such behavior.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.the proponents wanted the responsible parties,not the government program,to pay for treatment of injured persons.id.at.the opponents of the amendment were responding,based on the analysis in debbie reynolds,supra,th,d,that private businesses and the economy would suffer if innocent employers were held liable for the bad acts of individual perpetrators on a vicarious liability basis,and any case,the repressed memory theory was not universally accepted.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july.
eventually,in,the legislature passed the amendment to allow vicarious liability of such entities where there was a sufficient connection between the employment and the occurrence of the molestation,but it did not expressly clarify how the amendment was to interact with existing government tort claims requirements applicable to public entities who might be such employers.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july.
also,the legislative history of the amendments adding subd.c and,in subd.b,lifting the bar on an plaintiff suing if vicarious liability allegations can be made against an entity that employed the molester which had reason to know of such proclivities discloses that the legislature was made aware through the comment and amendment process that entities that bore a duty of care to third parties for the conduct of employees engaging in acts related to employment might include a school district,church,or other organization engaging in the care and custody of a child,such that a duty of care is owed to the child to reasonably ensure its safety.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
government tort claims presentation requirements and statutes of limitations 
we accordingly seek to determine the interplay of the government tort claims requirements and the language of section.when the legislature amended section in,to allow vicarious liability allegations against employing entities,did it show any intent about the treatment of government entities,ordinarily entitled to require governmental claims against them,for purposes of applying delayed discovery principles further,does the amendment to section,subdivision c,allowing a window reviving old actions,have any impact upon the tort claims act applying to public entities,such as a school district,with regard to claims requirements 
under government code section,in order to compute the time limits for bringing a governmental tort claim pursuant to,the date of the accrual of a cause of action to which a claim relates is the date upon which the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of limitations which would be applicable thereto if there were no requirement that a claim be presented to and be acted upon by the public entity before an action could be commenced thereon.as explained in the ceb treatise,this language borrows for tort claims purposes the law that has been developed in civil actions for accrual of a claim.ceb treatise,supra.the date of accrual of a cause of action marks the starting point for calculating the claims presentation period.ibid.ordinarily,this is simply the date of injury.but some cases,particularly those involving continuing injuries or late discovery,present a more complex picture.if in doubt,the practitioner should consult the considerable body of law that defines the accrual date for a like action against a private party,citing,mosesian county of fresno d.italics added.
these treatise writers also observe that the claims presentation time limits contain no authorization for tolling or extending presentation periods due to a claimant minority or disability,other than the usual late claim procedures.ceb treatise,supra.government code section ordinarily requires that personal injury claims against an entity be filed not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.alternatively,a late claim may be presented within a reasonable time after accrual,not to exceed one year.if the application is denied,a plaintiff may petition the court for an order relieving her from the claims presentation requirement.no action for money damages may be brought against a public entity until a written claim has been presented to the entity and acted upon,or relief is granted from the claims requirements,but see bodde,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
as noted by the trial court,the purposes of the claim filing requirement are to give notice to the public entity so it will have a timely opportunity to investigate the claim and determine the facts and to give the public entity an opportunity to settle meritorious claims thereby avoiding unnecessary lawsuits.san diego unified port dist.superior court d.by requiring advance knowledge of potential claims,the claims statute provides an opportunity to the public entity to,quickly rectify a dangerous condition and further provides an opportunity for the entity to take the potential claim into account in its fiscal planning.ibid.the trial court observed that although claims requirements function in part like statutes of limitation,t he statutory requirements for an early presentation of a claim are thus not mere statutes of limitation quoting the ceb treatise,supra.the trial court thus distinguished between claims presentation procedures and statutes of limitations,and found section did not extend the time for claims presentations.
however,the trial court did not take note that the same treatise writers on which it relied go on to observe in the same section the requirements do,however,function in part like statutes of limitation.citations.ceb treatise.
again as observed by the treatise writers,i n the public entity context,the late discovery rule usually applies in medical malpractice cases citation,earth movement cases citations,and child molestation cases when the parent had no reason to suspect wrongdoing citations.the late discovery rule may also apply in fraud cases.ceb treatise,supra,see jefferson county of kern th,d medical malpractice.
from all these authorities and the legislative history,we conclude that even though the legislature did not expressly mention governmental tort claims requirements when enacting and amending section,it was well aware throughout the comment and amendment procedure that expanding the app
