bond purchasers brought suit alleging violations of federal securities laws in the may offering of bonds of bradford college in massachusetts.in january,the college defaulted on its bond obligations.this suit was brought ten months later.the district court dismissed the amended complaint for failure to meet the pleading standards in the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.mckeown advest,mckeown i,wl.the district court also denied the plaintiffs motion to vacate dismissal and plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the complaint to address pleading deficiencies identified by the court.mckeown advest,mckeown ii,wl.
the plaintiffs purchasers and an insurer of bradford bonds sold in may,claim they were misled by the official statement accompanying the offering,which allegedly concealed bradford dire financial straits and inability to pay the bond debt.the allegations are against three sets of defendants joseph short and donald kiszka,the former president and vice president of administration and finance of the college,respectively the officers sixteen members of the college board of trustees the trustees together with the officers,collectively the bradford defendants and advest,the underwriter investment banking firm.
this is our first occasion to apply the supreme court recent guidance regarding the standards for pleadings under the pslra in tellabs,makor issues rights,d.under tellabs,certain principles are clear.tellabs has altered this circuit prior standard,as set forth in in re credit suisse first boston,cir,for determining the sufficiency of pleadings of scienter in securities fraud cases under rule b.tellabs affirms our case law that plaintiffs inferences of scienter should be weighed against competing inferences of behavior.see,greebel ftp software,cir.tellabs also affirms our rule that the complaint is considered as a whole rather than piecemeal.see,in re cabletron,cir.finally,we hold that under the reasoning of tellabs,the pslra does not alter the liberal amendment policy of federal rule of civil procedure.and we stress again our disinclination to require allowance of amendment of complaints when there has been undue delay.
we affirm the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion to allow a belated second motion to amend the complaint.
confining our analysis of the motion to dismiss to the amended complaint,we affirm dismissal.although one of the allegations presents an arguable claim of misrepresentation as to the college budget for financial aid spending in the academic year,the pleadings are insufficient to establish the requisite scienter.
in reciting the facts as alleged,we draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.bradford was established as a coeducational academy in.after going through incarnations as a female academy and junior college,bradford became a coeducational college in.by the,bradford became mired in persistent cash flow problems.in spite of increasing enrollment and a growing operational budget,bradford had operating deficits every year from to.boosting enrollment became a critical goal for the college because tuition,room,board,and other student fees constituted the largest source by far of its operating revenues.bradford administration invested in educational and physical improvements designed to attract more students,raise revenues,and attain financial stability.bradford financed these improvements in part with a million loan from the united states department of education and a million bond offering in.
there were indications in that bradford fortunes might be on the upswing.in spite of admitting fewer students than in years past,the matriculation rate rose from in to in,and the number of enrolled students rose sharply in the fall of.meanwhile,the combined value of bradford endowment and investment portfolio increased between june and june.
on february,the trustees voted to approve issuing another series of bonds both to help settle its debt and to finance a project designed to increase bradford residential capacity and,in turn,accommodate even higher levels of enrollment.the trustees approved the sale of million worth of bonds,which the college underwriter advest determined to be the college maximum bonding capacity.the bonds would be secured solely by a lien on tuition receipts.by entering into the bond transaction,bradford committed to paying over million a year in debt service through.
the massachusetts industrial finance agency mifa issued the bonds rather than the college.the offering was on may,the offering closed when the transaction documents were executed twelve days later.an official statement,prepared by advest,short,and kiszka,and dated may,accompanied the offering.the official statement outlined the mechanics of the transaction and contained various qualifications and disclaimers.for instance,under the heading bondowners risks,the statement provided that the college would be the sole source of repayment for the bonds,and disclaimed any assurance that revenues will be realized by bradford in the amount necessary to make payments sufficient to pay the debt service on the bonds.the statement noted specific risks to bondholders,including that the college failure to meet future enrollment targets could jeopardize its ability to support the debt.the statement also noted as risk factors the college ability to control expenses,competition,costs,and the amount of financial aid awarded to students.both the cover sheet and the main text of the statement disclosed that standard poor had assigned a bbb rating to the the highest level of risk short of junk bond status.
the official statement also incorporated a series of appendices,the first of which was a document,signed by short and kiszka,containing information about bradford operations.the document specified that the college would use a portion of the proceeds from the bonds to refund the bonds.most of the remainder of the proceeds would be used to pay for renovations to existing residence halls and construction of new residence facilities.the renovations and construction were projected to require two years and cost almost million.
in addition to providing details about the proposed project,this appendix also presented selected statistics illustrating recent trends in enrollment,financial aid,the growth of bradford endowment and investments,and.a section entitled accounting matters set out the college analysis of some of those numbers as well as targets for future enrollment and financial aid levels.significantly,the official statement expressly advised that the college was not certifying the accuracy of any projections and opinions in the statement.
the next appendix contained bradford audited financial statements for fiscal years to.the remaining appendices comprised various transaction documents including opinion letters and a continuing disclosure agreement.the official statement including its appendices is discussed in further detail below.
bradford college failed to reach its benchmarks for increased student enrollment and reduced financial aid awards for the school year,despite the promising numbers from.a revenue shortfall forced the college to rely on donations and over million from the endowment.in spite of the deficit,the college granted financial aid to of students in.because bradford itself funded about half of all financial aid,such high aid levels represented a significant drain on the college cash flow.
bradford college never recovered.president short resigned in the summer of,to be followed by kiszka a year later.in november,the college announced that it would cease operations after the school year.the bonds were declared in default in january.
the plaintiffs brought suit in november,alleging federal securities law violations and various claims.the plaintiffs initially voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice under tolling agreements.in the interim,the college went through bankruptcy proceedings.
the plaintiffs then filed the current action in july and amended their complaint in january.the motion to dismiss was addressed to this amended complaint.
the first count of the amended complaint alleges violations of section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and the concomitant rule,for material omissions and misrepresentations in the official statement.four of the allegations in the amended complaint are pressed on appeal that the official statement was deceptive by avoiding reference to bradford high rate of student attrition by misrepresenting projected enrollment levels by falsely stating that the college intended to contribute million of its own funds toward completion of the construction and renovation project and by including false statements regarding projected financial aid levels for the and academic years 
the sequence of proceedings proves important to the legal argument about further amendment of the complaint.advest filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in february the bradford defendants followed suit in march.the plaintiffs filed their opposition on may,and the district court heard oral argument on october.almost a year after the hearing,on september,the district court granted the motions to dismiss the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.mckeown i,wl,at.
the plaintiffs did not immediately appeal,instead filing simultaneous motions with the district court asking it to vacate dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure e and to grant plaintiffs leave to further amend the complaint under rule a.a proposed second amended complaint was attached to the rule a motion.the plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing without granting leave to amend the complaint to cure pleading deficiencies pointed out by the district court.in addition,they claimed that the dismissal should be vacated on the basis of new evidence uncovered during a document review conducted by plaintiffs counsel in june.
the district court denied the motions on december.mckeown ii,wl,at.the court disagreed that evidence discovered in june could qualify as new evidence warranting vacation of the judgment id.the court pointed out that the plaintiffs made no effort to amend their complaint after uncovering the new evidence and during the long pendency of the motions to dismiss.id.at.lastly,the district court held that entry of judgment precluded jurisdiction to consider the proposed second amended complaint.id.at.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by failing to apply the liberal amendment policy of federal rule of civil procedure a.
the plaintiffs tie the rule e issue to the denial of the motion to amend.review of the denial of the rule e motion is for manifest abuse of discretion.council of ins.agents brokers,cir quoting binkley tank,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also sonolux records,cir.rule e,while it authorizes motions to alter a judgment,does not state what grounds would justify such an alteration.see.e wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure ed.district courts enjoy considerable discretion in deciding rule e motions,subject to circumstances developed in the case law,at.correction of a clearly established manifest error of law is among the grounds for a valid rule e motion.fdic world,cir.a rule e motion should not,however,raise arguments which could,and should,have been made before judgment issued.id.quoting motor bank of new england,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the manifest error that the plaintiffs allege consists of the district court dismissal of the amended complaint without leave to amend.we turn to the motion to amend.
rule a provides that a party may amend its pleading with the court leave,and that t he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.a.the rule reflects a liberal amendment policy,hyatt hotels of,cir,but even so,the district court enjoys significant latitude in deciding whether to grant leave to amend.we defer to the district court decision if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.larocca borden,cir quoting grant news group boston,cir internal quotation marks omitted.grounds for denial include undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of amendment.foman davis,d.
plaintiffs argue that these liberal standards remain unaffected by the pslra.defendant advest posits that allowing belated amendments would be particularly inappropriate in cases governed by the pslra,citing in re squibb securities litigation,and in re champion enterprises.securities litigation,d.the circuit courts have expressed different views,and we have not addressed the issue before.compare miller champion,cir t he purpose of the pslra would be frustrated if district courts were required to allow repeated amendments to complaints filed under the pslra,with belizan hershon,holding pslra does not alter operation of rule a,and eminence capital,llc aspeon,cir per curiam same.
we hold that the pslra does not itself modify the liberal amendment policy of rule a we agree with the circuit that had the congress wished to make dismissal with prejudice the norm,and to that extent supercede the ordinary application of rule a,we would expect the text of the pslra so to provide.belizan,at.the text of the act neither purports to affect rule a,nor does it require that all dismissals be with prejudice.see,b a requiring dismissal for failure to meet the act pleading requirements,but not specifying dismissal with prejudice.in the absence of a legislative directive to the contrary,rule applies as in the normal course.that is one of the lessons of tellabs.tellabs.at applying rule b standard that all factual allegations in a complaint must be accepted as true in the securities fraud context as with any motion to dismiss aldridge cross,cir applying usual rule b standard in pslra context.
interpreting the pslra as constricting the operation of rule a would be contrary to the purposes of the act.the pslra serves twin goals to curb frivolous,litigation,while preserving investors ability to recover on meritorious claims.tellabs.at.the heightened pleading standard furthers the goal of deterring frivolous litigation by erecting a significant hurdle for a plaintiff to clear before her complaint can survive a motion to dismiss.a blanket rule that the pslra modifies rule a would tip the scales too far,compromising plaintiffs ability to have meritorious claims presented in court.eminence capital,at holding that liberal amendment policy of rule a should be adhered to precisely because the pslra requires an unprecedented degree of specificity and detail.to read the pslra to constrict rule a would disturb the legislative balance struck by the act.the number and nature of prior amendments to a complaint is relevant as to any motion for leave to amend.to the extent that miller may embody a rule that the pslra modifies the operation of rule a,however,we disagree.
the parties dispute whether the more restrictive standard for motions to amend under james watt,cir breyer,applies,or the usual rule a standard.here,the formal motion was not made until after dismissal.but the plaintiffs opposition to the motions to dismiss did at least conditionally request an opportunity to amend i n the event that the c ourt does agree that the plaintiffs have stumbled over some of the pleading intricacies in a federal securities action.
that does not win the day for the plaintiffs.each case will turn on its own circumstances.the district court had abundant reason to deny the motion,however the request to amend is characterized.this suit was originally filed six years before the court dismissal order and dismissed by the plaintiffs without prejudice.the complaint was in july and amended in january.the defendants moved to dismiss in early,identifying deficiencies in the amended complaint.the plaintiffs could have moved to amend then,but did not.nor did they move to amend in june,after plaintiffs counsel claimed they had uncovered new evidence in a document review related to the college bankruptcy proceedings to continue the litany,the plaintiffs did not move to amend at oral argument on october,or before the court ruling on september.plaintiffs took no action to add new allegations even though they knew what they would add if they amended.
the plaintiffs argue that in the end,they were entitled to wait and see if their amended complaint was rejected by the district court before being put to the costs of filing a second amended complaint.they claim this would promote efficiency in the judicial system.plaintiffs have it exactly methodology would lead to delays,inefficiencies,and wasted work.the plaintiffs do not get leisurely repeated bites at the apple,forcing a district judge to decide whether each successive complaint was adequate under the pslra.plaintiffs may not,having the needed information,deliberately wait in the wings for a year and a half with another amendment to a complaint should the court hold the first amended complaint was insufficient.such an approach would impose unnecessary costs and inefficiencies on both the courts and party opponents.this court expressly disapproved a similar tactic in james,and we do so again.see id.at such a practice would dramatically undermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of judicial decisions,and should not be sanctioned in the absence of compelling circumstances.citing wright miller,federal practice and procedure.
it is law that r egardless of the context,the longer a plaintiff delays,the more likely a motion to amend will be denied,as protracted delay,with its attendant burdens on the opponent and the court,is itself a sufficient reason for the court to withhold permission to amend.steir girl scouts of the usa,cir citing hilton int l of,cir see also palmer champion mortgage,cir approving rejection of request for leave to amend made fifteen months after commencement of action on the basis of previously available information.there was no error.
pslra pleading requirements 
we evaluate de novo whether the first amended complaint meets the pleading requirements imposed by the pslra.aldridge,at.we may affirm on any independently sufficient ground.ezra charitable trust tyco int l,cir quoting,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
under the pslra,as with any motion to dismiss under rule b,we accept factual allegations in the complaint as true and view all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.aldridge,at greebel,at see also tellabs.at.the supreme court has recently altered the rule b standard in a manner which gives it more heft.in order to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must allege a plausible entitlement to relief.bell atl.twombly,d margo caribe,cir.the court formulation revised language from conley gibson,d,that a complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to relief.id.at.of course,plaintiffs alleging securities fraud must also meet the rule b standard for pleading fraud with particularity 
for a complaint to state a claim for securities fraud under section b and rule,it must plead six elements a material misrepresentation or omission scienter,or a wrongful state of mind a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.dura,broudo,d.
the pslra requires plaintiffs complaint to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.further,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.id.
the pslra also separately imposes a rigorous pleading standard on allegations of scienter.scienter is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.
in this circuit,a plaintiff may satisfy the scienter requirement with a showing of either conscious intent to defraud or a high degree of recklessness.aldridge,at citing greebel,at.a complaint alleging securities fraud shall,with respect to each alleged act or omission state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.while under rule b all inferences must be drawn in plaintiffs favor,inferences of scienter do not survive if they are merely reasonable,as is true when pleadings for other causes of action are tested by motion to dismiss under rule b.greebel,at.
further,tellabs confirms this court existing rule from cabletron,at,that scienter should be evaluated with reference to the complaint as a whole rather than to piecemeal allegations.tellabs.at the inquiry is whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter.tellabs also affirms our view,see,ezra charitable trust,at,that competing inferences should be weighed against plaintiffs preferred interpretation of the facts.tellabs.at holding that a court must engage in a comparative evaluation it must consider,not only inferences urged by the plaintiff but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged.while it may be unusual for courts to weigh competing inferences from facts,congress mandated this review in the pslra.
however,tellabs has overruled one aspect of the rule this court stated in credit suisse.credit suisse held that where there were equally strong inferences for and against scienter,this resulted in a win for the defendant.at scienter allegations do not pass the strong inference test when,viewed in light of the complaint as a whole,there are legitimate explanations for the behavior that are equally convincing.this is no longer the law.
tellabs held that a strong inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.at emphasis added.in other words,where there are equally strong inferences for and against scienter,tellabs now awards the draw to the plaintiff.at a complaint will survive if the inference of scienter is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.
application to the factual allegations 
we apply these principles to the amended complaint allegations about four categories of misleading statements and omissions in the official statement.
the amended complaint alleges that the official statement was issued within the context of a serious financial crisis at bradford,and the defendants had motivation to conceal the crisis so that they could continue to finance their operations.for instance,the amended complaint alleges defendants were well aware of the college financial instability.the amended complaint describes a meeting of the board of trustees on february,a year before the board approved the bond offering.at that meeting,the chair of the board stated that the cash flow model indicates that the college may be able to survive for five more years.to stem cash bleeding,however,which would occur in that period would be devastating to the faculty and staff in terms of no salary increases and other cost cutting measures.kiszka,the college chief financial officer,apparently rejoined that this was too optimistic t here is a possibility of the college surviving five years assuming more layoffs and no salary increases,but kiszka felt that it would be more like two or three years.looking at the bigger picture,layoffs and cutbacks would be very disruptive and send a bad message.the amended complaint alleged that the college took no steps to lay off personnel or freeze salaries,which were necessary t o stem cash bleeding,because that would be disruptive and send a bad message.the amended complaint alleges that this reluctance to send a bad message extended to the representations in the official statement.
the amended complaint alleges that one trustee resigned when the board of trustees initially voted in to approve construction of new dormitories because he concluded that student enrollment could not support the expansion.
despite having implemented no widespread measures and after a decade of budget deficits,the bradford defendants approved the issuance of the bonds.this in turn obligated the college to incur an additional cash flow drain of over million annually through the year.at the time,the college annual operating budget,excluding financial aid,was million.the amended complaint alleges that the ability to meet this additional obligation was dependent primarily upon two factors the college level of student enrollment,and the degree to which the college discounted its tuition revenues by funding financial aid awards to students.
the plaintiffs lead theory of misrepresentation was that the college ability to pay the bonds depended upon the school meeting its increased enrollment targets,which would substantially increase the size of the student body.the official statement,they allege,had several flaws it was too optimistic when it said the college believed it could meet its goals.it failed to disclose available information suggesting that the college was unlikely to meet its goals.and it fudged on the level of the college equity contribution to the project.
the plaintiffs secondary theory was that even if the college could increase its enrollment,this would not improve the college financial condition if it gave high financial aid to reach this result.the plaintiffs concede the official statement informed investors of this connection between enrollment and high financial aid.the statement contained the college projections that it would reduce financial aid,and said that its financial plan called for reducing aid in the upcoming academic year to of student income.the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in rejecting as immaterial the difference between the projections in the official statement,what was in the school budget,and what actually happened.
we start with the allegations relevant to increased enrollment targets.
attrition rate 
the amended complaint alleges that the official statement misled investors by failing to refer to bradford severe,problem with student attrition.the short answer is that the statement warned that the college ability to pay debt service was highly dependent upon tuition and fee revenues from students,and that a failure to attract and retain students in sufficient numbers could adversely affect the ability of the college to make required payments on the series bonds.the official statement also presented enough information to notify investors that student attrition factored into the risk associated with the bonds.
tables in the statement containing enrollment and admissions statistics covering academic years to revealed that the college enrolled new students each fall in numbers far exceeding of total enrollment while some portion of the additional number of incoming students might be attributable to fluctuations in the number of transfer students and others not enrolled in a traditional program at the college,these tables gave notice that some portion of the discrepancy would be due to attrition.
the attrition rate at bradford had,according to the amended complaint,been an extraordinary since.the amended complaint alleges that omitting that figure from the official statement concealed the college inability to repay its bond debt.the defense argues those figures may be derived from the information provided.the plaintiffs argue that it is impossible to calculate from the tables the alleged attrition rate.this may be true,but it is insufficient to make the other statements misleading.the amended complaint does not explain why omitting information about the precise attrition rate at bradford would mislead investors when more pertinent measures of the college financial health are presented forthrightly in the statement 
the statement alerts investors that repayment of the bond debt depended entirely on bradford revenues,and that like most colleges,bradford was highly dependent upon tuition and fee revenues from students.revenue is,at any given time,a function of total enrollment levels,not of attrition.the statement provided information about past and current enrollment levels,and the amended complaint never disputes the accuracy of those numbers furthermore,the statement contained information on admissions trends that would allow a potential investor to evaluate whether the college enrollment level was sustainable.
the college did not have a duty to disclose in the statement every possible material fact about its operations and finances,so long as the disclosures that were made satisfied the statute.gross summa four,cir a corporation does not commit securities fraud merely by failing to disclose all nonpublic material information in its possession.citing roeder alpha,cir.the official statement needed only disclose enough accurate information and not omit pertinent information to allow investors to make an informed decision about whether to invest.it did so.
enrollment projections 
again,on the theory that accurate enrollment projections were key the plaintiffs find fault with this passage from the official statement 
as of april,applications received by the college to date total,an increase of more than from april.the total of exceeds total applications received for the fall.the majority of increases have been the traditional freshman application pool.
based on this increase in applications,historic rates for conversion of applications into enrollments,the number of applications from freshmen and deposits received to date,the college believes that it can reach its goal of enrolling new students for the fall of 
the plaintiffs do not challenge the facial accuracy of the college contemporaneous figures,but allege that the use of the number of applications for the fall of was misleading for several reasons.
the plaintiffs argue that because bradford had begun accepting standardized applications submitted over the internet,this artificially inflated the applications numbers.the goal of new students in fall was allegedly unrealistic because ultimately,the acceptance rate dropped and bradford had fewer actual acceptances for fall than the previous year.finally,the plaintiffs allege that by the date of the official statement,the defendants knew that the number of students who had placed deposits for fall had declined by almost.
these allegations fall short of establishing that the enrollment projections were materially misleading at the time of the statement.a plaintiff may not plead fraud by hindsight,a complaint may not simply contrast a defendant past optimism with less favorable actual results in support of a claim of securities fraud.shaw digital equip,cir.there is nothing in the amended complaint to establish that the defendants were aware of facts,at the time they made their predictions,that would have made those predictions unreasonable,if they were unreasonable.
even now there is no basis to conclude,from the plaintiffs premises,that the predictions were unreasonable.it has not been demonstrated that accepting applications by internet for the fall of would inflate the college application numbers or somehow lead to lower matriculation rates,or that the defendants had any reason to think this.similarly,while the amended complaint,without giving specific numbers,quotes the actual acceptance rate for fall and claims that bradford had fewer actual acceptances in fall than it had for fall,it does not allege in any detail how the defendants could have forecast that outcome in may.
the allegation regarding the drop in actual deposits,as opposed to projected deposits,comes closer,but it does not allege enough detail to satisfy the pleading standards of the pslra.the amended complaint alleges there was a drop in actual deposits as of may,but does not state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.the plaintiffs have not included details about how they were able to identify the figure,much less whether this information was known to the defendants at the relevant time.standing alone,this is insufficient for an allegation of securities fraud.it is true,as the plaintiffs argue,that the pslra does not require plaintiffs to plead evidence.see cabletron,at citing cooperman individual,cir shaw,at.but more meat was needed on these bones.
equity contribution 
the amended complaint alleges that the official statement also skewed the school future financial health by misrepresenting bradford intentions regarding a planned equity contribution to the construction and renovation project.the statement,under the heading of estimated sources and uses of funds,said that a million contribution of the college own funds would be used for the construction and renovation project.
the amended complaint alleges that at a february,meeting of two committees of the board of trustees,those committees determined that the bond issue would not cover the entire cost of the project and resolved to recommend to the full board that 
t he college will have to review the project and attempt to reduce the final two phases to correspond with the bond financing or the college will have to include an equity contribution to fund a portion of the construction.it was agreed that the bond financing would proceed as recommended with advest and that the college would make every effort to reduce its construction costs or make an equity contribution at the end in the final phase of the project.
emphases added in amended complaint.the plaintiffs interpret this as revealing the bradford defendants intention not to contribute any funds to the project,but rather to cut corners on the project in an effort to bring project costs down to the level of the bond financing.the official statement was allegedly misleading because it failed to disclose the contingent and delayed nature of the college putative equity contribution.
even accepting the allegations as true,and adopting the plaintiffs preferred inference that the committees recommendation was implemented by the full board prior to the bond offering,the allegations simply do not establish any misrepresentation.the official statement does not speak in any way to the timing of bradford expected contribution.by like token,the committees statement from the february,meeting does not at all foreclose the college from making an equity contribution in fact,it clearly states an intention that the college would contribute should the cost of completing the project so require.
financial aid projections 
we turn to the plaintiffs second tier of the financial condition of the college would be adversely affected even if enrollment increased unless financial aid did not increase,and that the statements on this point were misleading.
the amended complaint alleges that projections in the official statement for financial aid levels in the and academic years were false and misleading when made.the official statement acknowledges that there has been a substantial increase in financial aid funded by the college between and.however,the plaintiffs point to the statement projections 
d uring the academic year,the college estimates that financial aid will be reduced to of student income versus the previous year.this expected reduction is a result of a change in methodology of aiding students with support versus additional loans funded by students parents.the college financial plan currently calls for a further reduction of financial aid spending for the academic year to of student income.
the amended complaint alleges that these statements were the actual percentage of financial aid awarded in was over of student income.the plaintiffs also allege that the budget,as of the date of the official statement,contemplated that financial aid would be of student income,not.
again,the allegations concerning the discrepancies between the actual percentage for the academic year and the estimated ones in the official statement come from hindsight the amended complaint obtained the figure from bradford audited financials for the year,which were not produced until after the close of the fiscal year in june,after the date of the official statement.
no facts are pled to support the general allegation that a t the time the official statement was distributed,the college possessed,and the defendants had access to,the data that proved the estimate was substantially incorrect.these allegations do not state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with scienter.b.
the plaintiffs do point to information which they say was available at the time of the official statement about the academic year.they allege the college knew that enrollment for the spring term in was lower than in the budget and knew what its financial aid commitments were.they also say the defendants knew the financial aid commitments were almost more than budgeted.those two pieces of data,however,do not,without more,tell one of the actual percentage of financial aid as against student income,either as of may,or as of the end of that academic year.
the most troublesome issue in the case is presented by the allegations regarding the official statement description of the financial plan for the school year financial aid levels.these are not mere optimistic projections because the statement is that t he college financial plan currently calls for a further reduction of financial aid spending for the academic year to of student income.emphasis added.this sentence would misrepresent the facts if the defendants,as of may,had actually decided to budget a significantly greater amount of the college funds for student aid.
the amended complaint alleges that bradford budget was originally submitted to the trustees on april,and reviewed by the finance committee of the board on may.the allegation is that the budget was revised at a meeting of college administrators later in may.the finalized budget pegged financial aid spending for at of student income.according to the amended complaint,that amount was greater than the sum referred to in the official statement issued on may.there is no allegation as to the budgeted figures in the april draft budget.the plaintiffs draw the inference that the final figure of was in the initial draft budget of april.the claim is that the makers of the statement about the budget had actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading,thus removing it from the safe harbor provisions of the pslra.see,greebel,at.
we can not say that the discrepancy between the figure in the statement and the figure alleged in the amended complaint is immaterial as a matter of law,as defendants argue.materiality is usually a matter for the trier of fact.shaw,at citing basic levinson,d.although represents only a small portion of the college operating revenues,which exceeded million in fiscal year,it amounts to about of the amount bradford spent on student aid that year.put another way,would cover about a third of the debt service due on the bonds in.the figure could indicate a trend of rising financial aid contributions,not the anticipated downward trend portrayed in the statement.the statement named the amount of financial aid awards as a risk factor in the college ability to repay the bonds.
even assuming materiality,the amended complaint provides no information on what proposed budget figures were known to the bradford defendants before the official statement was completed.one might infer that at least president short,as an ex officio member of the board of trustees,knew that financial aid was budgeted to be at the time he helped draft the statement.but few specifics are given to support the inference that the defendants knew the representation about the budget was wrong when made.
we must assess whether the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to give rise to a strong inference that the defendants wrote that passage in the official statement with intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst,at.more than mere proof that the defendants made a particular false or misleading statement is required to show scienter.aldridge,at see also geffon micrion,cir.but the fact that a defendant knowingly made a false statement is classic evidence of scienter.aldridge,at.
one inference,urged by plaintiffs,is that the at least short and the in possession of a budget that clearly contradicted the numbers they planned to quote in the official statement.the argument is that they feared that portraying an upward trend in financial aid expenditures would warn off investors,so they opted instead to spin the numbers to suggest that bradford was
