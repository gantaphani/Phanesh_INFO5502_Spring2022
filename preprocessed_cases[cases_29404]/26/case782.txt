engel appeals the grant of summary judgment for rcsd.she also appeals an order of the district court quashing her notice of deposition for michael hickey,rcsd attorney.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
because we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we describe the facts in the light most favorable to engel.from to,engel worked for rcsd,first as a technology secretary and later as an instructional and network technology associate.during her employment with rcsd,engel regularly encountered david herrera,a.in about,herrera began sexually harassing engel.among other actions,herrera asked engel the color of her undergarments and commented on her buttocks.he once asked her to feel his penis.he also harassed other female.
rcsd learned of herrera behavior in march,when jamie volk,another rcsd employee,complained about herrera to her supervisor.after volk made this complaint,engel was asked by a supervisor if she had been harassed by herrera.she said that she had been harassed and completed a written complaint describing the harassment.in response,rcsd suspended herrera on march and launched an investigation.five individuals conducted the investigation and decided how to discipline herrera.the members of the panel were steven hengen,the assistant superintendent of schools who oversaw the investigation,peter wharton,the superintendent of schools,michael hickey,rcsd counsel,and two supervisors from herrera office.
after its investigation,the panel issued a conference review in april outlining its response.it described the harassing conduct of which herrera had been accused as follows 
two requests by herrera that a female employee look at pornographic images of male and female sex on herrera computer numerous instances where herrera would rub or massage the neck of female without their prior permission instances where herrera would stroke the hair of without their permission instances where herrera would make remarks about the physical anatomy of female,nice butt or ask to feel a butt instances where herrera would attempt to look down the shirts of female instances where herrera would persistently inquire about whether or not a female coworker was wearing thong underwear and if so what color was it and did it match her bra instances where herrera would look females up and down which made females feel uncomfortable an instance when herrera made a remark to a female wherein he stated that she smelled good and that he needed to find some lotion and go into the bathroom and instances when he made comments about oral sex and sexual positions which could be used between the female and her husband,and an instance where herrera attempted to reach in a woman shirt to grab her identification badge.
the panel reported that the complaints against herrera had been carefully reviewed and verified,that the complaints were credible,and that herrera contrary explanation was not believable.id.at.the conference review stated that herrera conduct was unacceptable,and that it violated state and federal law.rcsd determined that herrera would not be paid for the time that he was suspended.
herrera was allowed to return to work on april,in the same department and location,but rcsd directed that he undergo counseling to address these areas of concern.id.rcsd no longer permitted herrera to have a master key to buildings,and he was required to gain advance approval for any travel away from the building where he worked.rcsd directed herrera that when within his control,he was not to be alone with any female employee.
rcsd advised herrera that any future complaints of harassment by you will result in your immediate termination of employment,and that i f there are any additional instances of inappropriate conduct,whether it be touching,verbal or otherwise,your employment will be terminated.id.the conference review concluded with a further warning continued conduct of the type mentioned above will not be tolerated any further.as stated above,if there is an additional complaint,your employment with the district will be terminated.id.
engel testified that after herrera returned to work,she was afraid to venture away from her immediate work area,for fear of encountering herrera.according to engel,she felt like she was a prisoner in her own room.id.at.she asked rcsd officials why herrera could not be moved to a different department or to a different area,but said that she never could get answers.id.school officials later explained that there were limited options for transferring someone in herrera occupation,and that although moving herrera had been discussed,rcsd concluded that it was best to leave him in the same location,because he would be under direct supervision.id.at.
after his return,herrera once said hello to engel in the hallway and tried to strike up a conversation.on another occasion,he spoke to her over the school intercom system.engel testified that when she was in the same room with herrera,he continued to look her up and down,such that she felt he was undressing her with his eyes.id.at.engel testified that she reported herrera continued leering to hengen in may or june.id.at.in august,hengen again suspended herrera from work.at that time,hengen wrote to herrera that on two separate occasions you have violated written restrictions placed upon you because of your previous sexual and nonsexual harassment by speaking to dede engel in the hallway and over the intercom.id.at.
despite rcsd earlier threat to terminate herrera if he engaged in any inappropriate conduct,rcsd did not fire him.instead,rcsd denied herrera pay for the time he was suspended,and some of the previous restrictions on his activities were reimposed.the august letter from hengen also included an admonition that w ithout prior approval,you are not to initiate discussion with,apologize to,or otherwise contact dede engel or jamie volk.id.hengen removed the threat that herrera definitely would be fired if he engaged in additional misconduct.this second disciplinary letter advised herrera that a ny future complaints of conduct of harassment or violation of the aforementioned terms and conditions will result in additional administrative action,up to and including the termination of your employment.id.
according to engel,after herrera returned to work after this second suspension,he continued to give her the look,the glance,the once over.id.at.engel averred that this leering made the work environment stressful,to the point where she would come home crying from work every night due to stress.id.at.engel eventually resigned her position with rcsd in march.at a farewell party at the school district,the superintendent asked engel whether her departure had anything to do with herrera sexual harassment.engel told him that the harassment was one of the factors that led her to resign,later explaining that she could take the stress anymore from the working conditions.id.at.engel submitted a formal letter of resignation in which she wrote that she really enjoyed working at rcsd,and made no mention herrera sexual harassment.she later testified that she omitted reference to the harassment because the town was too small,she would be labeled,and she was a single parent who need ed a job.id.at.
engel filed suit against rcsd,alleging sex discrimination and constructive discharge under title vii of the civil rights act of,and discrimination under codified laws.during discovery,engel sought to depose attorney hickey,who had been a member of the panel that investigated herrera behavior,and who also served as rcsd counsel in its defense to engel suit.rcsd moved to quash a notice of deposition for hickey,and the district court granted the motion.the court later granted rcsd summary judgment,holding that engel had failed to present sufficient evidence that rcsd response to herrera actions had been inadequate or that she had been constructively discharged.the court also dismissed engel parallel state discrimination claim with prejudice,and dismissed the other state claims without prejudice pursuant to c.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to engel.nitsche ceo of osage valley,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
this case involves sexual harassment by a who is not alleged to be a supervisor of the victim.in that situation,the employer can not be vicariously liable for the harassment.burlington,ellerth,d faragher city of boca raton,d.an employer may be directly liable for a harassment,however,if the employer knew or should have known of the conduct,and failed to take proper remedial action,merritt albemarle,wl,at cir dhyne meiners thriftway,cir.
our court,like several other circuits,has adopted the eeoc regulatory rule that w ith respect to conduct between fellow employees,an employer is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace where the employer knows or should have known of the conduct,unless it can show that it took immediate action and appropriate corrective action.d see faragher,at.burns mcgregor electronic,cir barrett omaha bank,cir.under this negligence standard,an employer is not liable if it takes prompt remedial action that is reasonably calculated to stop the harassment.carter chrysler,cir.the prevailing case law provides,however,that if the employer fails to take proper remedial action,then it may be culpable for harassment to which it did not adequately respond,on the theory that the combined knowledge and inaction may be seen as demonstrable negligence,or as the employer adoption of the offending conduct and its results,quite as if they had been authorized affirmatively as the employer policy.faragher,at.see smith louis,cir hall gus constr,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment for rcsd because it concluded that herrera harassment stopped after rcsd took remedial action,see moore city of philadelphia,cir duncan manager,of safety,denver,cir but see fuller city of oakland,cir,and because engel failed to report any subsequent harassment.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to engel,we conclude that neither ground can sustain the grant of summary judgment.
engel provided sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether herrera sexual harassment continued after rcsd took remedial action.a hostile work environment is a cumulative phenomenon,composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.passenger morgan,d.while a single harassing act might not be actionable standing alone,it can be actionable as a constituent element of a larger hostile environment claim.id.at.thus,once a hostile work environment is created,the continuation of acts contributing to that hostile environment,or closely related acts,can support a finding that the hostile environment has continued.see id.at.the statute does not separate individual acts that are part of the hostile environment claim from the whole for the purposes of timely filing and liability.duncan,at the entire range of related acts constitutes the hostile work environment underlying the plaintiff claim.to show that a hostile work environment has continued after an employer remedial action,a plaintiff need not prove an entire accumulation of harassing acts,amounting to a new and hostile work environment.
rcsd admitted that herrera pattern of harassment prior to april constituted a violation of federal and state law,and it identified instances where herrera would look females up and down which made females feel uncomfortable as a constituent element of the hostile work environment.engel app.engel testified that herrera continued this conduct after rcsd remedial actions.id.at.herrera also spoke twice with engel after rcsd initial remedial efforts,and rcsd acknowledged that these communications violated the written restrictions placed upon herrera,which forbade additional instances of inappropriate conduct.id.at.this evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether herrera harassment and the hostile work environment continued after rcsd took remedial action in april.
nor do we believe that summary judgment was warranted on the basis that engel failed to report herrera continuing harassment to rcsd.t he employer knowledge of the misconduct is what is critical,not how the employer came to have that knowledge.cerros steel,cir.thus,a plaintiff is not necessarily required to report the harassment through an official complaint procedure.varner super markets,cir.taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the evidence shows that engel officially complained of herrera harassment before rcsd first remedial action,and later alerted assistant superintendent hengen that herrera continued certain elements of the harassment after the first remedial action.this evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether engel adequately placed rcsd on notice of continued harassment.
that herrera harassment continued,and that engel reported the harassment,is not sufficient,in and of itself,to establish that rcsd could be liable for the hostile work environment.proper remedial action need be only reasonably calculated to stop the harassment,carter,at,and remedial action that does not end the harassment can still be adequate if it is reasonably calculated to do so.moore,at.
we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to show that rcsd is liable for the hostile work environment that occurred prior to april.during this period,rcsd had a written policy against sexual harassment and a formal complaint procedure,yet no employee reported herrera harassment to supervisory employees until march.herrera was suspended from work on march.the first remedial action,set forth in the conference review dated april,sanctioned herrera with an unpaid suspension,restricted his ability to gain access to buildings,assigned him to undergo counseling,and issued a stern warning that additional harassment or inappropriate conduct would result in termination.although it turns out that this action did not stop herrera harassment entirely,it did eliminate some of the offending conduct,and the law does not require an employer to fire a sexual harasser in the first instance to demonstrate an adequate remedial response.barrett,at.the response was prompt,reasonably comprehensive in scope,and stern in its warnings.we therefore conclude as a matter of law that rcsd can not be liable for a hostile work environment that existed prior to herrera return to work on april.
that an employer responds adequately to an initial report of sexual harassment,however,does not discharge the employer responsibility to respond properly to subsequent reports of offending conduct by the harasser.in this case,as we have recounted,there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether herrera harassment continued after the first remedial action in april.as to the time period between april and march,we conclude that there is also a genuine issue of fact as to whether rcsd was negligent in responding to herrera continued harassment,such that it may be liable for a hostile work environment continuing to occur after the first remedial action,and for damages limited to that later period.
several considerations lead to this conclusion.a reasonable jury could conclude that rcsd second remedial action in august failed to ad
