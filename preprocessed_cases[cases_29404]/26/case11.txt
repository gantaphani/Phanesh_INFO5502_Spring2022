this case concerns two separate,but ultimately intertwining,narratives.the first is that of appellant,her son,and his right to a free appropriate public education fape under the federal individuals with disabilities education act idea.the second concerns the implementation of a maine regulation referred to herein as the filing limitation that determines how much time a parent,such as,has to request a due process hearing alleging an idea violation.
in may,filed a request for a due process hearing with the maine department of education mdoe concerning alleged idea violations in all of ninth,tenth,eleventh,and twelfth grade years.the hearing officer dismissed the claims that arose during ninth and tenth grades as time barred because the filing limitation allowed only claims brought within two years of when the parent knew or should have known of a violation.sought judicial review in the district court,arguing that the hearing officer should not have dismissed the ninth and tenth grade claims because the filing limitation was not promulgated in compliance with the maine administrative procedure act maine apa or mapa and is therefore void and of no legal effect.the district court determined that the filing limitation was valid,did not qualify for an exception to the limitation period,and received a fape in the eleventh and twelfth grades.timely appeal followed.
we conclude that the district court erred in its analysis of the validity of the filing limitation,and,further,that the record before us is insufficient to determine whether the mdoe adequately complied with mapa procedures when adopting the filing limitation.given that conclusion,we do not reach the question of whether an exception to the filing limitation applies here.however,we do find that,consistent with the district court judgment,received a fape in the eleventh and twelfth grades.we therefore vacate and remand in part,and affirm in part.
background 
received special education services on and off from kindergarten through high school to address developmental delays,particularly related to speech development.he was diagnosed with autism in high school.in detailing this history,we recite the facts pertinent to arguments on appeal.
in,enrolled in the ninth grade at fryeburg academy,a contract high school for students residing in regional school unit the school district.before beginning school,an individualized education program iep team composed of school staff,and met and determined that did not qualify for an iep,but the team provided with a plan to address language deficits.in ninth grade,also participated in fryeburg academy transition program and was provided accommodations such as an allowance for delayed responses through his plan.by tenth grade,however,had a normal schedule of courses and no longer participated in the transition program.
in tenth grade,began to engage in inappropriate use of the internet and was by his peers.his first trimester grades included four f grades and one d grade.after again determining in november that did not need special education services,the iep team met next in may and concluded that was eligible for idea services,including speech language therapy,classroom accommodations,and sessions at the school learning center.
at the beginning of eleventh grade year,the iep team held another meeting to review the results of summer assessments and diagnoses.over the summer,was diagnosed with autistic disorder,mixed receptive and expressive language disorder,and depressive disorder.in response,the iep team required additional reporting on speech and language sessions and suggested participation in a planned social group that never came to fruition,but otherwise did not change iep.on a weekly basis,carie heath,a speech and language services provider,worked with on his speech and language skills,as well as his social skills.during this time,heath consulted with school staff and concerning,and told heath that he felt good about his progress.special education teacher testified that during the same period,became more involved with student activities and was starting to come out of his shell.
however,in october,began missing some of his classes,and,in november,informed the school that she would be keeping home due to safety concerns resulting from bullying.shortly thereafter,the iep team met to address these concerns.in response to request that receive social skills instruction,school staff informed her that the psychological services provider worked with students individually for scheduling reasons,but that was encouraged to engage in group activities and had been doing so through his involvement with the school student union and sports teams.special education teacher also reported that was making small advancements,but still needs prompting and coaxing.nevertheless,the iep team agreed that iep should be enhanced to include a educational technician escort in and between all classes,to add a behavior plan,and to require daily meetings with his school advisor.
by december of his eleventh grade year,was evading his school escort and had reportedly stolen sneakers from one of the school dormitories.as a result of the theft,the fryeburg academy judicial board expelled.at a january iep team meeting,the team determined that tutorial services were necessary pending return to a program.on february,the team met again to identify possible alternative schools that might attend,including the real school for both disabled and nondisabled students who had difficulty in a traditional school setting.the following week,the real school offered admission to its program.the real school had a program,prompting expressions of concern from,but she nevertheless agreed to the placement.
in the months following placement at the real school,appeared both to have excelled and to have experienced setbacks.at a march iep meeting,the team declined request for a longer school day but added social and transition goals to iep.the real school also prepared a positive behavior support plan for,and his june report card reflected grades above in all of his courses,including a in math and a in english and social studies.his sat scores,however,were rated in the tenth,seventh,and third percentiles nationally for reading,writing,and math,respectively,and engaged in some questionable behavior involving the taking of money.in spite of these issues,lauded the program and its administrators in email exchanges,and she offered such praises as thanks for being so awesome,and you guys are good.during this time,heath continued to provide weekly speech and language services to 
in the summer of,the real school provided with nine hours of services with a licensed clinical social worker and three days of adventure programming.that same summer,licensed psychologist laura concluded that had autistic disorder and is a candidate for therapeutic residential placement for adolescents with autistic disorder and other developmental disorders.
at the end of august,iep team met again to review evaluation.a written notice from the meeting indicates that liked attending the real school and would not like to see anything change.indicated that the lengthy commute to and from the real school limited time to socialize and that she would like to see placed in a residential setting.the team met again in early september and could not reach a consensus concerning evaluation and diagnosis of autism.the team raised concerns that evaluation did not conform with either local or state standards for assessments.the team,however,agreed that should remain for a fifth year of high school for the academic year.after the september meeting,a psychologist conducted additional testing of skills and potential disorders.the psychologist later testified that his role was not to make a diagnosis concerning autism,but that he would be skeptical of such a diagnosis.he also testified that a residential program that requires supervision does seem to fit needs,nor did an program.
in his senior year at the real school,participated in service activities,and in an email to,the director of the real school described participation as stunningly active and reported that contributed so much leadership and kindness to our group.first quarter report card reflected a grade of in english,math,and science,and a grade of in social studies.however,continued to object to the school shortened day and lengthy commute.on october,informed the school district that she was rejecting as inappropriate the iep and placement offered to,and that she was removing from the real school and placing him at the eagleton school in massachusetts.also requested reimbursement for the costs of placing at the eagleton school,which is a,residential program.
at a november iep team meeting,the team noted that had made excellent progress with developing social skills and progressing academically at the real school and that they did not agree with the need for a residential placement.nevertheless,began attending eagleton that month.in march,the iep team met again to discuss programming at eagleton,and the school district director of special services determined that should still be placed at the real school.by july,the school education director reported that had blossomed socially at eagleton and that he would be ready to transition back to the real school for the fall of his fifth year of high school,with the proper social and language supports.
completed the eagleton program in august and returned to the real school for the year.from november through august,spent on placement at the eagleton school 
b.the filing limitation 
in the fall of,as was beginning ninth grade at fryeburg academy,the mdoe was beginning the process to revise certain rules within the maine unified special education regulation muser.the maine apa governs the process to amend muser,and muser,a state regulation,controls the process for requesting a due process hearing under the idea.although the idea and its corresponding federal regulations provide default provisions for this due process hearing procedure,the idea permits states to vary some of these provisions.see f c.
two specific muser provisions are relevant here.the first is the filing limitation,which,as discussed above,specifies the time a parent or school district has to file a request for a due process hearing after the date the parent or district knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process hearing request.me.code,ch.muser xvi.muser also contains a separate provision referred to herein as the term that limits how far back in time a claim may reach once a parent knows or should have known of an asserted violation.id.xvi.a.
prior to the mdoe efforts to amend muser in,the filing limitation and the term each stood at four years thus,in certain circumstances,a parent might have had eight years from the date of an alleged violation to file an idea due process hearing request the violation could have taken place up to four years before the parent knew or should have known about the violation the term,and then,from the point at which the parent knew or should have known about the violation,the parent had another four years to decide if he or she would like to request a due process hearing the filing limitation.
in november,the mdoe issued a notice of agency proposal,which identified a variety of proposed changes to muser,including that the statute of limitations for due process hearings will be changed to the federal standard of two years.to accompany the public notice statement,the mdoe published at least two versions of muser that indicated the mdoe proposed changes by striking through old language and underlining new proposed language.both versions explicitly changed the term from four years to two years.however,neither version indicated any change to the filing limitation,and,instead,left the provision untouched at four years.
in accordance with mapa procedures,the mdoe scheduled a public hearing in december to discuss the proposed changes.in january,after the notice and comment period,the mdoe filed the now provisionally adopted rules which contained a proposed term and an unchanged filing limitation with the maine secretary of state and submitted the rules to the maine legislature for its required review.
while this standard rulemaking was taking place,the mdoe had also taken advantage of an expedited mapa procedure allowing a rule to take effect on a temporary,emergency basis.the emergency rule contained several of the same changes to muser,including a change to the statute of limitations for due process hearings.consistent with the earlier filings,the emergency rule included a term and an unchanged filing limitation of four years.this emergency rule was adopted by the agency in january and then submitted to the maine legislature for permanent adoption,along with the provisionally adopted rule,later that month.the legislature joint standing committee on education and cultural affairs joint standing committee considered the emergency and provisionally adopted rules in tandem,conducting a public hearing and multiple work sessions in february.
the maine legislature then approved the emergency and provisionally adopted rules with some amendments but none that altered the filing limitation from four years to two years following the legislative review,the mdoe adopted a final version of muser.here,for the first time,muser listed the filing limitation as two years from the date a parent knew or should have known about an alleged violation.the term also was listed as two years,as it had been in the proposed,emergency,and provisionally adopted versions of the rule.
procedural history 
in may,filed a request for a due process hearing with the mdoe concerning alleged violations in each of high school years.the hearing officer dismissed the claims that arose during the ninth and tenth grades as barred by the filing limitation.the hearing officer then found that the school district did not provide with a fape for the period following his expulsion from fryeburg academy in his eleventh grade year,but did receive a fape during the remainder of his eleventh grade year and throughout his twelfth grade year.
sought judicial review in the district court arguing that the filing limitation is void because it was not passed in compliance with the maine apa,and hence ninth and tenth grade claims should be restored.in connection with her claims,sought reimbursement for costs associated with private placement at the eagleton school compensatory educational services for bs.the school district did not appeal the hearing officer minor ruling in favor regarding the period following expulsion from fryeburg academy.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court hold the filing limitation valid because the maine legislature reviewed and approved the filing limitation when it approved subsequent amendments to other parts of muser in rulemakings,including in and.
the district court adopted the recommendation on this point,and it added that evidence of the legislature intent in early supports the conclusion that the legislature approved a filing limitation at the same time that it approved the proposed term.the district court also adopted the recommendation that did not qualify for an exception to the limitation period and that received a fape in the remainder of his eleventh grade year and throughout his twelfth grade year.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the validity of the filing limitation under mapa.see town of johnston fed.hous.fin.agency,cir.with regard to eleventh and twelfth grade idea claims,we review the district court answers to questions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.ex rel.elizabeth esposito,cir.quoting ex rel.five town cmty.sch,cir.when faced with mixed questions of law and fact,such as whether an iep is adequate or a student received a fape,our degree of deference depends on whether a particular determination is dominated by law or fact.id.at.
iii.the maine administrative procedure act 
argues that the district court erred in holding that the mdoe promulgated the filing limitation rule in accordance with mapa.she asserts that the mdoe made an unauthorized unilateral change to the filing limitation term,and that the mdoe failure to comply with mapa should render the filing limitation void.as a result,argues,we should conclude that the ninth and tenth grade claims were timely brought within the filing period.
mapa ordinarily requires an agency to promulgate certain,major substantive rules such as the rules changing the filing limitation via a process.the first step requires the agency to provide public notice of the proposed rule and an opportunity for comment.see me.stat.ann.tit.the second step,which is the primary focus of our analysis,requires legislative review of the proposed rule.see id.if an agency violates mapa rulemaking procedure,mapa judicial review provision prescribes whether the rule nevertheless survives depending on the nature and impact of the violation.see id.
the district court did not address the notice step of the rulemaking process.the court looked to the legislature intent in as well as the legislature approval of rulemakings in and to conclude that the filing limitation was valid.as we explain below,the court assessment of the rulemaking compliance with mapa legislative review requirements was flawed in three respects it erroneously analyzed certain materials regarding the legislature intent to approve a filing limitation it erroneously concluded that subsequent years rulemakings cured any prior deficiencies and it failed to apply a review standard to evaluate the rulemaking missteps.on the record before us,however,we are unable to determine whether these errors undermine the court conclusion that the filing limitation is valid.we therefore remand the case to the district court to be decided in accordance with the guidance provided below.
regrettably,we can not explain our remand decision without describing the complexities of mapa.we thus begin by examining mapa legal framework.
mapa rulemaking 
under mapa,a state agency seeking to adopt a major substantive rule may initiate the rulemaking process in two ways by following the standard procedures prescribed for such rules or by seeking temporary adoption of an emergency rule.me.stat.ann.tit.the two paths may be pursued simultaneously,which is what occurred here.see id.hence,because the mdoe proposed the filing limitation as both a major substantive rule and an emergency rule,we review the mapa requirements for each.
although major substantive rules are subject to greater scrutiny than routine technical rules,the standard rulemaking process begins with the same notice and comment procedures applicable to such routine rules.see id.in addition,every major substantive rule is also subject to legislative review,as described in mapa section.id.preamble see also id.b.a major substantive rule has legal effect only after review by the legislature followed by final adoption by the agency.id.
a major substantive rule also may be proposed as an emergency rule,one that is necessary to avoid an immediate threat to public health,safety or general welfare.id.if an agency finds that implementation of a rule meets this standard,it may modify the rulemaking requirements to accelerate adoption of rules designed to mitigate or alleviate the threat found.id.emergency rules,however,are not permanent.in certain circumstances,an emergency major substantive rule may be effective for up to months or until the legislature has completed review.id.thus,at the very least the legislature must review any changes to a major substantive rule adopted through the emergency process to make such a rule permanent.
mapa judicial review 
mapa section sets forth the judicial review standards for alleged agency rulemaking violations me.stat.ann.tit.curiously,neither party briefing,either to us or the district court,refers to this provision when evaluating whether the maine legislature reviewed the reduced filing limitation in accordance with mapa in not surprisingly,given this omission,the district court did not refer to it in its order.in light of these omissions,we arguably could avoid the question of the appropriate standard for judicial review by invoking the waiver doctrine.see united states zannino,cir.however,the parties have asked us to decide whether the filing limitation is valid for the purpose of resolving idea claims.in our view,it would be imprudent to ignore a factor critical to a challenge to a rule adequacy and to ignore the statutory text of mapa judicial review provision.see bank of or.indep.ins.agents of,w hen an issue or claim is properly before the court,the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties,but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.quoting kamen kemper fin.moreover,our discussion of the proper scope of the court review under mapa does not result in a merits decision by us as to the validity of the filing limitation.rather,we raise this issue to properly frame the district court review of the case on remand.
the applicable mapa review standard depends upon the type of mapa violation.hence,we must classify the failure to comply with mapa legislative review procedure as a particular type of violation in order to determine the appropriate review standard for such a violation.section sets the scope of judicial review for three types of rulemaking violations if the rule exceeds the authority of the agency,if the rule is void under section of mapa discussed below,and any other procedural error.me.sat.ann.tit.
if a court finds either of the first two types of violations,the court must hold the rule invalid.id.in a case dealing with the third type of mapa violation any other procedural error the court may find the rule invalid only if the procedural error is substantial and of such central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if the error had not occurred.id.the maine law court has described the substantial likelihood standard as a harmless error standard similar to that employed in ordinary civil litigation.fulkerson comm r,me.dep t of human,me.
the law court also concluded that the two different review standards automatic invalidation and harmless error reflect the legislature inten t to narrow the circumstances in which procedural error would automatically invalidate a rule.id.at.the court found that the circumstances in which invalidation of a rule is automatic principally involve a denial of public participation.id.at.
here,the parties do not dispute the general rulemaking authority of the mdoe as to muser which would implicate the first type of rulemaking violation,and we thus focus only on the second and third types of rulemaking violation.the second type consists of violations that would make a rule void under section of mapa.me.stat.ann.tit.section requires compliance with four sections of mapa two govern the general rulemaking and public notice process sections and,one governs emergency rulemaking section,and one governs the filing and publication of an adopted rule section.id.section states that failure to comply with certain parts of these sections renders a rule void and of no legal effect,except that insubstantial deviations from the requirements of section,the section governing notice,do not invalidate the rule subsequently adopted.id.see also id.the judicial review standard in section then reinforces this scheme by stating that,if a court finds that a rule is void under section,it shall declare the rule invalid.id.in sum,a court reviewing certain alleged violations of sections,or must consider whether such a violation occurred,and,absent the insubstantial deviation exception for notice,if the court finds a violation,it must declare the rule invalid.
meanwhile,the third type of violation encompasses all other procedural error s.id.it follows that such errors are those that do not constitute an agency transgression of its rulemaking authority,the first type of violation and those that are not addressed in mapa compliance section,section,the second type of violation.see id.
the legislative review stage of the rulemaking process is governed by sections and of mapa,neither of which is discussed in mapa compliance section.see id.section also does not address failures to comply with certain parts of the mapa section governing emergency major substantive rules.see id.thus,errors at these stages appear to fall into the third,any other procedural error category and warrant harmless error review under mapa section.id.
we must,however,address one other consideration in a court review of a rulemaking compliance with the legislative review process.section expressly states that a provisionally adopted major substantive rule has legal effect only after review by the legislature followed by final adoption by the agency.id.standing alone,this language suggests that the utter absence of legislative review for a major substantive rule may preclude the validity of a finally adopted rule.although both past and present versions of section allow for a rule to take legal effect without legislative action in certain circumstances see supra note,it is fair to say that the legislature at least must have had the opportunity to review the substance of a finally adopted rule in the section process.absent such opportunity,it may be that a final major substantive rule can not survive judicial scrutiny under section.how these nuances play out in this case is best left to the district court to address in the first instance.
adoption of the filing limitation 
the challenge in this case to the validity of the filing limitation is not a surprise.the mdoe rulemaking actions surrounding the overall muser changes in fostered confusion and concern.in fact,this rulemaking prompted the passage of a bill in the maine legislature to commission a report on state agency rulemaking efforts under mapa.see final report of the state and local gov t comm.study of the process under the maine administrative procedure act,sess.me.the resulting public report discusses government confusion concerning the process for permanent adoption of an emergency rule and,more significantly,it observes that many saw the mdoe changes to muser as a continuation of a process in which the department was frustrating the will of the legislature by adopting policies that were not consistent with direction given by the legislature.id.at app.b.
with respect to the specific muser provisions at issue here,the phrase statute of limitations is used without definition by the mdoe in its public notice statement,by the mdoe commissioner in her testimony to the maine legislature,by many additional witnesses and advocates,and by the legislature itself.both the filing limitation and term involve time restrictions,and both periods were originally four years while the parallel federal periods are both two years.hence,the statute of limitations label could be used to describe the filing limitation,the term,or both.this imprecision complicated the rulemaking process.
as described above,the standard process for implementing a major substantive rule involves two steps,and legislative review.asserts error in both steps of the rulemaking,but does not account for the rulemaking parallel,emergency track.we briefly address notice before moving on to the three errors we detect in the district court discussion of the legislative review step.these three errors concern the court treatment of legislative intent,subsequent rulemakings,and mapa judicial review standards.
asserts on appeal that the final adopted filing limitation is invalid because the mdoe did not provide the public notice or opportunity for comment that is required in the rulemaking process although raised the adequacy of notice in the district court that issue received little attention from either the district court or the parties.for example,no consideration was given to whether the mdoe must provide public notice when making permanent an emergency major substantive rule and,if so,whether the mdoe provided adequate notice here.we think these questions are more appropriately handled by the district court in the first instance.see town of barnstable,cir.declining to decide and remanding a question of law advanced by a party but not decided in the district court see also singleton wulff,the matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.depending on the court resolution of other issues,it may need to consider these notice questions on remand.
legislative intent 
as described above,the rule proposed in and approved by the legislature in did not include language reducing the filing limitation.nevertheless,the district court concluded that the requisite legislative review occurred,in part,because the record supported a finding that the legislature in intended to approve a filing limitation.
argues that courts may never consider lawmakers intent when evaluating whether a rulemaking complied with mapa procedural requirements.we reject the assertion that legislative intent is entirely irrelevant to mapa compliance.for instance,we can envision a court looking beyond the text of the regulatory documents when conducting the harmless error inquiry prescribed by mapa section.see me.stat.ann.tit.
of course,in some circumstances,a court consideration of legislative intent is improper.ordinarily,the law court does not look beyond language approved by the legislature to determine the legislature intent where,as here,the language is unambiguous.see state hood,me.the rule approved by the legislature contained express language specifying a filing limitation of four years.in addition,the legislative resolve approving the rule made no changes to that text 
nonetheless,the district court found that reference to legislative intent was necessary to avoid absurd,inconsistent,unreasonable or illogical results.state niles,me.the court concluded that the combination of a term and a filing limitation created an illogical result because the scheme would give parents more time to take an action within their control yet restrict their rights with respect to a factor farther outside of their control.
we disagree that logic requires either identical timelines for both the term and the filing limitation or a longer timeline for the term.while a longer filing limitation would not mirror the federal regulatory scheme,it could reflect a plan to give parents more time for at least one stage of the process.indeed,it does not strike us as illogical to give parents more time to consult with counsel,consider their options,and decide how to proceed once they are aware that a violation took place.the court therefore erred in finding an illogical outcome that required the court to examine legislative intent.
in any event,the evidence that the court relied upon as unequivocal expressions of the legislature intent does not provide conclusive support for the court finding.in concluding that the legislature intended to approve a filing limitation,the district court pointed to witness testimony submitted to the joint standing committee,which was reviewing the changes to muser.the limited materials presented to the district court show that the mdoe commissioner and multiple other witnesses submitted testimony that included vague reference to a change to the statute of limitations.however,much of the written testimony in these materials also included specific page references to the text of the proposed rule,linking the witness position with the exact muser provision at issue.when discussing changes to the statute of limitations,the testimony of the mdoe commissioner and multiple other witnesses before the committee include page references that correspond solely to the term and not the filing limitation in the november proposed for provisional adoption version of the rule.see proposed for provisional adoption,maine unified special education regulation birth to age twenty,at,proposed.in light of these specific page references,we do not interpret this testimony as a clear indication that the legislature reviewed the filing limitation 
for additional support for its conclusion,the district court looked to the published report of the joint standing committee vote on the mdoe proposed changes to muser.based on this report,the court found that,by a vote of seven to five,the committee decided that t he statute of limitations for due process hearings is changed to the federal standard of two years second alteration in original.however,a closer examination of the report reveals that the joint standing committee voted that a rule change to reduce t he statute of limitations for due process hearings to two years ought not to pass,or ontp,by a vote of seven to five as opposed to the district court assertion that the committee approved the change by such a vote although subsequent committee vote tallies,of which we take judicial notice,see territory of alaska am.can,suggest that the joint standing committee may have reconsidered the measure,the precise subject of those subsequent votes remains unclear.see joint standing comm.on educ.and cultural affairs,committee voting tally sheets,me.accordingly,to the extent the district court refers to these rulemaking materials on remand,it will need to reevaluate their content.
subsequent rulemakings 
the district court also offered a ratification rationale for finding the rule valid notwithstanding the legislative review issues of the original rulemaking.the court,agreeing with the magistrate judge,concluded that the legislature effected a post hoc ratification of the period when it reviewed changes to other parts of muser in subsequent rulemaking proceedings in and.
however,consistent with its review of the original rulemaking,the district court did not consider the issue of notice when it examined the subsequent rulemakings.it again reviewed only whether the legislature had approved the proposed rules.yet,as both parties recognize,the subsequent proceedings were subject to the mapa requirement of notice and an opportunity for public comment.see me.stat.ann.tit.the record provides no indication that the mdoe gave notice to the public of any change to the length of the filing limitation period in these subsequent,standard rulemakings.
the school district argues that the failure to alert the public to this change in the subsequent rulemakings is an insubstantial deviation s from mapa notice requirements because the text of the proposed rules in those later years included the filing limitation.see id.however,if merely including language in the body of a rule without identifying it as a change were sufficient to provide notice,mapa notice requirement would have no meaning.an agency could simply bury new language in a previously existing rule,putting an unreasonable burden on the public to unearth the language and identify it as a change.we reject this approach as inconsistent with the law court view of the importance of notice and public participation in the rulemaking process.see fulkerson,at.therefore,given the lack of notice in the subsequent rulemakings,the district court erred in finding that these later proceedings cured the defects in the original rulemaking.see me.stat.ann.tit.
judicial review 
as discussed above,the review that a court applies to a particular type of mapa violation may dictate whether,in spite of the violation,the rule has legal effect.the district court decision did not reflect consideration of either the different judicial review standards set forth in section or the fact that section gives legal effect to a rule only if,at a minimum,the legislature had the opportunity to review it.see me.stat.ann.tit.therefore,the district court erred when it did not apply a review standard.
mapa summary and guidance on remand 
in sum,we conclude that the district court did not properly evaluate the validity of the filing limitation under mapa prescribed rulemaking procedures.the district court did not address the notice issue raised by as to the original rulemaking.in addition,it made three errors when evaluating the rulemaking compliance with mapa legislative review requirements it erroneously analyzed certain materials regarding the legislature intent it concluded that subsequent rulemakings cured defects in the original rulemaking and it did not apply a review standard to violations of the rulemaking process.
we recognize that,despite these errors,the court ultimate conclusion that the filing limitation is valid could be correct.however,we are unable to affirm that judgment in light of the district court incomplete analysis,the parties deficient briefing,and the murky record before us.we thus remand the case to the district court to reevaluate the validity of the filing limitation.
on remand,the district court resolution of the validity of the filing limitation rule should apply the judicial review framework,in keeping with the guidance provided herein.the public record for the rulemaking process encompasses substantial materials far beyond those initially presented to the district court.the court may order the parties to develop the record and provide further briefing as necessary to make its determinations.we do not opine on whether materials beyond the mapa processes may be germane to the section analysis.we also do not opine on whether a certified question for the law court about the interplay between mapa various provisions may be appropriate once the record is developed.
iv.the specific misrepresentation exception 
the idea,and,in turn,muser,contain two exceptions to time restrictions imposed by the filing limitation.see f d i ii muser xvi.f.relevant here is the specific misrepresentation exception,which sets aside the filing limitation if the parent was prevented from filing a due process hearing request due to s pecific misrepresentations by the school district that it had resolved the problem forming the basis of the due process hearing request.muser xvi.f.f.argues that even if the filing limitation stands at two years,the idea specific misrepresentation exception applies,and,as a result,the ninth and tenth grade claims are not time barred.because we are remanding the case to the district court to determine the validity of the filing limitation,we do not reach this issue.
idea claims 
setting aside the ninth and tenth grade claims,we focus on undisputedly timely claims.argues that the school district did not provide with a fape in his eleventh and twelfth grade years.under the idea,each state receiving federal idea funding must provide a fape to all children with disabilities between the ages of and.a a.to ensure that this takes place,a school district must take steps to identify children who may qualify as disabled,evaluate each such child to determine his or her eligibility for statutory benefits,and develop a customized iep designed to ensure that the child receives a level of educational benefits commensurate with a fape.five town,at.the idea also mandates that,t o the maximum extent appropriate,a school district special education accommodations should take place in the least restrictive environment available.a a a.
the iep is the centerpiece of the idea education delivery system for disabled children.honig doe.a customized iep must include,at a bare minimum,the child present level of educational attainment,the short and goals for his or her education,objective criteria with which to measure progress toward those goals,and the specific services to be offered.esposito,at quoting lessard coop.sch,cir.an iep therefore must target all of a child special needs,including a child social limitations.lenn portland sch,cir.quoting town of burlington dep t of,cir.however,t he idea does not promise perfect solutions,id.at,and the obligation to devise a iep does not imply that a disabled child is entitled to the maximum educational benefit possible,esposito,at quoting lessard,at.we therefore review an iep compliance with the idea based on whether the iep is reasonably calculated to confer a meaningful educational benefit.esposito,at.
eleventh grade 
argues that,in eleventh grade,did not receive adequate social skills instruction and that his placement in the real school was not reasonably calculated to provide him with meaningful benefit.
the district court concluded that the hearing officer adequately addressed the social skills instruction issue and that the school district was not required to provide a student with his parent first choice for services.we agree.in accordance with his iep,met weekly with speech pathologist heath to work on his speech,language,and social skills.during this time,heath consulted with school staff and concerning,and told her that he felt good about his progress.special education teacher testified that during the same period,became more involved with student activities and was starting to come out of his shell.that fall,when kept home due to safety concerns resulting from bullying,the iep team met to address those concerns.although the school did not satisfy request to provide social instruction because of scheduling difficulties,was encouraged to engage in group activities and was reported to have been doing so through his involvement with the school student union and sports teams.the iep team also enhanced iep to include a educational technician escort in between all classes,to add a behavior plan,and to require daily meetings with his school advisor.although the plan may not have met the appellant specific requests concerning instruction,the iep team put in place measures to address social needs and limitations.the district court did not err in concluding that no violation occurred 
also argues that the school district placement of in the real school following his expulsion from fryeburg academy did not meaningfully benefit.posits that the real school did not provide with the appropriate programming given the school shortened day and lack of an speech pathologist.the district court found no evidence to support conclusion that the real school was an improper placement for.we again find no error in this determination.under state regulations,an abbreviated school day is any day that a child attends school or receives educational services for less time than peers without disabilities within the same school school program.muser ii emphasis added.day was no shorter than his peers at the real school.in fact,school officials testified that the real school abbreviated day works out to the same amount of instructional time as would have received at a traditional public high school where students have significant amounts of holding time,such as homeroom and time between classes.furthermore,while the real school did not have a speech pathologist on staff,heath continued to provide speech therapy to on a weekly basis while he attended the real school.thus,the district court did not err when it determined that received a fape in the eleventh grade,and we affirm this judgment.
twelfth grade 
asserts the same claims concerning the real school in twelfth grade year as she did regarding his placement there in his eleventh grade year.the district court ruled that again received a fape in twelfth grade.for the reasons discussed above,we affirm this judgment.
vi.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court judgment that the filing limitation is valid under the maine apa and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the district court judgment that received a fape in the eleventh and twelfth grades.each party shall bear its own costs.
so ordered.
with the greatest respect for my colleagues,i write separately to express my views.
i fully join the holding affirming that received a free appropriate public education fape under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,for his eleventh and twelfth grade years.
the issue of the appropriate limitation period for the filing of the plaintiff claim,particularly as to the ninth and tenth grade years,is controlled by a federal statute,f c,which receives too little attention from the parties.that federal statute states that a parent has two years to file a complaint from when the parent knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a hearing under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows.see also e.as i understand the provision,a state limitation period is adopted if and only if the state has an explicit time limitation,otherwise the federal default period of two years is used.
the parties have assumed that maine has an explicit time limitation in its state regulation,me.code,ch.muser xvi.e,which on its face provides for a limitation period of two years.assumes that she is nonetheless free to attack the validity of this state regulation using the maine administrative procedure act mapa,as a matter of application of the governing federal idea statute.based on that assumption,she argues that the state regulation is invalid under mapa.the school system responds by defending the state regulation validity in like terms.
it is not clear that the intent of f c is to permit a federal court to decide state administrative procedure questions about the validity of explicitly stated state administrative provisions.it could be that we are to take the state law on its face.then again,it may be that those uncertainties about the time period under mapa mean that maine has not met the explicit time limitation requirement of the federal statute.if so,we would find the federal limitation period applies for the ninth and tenth grade years.in either of the scenarios,we would find that the governing limitation period is two years,that the plaintiff claims as to the ninth and tenth grade years are not timely,and that judgment should be entered against her on those claims.
on the other hand,there may be reasons to think that the state law validity issue should be resolved.still,that does not answer the question of who should resolve the issue or say that the federal court should resolve it.the parties have utterly failed to adequately brief the federal issues and have encouraged the court to enter the state law briar patch.my colleagues are not to be faulted for walking down the path that the parties laid out for them.
nevertheless,as to answering the question of the validity of the limitation period under maine law,my view is that it is not the business of a federal court to tell maine how to interpret its own administrative law.doctrines of federalism,comity,and abstention all counsel against such incursions.see the real estate bar ass for,real estate info,cir.there are strong federalism interests that are furthered by providing the state courts with the opportunity to decide on underlying unsettled questions of state law,certified question answered.
to the extent that the state regulation validity issue governs the timeliness analysis,i would have preferred to send this matter to the maine supreme judicial court for resolution or to have abstained and let the state courts resolve this matter.i agree that the question is important to the administration of idea programs and services in maine,and that is exactly why the maine supreme judicial court,and not this court,should decide the state law question.see fortin titcomb,cir.certifying where the choice between these two paths was a matter of state policy best left to the state courts,certified question answered,me.in my view,the conditions for certification have been met.see darney dragon prods,llc,me.and here,we would benefit from certifying a question to the maine supreme judicial court,as we have in the past.see,fortin,at
