petitioner john white white petitions for review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board board,which rejected his whistleblowing claim,finding that white did not have a reasonable belief that he was disclosing gross mismanagement.white dep t of the air force.we affirm.
background 
white was employed by the department of the air force air force as a civilian supervisory education service specialist at nellis air force base in nevada.as part of his duties,white was delegated complete responsibility for administering education programs at nellis air force base.
in and early,the air force was developing the bright flag quality education system qes,a program which mandated various standards for colleges and universities contracting with the air force to provide education services.as the board found,the qes program 
imposed various requirements on the educational institutions providing services on agency bases,and set forth ways to measure the institutions compliance with the standards.the requirements pertained to faculty prerequisites,compilation of statistical data monitoring the effectiveness of the educational programs,minimum classroom contact hours,compatible computer systems,mathematical and english placement testing to determine enrollment levels,course duplication,course evaluations to maintain quality,and adequate library resources to support the courses and programs.
white dep t of the air force,white v.from september onwards,white discussed the qes program with various educational institutions that provided services to the air force and received a number of complaints from these institutions criticizing the qes program.among the complaints from educational institutions were that the qes program duplicated regional accrediting,was academically unsound,necessitated excessive administrative burdens,and imposed excessive costs.there were also procedural objections that the air force had developed the program too quickly,without sufficient notice and input from the schools,and without conducting a analysis.white relayed these concerns to the air force in february,but no action was taken at that time.
frustrated by lack of attention to their concerns,several educational institutions requested a meeting with air force officials.a meeting was convened in the may of.white was present at the meeting along with other air force officials.white repeated the criticisms of the qes program,arguing that the standards were being imposed too rigidly,were academically unsound,and were impossible to meet or,at least,too burdensome.white specifically identified the requirements pertaining to collection of statistical information,computer compatibility,and library resources.white concluded by relaying the threats of various institutions to withdraw from the qes program that he suggested would lead to a loss of educational opportunities for lower ranking airmen.although the standards were revised before issuance,the air force implemented the qes standards in october without responding to most of white concerns,and they remained in effect until.
because of white statements about qes,the air force lost confidence in white ability to support qes and reassigned him to a administrative officer position,without reduction in pay.at.after exhausting his administrative remedies,white filed an individual right of action with the board alleging retaliation for protected whistleblowing,in contravention of the whistleblower protection act of wpa,stat.the proceedings in this case,unfortunately,have been ongoing for more than a decade.
in,the administrative judge found that white disclosures were not protected and dismissed his appeal.at.the full board reversed and ruled that white disclosures were protected because the concerns he expressed were shared by a wide variety of educational institutions and other education service officers,and remanded for a determination of whether the disclosures were a contributing factor in his detail.white dep t of the air force,white i.on remand,the administrative judge found that white detail resulted from his disclosures on may and,and ordered the air force to return white to his prior position.at.
the agency then appealed the remand initial decision to the full board.in,the full board affirmed the remand initial decision under the law of the case doctrine.white dep t of the air force,white ii.in a subsequent proceeding to consider arguments raised by the office of personnel management opm as intervenor,the board in again affirmed its decision.white dep t of the air force,white iii.
opm then appealed to this court,which reversed the board decision and remanded for further proceedings.lachance white,white iv.we held that the board had applied an improper test for whether white had a reasonable belief that he uncovered gross mismanagement.id.at.we held that it was insufficient for white simply to demonstrate that others shared his views the board was required to conduct an objective review of the evidence as a disinterested observer.id.at.we stated that the proper test was whether a disinterested observer who had knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the disclosure evidenced gross mismanagement.id.at emphasis added.
on remand,the administrative judge received additional evidence.the administrative judge concluded that white reasonably believed his disclosures evidenced gross mismanagement because the evidence showed that management actions had created a substantial risk in may,that the providers of the educational services would leave the educational services program under the new standards of the qes.that would have had a significant adverse impact upon the agency ability to accomplish its educational services mission.at.the full board reversed.the board stated that,in its view,gross mismanagement is more than de minimis wrongdoing or negligence and does not include management decisions that are merely debatable.it must also include an element of blatancy.white v,at.the board found 
a disinterested observer in white position would have known that the agency wanted to improve the quality of education,that it formed a team to study and develop a way of meeting this aim,and that the team included agency educational employees and outside educational experts.a disinterested observer may have well concluded that the qes had shortcomings and that it may not have been the best process for achieving the agency goal.indeed,one of the agency officials who worked on the qes project testified that reasonable people disagreed about the qes process,and that some had concerns about the qes,and others did not.similarly,a deponent for white acknowledged that reasonable educational experts could disagree about the qes project.
id.at internal citations omitted.
the full board held that white had disclosed a debatable management decision regarding a policy matter,and,as such,he did not have a reasonable belief that he disclosed gross mismanagement.id.at.the board therefore reversed the initial decision and denied relief.white appeals to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the board decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule or regulation or unsupported by substantial evidence.c carreon office of pers.
petitioner first claims that the board improperly considered whether white disclosed gross mismanagement,rather than simply whether any belief about his disclosure was reasonable.according to petitioner,this board action improperly disregarded this court instructions in issuing the remand in white iv ignored the board own law of the case and deprived petitioner of due process of law.we conclude that none of these arguments has merit.
the core of petitioner argument is that this court remanded in white iv only for a review of the basis for a party beliefs as it relates to government misconduct,and,according to petitioner,it had already been determined that gross mismanagement existed.pet r br.at.petit
