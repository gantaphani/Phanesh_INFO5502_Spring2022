background 
audrey goodwin is a black female.she has worked for the university of illinois at since,first as a building service worker bsw and then as a bsw foreman.during the time period relevant to this lawsuit,goodwin supervisors included randy kornegay,the superintendent of building services,and kip mecum,the director of operations and transportation services.kornegay is a black male,and mecum is a white male.goodwin immediate supervisor was charles hassell,the assistant superintendent of the day shift.
from the time she was hired until,goodwin worked deep nights,first as a bsw and then as a bsw foreman.her supervisors,including kornegay and mecum,eventually promoted her to the day shift as foreman of the moving crew.goodwin claims that throughout her tenure at the university,her work record was before january claim that the defendants do not dispute on appeal.
the events leading to this lawsuit began on january,in goodwin office.goodwin office was located in the corner of a large space dedicated to the moving crew.it contained the time clock for the bsws,and,every day at the beginning and end of each shift,the bsws and the truck drivers who reported to goodwin would clock in and out there.near the end of her shift,goodwin was checking her while employees were waiting to clock out.the employees in the vicinity of goodwin desk were james gillin,elijah green,jack hall,jim mcconkey,donna rokos,and donald wisehart.goodwin opened an that had been sent to her university account.the contained an image of at least three women,each weighing over pounds,eating.their naked breasts were resting on a table.
goodwin claims that when she saw this,she made an involuntary exclamation in the nature of that so terrible she claims that she was then distracted by a phone call and left the image on the screen as she spoke on the telephone.as she was attending to business,she claims that the employees around her office,whose curiosity had been aroused by her exclamation,walked around her desk and looked at the image on her computer screen.
the defendants claim that goodwin involuntary exclamation was actually a comment intended to draw the employees attention to the image,and that she turned the computer screen around so that the employees could better view the picture.the defendants also claim that three of the employees,hall,rokos,and wisehart,heard goodwin comment that if her breasts were that big,she would cut them off.only one employee,rokos,claims to have been offended by the picture.
rokos reported the incident to ron burwell,a transportation foreman.both burwell and rokos had previously complained about goodwin in her capacity as a manager.burwell advised rokos to file a complaint against goodwin.the next day,rokos contacted goodwin immediate supervisor,charles hassell,and set up a meeting for the next day.
goodwin claims that hassell called her the day after the incident,january,and asked if she knew why rokos wanted to see him.goodwin claims that after thinking about what might have prompted rokos request,she told hassell about the incident.according to goodwin,she was honest about the contents of the,and after she finished telling hassell about the incident,he replied,that not so bad.hassell has testified that he does not recall this conversation.
hassell and rokos met as planned on january,and after the meeting,hassell discussed the incident with his supervisor,kornegay.kornegay and hassell decided that it would be necessary to conduct an investigation.
on january,goodwin met with hassell and tracy osby,the department public functions supervisor.during this meeting,goodwin admitted that she had received the vulgar,denied that she had invited others to look at it,and was given a paper with the heading etiquette.goodwin testified that hassell told her that he believed that she likely drew attention to the through an involuntary exclamation or gesture,and asked her to try to control her emotions better.goodwin also testified that at the end of that meeting,she asked,is that it and hassell replied,yes.goodwin claims that at the close of the meeting,she was under the impression that the matter had been resolved.
the defendants claim that on january,goodwin approached james gillin,one of the employees under her supervision who was present during the incident.they allege that goodwin asked gillin if he had seen the picture.when he responded that he had,goodwin allegedly told him that if he told supervisors that he had seen it,it would hurt him in the long run in trying to become a supervisor or foreman or anything.according to the defendants,gillin told rokos and another bsw,donald wisehart,about goodwin comment on the same day.
as part of their investigation into the incident,hassell,kornegay,and osby interviewed rokos,hall,gillin,green,and mcconkey regarding the incident on january.during her interview,rokos informed kornegay that she believed that goodwin had threatened gillin.kornegay asked gillin about these alleged threats during his interview.gillin agreed that goodwin had told him to deny that the incident occurred if he was interested in advancing within the department.
throughout the proceedings in this case,goodwin has denied mentioning the incident to gillin or threatening him in any way.she claims that gillin did not discuss any desire to be promoted with her until after january,and that even if he had,she would not have been in a position to make recommendations or decisions about promotions.she points out that by the time the alleged intimidation occurred,she had already voluntarily discussed what happened on january during the meeting on january with hassell and osby and,she claims,when hassell called her to discuss the reason that rokos had requested a meeting.in addition,she has testified that by the date that gillin alleges that she intimidated him,she believed that the entire matter had been resolved.she notes that gillin had already been disciplined for lying to supervisors at the time he made these accusations,and that gillin could not name the date of the alleged intimidation until he consulted with rokos and another personnel service employee.
goodwin claims that as part of hassell and kornegay investigation,hassell came to her office in early february to see if he could locate the vulgar in her computer deleted folder.goodwin alleges that hassell told her that it was rumored that she was trying to be more than what she was.she testified that she then asked hassell what she was doing wrong.she claims that hassell replied,people do like you because,historically,this is a white male position.you are a strong black female,and people do like that.you dress profession ally,you are strict and you enforce the rules,and people do like that.hassell testified that he does not remember making that statement and,in response to a leading question,testified that he would not make that kind of statement.
kornegay testified that he believed gillin intimidation accusation was credible.he initiated a meeting with goodwin.two meetings were held during the month of february.on march,kornegay signed and delivered to goodwin an intent to file notice of demotion.the same day,he placed goodwin on administrative leave with pay.on march,a civil service reconciliation meeting was held,but nevertheless,goodwin was demoted effective march.the reasons given for the demotion were abuse of authority,intimidation of an employee to withhold or misrepresent information,which creates a hostile work environment,and poor unbecoming a supervisor.
the parties dispute who was responsible for the decision to demote goodwin.all parties agree that kornegay was involved,but goodwin claims that kip mecum could have overridden kornegay decision.the defendants claim that kornegay was solely responsible for the demotion and that,although kornegay did consult mecum when deciding whether to demote goodwin,kornegay had the final authority in the matter.although neither party claims that hassell had the authority to demote goodwin,goodwin claims that hassell was integral to kornegay investigation and that he recommended that kornegay demote goodwin.
goodwin filed a grievance with the state university civil service system.a hearing officer conducted an administrative hearing on april.on may,the hearing officer issued his findings of fact.the hearing officer found that gillin intimidation claim was not credible,that goodwin had made an involuntary exclamation when she viewed the,and that the employees needed to walk around goodwin desk to view the image the hearing officer further stated that the incident had been blown totally out of proportion.on september,the university civil service merit board the merit board issued a final decision and order.the merit board determined that the university had failed to establish just cause for goodwin demotion and ordered that she be immediately reassigned to perform the duties of her former classification without loss of compensation.
goodwin was reinstated to bsw foreman by the end of september,and received the difference in pay between a bsw and a bsw foreman for the period of her demotion.although goodwin received her former title of bsw foreman,her position changed from foreman of the moving crew to foreman of the cleaning crew.her job was later reclassified as an office job,and she no longer directly supervises bsws.the defendants claim that the latter job switch was because the university was concerned that the union was targeting goodwin,and so she was moved for her own.goodwin complains that neither of the new job assignments provides the same opportunities for overtime pay as her old job she argues that she loses to per year in overtime pay.she also claims that the cleaning crew position was not as prestigious as the moving crew position.
the defendants have produced no evidence that any other employee has ever been disciplined for receiving personal or vulgar.goodwin has identified three employees whom she considers to be similarly situated to herself,and who had not received as severe a punishment for what she believes to be similar offenses.those employees,their offenses,and their punishments will be discussed below with more specificity.
in february,goodwin filed suit against the board of trustees of the university of illinois the university,kornegay,and mecum,alleging that the university had discriminated against her on the basis of her race and sex in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,title vii,and her age,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,and that mecum and kornegay had denied her right to equal protection of the law in violation of of the civil rights act of.the district court dismissed the age discrimination claim,finding it barred by the eleventh amendment,in august.that decision is not appealed.
at issue in this case is the district court july grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the title vii and claims.the district court reasoned that because goodwin had not alleged direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination,and had failed to indirectly prove discrimination using the method outlined in mcdonnell douglas green,d,the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.goodwin now appeals that decision,claiming that she has proven discrimination through direct or circumstantial evidence,and that she has also indirectly proven discrimination through the mcdonnell douglas indirect method.
ii.discussion 
mcdonnell douglas analysis 
in order to indirectly establish proof of discrimination in her title vii claim,goodwin must first establish the prima facie elements set out in mcdonnell douglas green,d.those elements are she is a member of a protected class she was performing her job satisfactorily she suffered an adverse employment action and similarly situated employees outside of her protected class were treated more favorably.traylor brown,cir.
if goodwin successfully establishes each element of the prima facie case,the burden shifts to the university to assert a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action.simmons chicago bd.of,cir.if it does so,the burden then shifts back to goodwin to present evidence that would allow the trier of fact to conclude that the university proffered reason is pretextual.id.this method can also be used to establish discrimination for the action against kornegay and mecum.friedel city of madison,cir citing am.nurses state of,cir yarbrough tower oldsmobile,cir ramsey am.air filter,cir.
the district court ruled that goodwin did not meet the fourth prong of the mcdonnell douglas test because she did not show a similarly situated individual outside of her protected class who was not disciplined as severely.although goodwin suggested three individuals that she believed satisfied this prong of the test,the district court found that each was distinguishable.
first,goodwin offered defendant mecum himself as a similarly situated employee.mecum admitted that he had received vulgar jokes on his university account.goodwin notes that he has never been demoted.we agree with the district court that mecum is not similarly situated to goodwin.mecum was in a more senior position,and thus did not deal with the same supervisor as goodwin.peele country mut.ins,cir quoting radue,cir see also adams stores,cir.assuming at this point that mecum was involved in the decision to demote goodwin,which we must since that is what goodwin herself alleges in her claim against him,goodwin can argue at best that mecum was hypocritical in not disciplining himself for similar conduct.
goodwin next suggests that charles elder,a white male bsw,is a similarly situated individual who was treated more favorably.elder was caught using university computers to access pornography on the internet.he received only a letter of warning for his conduct.the district court ruled that elder was not similarly situated because he was not a supervisor and had not been accused of showing the pornography to other.
goodwin cites this court opinion in ezell potter,cir,to support her position that elder is similarly situated.in that case,a postal worker who lost certified mail was deemed similarly situated to the plaintiff,who was accused of taking a long lunch hour.the panel dismissed the postal service claim that the plaintiff had not produced evidence to show that misplacing mail was a serious matter.the court reasoned,this is a curious claim from an entity whose primary business is delivering mail.misplacing certified mail,that is,mail that has been designated as especially important by its sender,would seem to be a serious matter w e may infer from the termination of another employee for merely delaying mail that losing mail would be a serious offense,at least as serious as taking a long lunch.ezell,at.
here,however,it is not so obvious that accessing pornography affected elder job performance that we may infer that it would be a serious offense.we believe that this case is distinguishable from ezell,as accessing pornography has nothing to do with the university primary business.the university could quite legitimately believe that allowing subordinate employees to see a vulgar image negatively affects job performance much more than accessing such an image in private.moreover,unlike ezell,the record does not reflect that another employee was terminated for a similar offense.like the district court,we also do not believe that elder and goodwin are similarly situated.
we are,however,persuaded that ray northway,the final employee that goodwin has proffered,is similarl
