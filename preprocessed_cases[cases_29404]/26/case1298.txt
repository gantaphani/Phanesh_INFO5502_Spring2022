in this case,a employee,with the employer approval,pursued an undergraduate degree at company expense.three years later,he sought postgraduate education.when the company denied funding,plaintiff brought suit claiming unlawful age discrimination.
this case does not involve any cause of action related to wrongful termination.instead,plaintiff raises two novel issues related to age discrimination in the furnishing of employee benefits.first,he contends that the california fair employment and housing act the feha,et prohibits an employer from discriminating on the basis of age in the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.second,he contends that an employer denial of educational assistance to an employee over the age of because of that employee age violates a fundamental policy against age discrimination in employment and is therefore a common law tort for which an employee may recover damages under our decisions in tameny atlantic richfield cal d,tameny and rojo kliger cal d,rojo.
after a thorough review of the relevant statutory provisions,we conclude,as did both the trial court and the court of appeal,that the feha prohibition against age discrimination in employment extends to hiring,discharging,suspension,and demotion,but not to the furnishing of employee benefits such as educational assistance.because the feha is the source of the fundamental public policy against age discrimination in employment,that public policy is subject to the substantive limits set by the feha.although as individuals we may applaud plaintiff efforts at through education,as judges we find nothing in either statutory or common law that obliges employers to ignore an employee age in deciding whether to fund such efforts.
in february,union oil company of california unocal hired plaintiff dan esberg,then years old,as a telecommunications specialist.in,supervisor jeff winston told a group of employees,including plaintiff,that any of them who had not received an undergraduate degree should obtain one.plaintiff did not have a college degree at that time.manager nellis freeman explained that through its educational aid program,unocal would reimburse plaintiff tuition and other costs for each undergraduate course as plaintiff completed it.plaintiff obtained approval for educational aid and enrolled in the bachelor of science program at the university of redlands.unocal eventually paid all the expenses that plaintiff incurred in obtaining his undergraduate degree.
in early,plaintiff and coworker john marble discussed the advantages of obtaining a master of business administration mba degree from the university of redlands.in may,plaintiff told his immediate supervisor,walter aldrich,that he and marble were planning to enroll in the mba program and to fund the expenses through unocal education aid program.aldrich response was you too old to invest in.plaintiff was then years old.in august,unocal formally denied funding for plaintiff proposed graduate degree.unocal granted educational aid for the mba program to three younger employees,including the marble.
in,plaintiff filed a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh based on unocal refusal to fund an advanced degree for plaintiff because of his age.the dfeh chose not to prosecute plaintiff case,but it gave him a right to sue letter that authorized him to file a private action in court.after plaintiff received the letter,he brought this action against unocal.plaintiff complaint alleged,among other things,breach of contract,age discrimination in violation of the feha,and denial of benefits in violation of fundamental public policy.
after trial of the merits of plaintiff complaint,the jury returned a special verdict finding that unocal had wrongfully denied plaintiff educational assistance benefits for the mba program because of his age.the jury also found that unocal breached an agreement it had with plaintiff that it would not discriminate because of age.the jury awarded plaintiff in noneconomic damages and in economic damages.
unocal moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,contending that denial of an employment benefit such as educational assistance violated neither the feha nor the fundamental public policy against age discrimination in employment.the trial court agreed and set aside the jury award of noneconomic damages.because plaintiff had prevailed on his contract claim,the trial court entered judgment awarding plaintiff in economic damages.
plaintiff appealed,alleging that unocal refusal to reimburse him for the costs of obtaining a master degree violated the feha prohibition against age discrimination in employment,and that public policy supported a common law tort claim for denial of employment benefits based on age.the court of appeal rejected these contentions and affirmed the trial court judgment.we granted plaintiff petition for review.
