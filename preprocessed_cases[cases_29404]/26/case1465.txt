ii.demurrer of lake tahoe unified school district 
the bassetts theory of the district liability was that the district had designated a dangerous location for its schoolbus stop.the third amended complaint alleged that the intersection at street and eloise avenue had no traffic control signs.this absence together with the presence of such signs on nearby streets and highways prompted local motorists to use street as a shortcut to highway at unsafe speeds.there was an just before the intersection that distracted drivers and discouraged them from focusing on the intersection it positioned them so their line of sight of the intersection was obscured by trees.the presence of a residential structure also obscured the line of sight,making it difficult to discern the intersection ahead,and distracted drivers,making it difficult or impossible to see pedestrians in or near the intersection.the presence of a pathway encouraged pedestrians to use the portion of the intersection at a location where it was difficult for motorists to see them.the district designation of a schoolbus pickup point where the pathway meets the intersection encouraged and enticed students to use the intersection at a point where it was difficult for drivers to see pedestrians.
the trial court sustained the district demurrer without leave to amend on the basis that there was no evidence the district owned or controlled the bus stop and the district had immunity under education code section.
the liability of public entities is entirely statutory,subd.a.city of huntington beach petersen law firm th,d.the bassetts rely on government code section,which provides that a public entity may be liable for an injury caused by the dangerous condition of its property,e xcept as provided by statute.a dangerous condition is one that creates a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property is used with due care in a reasonably foreseeable manner,subd.a.
the public property itself need not be dangerous hazards present on adjoining property may create a dangerous condition of public property when users of the public property are necessarily exposed to those risks.bonanno central contra costa transit authority cal th,d.for example,users of a model airplane park were at risk from power lines on adjacent property in branzel city of concord d,and users of a public street were at risk from a railroad in holmes city of oakland d.
the bassetts contend the location of the bus stop,adjacent to a dangerous intersection,constituted a dangerous condition of public property,citing bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th,d.in bonanno,the plaintiff was seriously injured when she stepped into a crosswalk on her way to a bus stop.the supreme court held the location of a bus stop may be a dangerous condition of public property.id.at,d.the transit authority owned and controlled the stop because it had authority to remove it,even though the county could veto the location of any bus stop.id.at,and fn,d.that plaintiff was injured on adjacent property that the transit authority did not own or control did not eliminate the transit authority liability.the location of the bus stop caused users to be at risk from the adjacent dangerous intersection and plaintiff was using the bus stop when she crossed the street to reach it.id.at,d.
liability under government code section applies only where the public entity owns or controls the property,subd.c.the district argues,and the trial court found,that the district did not own or control the bus stop.the district apparently established,through judicial notice,that it did not own the crosswalk or the property on which the bus stop was located,but that is not the issue.the district superintendent has authority to designate the location of the schoolbus stop,tit,a.that power may be sufficient to constitute ownership or control of the bus stop for purposes of government code sections and.see bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th at,d,determining transit authority owned and controlled its own bus stop when it had power,subject to county ve
