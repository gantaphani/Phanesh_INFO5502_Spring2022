this case arises from the difficult transition of christopher van duyn van duyn,a severely autistic child,from elementary to middle school.van duyn alleges that baker school district district failed to implement key portions of his individualized educational program iep during the school year,his first year at baker middle school,thereby depriving him of the free appropriate public education guaranteed by the federal individuals with disabilities education act idea,et an administrative law judge alj ruled that the district failed to provide van duyn sufficient math instruction,but otherwise found that the district had adequately implemented the iep.the district court affirmed the alj decision in all respects and declined to award any attorney fees to van duyn.
van duyn brings to us a detailed list of complaints about the district variances from his iep,arguing that the alj and district court were much too forgiving of the district failures to provide him the special instructional and support services agreed to in the iep.accordingly,we must decide how much leeway a school district has in implementing an iep as it translates the plan provisions into action at school and in the classroom.we hold that when a school district does not perform exactly as called for by the iep,the district does not violate the idea unless it is shown to have materially failed to implement the child iep.a material failure occurs when the services provided to a disabled child fall significantly short of those required by the iep.
applying this standard to the various implementation failures van duyn alleges,we conclude that none of them was material with the exception of the math instruction shortfall,which was later remedied in response to the alj order,and that the district therefore did not violate the idea.because van duyn did partially prevail,however,we hold that van duyn is to that extent entitled to reasonable attorney fees for the relevant work done at the administrative hearing not for van duyn mother,who has acted as one of his attorneys in these proceedings.accordingly,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
factual history 
van duyn is a severely autistic boy who was years old during the school year.during the three years prior to,van duyn was a student at south baker elementary school,where he received extensive special education services.on february,a team comprised of teachers,district representatives and van duyn mother finalized a comprehensive iep for the school year,during which van duyn would transition to baker middle school.
van duyn iep called for him to work on language and written work for hours per week,math computer drills for hours per week and adaptive and swimming for hours per week.at the middle school,his schedule consisted of alternating red and white days,with gym,language,math and study skills on red days,and social arts,language arts and reading on white days.classes each lasted for about minutes,and he worked on math skills during his designated red day math classes as well as during his advisory time and study skills and classes.van duyn attended gym class,which included a gymnastics segment,on red days,and had swimming lessons twice per week.
van duyn iep also included a behavior management plan that was to be implemented.like the elementary school that he had previously attended,the middle school employed a daily behavior card,a visual schedule,social stories and a quiet room.however,his behavior was not accurately recorded on the card,he did not set up his daily schedule before starting each school day,social stories were not properly used and he was not ordered to go to the quiet room after all incidents of misbehavior.
the iep further called for all material to be presented at van duyn level and for him to be placed in a special education room.during class,he typically received instruction from his personal aide,linda baxter,as well as some personal instruction from his two main teachers,sue irby and kathleen walker.it is unclear whether he generally proceeded at his own pace or instead received instruction about whatever subject the class was studying that day.his classes varied in size from to students and were composed entirely of special education students.
other provisions in the iep required the regional autism specialist to visit the middle school twice per week,augmentative communication services to be provided for two hours per month and van duyn aide,baxter,to receive state autism training.the regional autism consultant visited the middle school a dozen times over the first three months of the school year,and other autism consultants also came by with some regularity.augmentative communication services were provided to van duyn in the form of visual aids,social stories,creative computer programs and other learning tools,though not by regional staff.his aide,baxter,did not receive training in educating autistic children,but she did attend local autism classes and meet with individuals who had worked with him in the past.
finally,under the iep,van duyn progress was to be measured by quarterly report cards,and approximately objectives corresponding to a series of annual goals were to be pursued.the middle school issued quarterly report cards to van duyn containing percentage scores in a range of categories.some of these categories corresponded to the iep goals while others did not,and on the whole the middle school report cards did not track the iep as well as the elementary school report cards did.van duyn also worked toward many but not all of the objectives set out in the iep.for example,he did not participate in any telephone activities or write a daily note home until december.
there is evidence that van duyn reading skills deteriorated during the school year,though it is unclear whether the regression amounted to three years or less than one.however,the school therapist and psychologist both testified that his behavior improved in and that he was more engaged with his surroundings as the year progressed.walker also testified that van duyn math skills showed progress in.finally,his report cards indicated improvement in the vast majority of categories from october to june.
procedural history 
on september,a few weeks after the school year had begun,van duyn parents filed a request for a due process hearing pursuant to f.they alleged that the district had completely failed to provide certain services described in the iep and materially failed to implement other iep provisions.according to his parents,these failures were depriving van duyn of a free appropriate public education.the alj issued a detailed decision on april.she found that the district had failed to implement the iep with regard to van duyn math goals because he was not being given the requisite hours of weekly math instruction.accordingly,the alj ordered the district to provide van duyn with the average of five hours per week of instruction in math that he has not been receiving.in every other contested area,the alj ruled in favor of the district.she found that van duyn aide and teachers had been properly trained,that he had been placed in a classroom,that his teachers had worked with him on oral language skills,that he had received daily instruction in reading and that objectives such as taking a daily note home had not initially been implemented but were now being followed.
van duyn appealed the alj decision to the district court.the court first ruled that only events prior to february,the date of the administrative hearing could be used to determine whether the district failed to implement the iep,though later events could be considered in crafting a remedy.the court then divided van duyn allegations of failed implementation into several categories,affording the alj comprehensive findings considerable deference.the court concluded that there had been no failure to implement a substantial provision of the iep.the court also ruled that the district had complied with the alj order that additional math instruction be provided to van duyn,and that van duyn was not entitled to attorney fees because he was not the prevailing party.
van duyn timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.

iii.discussion 
legal background 
the idea was enacted in because of congress belief that the educational needs of millions of children with disabilities were not being fully met.c.the statute stated purposes include to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further educational,employment,and independent living,and to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.d a,b.according to senator harrison williams,the idea principal drafter,t his measure fulfills the promise of the constitution that handicapped children no longer will be left out.cong.rec.
one of the idea most important mechanisms for achieving these lofty goals is the formulation and implementation of ieps.under d,every disabled child must have an iep drafted and put into effect by the local educational authority.the iep is to be formulated by a team that includes the child parents,regular and special education teachers,a district representative and other individuals with relevant expertise.d b.it must address such matters as the child present level of academic achievement,annual goals for the child,how progress toward those goals is to be measured and the services to be provided to the child.d a i.the child parents are entitled to participate in meetings regarding the iep,b,and must receive written notice of any proposed changes to the iep,b.either the child parents or the local educational authority may bring a complaint to the state educational agency about any matter relating to the iep or the child free appropriate public education.b.if such a complaint is not otherwise resolved,a due process hearing is held to determine whether the child received a free appropriate public education.f e i.after going through the due process hearing and any other available administrative remedies,an aggrieved party may file a civil action in federal district court.i a.
the supreme court first and most significant opinion interpreting the idea was its decision in rowley,in which the court considered the content of an iep that was allegedly deficient because it did not call for a interpreter to assist the deaf child in all of her classes.the court rejected this challenge,concluding that all of the idea procedural requirements had been followed and that the statute did not aim to maximize the potential of each handicapped child but rather merely to provide them with access to a free public education.at.emphasis added.the court also set out a test for evaluating complaints about the content of an iep first,has the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and second,is the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits id.at.internal footnotes omitted.
we have applied the rowley framework in numerous cases.see,federal way sch,cir amanda,at wartenberg,at.however,we have not previously considered challenges to the opposed to the an iep.as discussed in more detail below,the fifth circuit addressed iep implementation challenges in houston indep.sch.dist.bobby,cir,holding that de minimis failures to implement an iep do not amount to a violation of the idea,but rather that the statute is violated only by failures to implement substantial or significant iep provisions.id.at.the eighth circuit took a similar position in neosho sch.dist.clark,cir,holding that the idea is violated when a school fails to implement an essential element of an iep,an element necessary for the child to receive an educational benefit.id.at.
violations of the idea procedural requirements 
against this background,we turn to van duyn argument that the district alleged failures to implement his iep amounted to both a violation of the idea procedural requirements and a substantive violation that denied him a free appropriate public education.we conclude there were neither procedural nor substantive violations of the statute.
van duyn first contention is that by failing to implement portions of the iep,the district changed the iep without notifying his parents in violation of the idea procedural requirements for the formulation and revision of ieps.see b.in his view,this procedural defect impeded his parents right to participate in decisions regarding the iep and hence violated the statute even if he can not directly establish that he was deprived of educational benefits or a free appropriate public education.see f e ii ii idea violated if procedural flaws significantly impede the parents opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents child.
van duyn procedural argument fails because there is no evidence in the record that the district ever attempted to change his iep after the school year began.he points to no concrete proposals to change the iep,nor is there any testimony or documentary evidence that the district decided to revise the iep in secret.the district did request a m eeting to discuss augmentative communication and autism service time in may.but van duyn parents were notified about the meeting,it took place well before the school year started and it resulted in no change to the iep because the iep team decided that t ransitioning to a new school and teachers is a major change for an autistic student and more services are needed.
van duyn procedural argument thus boils down to the novel proposition that failures to implement an iep are equivalent to changes to an iep.if accepted,this proposition would convert all iep implementation failures into procedural violations of the idea,but there is no indication that a conflation of this sort is intended or permitted by the statute.moreover,the one case that van duyn cites as support,an unpublished maryland district court decision,is unhelpful to him.manalansan board of educ.of baltimore city,no.civ.amd,wl,unpublished,held that the baltimore educational authority violated the idea because of substantive failures in implementing an because of any procedural shortcomings in the iep formulation or implementation.see wl,at free appropriate public education denied because the only rational determination is that defendants have failed to implement brandon iep.like all other courts to have considered the relationship between iep implementation failures and idea procedural violations,manalansan understood the tardiness and absences of the plaintiff aides as failures to implement the iep,not surreptitious attempts to alter it.
failures to implement the iep 
we therefore turn to van duyn principal the district in fact failed to implement portions of his iep.in addressing his argument,we hold that the alj did not erroneously allocate the burden of proof at the administrative hearing,that state contract law does not apply to the interpretation of an iep and that only material failures to implement an iep constitute violations of the idea.applying this standard,we conclude that none of the implementation failures that van duyn alleges was material.
burden of proof 
van duyn argues that the alj erroneously placed the burden of proof on him to establish that the district failed to implement the iep.although the alj never specified which party bore the burden,even if she did place the burden on van duyn,doing so was proper under schaffer weast,d.the supreme court held in schaffer that t he burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an iep is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.id.at.van duyn,as the party objecting to the iep implementation,thus bore the burden of proof at the administrative hearing.
van duyn contends that schaffer is inapplicable because it dealt with a challenge to the content rather than the implementation of an iep,but that is a distinction without a difference.nothing in schaffer hinged on the kind of challenge being made to the iep.rather,the court cited the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims,holding that a bsent some reason to believe that congress intended otherwise,we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls,upon the party seeking relief.id.at see also stringer james sch,cir following schaffer in context of claim that iep was not being implemented.neither schaffer nor the text of the idea supports imposing a different burden in iep implementation cases than in formulation cases.accordingly,we hold that if the alj placed the burden of proof on van duyn,that allocation was correct 
interpretation of the iep 
van duyn next argues that contested terms in the iep should be interpreted under oregon contract law,in particular the principle that ambiguities must be resolved in van duyn favor because the document was drafted by the district for his benefit.this argument,raised for the first time on appeal,is meritless.first,the iep is entirely a federal statutory creation,and courts have rejected efforts to frame challenges to ieps as claims.see,city of south portland,d,a n iep is not a legally binding contract.van duyn offers no example of a court treating an iep as a contract,nor have we been able to locate any.
second,even if the principle that ambiguous terms are interpreted against the drafting party applied,it would not help van duyn.his parents played a central role in the drafting of the iep,so it is unclear who the iep author is for contract law purposes.in addition,the terms van duyn cites as ambiguous simply do not mean what he claims,even taking the favorable contract law principle into account.in our view,van duyn real objection is not to the ambiguity of the iep terms but rather to its omission of additional requirements for the district.this is not a problem we can solve.an iep is not a even if it were,we could not read into it additional terms the parties did not agree to include.
the materiality standard 
the core of van duyn case is his allegation that the district failed to implement his iep.because most idea cases involve the formulation rather than the implementation of an iep,our court has not yet articulated the standard for assessing an iep implementation.to determine this standard,we look to both the statutory text and decisions of other courts.
the idea defines a free appropriate public education as special education and related services that are provided in conformity with the child individualized education program.the statute also allows a party to challenge an iep because of procedural flaws in the iep formulation as well as on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.f e i.this language surely indicates that a failure to implement an iep may deny a child a free appropriate public education and thereby give rise to a claim under the statute.the language also counsels against making minor implementation failures actionable given that special education and related services need only be provided in conformity with the iep.there is no statutory requirement of perfect adherence to the iep,nor any reason rooted in the statutory text to view minor implementation failures as denials of a free appropriate public education.
as noted earlier,the supreme court in rowley was faced with a challenge to an iep content.nevertheless,the court approach is instructive in the iep implementation context as well.in particular,it is significant that,according to the court,procedural flaws in an iep formulation do not automatically violate the idea,but rather do so only when the resulting iep is not reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.at.this suggests that minor failures in implementing an iep,just like minor failures in following the idea procedural requirements,should not automatically be treated as violations of the statute.the court description of the idea purpose as providing a basic floor of opportunity to disabled students rather than a education also supports granting some flexibility to school districts charged with implementing ieps.id.at.
the two circuits to have explicitly addressed iep implementation failures both did so in a manner consistent with our reading of the statutory text and rowley.in bobby,the fifth circuit considered a disabled child whose iep had not been perfectly implemented and whose academic performance had improved in some areas and declined in others.the court held that to prevail on a claim under the idea,a party challenging the implementation of an iep must show more than a de minimis failure to implement all elements of that iep,and,instead,must demonstrate that the school board or other authorities failed to implement substantial or significant provisions of the iep.at.employing this standard,the court concluded that conceded implementation failures did not violate the idea because the significant provisions of the child iep were followed,and,as a result,he received an educational benefit.id 
similarly,the eighth circuit held in clark that the idea is violated if there is evidence that the school actually failed to implement an essential element of the iep that was necessary for the child to receive an educational benefit.at.to determine if the fact that no cohesive plan was in place to meet the child behavioral needs gave rise to a statutory violation,the court considered both the shortfall in services provided and evidence regarding the child progress in several areas.id.at.the court concluded that the idea was indeed violated because the actions taken by the school did not appropriately address the child behavior problem,id.at,and any slight benefit obtained was lost due to behavior problems that went unchecked and interfered with the child ability to obtain a benefit from his education.id.
in accordance with the idea itself,the court decision in rowley and the decisions of our sister circuits,we hold that a material failure to implement an iep violates the idea.a material failure occurs when the services a school provides to a disabled child fall significantly short of the services required by the child iep.minor discrepancies between the services provided and the services called for by the iep do not give rise to an idea violation.
because the parties debate whether van duyn skills and behavior improved or deteriorated during the school year,we clarify that the materiality standard does not require that the child suffer demonstrable educational harm in order to prevail.however,the child educational progress,or lack of it,may be probative of whether there has been a significant shortfall in the services provided.for instance,if the child is not provided the reading instruction called for and there is a shortfall in the child reading achievement,that would certainly tend to show that the failure to implement the iep was material.on the other hand,if the child performed at or above the anticipated level,that would tend to show that the shortfall in instruction was not material 
implementation of the iep 
applying the standard for evaluating alleged iep implementation failures here,we turn to the various areas in which van duyn asserts that the district failed to implement his iep.because both the alj and the district court have already considered at length van duyn alleged implementation because we largely agree with their focus on what we understand to be van duyn weightiest claims that he did not receive sufficient math instruction,that his behavior management plan was not implemented properly,that work was not presented at his level and that he was not placed in a classroom 
first,van duyn iep required hours of math instruction per week.the alj found that he was not being provided with sufficient instruction and therefore ordered that he receive the five hours per week of instruction in math that he has not been receiving.we agree that the initial shortfall was a material implementation failure.van duyn now claims that only minutes of math instruction per week were added in response to the alj order and that the district was thus still not in compliance with the iep.however,he makes no effort to rebut the testimony to the contrary by walker,who taught three of van duyn eight classes,and irby,his other main teacher.walker testified that van duyn worked on math in two red day classes,one white day class and his advisory time,and therefore received the requisite math instruction.similarly,irby testified that van duyn used math computer programs in her classes for roughly minutes per week.we therefore hold that after the district corrective actions,there was no material failure to provide van duyn with the required amount of weekly math instruction 
second,van duyn is correct that several elements of his behavior management plan were not implemented in the same way at the middle school as at the elementary school.the daily behavior card was not used as strictly as it was before.social stories were never employed in walker three classes and were improperly used by baxter and irby.and van duyn was not told to go to the quiet room after all incidents of misbehavior,nor was the room adequately equipped until just before the administrative hearing.
although we do not condone these failures to implement the behavior management plan,we conclude that they were not material for several reasons.first,the iep did not clearly describe how the daily behavior card,social stories and quiet room were used at the elementary school,nor did it require that they be used in the same way at the middle school.it is undisputed that the behavior management plan was not implemented identically at the two schools,but the iep did not say that it had to be.second,the middle school did employ many of the techniques outlined in the behavior management plan,even if not quite as van duyn envisioned.third,there is evidence that the elementary school behavior management plan was inappropriate for the middle school context.van duyn former aide testified that i t looks to me like the system that we used at south baker does work at the middle school,and so it not being used the same.finally,van duyn behavior appears to have improved in.the school speech therapist stated that while in the previous reports it mentioned that chris does notice others in his environment,t he following year we see that chris does notice others in his environment and is engaging more.the school psychologist added that van duyn was being sent to the quiet room only about once per month at the middle school,a much lower rate than at the elementary school.
next,there is some ambiguity in the record about whether,as required by the iep,work was presented at van duyn level.on the one hand,baxter testified that what van duyn would learn about on any given day depended on what the class was taught that day.on the other hand,his two main teachers,walker and irby,testified that he was never subjected to teaching and generally received instruction.walker described filter ing around to the students while irby stated that van duyn instruction was largely with her or the assistant.on this conflicting record,we can not conclude that the district materially failed to present work at van duyn level.we also note that there is no evidence that his educational progress was hindered as a result of exposure to materials that were too advanced for him.
finally,the parties dispute the meaning of sp ecial ed ucation room and whether van duyn was provided with such placement.he contends that his iep required a learning environment like the one he enjoyed at the elementary school,with a single classroom where highly disabled students receive instruction individually or in small groups and there is complete flexibility as to the timing and content of instruction.see ash lake oswego sch.dist,classroom contains students with one teacher and two aides.the district,however,asserts that a classroom is a service rather than a placement,and exists whenever a student spends more than percent of his time in a special education classroom.
even under van duyn definition,which appears nowhere in the iep and is at odds with oregon practice as well as the testimony of one of his own witnesses,we hold that the district did not materially fail to provide him with a classroom.his class sizes varied from to students a range with an almost identical midpoint to the range cited in ash,and there were always one teacher and one aide present comparable to the one teacher and two aides in ash.whereas the ratio was somewhat higher in the middle school than in ash,it is significant that baxter was van duyn personal aide.there is no indication that the two aides in ash were specifically designated for individual students.
furthermore,there was substantial flexibility in the instruction that van duyn received at the middle school.while he was on a block schedule with set times for classes,he could take breaks whenever they were necessary,he received constant attention from baxter and frequent instruction from walker and irby and the projects he worked on were typically unrelated to his classes nominal subject matter.this may not have been quite as beneficial a learning environment as the elementary school,but we can not conclude that it constituted a material failure to provide van duyn with a classroom.
we therefore hold that the district did not materially fail to implement any provisions in van duyn iep with the exception of the math instruction requirement,which we hold was satisfied after the alj order.
attorney fees 
van duyn requests two remedies from this court compensatory education and attorney fees.no compensatory education is warranted because he has failed to establish any material failure by the district in implementing his iep.contrary to the district court,however,we hold that van duyn is entitled to reasonable attorney fees for the administrative hearing to the extent he partially prevailed in that proceeding,but only for counsel other than his.
under the idea,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorney fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.i b i emphasis added.a prevailing party is one who succeed s on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit.parents of student puyallup sch,cir internal quotation omitted.the success must materially alter the parties legal relationship,can not be de minimis and must be causally linked to the litigation brought.see also park anaheim union high sch,cir.
under this standard,van duyn was not the prevailing party at the district court level because that court affirmed the alj decision in its entirety and refused to grant him any additional relief.van duyn also was not the prevailing party in his challenge to his iep before the oregon department of education because the department did not revisit the contested iep but rather ordered the parties to work together to formulate a new iep for the school year.nor,of course,is he the prevailing party here.
we hold,however,that van duyn was the prevailing party at the administrative hearing to the extent the alj ruled in his favor regarding the amount of math instruction he was due.the amoun
