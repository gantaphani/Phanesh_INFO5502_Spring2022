plaintiff stephen hoschler appeals from a judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate,which sought his reinstatement as a teacher for defendant sacramento city unified school district the district.
the central issue in this case is whether the district gave hoschler timely notice of his nonreelection as a teacher for the term under education code section section provides that an employee on probationary status is deemed to have been reelected for the next succeeding school year unless the district notif ies him by march of its decision not to retain him.the statute does not prescribe how such notice shall be given.here,the district sent a notice of nonretention to hoschler by certified mail on march,but he did not receive actual notice until weeks later.
the trial court ruled that sending the notice by certified mail complied with section,even though the statute does not prescribe certified mail as an acceptable method of notice.hoschler argues that the decision contravenes the settled principle that,where a statute is silent as to the method of notice,personal notice is required.we agree with hoschler and shall reverse the judgment.
factual background 
the facts are undisputed.in,hoschler worked during the school year as a university intern for the district while obtaining an intern credential from the california commission on teacher credentialing.after obtaining his teaching credential,he taught during the school year under a written contract.he began his second credentialed year in as a probationary teacher.
on march,all further calendar references are to that year,the district board of education decided that hoschler would not be reelected for the school year.on march,the district claims it mailed hoschler a notice of probationary release,informing him of its decision not to reelect him for the following school year.the notice was sent by certified mail,with a return receipt fee of indicated by the district hoschler claims he did not receive the letter from the district and did not see the notice until may,when he received a copy of it from his attorney.it was undisputed that hoschler did not willfully refuse to pick up his mail.
on august,hoschler filed a petition for a writ of mandate,requesting that the trial court declare him reelected for the school year because he did not receive timely notice of his nonreelection.following a nonevidentiary hearing,the trial court denied the petition.the trial court reasoned that since the education code consistently provided for notice by certified mail in other statutes dealing with teacher nonretention and dismissal,section must also be so construed 
discussion 
general principles 
where,as here,there is no factual dispute and the trial court decision turns solely upon a question of law,the standard of review on appeal is de novo.conway city of imperial beach th,d conway.
interpretation of a statute presents a question of law.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d,california ins.guarantee liemsakul d.the trial court application of an interpreted statute to undisputed facts is also subject to our independent review.conway,supra,th at,d.
our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.white ultramar,cal th,d.we begin our inquiry by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.in doing so,however,we do not consider the statutory language in isolation.citation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision citation.that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute people mendoza cal th,d.
ii.section and the requirement of notice 
under the education code,for the first two years of his employment,a certificated teacher in a large school district or more students is a probationary employee and serves at the pleasure of the district.as long as it notifies the teacher by march of the second year of his employment of its decision not to rehire him for the next year,the district may release him at its complete discretion,without any showing of cause,without any statement of reasons,and without any right of appeal or administrative redress.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d,kavanaugh,quoting bellflower education bellflower unified school dist.d.accord,summerfield windsor unified school dist.th,d.however,if a teacher is not so notified,he is deemed reelected for the third year and achieves permanent status tenure,subd.b see grimsley board of trustees d.
the controlling statute,section,subdivision b,provides in relevant part every employee of a school district of any type or class having an average daily attendance of or more who,after having been employed by the district for two complete consecutive school years in a position or positions requiring certification qualifications,is reelected for the next succeeding school year to a position requiring certification qualifications shall,at the commencement of the succeeding school year be classified as and become a permanent employee of the district.the governing board shall notify the employee,on or before march of the employee second complete consecutive school year of employment by the district in a position or positions requiring certification qualifications,of the decision to reelect or not reelect the employee for the next succeeding school year to the position.in the event that the governing board does not give notice pursuant to this section on or before march,the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.stats,ch,italics added.
section is silent as to a method of giving the required notice.under settled principles of statutory construction,a statute requiring that a notice shall be given,but which is silent as to the manner of giving such notice,contemplates personal service thereof.long chronicle pub,long accord,see johnson barreiro d,johnson,cited with approval in simpson city of los angeles cal d,smith smith d.as the court noted in long it may be broadly stated that where a statute or contract requires the giving of notice,and there is nothing in the context,or in the circumstances of the case,to show that any other form of notice was intended,personal notice will be required.citation.this is true because the law always favors a personal notice,and countenances substituted and constructive notices as matters of necessity or extreme expediency.long,supra,at,quoting stockton automobile confer cal,italics omitted.
since the district claims it sent notice of hoschler nonretention by certified mail,and the evidence is undisputed that he did not receive the notice until well after march,the notice of nonrenewal was untimely.johnson,supra,d at,where statute does not prescribe method of service,notice served by mail not effective until received.although there is no california teacher case directly on point,decisions applying analogous education statutes on similar facts,have so held.see,school dist.barber,school dist.norwood,weckerly mona shores bd.of education,kiel green local sch.dist.bd.of educ.ohio.
iii.the district reliance on gilliam 
the district cites gilliam moreno valley unified school dist.th,d gilliam to support its argument that,despite its silence on the method of notice,we should read into section a provision that certified mail service by the march deadline is effective.
in gilliam,the plaintiff was a probationary employee of a district that mailed him a notice on march,that he would not be reelected for the school year.the plaintiff claimed that section did not apply because he was transferred to a lateral position.the court of appeal rejected the plaintiff argument that his termination was controlled by a different statute under the general versus specific rule of statutory construction.accepting at face value the trial court finding that the plaintiff was properly noticed of his nonreelection,the appellate court affirmed the judgment.gilliam,supra,th at,d.
gilliam thus had no occasion to consider whether service by mail was sufficient compliance with the notice requirement because the plaintiff never disputed that he was notified before the statutory deadline set forth in section.the plaintiff might well have received actual notice prior to march,which would have dispensed of the need for personal service.see shearman jorgensen cal,admission of receipt by mail is tantamount to personal service.
opinions are not authority for issues they do not consider.stoll shuff th,d palmer ted stevens honda,d.consequently,gilliam does not help the district position 
iv.the trial court rationale 
the trial court ruled that a certified mail method of giving notice must be read into section because it is featured as an optional method of notice in other education code statutes dealing with teacher nonretention and dismissal.the court agreed the question was close and that the legislative history of the statute was not helpful at all.the court nevertheless ruled against hoschler in a written decision from which we quote in pertinent part i n the context of the service requirements for other notices of actions affecting the employment of certificated employees under the education code,the court concluded that actual notice to hoschler of his by personal service or other method was not required.the education code consistently provides for the service of notices of dismissal,suspension,and reduction in numbers by either personal service or registered mail.see.service by registered or certified mail is expressly authorized even with respect to tenured teachers having procedural due process rights to continued employment.in this context,a requirement for personal service and actual notice can not reasonably be implied in subdivision b of section for the notice of given to probationary employees like hoschler.
we observe at the outset that hoschler was not asking the trial court to imply a requirement of personal service in section,any more than the district was asking the court to imply a provision that certified mail notice is sufficient.the statute requires the district to give notice,but is silent as to the method.when the meaning of a statute is not clear from the plain meaning of the words used,we turn to a variety of aids including rules of statutory construction,with the objective of determining the intent of the legislature.santa ana unified school dist.orange county development agency th,d.
here,the statute is silent on the method of notice.under accepted canons of statutory interpretation,where a statute does not prescribe the method of notice,personal service is contemplated.thus,unless a different purpose is found within the statutory scheme to justify an exception,the presumption of the personal service method of notice applies.
the trial court found justification for reading a certified mail method of notice into section because t he education code consistently provides for the service of notices of dismissal,suspension,and reduction in numbers by either personal service or registered mail.see.italics added.
however,as the accompanying chart shows appendix a,post,the statutory scheme is anything but consistent on methods of service.while the sections cited by the trial court do,in fact,authorize service by either personal or certified mail,other sections dealing with dismissals or nonretention of employees,and,as well as section,do not.furthermore,because some of these statutes feature an service provision and some do not,it is clear the legislature knows exactly how to provide for alternative methods of notice when it so intends.see kavanaugh,supra,cal th at,d.in any event,the trial court premise that the education code consistently provides for certified mail notice is incorrect.the failure to provide a method of notice in section is not aberrational it is repeated in a number of statutes dealing with nonretention of teachers.hence,the court rationale of harmoniz ing section with other education code notice statutes,can not be justified.
the trial court also reasoned that,since the legislature enacted other education code sections giving school districts the option to use the certified mail method of notice for teachers who are subject to dismissal only for cause and enjoy due process procedural rights,it could not possibly have intended a more onerous personal service requirement for probationary teachers,who have no recourse whatsoever once a district informs them their services are no longer necessary.
this logic is not persuasive.since a probationary teacher has no procedural due process rights under section,notification of his nonreelection is the end of the line for that teacher.one of the primary purposes for requiring that probationary employees be given timely notice of a decision not to retain them is so that they can make alternate plans,apply for other jobs,and have time to relocate if necessary.
on the other hand,in cases where a teacher does enjoy procedural due process rights,a district notice is not the end of the line,but the beginning of a process,which may or may not lead to the loss of his job.the legislature could well have believed that personal notice by march should be given to probationary employees who have no procedural recourse,since it is essential they have actual knowledge of a district decision early enough to prepare for the future.the fact that three of the four statutes not specifying a method of notice pertain to the nonretention of employees without procedural recourse see appendix a,supports this conclusion.
the circuitous history of probationary dismissal statutes also supports the inference that the legislature failure to insert an option for certified mail service in section was deliberate.
under early provisions relating to the hiring and dismissal of teachers,all teachers were subject to annual hiring decisions.school districts exercised absolute discretion in making those decisions.former pol.code,as added by stats,ch.later,distinctions were made between permanent employees,who enjoyed tenure and could only be dismissed for cause,and probationary employees,who could only be dismissed for cause during the school year but remained subject to dismissal at the end of each school year with or without cause.former pol.code,subds.i and j,as amended by stats,ch.that right was expanded in to require in larger districts that any decision not to rehire be for cause.cousins weaverville elementary school district th,d cousins,citing former,as amended by stats,ch.
in the,a probationary teacher could be dismissed during the school year only for cause,but if given notice in writing on or before june,dismissal was permitted without cause.former.former school code section allowed for notice to be deemed sufficient and complete when delivered in person to such employee by the clerk or secretary of the board,or deposited in the united states registered mail postage prepaid,addressed to the employee at his last known place of address.salmon allen d.the amendments to the former school code placed this description of how notice is to be delivered into section,which provided that o n or before the fifteenth day of may in any year the governing board may give notice in writing to a probationary employee that his services will not be required for the ensuing year.such notice shall be deemed sufficient and complete when delivered in person to such employee by the clerk or secretary of the governing board of the school district or deposited in the united states registered mail with postage prepaid,addressed to such employee at his last known place of address.darby biggs school dist.d,italics added knickerbocker redlands sch.dist.d.
the educational reform act of eliminated the requirement that nonreelection of probationary teachers must be based on cause.california teachers association mendocino unified school dist.th,d.the period of probation was reduced from three to two years.however,language requiring nonreelection to be based on cause was eliminated.section,subdivision b now requires the governing board of school districts having an average daily attendance of or more to give certificated probationary employees notice of the decision
