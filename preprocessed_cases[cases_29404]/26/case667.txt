pursuant to the privacy act,mahmoud cherif bassiouni sought to amend records maintained by the federal bureau of investigation fbi or the bureau that pertained to his contacts with,and activities concerning,the middle east.after exhausting his administrative remedies,bassiouni filed this action under the privacy act enforcement provisions,id.g.the district court granted summary judgment to the fbi it held that the records were exempt from the privacy act amendment requirements.bassiouni now appeals.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.the privacy overview 
because this case requires an understanding of the privacy act,we shall depart from our usual format and set forth an analysis of its pertinent provisions before turning to the background of this case.
general provisions 
under the privacy act,agencies,such as the fbi,that maintain a system of records concerning individuals are required to do so with such accuracy,relevance,timeliness,and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual.id.e.in addition to the accuracy requirement,agencies are prohibited from maintaining certain types of information in those records,including information describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the first amendment.id.e.the prohibition on maintaining first records,however,does not apply when those records are pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.id the act does not define a law enforcement activity,and the phrase does not appear elsewhere in the statute.
in addition to setting forth limitations on agency record keeping,the act also contains remedial measures.the act first provides an individual with the right to access his records upon request,id.d,and allows him to request amendment or correction of his records,id.d.in response to such a request,the agency either must amend the records or inform the individual of its reason for refusing to amend.id.d b.an individual unsatisfied with the agency response may pursue an administrative appeal.id.d.if the internal mechanism fails to resolve the individual request,he may seek review of the agency decision in federal court.see id.g a b.
exemptions 
in some cases,agencies may exempt certain record systems from privacy act requirements and,specifically for our purposes,the d amendment process.section j,entitled general exemptions,allows the head of an agency to exempt any system of records within the agency from any part of the act if the system is maintained by a law enforcement agency and if the information concerns certain criminal investigation functions.id.j.under this section,however,an agency may not exempt a system of records from e,which prohibits an agency from maintaining records describing an individual exercise of his first amendment rights.see id.j.
in addition to the general exemption provision,agencies may exempt record systems from specific sections of the act if the records are maintained for law enforcement purposes.id.k.the amendment process of d is among those that may be exempted.id.k yet,although an agency may exempt its record system from the amendment process,the agency still may not keep records of activity that is protected by the first amendment.
remedial provisions 
the privacy act provides limited civil remedies for individuals seeking redress for an agency noncompliance.the act allows an individual to seek redress in federal court if an agency does not allow the individual to review his record as required by d,see id.g b,or if an agency has refused to amend a record,see id.g a an individual also may challenge an agency failure to maintain records with the accuracy,relevance,timeliness and completeness required by e,but only if the plaintiff demonstrates that the agency action had an adverse effect on him.id.g c.similarly,g d provides a catchall cause of action for circumstances in which an agency fails to comply with any other provision of the act however,like the relief provided in g c,an adverse effect on an individual is also a prerequisite to a g d action.
at the heart of this dispute is the interplay between e protection against maintenance of records concerning first amendment activities and that same subsection exemption for records pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.however,the act nowhere defines law enforcement activity as used in subsection e.we turn,therefore,to the privacy act legislative history for further guidance in discerning the meaning of this term.
the privacy act lack of precision in defining law enforcement activity may be attributed to the circumstances of its drafting and passage.the act passed quickly in the late months of the congress.as one commentator noted 
passage of the act was both aided and hindered by the congress focus on watergate and the impeachment hearings involving former president nixon aided,because the watergate scandals had involved allegations of illegal wiretapping and surveillance of private citizens by federal agencies and hindered,because the impeachment process left little time for other legislation until the closing months of the session.

congress felt it was important to pass some kind of privacy protection before adjourning,id.at,and two bills concerning the limits of governmental intrusion into personal privacy were proposed in the senate and in the house of representatives,see,cong,reprinted in legislative history of the privacy act of source book on privacy gpo hereinafter source book,cong,reprinted in source book.neither bill represents the final version of the privacy act.indeed,due to time constraints,the bills were not reconciled through a formal conference.see guidebook.rather,members from the respective house and senate committees met informally and agreed on a compromise.steven becker,maintaining secret government dossiers on the first amendment activities of american citizens the law enforcement activity exception to the privacy act,depaul,citing cong.rec.statement of ervin,reprinted in source book.
during the compromise process,certain provisions were incorporated from both the house and senate versions and,in some circumstances,entirely new material was added.at the close of the process,house and senate staff members prepared an analysis of house and senate compromise amendments to the federal privacy act.see source book at senate id.at house collectively hereinafter,staff analysis.this document took the place of the conference report,which usually represents the most definitive record of the legislative history and intent of the law as enacted.guidebook.
however,despite the limited legislative history,it is evident that congress expressed particular concern with the government action in collecting information about citizens exercise of their first amendment rights.both the senate and the house versions of the bill contained protections to address these concerns.in the senate bill,section b provided that an agency shall establish no program for the purpose of collecting or maintaining information describing how individuals exercise rights guaranteed by the first amendment unless the head of the agency specifically determines that such program is required b,reprinted in source book.the senate committee report explained that section b 
reflect ed the preferred status accord ed to information touching areas protected by the first amendment it wa s aimed at protecting americans in the enjoyment of the privacy of their thoughts,habits,attitudes and beliefs in matters having nothing to do with the requirements of their dealings with an agency seeking information.
at,reprinted in source book.moreover,the committee noted,section b was directed to the planning stage of any programs being designed for the principle purpose of identifying americans who exercise their rights under the first amendment,and was aimed particularly at preventing collection of protected information not immediately needed,about americans,on the that government or the particular agency might possibly have to deal with them in the future,at,reprinted in source book.section e of,the house equivalent to b was both broader and narrower than the senate version it stated simply that an agency shall maintain no record concerning the political or religious belief or activity of any individual,unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained.e,reprinted in source book see,at,reprinted in source book.
after the bills were proposed in both houses of congress,members expressed concern that the analogues to e were overly broad and would hamper legitimate law enforcement efforts.for example,a sponsor of assured the house that section e would not prevent the fbi from maintaining records as to political beliefs if the records concerned the communist party or other groups dedicated to the violent overthrow of the government.see cong.rec,reprinted in source book.
this concern prompted representative ichord to propose a proviso to section e,which was adopted in the final version of provided,however,that the provisions of section e shall not be deemed to prohibit the maintenance of any record of activity which is pertinent to and within the scope of a duly authorized law enforcement activity.see e,reprinted in source book.in introducing his amendment,representative ichord articulated his concerns that the broadly worded section e might allow subversive groups to use the first amendment as a cover for illegal activities 
i n its present form it is clear that section e can be construed to cover activities which are properly within the scope of legitimate law enforcement.i am assured that the authors of this measure have not intended the provisions to foreclose this proper purpose.
the terms of the broad prohibitions on maintenance of records relating to political and religious activities would,for example,embrace the activities of the communist party and similar groups,which,although generally recognized as conspiratorial or clandestine,are nevertheless commonly described as political.similarly,certain sects within the black muslim movement,which have been described by the director of the fbi as endangering the internal security,may claim protection under this clause as a religious activity.
although those records of political or religious activity which are expressly authorized by statute,are excepted from the prohibitions of this paragraph,this is not adequate to exempt the activities of such subversive groups as i have indicated.i know of no existing or enforceable statute which expressly and generally authorizes any particular agency to maintain the records of political or religious activities of subversive groups 
i believe this clarifying amendment would obviate any ambiguities as to the reach of the prohibition,and would serve to eliminate any adverse litigation on the subject.

representative ichord then clarified that,i n referring to a law enforcement activity as used in e and law enforcement purposes as used in k,i am of course,using the expression law enforcement in its general meaning and in the broadest reach of the term.cong.rec,reprinted in source book.he continued 
i want to that there is no changes are designed to protect only legitimate national or internal security intelligence and investigations,and no records or files shall be kept on persons which are not within constitutional limitations.let the legislative history be explicit.none of these changes are intended to abridge the exercise of first amendment rights.the rights of americans to dissent in a lawful manner and for lawful purposes must be preserved.

the provision that had been section e in emerged from the informal compromise process in its current form,e.the final provision somewhat broadened protections,by adopting protection of rights guaranteed by the first amendment as opposed to protection of the political or religious belief or activity of any individual.source book.however,the compromise bill also adopted representative ichord exception for law enforcement activity.the only statement concerning the compromise section came from the congressional staff analysis,and added little toward interpreting the scope of the term law enforcement activity 
the compromise broadens the house provisions sic application to all first amendment rights and directs the prohibition against the maintenance of records.however,as in the house bill,it does permit the maintenance,use,collection or dissemination of these records which are expressly authorized by statute or the individual subject or are pertinent to a duly authorized law enforcement activity.
see staff analysis,reprinted in source book.
after reviewing the text of and the legislative history,we believe that certain principles are clear.first,in enacting,congress was motivated by a general concern with the potential for abuse if the government is allowed to collect political dossiers about american citizens.second,congress was concerned that overly restrictive limitations on the government ability to collect criminal intelligence would hamper legitimate law enforcement efforts.third,congress concern about restricting law enforcement was highest in areas of agency activity affecting the security of our nation.in our decision,we must acknowledge these legislative concerns in order to give effect to the intent of congress.
bassiouni,a law professor at depaul university,is a former president of the association for university graduates aaaug and of the arab chamber of commerce aacp.his academic work focuses on the fields of international law and human rights,and he has extensive experience in these areas.
in a letter dated november,bassiouni requested access to any records concerning himself or his activities that were in the possession of the fbi central records system.on march,the fbi released pages of redacted records accompanied by a transmittal sheet dated.the materials consisted of several bureau memoranda carrying dates from to.one of the memoranda contained excerpts from a speech that bassiouni had given to the aacp in it,however,did not report the full text of the speech.the records referenced a number of groups described as terrorist,and one group,the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp,currently is listed among the designated foreign terrorist organizations by the united states department of state.none of the record memoranda concluded that bassiouni was a member of a terrorist organization.bassiouni denies any such membership,and the fbi concedes that it does not suspect him of ties to terrorist groups.
on april,bassiouni requested that the fbi amend his records pursuant to the privacy act.he claimed that the amendment was required because,among other things,the records were inaccurate and incomplete the records described activities protected by the first amendment and the records were outdated.on february,the fbi denied his request on the ground that the records were exempt from amendment under the act because the information is a reasonably accurate,relevant,and timely account of the results of our investigation and is completely relevant to the investigative purpose for which it was collected.on march,bassiouni then filed an internal appeal.the fbi denied his appeal but suggested that he could forward a statement of disagreement,which would be included in the file.bassiouni did not send a statement but instead brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to g.
district court proceedings 
bassiouni suit alleged that the fbi maintained records on him that were untimely,were inaccurate and contained information with respect to his first amendment activities,all in violation of the act.see e,e.in addition to costs and fees,he sought expungement of the records from the central records system an injunction prohibiting the maintenance of such records and such further relief as th e district court deems just and proper.at.
the fbi moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see.b.it maintained that bassiouni suit was barred by the statute of limitations,that the bureau records were exempt from bassiouni privacy act claim and that bassiouni failed to allege any adverse effect from the bureau maintenance of his records.the district court rejected the fbi arguments and held that bassiouni complaint stated a claim for relief.
the parties later filed for summary judgment.bassiouni argued that he was entitled to summary judgment on both his e and e claims.according to bassiouni,the file maintained by the fbi violated e because it included references to a number of organizations,with the exception of the aaaug,with which bassiouni never had been associated.not only was the inclusion of this highly prejudicial and inflammatory material irrelevant,continued bassiouni,it also was untimely because the file indicated that the fbi investigation of him was terminated in,memorandum of law at.finally,bassiouni alleged that the file was not complete because it contained a summary,as opposed to the full text,of a speech that he had given.
bassiouni also claimed that he was entitled to summary judgment on his e claim because it was undisputed that his file contained information regarding his first amendment activities.according to bassiouni,these records did not fall within the exception for law enforcement activities set forth in e.also,relying on this court decision in becker internal revenue service,cir,bassiouni argued that,even if the initial collection of the information contained in the file was justified,the agency must demonstrate that its continued maintenance of records is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity,memorandum of law at citing becker,at emphasis in original.because the fbi had failed to establish a legitimate law enforcement reason for maintaining his records,becker concluded,he was entitled to summary judgment.
the fbi filed a for summary judgment.with respect to bassiouni e claim,the fbi explained 
the balance of plaintiff complaint is that he is entitled to amendment of the records pursuant to section d because they violate the standards for accuracy established by section e.although the privacy act provides a method for individuals to seek amendment of inaccurate records,d,it also permits agencies to exempt certain systems of records from the record amendment provisions.see j and k.relying on these provisions,the fbi has promulgated regulations that specifically exempt records maintained in its central records system from section d to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to sections j and k thus the fbi is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff d claim if the records in question are maintained in the central records system and subject to the privacy act exemption provisions.
both of these criteria are met here 
memorandum at.
turning to the e claim,the fbi argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because it had a legitimate law enforcement purpose for maintaining the file on bassiouni.these law enforcement purposes were set forth in the declaration of supervisory special agent james krupkowski the krupkowski declaration or declaration that was submitted with the bureau motion for summary judgment.the declaration acknowledged that the agency had determined that bassiouni was not a member of a terrorist organization.it further claimed that the exact relevance of bassiouni records was classified.however,the krupkowski declaration submitted that bassiouni records were relevant to current investigative interests because investigation of terrorism is the fbi top priority due to his contacts,the fbi will continue to receive information about bassiouni and will need the records to provide context with which to evaluate that new information and the records are important for evaluating the credibility and veracity of the fbi sources.moreover,the declaration pointed out that,if there were a terrorist event related to one of the groups with which bassiouni had contact,there will be an intense interest in what the fbi knew and when it knew it.destruction or amendment of the records would impede such an inquiry,ex.
the bureau also offered a classified version of the krupkowski declaration classified declaration for the district court in camera inspection.see.the classified declaration purported to detail the fbi investigative purposes.the district court,however,resolved the crossmotions for summary judgment on the information contained in the public krupkowski declaration alone.
in addressing the parties arguments,the district court noted that e and e do not,in themselves,give rise to a cause of action.at.i t is the fbi refusal to amend records under subsection d,rather than its alleged violations of e and e,that give rise to this cause of action pursuant to g.id.at.
the court further noted that k allows the fbi to exempt any system of records from the subsection d administrative amendment process if the system of records contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.id.at quoting k.without extended discussion,the court also observed that the same analysis applies to the fbi alleged violations of subsection e.id.at.thus,the court determined that bassiouni could not maintain an action to amend the records if they were compiled for a law enforcement purpose,a fact established by the public krupkowski declaration.consequently,bassiouni action for declaratory and injunctive relief failed.
in this appeal,bassiouni challenges only the district court grant of summary judgment on his e claim that the fbi is illegally maintaining records concerning his first amendment activities he does not challenge the district court determination with respect to his claim pursuant to e.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a motion or for summary judgment de novo.gazarkiewicz town of kingsford heights,indiana,cir.in considering for summary judgment,we are obliged to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the party against whom the motion under consideration is made,here bassiouni.id.
summary judgment 
as we have noted above,the central question on appeal is whether the fbi maintenance of bassiouni file violates e.in addressing this issue,the parties agree that the records contained in bassiouni file pertain to his first amendment activities.we shall now examine the matters on which there is disagreement.
bassiouni presents several arguments on appeal bassiouni submits that there is no support for the district court holding that challenges based on e only may be brought under g c or d,and thus require a showing of adverse effect.he also maintains that the district court erred by not considering his request for the expungement of his records.bassiouni finally claims that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the fbi plainly is maintaining his records in violation of e.
the fbi makes one primary argument it is entitled to summary judgment on bassiouni claims because its maintenance of bassiouni records is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity,and therefore complies with e.
we turn now to an analysis of these submissions 
focusing on the district court rationale for denying his e claim,bassiouni first argues that the bureau may be held liable for its alleged violation of e and failing to cure that violation through the amendment process,pursuant to g a.
bassiouni brought this action under the civil remedy provision of g a.by its terms,g a provides a remedy only when an agency makes a determination under d not to amend an individual record or fails to make such review in conformity with that subsection.
the fbi has exempted its central records system from the d amendment process,and those files are not subject to the amendment process of subsection d.because the fbi central records system is not subject to the subsection d amendment process,t
