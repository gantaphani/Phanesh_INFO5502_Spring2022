vincennes university,the oldest institution of higher education in indiana founded in by future president william henry harrison before indiana was admitted to statehood and a public institution since its its main,and only residential,campus in the town of vincennes population in southwestern indiana.about students,all undergraduate,are enrolled full time at the vincennes campus.
james gilles brother jim home page,visited,is a traveling latest in a line of christian itinerant preachers stretching back to saint paul and prominent in methodism in america.born near vincennes,gilles gives the following account of his salvation.as a result of satan machinations,he devoted himself as a youth to drugs,sex,booze,and rock and roll.at a rock and roll concert at which the van halen band performed,singer david lee roth shouted to the crowd not even god can save your soul at a van halen concert gilles saw the light,called on god to save him and thus refute roth,and was saved.the message he preaches,as summarized in his own words,is sinner friend,i have good news for you,you also can experience righteousness,peace and joy in the holy ghost if you would only forsake your sinful,selfish ways and turn to the lord and savior jesus christ.neither the record nor brother jim home page indicates that he is affiliated with any religious organization,although in another case in which he was turned away by a university he is identified as a member of the free pentecostal holiness churches,gilles torgersen,cir dismissed without a decision on the merits,presumably a reference to the pentecostal holiness church,a protestant denomination with methodist antecedents.none of this,of course,is important.there is no reason to doubt either his bona fides or that the content of his religious advocacy is protected by the first amendment.the question is whether the protection extends to a particular site on the university campus.
vincennes university and brother jim first intersected in,when he entered the campus uninvited and walked to a lawn in the middle of the campus,next to the university library.he preached from the lawn and a disturbance ensued,the nature of which is not revealed by the record,although the university dean of students stated in his deposition that when i went there,he brother jim was in the grassy area in front of the library.he had was speaking to a number of students there.there was disturbance,and at one point the campus police felt like he was in danger.and they asked him to leave,and he did.from another case we learn that when preaching,brother jim uses a confrontational style that includes calling people in the crowd names,such as whoremonger and drunkard,once the individuals have answered certain questions that he poses to them.he has been arrested on numerous occasions in the past.gilles torgersen,dist.lexis,at,vacated for want of standing,cir.brother jim denied that his preaching at vincennes in had caused a disturbance,and in the procedural posture of the case we must credit his denial.
in reaction to the exactly it university for the first time adopted a formal policy governing access to the campus by outsiders to the university community.entitled sales solicitation policy,the policy requires prior approval by the dean of students of all sales on campus.in addition,and more to the point of this case,the policy also requires the dean prior approval of all solicitations on campus.solicitation is defined as the act of seeking to obtain by persuasion to entice a person to action or the recruiting of possible sales.solicitors,if approved,are limited to soliciting in the brick walkway directly in front of the student union.
here is a satellite photo of the campus,showing the library lawn and the walkway.
brother jim returned to the campus the following year,proceeded to the lawn,was turned back and told he could preach only on the brick walkway.he tried to preach there,but the fact that the walkway is adjacent to a street makes it a noisy locale for a speech.unable to attract an audience,he broke off and left,and filed this suit against the responsible university officials,contending that the solicitation policy infringes his right of free speech.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.
brother jim argues that since the lawn is public property and is suitable for speechifying,he can no more be forbidden to preach there than he could be forbidden to preach in a public park.that is incorrect.the justice department in washington has a large auditorium,with a stage,and so would be a suitable venue for a theatrical production.but the first amendment does not require the department to make the auditorium available for that purpose even when it is not being used for departmental business.public property is property,and the law of trespass protects public property,as it protects private property,from uninvited guests.cornelius naacp legal defense educational fund,d.since public and private universities compete with each other,courts hesitate to impose in the name of the constitution extravagant burdens on public universities that private universities do not bear.chicago acorn metropolitan pier exposition authority,cir.
it is not as if requiring a public university to throw open its grounds to itinerant speakers would merely redress the advantage that a public university has over a private one because it has taxpayer support the requirement would deny the university control over its facilities.the courts reject the proposition that a campus must make all of its facilities equally available to students and nonstudents alike,or that a university must grant free access to all of its grounds or buildings.widmar vincent,d.the state,no less than a private owner of property,has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.adderley florida,d see also united states postal service council of greenburgh civic associations,d.
no matter how wonderfully suited the library lawn is to religious and other advocacy,vincennes university could if it wanted bar access to the lawn to any outsider who wanted to use it for any purpose,just as it could bar outsiders from its classrooms,libraries,dining halls,and dormitories.it would have to prove that allowing them in would disrupt its educational mission.see american civil liberties union mote,cir.g overnment may draw permissible distinctions among different classes of speakers in order to preserve the purpose of the forum,even when the proposed uses by those inside the permitted class of speakers and those outside the permitted class of speakers are quite similar.goulart meadows,cir.
what is true is that a university that decided to permit its open spaces to be used by some outsiders could not exclude others just because it disapproved of their message,rosenberger rector visitors of university of virginia,d.but it could use neutral criteria for access,such as that an outsider must be invited to speak on campus by a faculty member or a student group.american civil liberties union mote,supra,at.the difference between invited and uninvited visitors is fundamental to a system of property rights.the fact that other civilian speakers and entertainers had sometimes been invited to appear at fort dix did not of itself serve to convert fort dix into a public forum or to confer upon political candidates a first or fifth amendment right to conduct their campaigns there.the decision of the military authorities that a civilian lecture on drug abuse,a religious service by a visiting preacher at the base chapel,or a rock musical concert would be supportive of the military mission of fort dix surely did not leave the authorities powerless thereafter to prevent any civilian from entering fort dix to speak on any subject whatever.greer spock,d.coming closer to this case,we said in piarowski illinois community college district,cir,that the fact that piarowski sometimes invited artists from outside the college to exhibit their work in the college art gallery no more made the gallery a public forum than a teacher inviting a guest lecturer to his classroom would make the classr
