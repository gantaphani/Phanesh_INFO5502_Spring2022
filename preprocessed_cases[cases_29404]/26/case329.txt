background 
on or about february,rhonda gottlieb,then a junior at laurel highlands public high school,entered the school with the intention of confronting another female student,leah saluga,about her relationship with gottlieb.gottlieb was a disruptive student with a lengthy disciplinary record at the school.on this day she arrived late and apparently did not plan on attending classes.upon her arrival,gottlieb proceeded directly to saluga classroom.the two argued without physically engaging each other,and a school security officer arrived.the security officer instructed gottlieb to leave the building,but gottlieb disobeyed and continued to threaten saluga.the security officer then escorted gottlieb to the principal office.
gottlieb stood in the doorway of assistant principal michael carbonara office while he spoke with a teacher.carbonara then allegedly began yelling at gottlieb and spoke a few words to another principal,robert raho.raho then told gottlieb that he had just been on the phone with gottlieb mother and that gottlieb was not allowed in school until a conference took place.according to gottlieb,carbonara then told her to shut up,because he did want to hear nothing sic s he had to say and pushed her shoulder with his hand,propelling her backwards into a door jam.as a result of this contact,gottlieb lower back struck the door jam.gottlieb described the encounter in her deposition 
were you caused to fall to the floor from this being pushed 
no.its sic not like he pushed me to try to knock me out or anything.he did its sic not like he like hauled off and like me to knock me out.it was like that.he was just in a fit of rage,and he was mad.and he was yelling,and it happened.
is it your belief that carbonara intended to force you into the doorjamb 
no.why would he just all of a sudden hit me i never did nothing to the man.
is it your belief that carbonara intended to hurt you at all 
no,i just think he was mad,and he did know what he was doing.
and do you know why he was mad 
probably because i was up there acting like an immature kid at the high school.i should have been there,and i went there.
gottlieb alleges that she suffers chronic back pain and cramping as a result of this impact.she has been treated by several doctors and chiropractors for the injury.she has been advised to avoid strenuous activities involving her back,and she has not been able to perform various jobs or participate in some leisure activities.
carbonara was earlier involved in a physical altercation with an opposing football coach,and gottlieb therefore argues that the school district is liable because of its failure to address the risk carbonara posed to students.
ii.discussion 
gottlieb claim against carbonarai the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed 
we first must identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed and determine if gottlieb claim should be reviewed under the fourth,fifth,or fourteenth amendment.graham connor,d.because different standards attach to the various rights,identifying the proper constitutional approach is essential.here,the difference between reviewing carbonara actions under the reasonableness standard of the fourth amendment or the shocks the conscience standard of the fourteenth amendment may be determinative.see county of sacramento lewis,d fagan city of vineland,cir en banc.
because the fourth amendment invokes the less stringent reasonableness standard,gottlieb argues that carbonara push amounts to a seizure effectuated by a government actor who by means of physical force or show of authority,in some way restrain ed the liberty of a citizen.graham,at.the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures,however,does not properly cover gottlieb alleged injury.courts have recognized that public schools are in a unique constitutional position,because o nce under the control of the school,students movement and location are subject to the ordering and direction of teachers and administrators.wallace by wallace batavia sch.dist,cir see also vernonia sch.dist.acton,d students are lawfully subject to a level of restraint that would be unacceptable if exercised over free adults.the fourth amendment principal concern is with intrusions on privacy,and therefore when the infraction deals not with the initial decision to detain an accused and the curtailment of liberty that such a decision necessarily entails,but rather with the conditions of ongoing custody following such curtailment of liberty,then the claim invokes principles of substantive due process.ingraham,at.at citation omitted.gottlieb did not experience the type of detention or physical restraint that we require to effectuate a seizure.as the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania correctly stated,the momentary use of physical force by a teacher in reaction to a disruptive or unruly student does not effect a seizure of the student under the fourth amendment,and therefore is a scenario to which the fourth amendment does not textually or historically apply.kurilla by kurilla callahan,d.
gottlieb action is a claim of excessive force,not of unreasonable detention.in our leading case reviewing corporal punishment in public schools under,metzger osbeck,cir,we did not explicitly adopt the shocks the conscious standard,but rather did so impliedly,stating that the offending conduct must be inspired by malice or sadism.this led judge weis to state in his dissent that the majority had apparently adopted the shocks the conscience standard.metzger,at weis,dissenting.we agree and take this opportunity to clarify the standard we adopted in metzger,applying the fourteenth amendment shocks the conscience standard to federal claims alleging the use of excessive force by public school officials.accord,johnson by johnson newburgh enlarged sch,cir neal by neal fulton county bd.of,cir lillard shelby county bd.of,cir wise pea ridge sch,cir garcia by garcia miera,cir webb mccullough,cir.
ii application of the shocks the conscience standard 
the substantive component of the due process clause protects individual liberty against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.collins harker heights,d quoting daniels williams,d.t he substantive component of the due process clause is violated by state conduct when it can properly be characterized as arbitrary,or conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense.county of sacramento,at.at citation omitted.thus,conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.id.at.at.
in metzger,at,we cited johnson glick,cir,for the standard to evaluate excessive force claims 
in determining whether the constitutional line has been crossed,a court must look to such factors as the need for the application of force,the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used,the extent of injury inflicted,and whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.
the fourth circuit refined the glick criterion in
