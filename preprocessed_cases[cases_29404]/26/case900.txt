sam is a disabled student.an administrative hearings officer for the state of hawaii concluded that the state department of education doe failed to propose a school placement for sam for the school year that was appropriate and satisfied the requirements of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.the hearings officer further found that the private school program in which sam was enrolled by his parents was appropriate.
in other circumstances,this would have entitled the parents to reimbursement by the doe for the costs of attending the private program,but the hearings officer also concluded that the parents request for reimbursement was untimely under.a.that statute sets two different limitations periods.parents ordinarily have two years to initiate the process by requesting a hearing,but the statute requires a filing within one hundred and eighty calendar days of a unilateral special education placement if the request includes reimbursement of the costs of the placement.id.the hearings officer found that the private placement by the parents was unilateral and that their request was not filed within days.reimbursement was denied on that ground.the district court disagreed.it held that the placement was bilateral,not unilateral,so that the parents request was not untimely,and concluded that the parents were entitled to reimbursement.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the district court also awarded attorney fees to sam and his parents.contending that the hourly rate used in calculating the award was too low,sam the amount of the attorney fees.we affirm that order as well.
background 
sam suffers from anxiety,depression,language issues,speech issues,social issues,and central auditory processing disorder.in,his parents parents removed sam from public school and placed him in loveland academy,a private institution in honolulu,where he was enrolled every year thereafter.the current litigation concerns sam placement for the school year.
previous litigation between the parents and doe regarding the three years immediately preceding the school year was resolved by a settlement in may under which doe agreed to pay for sam tuition at loveland for school years through,current information from loveland about sam would be provided to doe,and the parents would participate in an iep reevaluation meeting by the end of june the parents and doe representatives met to discuss sam individual education plan iep for the following year several times during the summer and into the fall of.in the meantime,the school year began,and sam remained at loveland.
the meetings extended into january.no different placement was ever agreed upon.doe did not present a specific public school placement until january,when doe produced a signed iep that provided that sam would be placed in a public school program at the windward intensive learning center ilc.doe followed up on that proposal by sending to the parents a document entitled prior written notice of department action,giving formal notice of the ilc placement,dated january.sam never joined the ilc program,remaining at loveland instead.
the parents disputed the effectiveness of the iep and the finality of the ilc placement.the doe stated in letters dated march,and april,that the iep issued on january,was the final iep.the parents filed a request for a due process hearing on october.
following an extensive due process hearing,the administrative hearings officer issued a page findings of fact,conclusions of law,and decision.the decision included at least five determinations that are important for the current appeal.
the doe predetermine d placement to be appropriate at doe proposed placement the ilc program in advance and without any significant parental input.the hearings officer further concluded that t he idea is violated when the doe predetermines placement for sam before the iep is developed.in addition to being contrary to the procedural requirement that the placement be based on the iep,also deprived the parents of meaningful participation in the iep process.
the placement proposed by the doe was ill advised,inappropriate,and potentially disastrous to sam and his education.the decision detailed reasons for that conclusion,but as the doe is no longer contesting the conclusion,it is not necessary to go into them here.the important determination,also no longer disputed by doe,was that the placement proposed by the doe was not reasonably calculated to confer educational benefits on sam and denied him the free appropriate public education to which he was entitled under the idea.
the parents established that loveland was an appropriate placement for purposes of reimbursement.the hearings officer specifically concluded that it has provided and can provide educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of sam,supported by such services as are necessary to permit sam to benefit from instruction.citations omitted.
the placement of sam at loveland for the school year was a unilateral placement by the parents,without the agreement of doe.the doe made its position clear that the iep process was over and the ilc placement was what it made available.the hearings officer found that doe stated this view no later than in its letter dated march.this letter was received by the parents around march,and so the day period began running,at the latest,on march.the parents request for a due process hearing and reimbursement was filed on october.that was untimely as it was more than days later,so the hearings officer concluded that reimbursement was precluded under.a.in reaching that conclusion,the hearings officer decision discussed both the previous decision of the district court in department of education,d,and our decision in department of education,cir.
the parents did not establish that doe was responsible for the failure to have the iep in place by the conclusion of the august,iep meeting,which would have been only about one week after the start of the school year.in reaching that conclusion,the hearings officer observed that the iep process was very lengthy and very disputatious as stated by petitioners counsel we stipulate that it the relationship between the parties was bad.alteration in original.
on appeal from the administrative decision,the district court reversed the hearings officer finding as to the statute of limitations,but affirmed in all other respects.the district court followed its own prior decision in,where it held that a subsequent determination by a hearings officer in favor of a student that a private placement was appropriate,while the doe proposed placement was not,constituted an agreement between the doe and the family rendering the private placement bilateral rather than unilateral.see,d at.the district court also observed that sam had been placed at loveland for many years,and that the doe had agreed in the settlement agreement to pay for the loveland program for the preceding three years.the court noted that the doe had not offered an iep for sam for those preceding years,that the settlement agreement did not provide for a change in placement,and that no iep had been offered by the doe by the beginning of the school year.under those circumstances,the district court concluded that the parents decision to continue to enroll sam in loveland effectively was a continuation of a bilateral placement rather than a unilateral placement.the court order discussed our decision in,which held that a settlement agreement did not necessarily constitute an agreement by the doe that continued into following years,concluding that our k.decision was distinguishable based on the facts that the district court identified.
on appeal to this court,the doe does not challenge the first three conclusions by the hearings officer identified above,all of which were affirmed by the district court.it is,therefore,no longer in dispute regarding the school year that doe breached a procedural requirement of the idea by predetermining sam placement and failing to allow for significant parental input in the iep process,the ilc placement proposed by doe was inappropriate for sam,and the loveland program in which sam was enrolled by his parents was appropriate.doe appeals only the decision by the district court that the parents are entitled to reimbursement because the loveland placement for school year was not unilateral and thus that the parents request was not untimely.
after the district court rendered its decision on the merits,including the parents entitlement to reimbursement,sam,through his parents,brought a motion in the district court for an award of attorney fees and costs.adopting a calculation made in findings and recommendation by a magistrate judge,the district court awarded fees in the amount of.the calculation was primarily based on billable hours compensated at a rate of per hour,with small amounts added for work done by a paralegal and for hawaii general excise tax.sam attorney sought a higher hourly rate of per hour and supported that request with declarations by five hawaii attorneys stating their opinions that such a rate was reasonable for the attorney in question.the district court noted those declarations but concluded,based on the court familiarity with the prevailing rates in the community,that the requested hourly rate was excessive and that an hourly rate of was reasonable.the court awarded fees based on that reduced hourly rate.
sam appeals the amount of fees awarded,raising only the issue of the reduced hourly rate.

the idea aims to provide all children with disabilities a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,employment,and independent living.d a.if parents believe their child is not receiving a free appropriate public education commonly referred to as a fape,they may be able to place the child in a private program and then seek reimbursement from the public school district.a c ii c.the federal statute provides that the parent must seek a hearing within two years of an alleged denial of a fape,but permits states to set a different limitations period.b b,f c.
under.a,parents in hawaii have two years to initiate the process by requesting a due process hearing,but a filing is required within one hundred and eighty days of a unilateral special education placement,where the request is for reimbursement of the costs of the placement.the statute does not define unilateral special education placement.there are no reported hawaii state court decisions interpreting this provision.
our court considered the meaning of unilateral special education placement as used in section in,f d at.we adopted a definition previously set forth in a district of hawaii decision and held that a unilateral special education placement occurs when one party unilaterally,without consent or agreement of the other party enrolls the student in a special education program.id.at quoting makiko hawaii,cv,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
in,a student family reached a settlement agreement in march with the hawaii doe under which the doe agreed to pay for the student private tuition,by coincidence also at loveland academy,for the school year.the agreement provided that the student was to participate in planning for transition to a public school for the following school year,if deemed appropriate.before that next school year began,the doe presented a iep providing for placement in a public school.the family did not respond and the student in the loveland program.after a due process hearing,the administrative hearings officer concluded that the public school placement proposed by the doe would have provided a fape.the hearings officer also dismissed the family claims for private program tuition reimbursement for the year.although the family argued that it was entitled to maintain the placement at loveland as a stay put placement during the pendency of litigation,the request was rejected as untimely because the placement at loveland for the year was found to have been unilateral and the request for reimbursement was made over a year later.
our court affirmed that decision.in particular,we agreed that the placement for was properly described as unilateral.we noted that the march settlement agreement never called for placement at loveland and only required tuition reimbursement for the prior year.id.at.the agreement also referenced at least the possibility that the student would transition to a public school for the next year.id.we observed that the settlement agreement specified in several places that it applied only to the school year.id.at.the decision to enroll the student at loveland the following year was,therefore,a unilateral decision by the family.the enrollment thus occurred without consent or agreement of the other party.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the doe points to and argues that this case is the same.we disagree,however,and conclude that this case is different in at least one important respect.
in the settlement agreement explicitly contemplated a public school placement for the following year,and the doe proposed such a placement before the next school year began.in the current case,the doe did not present an iep providing for a public school placement for the school year until january,at least halfway through that year.the doe did not make clear that its position was final until it sent a letter to that effect in march,after most of the school year had already gone by.prior to that time,sam was still attending the loveland program,as the doe necessarily knew.the doe had not proposed anything else,and it presumably did not intend that sam would receive no educational services in the meantime.in those circumstances,it does not appear to us that the placement at loveland for the school year was without consent or agreement of doe,as the term unilateral was defined in 
agreement may be tacit.the inclusion of consent as an alternative to agreement in definition of unilateral further suggests that the manifestation of agreement need not be explicit.see generally sierra club castle cooke homes hawaii,haw recognizing implied consent as c onsent inferred from one conduct rather than from one direct expression quoting black law dictionary ed.consent may be indicated by silence or inaction where such silence or inaction manifests a willingness for the conduct in question to happen.see generally restatement second of torts consent is willingness in fact for conduct to occur.it may be manifested by action or inaction and need not be communicated to the actor.if words or conduct are reasonably understood by another to be intended as consent,they constitute apparent consent and are as effective as consent in fact.restatement first of property cmt.c manifestation of consent.the consent from which a license arises may be manifested by conduct of any kind.the manifestation may consist in the use of language,or in conduct other than the use of language.such conduct may consist of acts indicative of a consent by the actor to the use of his land by another,or it may consist in failure to take reasonable action when inaction may reasonably lead to an inference of consent.
here,the doe knew that sam was enrolled at loveland for the school year.by waiting so long into that school year to propose a different placement,the doe tacitly consented to his enrollment at loveland academy.it is true that the hearings officer found that the parents did not prove that the doe was responsible for the failure to have an iep for a public school program in place by the time that the school year began.but that does not change the fact that the doe knew that sam was going to be enrolled in loveland in the meantime and necessarily consented to that enrollment for that school year because it had not offered another alternative.
that did not mean that the doe was precluded from proposing something different thereafter.had it proposed an a
