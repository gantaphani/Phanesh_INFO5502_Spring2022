the issue presented in this appeal is whether the magnet and permit with transportation pwt programs of defendant los angeles unified school district the district violate proposition cal,art.i,eff,because the programs take into account a student race or ethnicity in determining admission.proposition prohibits favorable or discriminatory consideration of race or ethnicity in public education,but expressly exempts from its reach integration plans in existence prior to its effective date.we hold the trial court correctly ruled the district magnet and pwt programs are exempt from the prohibition in proposition because they were part of an existing integration plan approved and implemented in.
background and procedural history 
following nearly two decades of litigation,the superior court entered a final order on september,approving with modification an integration plan in crawford board of education of the city of los angeles,case the plan of the district included provisions for magnet schools and pwt programs,both of which took into account the race or ethnicity of the student in the application and admission process.in its final order,the superior court terminated its supervision over the case,except for the issue of attorney fees.
in,the voters of california approved proposition which in part prohibits discrimination against or preferential treatment in favor of any individual or group on the basis of race,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public education.proposition included the following exception,found in article i,section,subdivision d nothing in this section shall be interpreted as invalidating any court order or consent decree which is in force as of the effective date of this section.
the magnet program is a voluntary integration program providing unique educational opportunities to students from kindergarten to grade.the magnet schools are part of the district voluntary desegregation program.as of,the district operated magnet programs.some magnets are located on regular campuses,while others occupy entire school sites.only ability and highly gifted magnets have specific eligibility requirements.
admission to a magnet school is based on a priority point system.twelve priority points are earned for students who have completed one level in a magnet school and apply to continue in the magnet program at the next level.between and points are awarded to applicants who have been on a magnet waiting list,with the number of points determined by the length of time on the list.students whose schools are designated as predominately hispanic,black,asian,and other phbao schools receive four points.four points are also awarded to students whose schools are deemed overcrowded.a student whose sibling attends the same magnet to which application is made is given three points.
maintaining ethnic balance is a factor in determining available space or openings in a magnet program.admission is determined using a formula of percent phbao and percent other white,although some magnets use a percent ratio.if a student of the required ethnicity is on the waiting list,the first available opening must go to that student in order maintain racial or ethnic balance in the magnet school.ethnicity may affect the timing of admission to a magnet and whether a student gets into a first choice school.
the pwt program is a voluntary integration plan available to students who live within a pwt sending school area.the pwt provides integrated educational experiences by placing phbao students in integrated settings,while providing opportunities for other white students to attend phbao schools.pwt sending schools are phbao pwt receiving schools are predominately white.free transportation is provided only to students from sending schools.assignments are made in order to improve the racial balance at the receiving school.
when applying for the magnet or pwt programs,students must mark on the application one of seven federally identified racial or ethnic categories american indian asian american,not of hispanic origin hispanic white filipino and asian islander.according to the application,your application will not be processed unless an ethnicity is indicated.there is a provision for indicating the applicant is,but unless one of the seven federally recognized ethnic or racial categories is marked,the application will not be processed.
allegations of the complaint 
on october,plaintiff and appellant american civil rights foundation acrf filed a verified complaint against the district for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging the racial considerations in the magnet school and pwt programs violate proposition to the extent the district programs use race or ethnicity to select students.the complaint alleged proposition,passed in november,specifically prohibits racial or ethnic preferences in public education,and there was no existing court order prior to november mandating the district to use race or ethnicity in selecting students for the magnet or pwt programs.the order terminating jurisdiction in crawford board of education of the city of los angeles entered september,neither mandated nor authorized the district to use race or ethnicity in the selection of students to the programs.
the complaint alleged the details of the application and admission process for the magnet and pwt programs,essentially as described above.acrf sought a declaration that the programs impermissibly use race or ethnicity as a basis for discrimination against or preferential treatment to individuals or groups in public education.acrf sought injunctive relief barring the district from enforcing the programs insofar as they require the use of race or ethnicity in the selection of students for the programs.
the district answer and the intervenors 
the district answered that it was required to engage in each act complained of by crawford board of education cal d.proposition,by its terms,is not applicable to the district desegregation plan,as the magnet and pwt programs were created pursuant to a state court order that was acknowledged and approved by the united states supreme court crawford board of education,d,and was in place on the effective date of the constitutional amendment.
two complaints in intervention were filed by multiple parties,denominated the alvarez intervenors consisting of parents with students in the district magnet schools,and the almaraz intervenors consisting of parents of five students in the district and two organizations.both intervenors opposed acrf action.
the summary judgment motions 
all parties filed motions for summary judgment.the motion of acrf was denied,but the district motion for summary judgment was granted.upon granting the district motion,the motions for summary judgment filed by the alvarez and almaraz intervenors were deemed moot.only the district successful summary judgment motion is at issue in this appeal 
the district summary judgment motion and acrf opposition 
the district moved for summary judgment on the basis that the magnet and pwt programs were part of court orders or decrees in force as of the effective date of proposition on november.the district argued it was required by court order to implement the programs on november.the district remained under court order after the trial court terminated supervision over the desegregation plan,even though that termination occurred many years earlier.the district relied upon board of education superior court th,d carlin for the proposition that desegregation orders do not terminate merely because a court ended supervision of plan implementation.the district received reimbursement from the state for the cost of the programs from,indicating the programs are considered to be a component of the desegregation plan.the state continued audits and reimbursement of the district desegregation costs are evidence that the crawford order remained in effect past november.the legislative analyst recognized that proposition would not impact desegregation plans,and the voters approved proposition with that understanding.
in its opposition to the district motion for summary judgment,acrf disputed the district characterization of the final order.acrf disputed that the order mandated the magnet and pwt programs or required the district to use race as a selection criterion.moreover,judge robert lopez ordered the writ discharged and vacated all outstanding orders.
acrf did not dispute that judge lopez crawford order has never been reversed,overruled,vacated,revoked,modified,or withdrawn by any court.it did contend the crawford order itself discharged the writ and terminated the court jurisdiction over the defendant integration efforts.acrf disputed that costs of the magnet and pwt programs were reimbursed by the state for and voluntary integration,as the crawford order contained no mandate for the programs to rely on race.
relevant undisputed material facts 
a.the crawford action 
in,judge alfred gitelson issued a writ of mandate after finding the district operated impermissibly segregated schools.although the california supreme court disagreed in part with judge gitelson reasoning,it affirmed the judgment as modified.crawford board of education,supra,cal d.the supreme court ordered the district to take reasonable and feasible steps to alleviate the harms of segregation regardless of the cause and to demonstrate meaningful progress in the task.
b.the district plan upon remand from the california supreme court 
in,the district submitted its integration plan.in,judge paul egly issued orders requiring mandatory reassignment of pupils on a racial and ethnic basis.crawford board of education d.in,the voters approved proposition cal,art.i,subd.a,eliminating the state court power to order mandatory reassignment of pupils based on race unless required by the united states constitution.crawford board of education,supra,at.although judge egly modified the order in,the modified order required substantial mandatory reassignment and transportation of pupils in the district.id.at.on appeal,judge egly orders were reversed in light of proposition.id.at.the united states supreme court affirmed.crawford board of education,supra.
c.the district integration plan upon remand from the united states supreme court 
after the united states supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of appeal,the district submitted its plan for desegregation on june.the plan was framed in terms of the school year,but it is intended to be a continuing master plan subject to adjustments necessary to meets its goals.to meet its goals of maximum desegregation,preservation of schools and neighborhoods that have achieved desegregation,and alleviation of the harmful effects of segregation,the plan utilized several components,including the magnet and pwt programs.
magnet programs were an integral part of the district desegregation program.the program grew from six schools in to schools and centers by september,with more than students enrolled and plans to increase enrollment.priority is given to minority students presently attending overcrowded schools.
the district choices booklet describes the magnet schools and pwt programs.all students may apply,but school assignments are made only on the basis of improving the ethnic balance of the school to which the student is transferring.for,virtually every school in the district with a white enrollment in excess of percent will be a designated pwt receiving school,and it is planned that as many as to minority students will participate.the assumption was that pwt would continue to be a viable part of the district integration plan,which will provide ethnic balance at the receiving school and an integrated education for the participating minority student.
whenever possible,the district will encourage voluntary programs including magnet and pwt involving the reassignment of students to facilities,and m inority students attending overcrowded schools will continue to receive priority for admission.
d.the superior court order 
in an order dated september,judge lopez noted that years had passed since the filing of the crawford litigation in.all the facts material to the case had changed.with the passage of time,the nomenclature had become outdated,misleading,and harmful to innocent children.educational quality had been displaced as the prime focus of public education.the court found there must be a commitment to excellence in education to fulfill the expectations of all children in the district.
determining that the case must be resolved and there must be finality in the law,the superior court found that it was time for common sense to return to the treatment of desegregation in the schools.the framework of the law was provided by the decisions of the california supreme court and court of appeal in crawford.those decisions required the district to develop a plan using reasonably feasible steps to produce meaningful progress in light of present conditions,regardless of the cause of segregation.
regarding the district submitted desegregation plan,the superior court made the following orders the district may construct new schools and make additions to existing ones to meet overcrowding and other needs the definition of groups in the plan as minority phbao was to end forthwith,as the term is factually inaccurate because those students comprise the vast majority of the school population,the label is harmful,the district had a duty to use factual descriptions,and those students should be referred to with accurate descriptions.the term racially isolated minority schools rims was barred as it is deceptive,demeaning,and inaccurate and should be replaced with a neutral term,but not minority all new elementary and junior high magnet schools and programs established under this plan shall be located in areas of phbao enrollment ratios must be maintained at or less in phbao schools,and all phbao students who volunteer are entitled to access to all programs involving the voluntary transfer of students all phbao pupils who volunteer are entitled to access all programs involving the voluntary transfer of students the district is to publicize transfer options to pupils in areas where most phbao families reside the district must issue annual reports on educational conditions and achievements in phbao schools and the share of desegregation expenditures allocated to payment of administrative expenses shall not exceed the administrative expense ratio characteristic of the district overall budget and the district shall prepare and make public,before july,a report of the measures taken and results achieved under the plan.
the superior court found that the district plan,as modified by the court,would protect the rights of students and meet constitutional standards.it was time to end the litigation.the mandate to the district to take reasonably feasible steps to desegregate was clear.the district remained subject to its constitutional duty to take reasonable steps to alleviate school segregation,regardless of the cause.the district had satisfied the mandate of the court,and the writ was ordered discharged.all outstanding orders of the superior court in this matter,save the minute orders re court monitors,are vacated,effective this date.the court retains jurisdiction for the sole purpose of determining the matter of attorneys fees.the district plan included the continuation of voluntary desegregation programs including magnet and pwt.
additional evidence in support of summary judgment 
peter james,principal counsel for the district in this action,represented the district in desegregation matters since the summer of.he was senior trial counsel for the district in the remedy hearing in crawford,conducted before judge egly between october and may.judge egly believed mandatory busing was necessary and ordered the district to implement a complex mandatory busing plan.judge egly order was vacated in crawford board of education,supra,d.review was denied by the california supreme court,but certiorari was granted by the united states supreme court,which affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal.
james declared that although the court of appeal vacated judge egly order as to the type of remedy,it did not remove the district obligation under crawford board of education,supra,cal d,to formulate a desegregation plan.the district formulated a desegregation plan dated june.judge lopez vacated an interim order of the court and modified the district desegregation plan.judge lopez ordered the plan implemented and provided for an end to active court supervision in,except for the purpose of determining attorney fees.
james declared that to meet the costs of the desegregation,the legislature in enacted education code section to provide state reimbursement of mandated costs,including desegregation plans.the district sought and received reimbursement from the state under this provision from until,when it was replaced with other funding.before,the legislature also reimbursed school districts for voluntary desegregation costs,but at a lower rate,pursuant to education code section.
james further declared there was an audit of the district reimbursement request to the state for.the district obtained clearance in advance from the state controller before making any changes in its desegregation plan to avoid denial of reimbursement costs under education code section.the district was assured that proposed changes to class size,mandated by legislation,would not jeopardize reimbursement for the district desegregation costs.state controller kathleen connell wrote in a letter dated september,that the district desegregation plan was court ordered and mandated costs were reimbursable.
olonzo woodfin iii,the former controller and chief financial officer of the district,filed a declaration stating he was responsible for preparing and filing claims for reimbursement of desegregation costs under education code sections and.he was responsible for the request for reimbursement of desegregation expenses for the school year,the last year before proposition was approved.the request for reimbursement was for more than million in expenses and million in voluntary desegregation expenses.from through,the district requested and received state reimbursement for costs under the crawford order.after a formal audit by the state controller for,the state paid the district million of the million claimed for a desegregation program under education code sections and.in,the state paid million on a request of million in desegregation costs.
gary orfield,an expert in desegregation cases,declared that he was a expert in crawford.in his experience,it is highly unusual for a desegregation plan to have an expiration date.generally a desegregation plan remains in place until a party to the case or other interested person with standing applies to the court for the plan termination.it is not unusual for a plan to remain in effect for several decades.desegregation would leave the underlying patterns largely unchanged and the plans must be continued until they become part of the accepted structure of the school district and its community.
orfield further declared he did not believe the superior court intended the crawford desegregation plan would remain in effect for only two years until the date of the status report.no such discussion took place and he was unaware of anyone else involved in the crawford litigation who believed the plan would be implemented for such a short period of time.it would be absurd and destructive to send children to another school for a brief period of time and then send them back to an inferior segregated school.the types of changes necessary to achieve successful desegregation in a jurisdiction like los angeles can not be achieved quickly because of the need to create educational benefits that justify commuting to another school.
the legislative analyst assessment of proposition contained in the ballot pamphlet for the november,general election indicated that elimination of voluntary desegregation programs might affect up to million in voluntary desegregation expenses.expenses would not be affected by the proposition.
f.the trial court ruling on the district summary judgment motion 
the trial court found that judge lopez final order and the plan judge lopez ordered implemented followed the pattern of virtually all remedy orders in desegregation cases and used race expressly.the order has never been reversed,overruled,vacated,revoked,modified,or withdrawn,and acrf does not contend otherwise.contrary to acrf claim,the superior court found it clear and beyond dispute that the district was ordered to employ race and ethnicity to ensure that the magnet schools would in fact be integrated.the trial court remedy,which included selection for magnet schools and pwt programs,ordered implementation of the plan as submitted,subject to exceptions set forth by the court.acrf did not contend that proposition eliminated the state constitutional obligation that districts take reasonably feasible steps to alleviate school segregation,regardless of its cause.
the crawford remedy order was in existence on november,when proposition became effective.judge lopez required the district to show progress by report in two years,but did not state that he expected the goals to be achieved in that time,and given the size of the district and patterns of segregated housing,achievement did not seem eminent.annual reports were ordered on educational conditions and achievements of phbao schools,indicating the court expectation that the order would remain in effect for the foreseeable future.
citing carlin,supra,th at page,d,the superior court ruled that the end of supervision of a desegregation plan does not terminate a district integration program.instead,responsibility is returned to the district.without an explicit order of termination,it is presumed the order is binding and remains in force.because the crawford order has never been reversed,overruled,vacated,revoked,modified,or withdrawn,and has never expired,it was in effect when proposition became effective.due to the existing order,proposition did not bar the magnet and pwt programs as they continue to operate.
the district motion for summary judgment was granted.objections by acrf to the separate statement were overruled the other motions for summary judgment were all rendered moot as a result of the summary judgment ruling.
discussion 
acrf argues that the magnet and pwt programs are facially unconstitutional under proposition to the extent they include race as a basis for admission.acrf renews the argument made in the trial court that the order issued by judge lopez terminated the superior court jurisdiction,so there was no existing desegregation order at the time proposition was approved in.

application of proposition to voluntary integration plans 
acrf argues proposition applies to a voluntary integration plan implemented by a school district to achieve racial balance,citing crawford huntington beach union high school dist.th,d huntington beach.we agree,although that issue is not determinative in this case.
in huntington beach,the plaintiff contended a school district policy with a racial and ethnic balance component violated proposition.huntington beach,supra,th at,d.the policy was explained as follows to prevent an inappropriate racial and ethnic balance,the district restricts transfers to and from westminster high school.if you are white and you live inside the high school attendance area,you can not transfer out unless another white student is willing to transfer in and take your place.if you are and you live outside the high school attendance area,you can n
