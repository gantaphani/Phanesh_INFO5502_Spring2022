the individuals with disabilities education act idea broadly authorizes the courts to provide appropriate relief,including compensatory education,to children who have been deprived by their state or local educational agencies of a free appropriate public education.when congress reauthorized the idea in,it enacted f c,a statute of limitations that requires parents to file a due process complaint no more than two years after the parents knew or should have known about the alleged deprivation,that is,within two years of the reasonable discovery of that violation the legislation simultaneously amended b b,which previews the various procedural safeguards available to parents,including the opportunity to file that due process complaint.the new language added to this prefatory subsection,however,described the due process complaint as alleging an injury that occurred not more than two years before the reasonable discovery date.
in an appeal stemming from a due process complaint filed by the parents of,a student with special needs,we consider,in a matter of first impression among the courts of appeals,how these two provisions should be interpreted together and what effect they have on the courts authority to remedy idea violations,in particular,through the award of compensatory education.we address today which,of a variety of interpretations,is correct does b b limit compensatory education to injuries occurring two years before the filing of the complaint,even if earlier injuries are claimed within two years of their reasonable discovery,as urged by appellant ligonier valley school district authority does it limit compensatory education to injuries that occurred from two years before their reasonable discovery through the filing of the complaint,up to two years after that discovery,the approach taken by the district court and urged by does it impose only a pleading requirement,without affecting the availability of a remedy for timely and claims,as argued by amici appellees and in the alternative or is it simply a restatement,albeit,of the same statute of limitations set forth in f c,as asserted by the united states department of education doe recognizing the uncertainty in this area,the district court certified the question for interlocutory appeal.
we now conclude,after careful consideration of the parties plain language arguments,the statutory context and structure,the doe interpretive guidance,and the legislative history,that b b is simply an inartful attempt to mirror f c statute of limitations.that is,both sections reflect the same filing deadline for a due process complaint after the reasonable discovery of an injury,and b b neither imposes a pleading requirement nor in any respect alters the courts broad power under the idea to provide a complete remedy for the violation of a child right to a free appropriate public education.
facts and procedural history 
after spending the previous year at a parochial school,entered high school in the ligonier valley school district the district in the fall of at a school open house shortly after he started,teacher told his father that seemed distracted in class and lacked organizational skills.father then orally requested that the district evaluate for any special education needs.the request was to no avail no evaluation was conducted and,instead,in the wake of a tragic car accident in which lost his older sister,the district,purportedly on the basis of information in her obituary,opened an investigation into whether even lived within district boundaries.that investigation confirmed residence and thus the district obligation under the idea to provide him with a free appropriate public education fape.
in the meantime,however,continued to struggle academically.for a time,he was able to keep those struggles partially hidden from his parents by intercepting and altering his report card.at the conclusion of the school year,however,district officials informed parents that he would need to repeat the ninth grade.it was at this point that his parents learned that he was being bullied at school on the basis of his sexual orientation,with students regularly calling him a faggot and a homo,and that as a result he was having trouble eating,sleeping,and concentrating on his studies.
faced with the district contention that should repeat the ninth grade,parents complained to the school principal about the bullying and again requested that be evaluated for special education needs.the conversation became heated,and the principal told father to speak with the parents of the bullying students himself.the principal also informed parents that a request for special education evaluation needed to be in writing.father then immediately handwrote and submitted a request,which mother followed up with an email to the principal.apparently not caring for the tone of that email,the principal made an angry phone call to each of parents.the same day,the principal requested that the district again investigate the residency of and his family.
the district then began another investigation,representing to the family that the new investigation was based on an anonymous phone call to the district.meanwhile,the principal also conducted his own investigation,using school computers to search for voting records of parents.over the next month,it appears little was done to assist with the challenges he faced either academically or socially.the district did,however,demand that the family provide a number of additional documents to prove residency.eventually,the district agreed to formally evaluate for the remedial support to which he might be entitled pursuant to the idea,and in august,after the family hired an attorney,yet again confirmed that lived within district boundaries.
thus,when returned to school in the fall,the district finally evaluated him for his special education needs for the school year and instituted a plan to prevent him from being bullied.that evaluation revealed that did indeed have learning disabilities in math,reading,and writing.in november,the district offered to parents an individualized education program iep,which parents found inadequate and sought to supplement with supports tied to each of special needs.despite multiple meetings between the parents and district officials during the months of december and january,they were unable to agree on the educational goals that would satisfy a fape for 
while the parties were attempting to negotiate a satisfactory iep over the fall and winter,the district also attempted to implement a plan to prevent from being bullied.however,by january,the bullying not only had continued,but had grown to include the participation of the school football coach,who allegedly made a disparaging remark to another student about that student relationship with,and did so in front of some of the very students who were bullying.when he learned of this public remark by the coach,became distraught and refused to return to school.instead,his parents picked up and returned his school work,which he completed at home.as this went on,iep team continued to meet,and his parents were in regular contact with district officials to attempt to address the bullying situation.
in march,was evaluated by an intermediate unit psychologist,who conditionally diagnosed him with two additional disabilities,including stress disorder caused by the ongoing bullying.on march,frustrated with the bullying that had been allowed to escalate and apparently had caused additional disabilities in their child,upset by his academic struggles,and dissatisfied with the iep offered by the district,parents withdrew him from the school and enrolled him in a cyber charter school.the district has conceded that march,reflects the date parents knew or should have known about the deprivation of a free appropriate public education to,that is,the reasonable discovery date for purposes of this case 
on january,within two years of the reasonable discovery date,and thus within the statute of limitations set forth in f c,parents filed their due process complaint,alleging that the district denied him a fape and requesting compensatory education for september through march that is,the entire period that was allegedly denied a fape by the district before he withdrew from school.
procedural history 
as required by the idea,parents initially requested their due process hearing by filing a complaint with the pennsylvania department of education,which in turn assigned it to a hearing officer.the hearing officer acknowledged that the language of seemed to describe two different time periods relevant to the idea statute of limitations f c,which provides that a due process complaint must be filed no more than two years after the reasonable discovery date,and b b,which describes the due process complaint as alleging an injury that occurred not more than two years before the reasonable discovery date.however,the hearing officer adopted the district position that the subsections,first,were actually the same,and,second,barred relief for violations that occurred more than two years before the complaint was filed.put differently,the hearing officer adopted an effective two year remedy cap,compensating only injuries that actually occurred within two years of the filing date,regardless of whether the parents filed within two years of reasonably discovering older injuries.
applying this interpretation to complaint,the hearing officer held that even assuming that the district deprived of a fape from september until march,that the parents reasonably did not know about the injury before march,and that the january,complaint was timely filed within two years of that march,discovery remedy was limited to injuries that occurred in the three months between january and march because that was the only period attended the district school within the window before the filing of the complaint.because the hearing officer proceeded to hold that was not injured during this period,that the district had provided a fape to during the school year,the hearing officer denied any award of compensatory education,even for those three months 
the district court,reviewing this decision,disagreed.in denying the district motion to partially dismiss the complaint on the basis of the alleged remedy cap,the district court construed f c and b b,in combination,to mean that relief may extend from two years before the reasonable discovery date through the date the complaint was filed,which could be up to two years after the reasonable discovery date,for a maximum period of relief of four years.ligonier valley sch.dist,wl,at.the district court thus adopted what has become known as the construction of these statutory sections,id.at,applying the same construction embraced by three other district courts in this circuit,see penn manor sch,wl,at,jana,d at ex rel cumberland valley sch,d.because the construction would render injuries from september to january redressable upon finding a violation,the district court remanded for the hearing officer to address whether the district provided a fape during the relevant period.wl,at.however,recognizing the uncertainty in this area and correctly identifying this issue as one that was important,controlling,and recurring,the district court stayed its remand order and certified the issue for interlocutory appeal,which we then granted

b.the reenactment and its aftermath 
prior to,the idea did not include a statute of limitations.see steven cent.bucks sch,cir.congress found this problematic because parents could knowingly wait for many years to file complaints,resulting in school districts that were often surprised by claims involving issues that occurred in an elementary school program when the child may currently be a high school student.rep,at.waiting many years to bring actions on behalf of a child,congress reasoned,jeopardized that child education and created distrust between school administrators and parents.id.
in the reauthorization of the idea,congress sought to remedy this problem by adding a statute of limitations to f,which is entitled impartial due process hearing and sets forth the procedures for the life cycle of such hearings,from the initial receipt of the due process complaint that constitutes the request for the hearing,f,through the findings of the hearing officer,f e.the new subsection,f c,was entitled timeline for requesting hearing and states 
a parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing within years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a hearing under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows.
f c.accordingly,under the idea parents must file their due process complaint within two years of the date they knew or should have known of the violation,unless the state has its own statute of limitations,in which case the state statute controls.abington sch,cir.the reauthorization also added two equitable tolling exceptions to this statute of limitations,which apply regardless of whether the state has enacted its own statute of limitations specific misrepresentations by the school district and the withholding of statutorily mandated disclosures.f d 
section overall is a lengthy and detailed section,the entire purpose of which is to provide parents procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education.dep t of,wl,at cir,quoting a the section opens with a,entitled establishment of procedures,which requires state and local educational agencies to establish and maintain procedures in accordance with this section to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education by these agencies.a.it proceeds in b,entitled types of procedures,to list out and briefly summarize t he procedures required by this section,b,b,in roughly the same order these procedures are then more fully described in the subsections that follow,c f.among the procedures listed in b,even before the reenactment,was an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child,b amended,corresponding to the fuller explanation of the due process hearing procedures set forth in f amended.
accordingly,along with the addition of the statute of limitations to f c,the reenactment also amended b to read 
b types of procedures 
the procedures required by this section shall include the following 
an opportunity for any party to present a complaint 
a with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child and 
b which sets forth an alleged violation that occurred not more than years before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for presenting such a complaint under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows,except that the exceptions to the timeline described in subsection f d shall apply to the timeline described in this subparagraph.
b emphasis added.with this amendment,the complaint procedure described at b b came to mirror the statute of limitations at f c in almost all respects they both describe a time limit that hinges on the reasonable discovery date they both provide that any state statute of limitations will override this timeline and they both incorporate the two exceptions to the statute of limitations set forth in f d unlike f c,however,b b limitations period runs backward instead of forward from the reasonable discovery date.
the differences in the language of these provisions and the fact that they appear to move in opposite directions from the reasonable discovery date,has given rise to confusion in the wake of the reenactment,with district courts within this circuit interpreting them in a range of ways.some have construed them to limit redress to the two years preceding a complaint.see,mount olive twp.bd.of,wl.some have interpreted them to impose a filing deadline but not to limit the remedy for claims.see,cent.sch.dist.ex rel,wl,at.july,collecting cases we also agree with the conclusion reached by several courts within this district,that the idea statute of limitations does not apply to limit the permissible period of compensatory educational awards.and at least four,including the district court here,have adopted the analysis.see,wl,at.
the district contends there can be no confusion because we have already addressed and resolved the question of how these provisions interact with each other and how they apply to claims dating back a number of years in steven,and.that resolution,according to the district,is that we definitively stated that claims are barred where they are alleged to occur two years prior to the date of filing.appellant br.citing steven,at,and,at.this argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of our prior cases.those cases held that f c bars claims that are not filed within two years after the parents knew or should have known about the injury a proposition that is now and is not disputed by either party to this case.however,neither steven nor says anything about claims that are filed within two years of that knew or should have known date but happen to relate to an injury that took place more than two years before the complaint was filed.
in steven,we considered a case brought by parents who had knowingly sat on a claim for years,see mark cent.bucks sch,wl,at,rev and remanded sub nom.steven,at,and held that f c statute of limitations applies retroactively to claims that predated the amendments and bars any causes of action that accrued prior to two years before the filing of the due process complaint,even if the violation continues into the window before the complaint was filed.at emphasis added.likewise,in,where we held that the statutory tolling provisions of f d precluded application of common law tolling doctrines and were therefore the exclusive exceptions to the idea statute of limitations,we reaffirmed our rejection of the continuing violation doctrine and held that the claims in that case,which we observed had been discovered years earlier,were,as the parents conceded,limited to the time period before the filing of the complaint under f c,at.indeed,contrary to the district reading,we expressly stated in that parents must request a due process hearing,not within two years of the occurrence of the injury,but within two years of the date the parent knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.id.at alterations in original quoting f c.
although we observed in passing in that this statute of limitations in f c was the same period that parents had to file an administrative complaint under b b,we did not there and have not since had occasion to reconcile the differences between the language of b b and f c or to consider how these provisions affect the remedy available for claims spanning multiple years that were filed within two years of the date the parents first knew or should have known about the basis for those claims.nor has any other court of appeals addressed the interplay between f c and b b.we resolve these issues today.
iv.analysis 
the starting point of all statutory construction is the text of the statute,but where that text is ambiguous,we must do our best,bearing in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.king burwell,d quoting util.air regulatory grp,d.thus,we consider below the plain language arguments of the parties and amici the broader context of the statute the position of the doe and the legislative history of the amendments,and we conclude that applying the plain language of the text would force us to give b b a meaning that turns out to be untenable in light of the statute as a whole.king.at internal quotations marks and alteration omitted.instead,our analysis confirms that,as we presaged in,b b and f c do indeed reflect the same statute of limitations,at,which imposes a deadline on the filing of claims once they are reasonably discovered but does not limit the redress available for claims.
a.the plain language of b b is ambiguous 
in interpreting b b,we confront a statutory provision that by its plain terms does not impose any obligation on parents,but rather identifies the opportunity to present a complaint among a list of procedural safeguards in the prefatory subsection of,which are then explicated in the subsections that follow.b b.meanwhile,the amendment to f c by its plain terms describes the t imeline for requesting a hearing and mandates that a parent shall request an impartial due process hearing within years of the reasonable discovery date.the amendment to b b appears to conform the description of the complaint that previously appeared in b,the mechanism to request an impartial due process hearing,to f c in every respect including the exceptions but one the timeframe of before,rather than after,the reasonable discovery date.id.b b,f c.no explanation is given for this singular difference.the clearest way to demonstrate the ambiguity it has created in the statute,however,is through the diametrically opposed interpretations proposed by the parties themselves.
i.the school district proposed remedy cap 
we begin with the district,which contends,first,that b b describes the same statute of limitations as f c and,second,that this statute of limitations limits the scope of a child remedy to those injuries that actually occurred in the two years before the filing of a complaint,no matter when the parent reasonably discovered the injury.the obvious problem with the district first contention is that,as the district court noted in rejecting it,the language and plain meaning of the subsections are,in fact,quite different section f c provides that parents who have been unable to secure relief for alleged violations through informal channels and are resorting to requesting a due process hearing must do so within years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.f c.section b b,on the other hand,describes that very same complaint that parents shall have the opportunity to present as set ting forth an alleged violation that occurred not more than years before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.id.b b.
the district does not attempt to reconcile the language of these provisions it simply asks us ipse dixit to declare them identical and further asks that we read this single statute of limitations to permit relief only for those injuries that occurred no more than two years before the filing of the complaint.the problem is that this is not what the statute says and the district logic proves an unworkable syllogism section b b makes reference to a injuries that occurred no more than two years before b the reasonable discovery date f c provides that b this reasonable discovery date must be no more than two years before c the filing of the complaint but neither subsection references a injuries that occurred no more than two years before c the filing of the complaint.
the district reading not only lacks textual support but affirmatively contravenes the language and purpose of congress in using a reasonable discovery date.when fashioning a statute of limitations,a legislature may choose as the date from which the limitations period begins to run either the date the injury actually occurred,an approach known as the occurrence rule,or the date the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the injury,that is,the discovery rule.see knopick connelly,cir discussing these rules in the context of pennsylvania tort law see also oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir explaining that the discovery rule provides that the date the statute of limitations begins to run is not the date on which the wrong that injures the plaintiff occurs,but the date on which the plaintiff discovers that he or she has been injured.under the discovery rule,a plaintiff time to bring suit is not in any way shortened by his or her reasonable ignorance the statutory limitations period begins to run and the plaintiff is afforded the full limitations period,starting from the point of discovery,in which to file his or her claim.oshiver,at 
the discovery rule controls here.generally,absen t a contrary directive from congress,we apply the federal discovery rule as a default.disabled in action of septa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,of course,congress left nothing to doubt,unambiguously providing in the idea that the date from which any limitations period begins to run is the date the parents knew or should have known of the basis for the claim.see b b,f c.the district thus does not argue that the occurrence rule applies,nor could it,because to do so would be contrary to the idea explicit,discovery rule.instead,it attempts an end run around the rule by proposing a cap on redress from the date of the complaint,with the same effect the requirement that a claim be filed within two years of the date the violation actually occurred not the date it was reasonably discovered for that claim to be cognizable.
take a practical example.assume a school district unreasonably fails to identify a child disability from the beginning of first grade through the end of third grade.assume also that at the end of third grade,the parents first reasonably discover the injury,and the school district immediately begins providing the student with the educational supports he or she needs going forward but declines to provide that child with compensatory education to make up for the three years the child was deprived a fape.under the theory espoused by the district,even if the parents filed a due process complaint the very same day they reasonably discovered the injury,the child compensatory education for the three years of this violation would be capped at two years the second and third grade years that occurred within the two years before the filing of the complaint.moreover,those two years of compensatory education would diminish daily for each day after the reasonable discovery date that the parents or their counsel conducted due diligence,explored settlement options,or prepared the complaint before filing.nothing in the plain language of the statute suggests such an absurd result.reiter cooper,d while it is theoretically possible for a statute to create a cause of action that accrues at one time for the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitations begins to run,but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit,we will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication in the statute.
putting aside the oddity of a statute of limitations functioning in this manner and its inconsistency with the broad remedial purposes of the idea discussed more fully below,the text is clear that congress eschewed the occurrence rule in favor of the discovery rule by hinging both f c and b b on the date the parents knew or should have known of the injury.see,merck reynolds,d holding that when a statute says that the plaintiff claim accrues only after the discovery of facts,a limitations period does not begin before discovery can take place beauty time,vu skin,cir it is that pennsylvania law recognizes an exception to the statute of limitations which delays the running of the statute until the plaintiff knew,or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known,of the injury and its cause.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the limitations period of f c begins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the facts constituting the violation whichever comes first.merck,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted accordingly,b b,which runs backward from the reasonable discovery date not the filing date,appears on its face to mean something different and,whatever that is,it is not,as the district would have it,that claims not known or reasonably known expire of their own accord if the injury occurred more than two years before the filing date.
ii.and pleading requirement theories 
in a diametrically different but no less problematic reading,argues that the text of b b supports two interpretations,each of which entitles him to relief.first,he argues that the district court approach was correct that b b provides a window before the reasonable discovery date within which he may claim idea violations occurred,thus effectively serving as a remedy cap.second,he argues,along with amici appellees that this subsection is merely the description of a prima facie cause of action,with no limit on remedy at all.that is,b b requires that a due process complaint allege an injury under the idea that occurred within two years of a parent reasonable discovery,but imposes no limitation on the remedy if these elements are pleaded and the complaint is timely filed.
both of these interpretations,however,would render the text illogical.for like f c,b b provides in the very same sentence that if a state has an explicit time limitation for presenting such a complaint,the complaint shall instead be filed in such time as the state law allows,rather than the time described in b b,and further provides that if the state does enact its own statute of limitations,the federal exceptions still apply to the state statute of limitations.b b.yet,it would be nonsensical for congress to specify that a federal statute remedy cap or the elements of a prima facie case be replaced by a state statute of limitations,and it would be equally illogical to have two bases for equitable tolling a doctrine used to determine whether a statute of limitations has expired apply to a provision that is not a statute of limitations in the first place.we decline to interpret the statute in this bizarre fashion.see,dep t of revenue of or.acf,d rejecting statutory interpretation that would render a statute illogical and contrary to congressional intent.
in sum,the supposedly straightforward textual arguments of the parties more resemble the twists and bends of a contortion artist,presenting us with the option,on the one hand,of ignoring swaths of the statutory text or,on the other,accepting a reading that is absurd on its face.the parties positions are illustrative,however,of the difficulty of applying a plain language reading to this text.we conclude,as we observed in addressing the pre version of the idea,the language of section b is at best ambiguous.lawrence twp.bd.of educ.new jersey,cir we therefore must resort to other tools of statutory construction.
statutory interpretation of b b 
the supreme court has instructed that t he certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.brown williamson tobacco,d.that is,a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.united sav.ass of texas timbers of inwood forest,d accord gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d analyzing statutory language in a way that is in accord with the language and structure of the section of law at issue.such is the case here,where examining b b in the context of and the idea as a whole points unequivocally in one direction that b b indeed restates f c statute of limitations and that this limitations period functions in a traditional way,that is,as a filing deadline that runs from the date of reasonable discovery and not as a cap on a child remedy for claims that happen to date back more than two years before the complaint is filed.
i.the structure,language,and context of the act 
we begin with the overarching structure of.see gwaltney,at evankavitch green tree servicing,llc,cir examining the structure and parallels of a statute to determine the meaning of its terms.as previously noted,after opening with a preamble that reiterates that a state must establish and maintain procedures to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards,a,the section next proceeds to list and briefly describe the t ypes of procedures mandated by the idea,id.b.that listing,in b,serves in effect as a table of contents for the expanded descriptions of these same procedures that then appear in roughly the same order in c f.thus,for example,b requires written prior notice of changes to a child educational program,the details of which are described in c b ensures notice is available in a parent native language,as described in d b provides a n opportunity for mediation,as described in e and,as relevant here,b provides an a n opportunity for any party to present a complaint,which is more fully described in f.id.b f.this structure makes clear that b was intended to preview and convey the same essential meaning as f.
given that b,in context,appears to be nothing more than a summary listing of the procedural safeguards more fully described in later subsections,we can not conceive that congress intended to bury within b a sea change in the idea.that,however,would be the effect of cutting off at twenty four months in virtually all cases the courts power to award compensatory education,and le aving parents without an adequate remedy when a school district unreasonably fail s to identify a child with disabilities.forest grove sch.dist,d noting congress acknowledgment of the paramount importance of properly identifying each child eligible for services.this proposition appears particularly fanciful considering that congress failed to even hint at such an intention either in f,the full version of the due process hearing procedure of which b is merely a précis,or in i,which was reenacted in without any alteration to the broad discretion it grants federal courts to remedy violations of the idea,forest grove,at.as the supreme court ha s repeatedly said,congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.eme homer city generation,d scalia,dissenting quoting whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.
moreover,it is a standard principle of statutory construction that identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning.powerex reliant energy,d.here,the words and phrases describing the idea statute of limitations and its exceptions indicate that b was intended to have the same meaning as the other references to a limitations period in,and,like them,to function as a filing deadline and not a remedy cap.specifically,in three separate subsections of,the statute provides a federal time limit,but using identical language provides as an alternative or,if the state has an explicit time limitation,in such time as the state law allows.b,f c,i b.given that state limitations periods generally function as filing deadlines on claims that are known or should have been known,not remedy caps on claims not yet reasonably knowable,the only way those words can be read sensibly is if they provide an alternative to a federal filing deadline,a traditional statute of limitations.
textual confirms this conclusion,brown gardner,d,for b b not only mirrors f c state statute of limitations provision but also its two equitable tolling exceptions,and does so simply by the the exceptions to the timeline described in f d,b,f c.this shorthand reference to these important tolling provisions,which are then set forth in full in f,fortifies our conclusion that b was merely intended as an abstract of f,that it reflects the same limitations period as f c,and that this limitations period,pursuant to the cooperative federalism inherent in the idea,schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,d quoting little rock sch.dist.mauney,cir,defers to state limitations periods when appropriate and otherwise functions as a traditional statute of limitations not a remedy cap.
indeed,while it would make no sense for a state filing deadline to displace a federal remedy cap or elements of a prima facie case,it makes perfect sense that congress,according due weight to principles of federalism,would allow a state filing deadline to displace a federal one.likewise,it would be odd indeed for b b,if it actually described a remedy cap or a prima facie case,to apply equitable tolling provisions from f d,but quite logical if b b merely restates the statute of limitations to which those equitable exceptions apply.that is,when we look to the section surrounding words and provisions and their context,tavarez klingensmith,cir,and apply the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole,king vincent,d,it is clear that b b,though poorly penned,was intended merely as a synopsis of f d statute of limitations

given the broad remedial scheme of the idea,neither in the period before the amendments when we borrowed a state most analogous statutory cause of action to determine how long after an adverse decision by a hearing officer a parent could wait before filing an idea complaint in state or federal nor in the period since,have we imposed a cap on the remedy a child could seek for claims.instead,we have consistently repeated that a child right to compensatory education accrue s from the point that the school district knows or should know of the injury to the child,and the child is entitled to compensatory education for a period equal to the period of deprivation,but excluding the time reasonably required for the school district to rectify the problem.ex rel.cent.reg l sch.dist,cir see also,at repeating standard mary sch.dist.of,cir same lauren ex rel.jean deflaminis,cir same.that standard is grounded in our understanding,then and now,that a child entitlement to special education should not depend upon the vigilance of the parents who may not be sufficiently sophisticated to comprehend the problem nor be abridged because the district behavior did not rise to the level of slothfulness or bad faith,at.
against the backdrop of these cases and the broad interpretation the supreme court has given to a court remedial power under i c iii,it bears particular significance that congress reenacted that subsection without change as part of the reenactment.thus,interpreting the idea statute of limitations as a remedy cap would also disregard the canon of statutory interpretation that congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.lorillard pons,d see also.dep t of hous.cmty.affairs inclusive communities project,d.
on this point,we find clear guidance in the supreme court decision in forest grove,which examined the amendments to the idea.those amendments added,among other things,a c,which provided that if the parents of a child who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency enrolled their child in private school without the consent or referral of that public agency,a school district could still be ordered to provide tuition reimbursement if a determined that the school district failed to provide a student with a fape in the first instance.a c ii.in an attempt to limit liability,a school district argued that because the idea only discusses reimbursement for children who have previously received services through the public school,the idea only authorizes reimbursement in that circumstance.at.
the supreme court disagreed.it observed that the amendments preserved the idea comprehensive remedial goal of providing every child with a fape and did not alter i c iii.see id.at stating that the holdings in school committee of burlington department of education of massachusetts,d,and florence county school district four carter,d,rested on the breadth of the authority conferred by i c iii,the interest in providing relief consistent with the act purpose,and the injustice that a contrary reading would produce considerations that were not altered by the amendments internal citations omitted.the court thus rejected the notion that congress repealed sub silentio those previous supreme court holdings describing the broad discretion afforded by i c iii.id.at.any other reading,the court reasoned,would be contrary to the idea broad remedial purpose and a child right to a free appropriate education would be less than complete.id.at alteration in original quoting burlington,at.
so too here,for the reauthorization reaffirmed the idea first purpose as ensur ing that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their unique needs,d a,and once more left unchanged i c iii,which grants courts the broad discretion to fashion remedies that accomplish that objective.congress purpose in that mandate is clear in order to effectuate the law broad remedial goals,a court finding a deprivation of a free appropriate public education should return a child to the educational path he or she would have traveled had the educational agency provided that child with an appropriate education in the first place.see,at reid,at see also ridgewood,at remanding to district court to consider eight years of claims for compensatory education lester by octavia gilhool,cir affirming grant of thirty months of compensatory education.
consistent with that purpose and the traditional way in which a statute of limitations functions,courts since the passage of the reenactment have routinely affirmed awards of compensatory education that remedy deprivations of greater than two years,or at minimum,remanded for an administrative agency to consider those claims.see ferren sch.dist.of,cir affirming award of three years of compensatory education ex rel.simchick fairfax cnty.sch,cir holding that the broad discretion afforded under the idea allowed a district court to consider reimbursement for three years of a child allegedly inappropriate placement draper atl.indep.sch,cir rejecting a school district argument that a child injury was time barred and upholding an award of approximately five years of compensatory education reid,at remanding to consider claims over a four and half year period of time dep t of,wl,at,finding that the idea clear statutory language mandates that a remedy is not limited by the statute of limitations when a claim is timely filed jefferson cnty.bd.of educ.lolita,d,holding that a right to redress for a complaint filed in october would be limited to the most recent two years unless the statute did not begin to run on the claim because the parent did not not have known about that action until a time within two years of the due process request.but see indep.sch.dist,marshall,wl,at,no party may recover for a violation occurring outside the statute of limitations.
of course,the idea statute of limitations does still practically curtail remedy,for it specif ies when a complaint is timely filed and thus has the consequence of limiting liability because filing a timely complaint is a prerequisite to having an actionable claim.passenger morgan,d.in context,however,that means simply that once a violation is reasonably discovered by the parent,any claim for that violation,however far back it dates,must be filed within two years of the knew or should have known date.if it is not,all but the most recent two years before the filing of the complaint will be but if it is timely filed,then,upon a finding of liability,the entire period of the violation should be remedied.in other words,f c,like its synopsis in b b,reflects a traditional statute of limitations.
iii.the department of education regulation and interpretation 
the doe,the federal agency charged with promulgating regulations for the idea,see,agrees that b b and f c state the same limitations period.
in its regulations following the reenactment,the doe simply reproduced both subsections verbatim.compare b b,and f c,with a,and e.in its analysis of comments and changes to those regulations,however,the doe reported that commenters were confused and sought guidance,because the statute of limitations is mentioned twice and implies that the timeline for filing a complaint and filing a request for a due process hearing are different.assistance to states for the education of children with disabilities preschool grants for children with disabilities.it responded that t he statute of limitations in section b b of the act is the same as the statute of limitations in section f c of the act.id.
in this appeal,at our request,the doe also submitted an amicus letter brief in which it reiterated its position that the subsections are,in fact,referencing a single statute of limitations 
we afford the doe interpretation of its regulation and its position before us here respect to the extent it has the power to persuade,gonzales oregon,d quoting skidmore swift.see id.at holding that an agency interpretation of regulations that merely parrot the statute are accorded skidmore deference,rather than the higher deference generally accorded to interpretive guidance under auer robbins,d.here,we find the doe position persuasive because it accords with the language,structure and purpose of the statute,and it is yet one more voice in a harmonious chorus that b b was intended to reiterate f c statute of limitations.
to the extent there remains any doubt about this conclusion,it is put to rest by the legislative history,to which we next turn.
iv.the legislative history of the idea amendments 
supreme court cases declaring that clear language can not be overcome by contrary legislative history are legion.first merchs.acceptance bradford,cir collecting cases.that said,legislative history can play a confirmatory role in resolving ambiguity when statutory language and structure support a given interpretation.see,dynamics land cline,d catwell att y,cir.this is such a case.
a legislature designing a statute of limitations confronts certain choices.as we have discussed,it can set the date from which the limitations period begins to run by using the occurrence rule or the discovery rule.see supra at.it also can set the expiration date either by counting forward from that occurrence or discovery date to the filing of a complaint or by counting backward from the date a complaint is filed to the occurrence or discovery date.
when the house of representatives proposed the amendment that was eventually incorporated into b,it chose to use the occurrence rule and to count backward,providing that parents would have 
an opportunity to present complaints 
a with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child and 
b which set forth a violation that occurred not more than one year before the complaint is filed 
at.the house committee report unambiguously described this language as a statute of limitations.id.at statute of limitations the act currently has no statute of limitations and leaves local educational agencies open to litigation for the entire length of time a child is in school,whether or not the child has been identified as a child with a disability the bill includes a statute of limitations of one year from the date of the violation.and as written,it would have unambiguously functioned like one,barring claims based on injuries that occurred more than twelve months before the complaint was filed.
the senate,meanwhile,chose to use the discovery rule and to count forward,providing in what became f c 
timeline for requesting hearing.a parent or public agency shall request an impartial due process hearing within years of the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a hearing under this part,in such time as the state law allows.
at.unlike the house proposal,the senate also added the provision giving primacy to a state limitations period,along with the two statutory tolling exceptions.
those two bills both statutes of limitations but pointing in different directions and using different starting dates for the limitations period then went to conference where the conference committee sought to reconcile them.that committee reaffirmed that each body amendment functioned as a traditional statute of limitations on the filing of a complaint 
the house bill and senate amendment have similar language regarding the opportunity to present complaints,but the house bill,not the senate amendment,includes language establishing a year statute of limitations on the right to present complaints.senate has a year timeline for filing complaints at note.
at,reprinted in,see also id.at,the senate amendment establishes a year statute of limitations unless state law already has a statute of limitations.the house bill includes a year statute of limitations see note.
apparently concluding that the addition of a statute of limitations should involve both a new provision within f c and an amendment to its prefatory subsection at b,the conference committee opted not to choose one body addition over the other but to retain both.it did so by conforming each and every of the material terms of the house version to the senate,by changing the house limitations period from one year to two,changing the occurrence rule to the discovery rule,adding that a state statute of limitations could override the idea,and adding the two equitable tolling provisions specified by the senate.the conference committee then incorporated the senate version at f and the house version in the summary listing at b.when it did so,however,it omitted to change the framework of the house version to the framework of the senate.thus was created the problem we grapple with today.
section b,in other words,started in the house as a functioning,statute of limitations for the filing of complaints 
a with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child and 
b which set forth a violation that occurred not more than one year before the complaint is filed.
at emphasis added.
it ended,however,as something different altogether 
a with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child and 
b which set forth an alleged violation that occurred not more than two years before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for presenting such a complaint under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows,except that the exceptions to the timeline described in subsection f d shall apply to the timeline described in this subparagraph.
b emphasis added.
the congressional research service described the amendments this way 
the reauthorization includes statutes of limitations in various sections.as previously discussed section b provides for a statute of limitations regarding the filing of a complaint.there is also a statute of limitations regarding requests for a hearing.the two years is from the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action.
richard appling and nancy lee jones,cong.research,individuals with disabilities education act idea analysis of changes made by,crs emphasis added.while this observation on its own carries little weight,nothing in the idea legislative history points to a contrary interpretation.
in fact,quite the opposite.far from congress intending that the two limitations periods diverge or limit a court remedial power under i,the legislative history reflects that the drafters intended the amendments to add a single statute of limitations and to leave untouched the idea broad remedies.for example,in its explanation of the addition of the statute of limitations,the senate report stated 
this new provision is not intended to alter the principle under idea that children may receive compensatory education services,as affirmed in school comm.of burlington department of education of massachusetts,d and florence county school district four carter,d and otherwise limited under section a c in essence,where the issue giving rise to the claim is more than two years old and not ongoing,the claim is barred where the conduct or services at issue are ongoing to the previous two years,the claim for compensatory education services may be made on the basis of the most recent conduct or services and the conduct or services that were more than two years old at the time of due process or the private placement
