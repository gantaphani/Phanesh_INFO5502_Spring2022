on march,the school principal,georgia baumann,visited each class and discussed the seriousness of making statements threatening harm with a weapon.she sent a letter home with each student asking parents to discuss the issue with their children and stating that immediate disciplinary action would be taken when students make statements referring to violence or weapons.was absent on march and his parents did not receive baumann letter.on march,and three other students made statements referring to weapons and shooting each other at recess.according to,he was playing a game of cops and robbers with his friends and said,i going to shoot you.app.at.another student told a teacher what and his friends were doing and that teacher reported that some of the students were upset.the teacher took the boys to baumann office.

discussion 
section imposes civil liability upon any person who,under color of state law,deprives another person of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.when an individual defendant in a action claims is entitled to qualified immunity,our first task is to assess whether the plaintiff allegations are sufficient to establish the violation of a constitutional or statutory right at all.gruenke seip,cir.if the plaintiff allegations meet this threshold,we must next determine whether,as a legal matter,the right that the defendant conduct allegedly violates was a clearly established one,about which a reasonable person would have known.id.if so,then the defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity.id.if the plaintiff allegations fail to satisfy either inquiry,then the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.id.until the question of qualified immunity is addressed,a court can not reach the underlying merits of the case.id.at.
in saucier katz,d,the supreme court explained why the first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged 
in the course of determining whether a constitutional right was violated on the premises alleged,a court might find it necessary to set forth principles which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established.this is the process for the law elaboration from case to case,and it is one reason for our insisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry.the law might be deprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead to the question whether the law clearly established that the defendant conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.
id.at.the supreme court had previously stated that this order of procedure is designed to spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability,but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long drawn out lawsuit.wilson layne,d quoting siegert gilley,d.we therefore proceed first to consider whether has alleged facts sufficient to establish the violation of a constitutional right.if so,we will then consider whether the right allegedly violated was clearly established.
first amendment 
argues primarily that was deprived of his first amendment right to freedom of speech when he was suspended from school for saying i going to shoot you to a friend at recess.he contends that the boys were playing a game,that they did not threaten physical harm and that they did not substantially disrupt school operations or interfere with the rights of others.
it has been established that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.this does not mean that students are free of any regulation of their speech.the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials,consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards,to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.id.at.
in tinker,the court was presented with the first amendment claim of two high school students and one junior high student who were suspended for wearing black armbands to school to show their objections to the vietnam war.in holding that school officials violated the students firs
