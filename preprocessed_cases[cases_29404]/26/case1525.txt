in this matter we decide whether members of the sanctity of human life network sohlnet have the right to come onto the campus of rocklin high school to distribute,literature to students before class.because a high school is not a college campus or public forum,we conclude that the school administration may constitutionally limit access by outsiders,regardless of their message or purpose,in order to prevent disruption.
plaintiffs martha reeves,harry reeves,john ficker,and murray lewis are members of sohlnet who sought to distribute and literature on the grounds of rocklin high school as students arrived in the morning.the principal of the high school refused to let them do so.instead,sohlnet distributed its pamphlets on nearby public streets.
plaintiffs then filed a complaint seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the rocklin unified school district rusd,asserting that the school regulations concerning access to the high school campus violated their constitutional rights.after a bench trial,the court upheld the validity of the regulations and entered judgment in favor of defendants.
plaintiffs appeal.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
approximately members of sohlnet,including plaintiffs,planned to distribute literature to rocklin high school students on may.at that morning,the group met with their attorney,dana cody,in a nearby shopping center parking lot to plan their strategy.they decided that plaintiffs would distribute leaflets and talk to students at two locations,the student parking lot and the bus point,while others distributed literature on a nearby street.the group planned to leave the high school at when the first bell rang for class.
attorney cody advised the group that state law required them to register in order to be on campus.at approximately,as the sohlnet group arrived at the high school,plaintiff murray lewis and cody went to the school office to register.
they spoke briefly to the assistant principal,steven james,and told him they were there to leaflet on campus.james looked briefly at their leaflet,and said that any permission to register would have to come from the principal,phillip spears.the administrators were aware sohlnet had attempted to gain access to the campus the year before.at that time,the group had videotaped students and tried to pass out literature,and the police had to be summoned.
principal spears told cody and plaintiff lewis that they did not have legitimate business on campus and would not be allowed to register.spears was concerned about potential disruption of the school normal routine and possible safety problems associated with having unsupervised outsiders mingling with students.he told them to leave the campus,and a police officer working at the school directed the group to the public street.
by,plaintiffs and the other sohlnet members had stationed themselves on stanford ranch road.they carried large placards,and handed out literature to drivers and students.traffic was backed up nearly two miles.one sohlnet member repeatedly pushed the pedestrian signal in order to stop cars.another stood on a median until directed to the sidewalk by a police officer.another member,carrying a large poster,obstructed the sidewalk,requiring students to walk in the street to avoid being confronted with the leaflets.a police officer diverted a group of students who appeared to be intent on confronting sohlnet members.many students were late to class.
thereafter,cody wrote to the school superintendent to ask for a hearing and to seek permission for future access.the superintendent met with cody on june and discussed the matter.cody did not receive any formal communication resolving the question of access to the campus nor did she pursue the matter with the school board.
instead,plaintiffs filed a complaint,asserting that the school refusal to allow them to register and to have access to the campus violated the constitutional rights of sohlnet members.after a bench trial,the court entered judgment in favor of defendants.the court determined that school officials acted reasonably in refusing access to plaintiffs,noting common sense dictates that the purpose of our high schools is to educate our youth in a safe environment under the direction of trained professionals preparing them for adult life in the work force or continued college education.it is hard to imagine how this purpose can be advanced by a barrage of special interest groups using the high school campus to advance their own viewpoint as noble as the cause may be.surely,equal time must be granted for opposing viewpoints.the court added that administrators had a reasonable basis to believe the visitors presence would be disruptive,and rejected plaintiffs claim that only conduct that was physically disruptive and unlawful under other statutes could be deemed disruptive.the court also rejected plaintiffs claims that the school registration policies and procedures were otherwise unconstitutional or deficient.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
istatutory scheme and rocklin unified school district policies 
in order to place plaintiffs claims in the proper context,we review the relevant statutory scheme and the policies of the rusd.
in,the california legislature enacted chapter of title of part i of the penal code,a comprehensive scheme relating to access to school premises.stats,ch.the legislature decried the fact that violent crimes on public school grounds are often committed by outsiders unauthorized to be on the premises,subds.a,c further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code,and further stated that s chool officials and law enforcement officers,in seeking to control these persons,have been hindered by the lack of effective legislation restricting the access of unauthorized persons to school grounds and providing appropriate criminal sanctions for unauthorized entry,subd.a.
the legislature declared that this new statutory scheme was intended to safeguard the teachers,other employees,students,and property of public schools,subd.b.this provision continues the legislature recognizes the right to visit school grounds for legitimate nonviolent purposes and does not intend by this enactment to interfere with the exercise of that right.
section,subdivision c further provides,in relevant part it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to promote the safety and security of the public schools by restricting and conditioning the access of unauthorized persons to school campuses and to thereby implement the provisions of section of article of the california constitution which guarantee all students and staff the inalienable constitutional right to attend safe,secure,and peaceful public schools.it is also the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to infringe upon the legitimate exercise of constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech and expression which may be expressed through rallies,demonstrations,and other forms of expression which may be appropriately engaged in by students and nonstudents in a campus setting.
to meet these safety concerns,section provides no outsider shall enter or remain on school grounds during school hours without having registered with the principal or designee,except to proceed expeditiously to the office of the principal or designee for the purpose of registering.an outsider is defined as anyone other than a student,parent or guardian of a student,a school district employee or officer,a public employee required to be on school grounds,anyone on school grounds at the request of the school,a representative of a school employee organization engaged in representational activities,an elected public official,or certain media personnel,subd.a.school hours extend from one hour before classes begin until one hour after classes end,subd.c.
section,subdivision a,a statute of particular importance in this case,provides the principal or his or her designee may refuse to register an outsider if he or she has a reasonable basis for concluding that the outsider presence or acts would disrupt the school,its students,its teachers,or its employees would result in damage to property or would result in the distribution or use of unlawful or controlled substances.subdivision b of this statute further provides the principal,his or her designee,or school security officer may revoke an outsider registration if he or she has a reasonable basis for concluding that the outsider presence on school grounds would interfere or is interfering with the peaceful conduct of the activities of the school,or would disrupt or is disrupting the school,its students,its teachers or its other employees.
it is a misdemeanor for a person to enter or remain on school grounds without having registered,after having been denied registration,or after registration has been revoked,subd.a.however,these criminal provisions shall not be utilized to impinge upon the lawful exercise of constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech or assembly,subd.b.
a person whose registration was denied or revoked may request a hearing before the principal or superintendent.this request must be made within five days,and the hearing must be held within seven days of receipt of the request.
this statutory scheme thus has two areas of focus student safety and the protection against disruptions.other statutes afford similar safeguards.for example,education code section authorizes a principal to request that an outsider that is,someone who is not a student,parent of students,employee or officer of the district leave public school grounds if that person continued presence would be disruptive of,or would interfere with,classes or other activities of the public school program,subd.a.section similarly provides for the removal of an outsider who is committing any act likely to interfere with the peaceful conduct of the activities of the campus or facility of a public school.
rusd adopted board policy and administrative procedure to address the same safety and operational concerns.board policy encourages and interested members of the community to visit the schools and view the educational program and directs the superintendent to establish procedures to facilitate visits.the policy further directs to ensure the safety of students and staff and avoid potential disruptions,all visitors shall register immediately upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session.
administrative procedure outlines the mechanisms to meet these policy objectives.it provides each person excludes currently enrolled students,employees of the school district,or other individuals performing services as per agreements with authorized district representatives desiring to visit a school during school hours must secure permission upon arriving on the campus from the school for the visitation.high school hours extend from to 
this administrative procedure further provides that any person other than the following is considered a visitor and required to register upon entering school premises during school hours.a student of the school,unless currently under suspension.a governing board member or district employee who is required to be on school grounds,or any authorized person who is on school grounds at the district school request.
administrative procedure outlines the process for registration and reiterates the provisions of section,stating the principal or designee may refuse to register any visitor if reasonably concludes that the visitor presence or acts would disrupt the school,students,or employees would result in damage to property or would result in the distribution or use of a controlled substance.the principal or designee or school security officer may revoke a visitor registration if was a reasonable basis for concluding that the visitor presence on school grounds would interfere or is interfering with the peaceful conduct of school activities or would disrupt or is disrupting the school,students or staff.
the policy concludes any person who is denied registration or whose registration is revoked may appeal to the superintendent or designee by submitting within five days a district complaint form and by following the district complaint procedure administrative policy.the final segment in the appeal process is for the board of trustees to consider the appeal.
administrative policy specifies that if a complainant is not satisfied with the superintendent decision,the matter may be appealed to the board of trustees,which may decide to hear or not to hear the complaint.
access to school premises and registration requirement 
plaintiffs assert that because they sought to come onto the rocklin high school campus for the legitimate purpose of distributing literature,school officials were required to give them permission to register to be on campus.we disagree.
plaintiffs emphasize the legislature express intent that the school access statutes not be interpreted as contravening constitutionally protected rights.they point particularly to section,subdivision c,which notes,in part it is also the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to infringe upon the legitimate exercise of constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech and expression which may be expressed through rallies,demonstrations,and other forms of expression which may be appropriately engaged in by students and nonstudents in a campus setting.italics added.
this reference to nonstudents,plaintiffs argue,means that they have the right to register for the purposes of distributing literature on campus.
the statutes do not lend themselves to such an interpretation.that a restriction on access to a high school campus shall not be construed to infringe on the legitimate exercise of constitutional rights merely begs the question as to the scope of those constitutional rights.nothing in any of these statutes authorizes unrestricted access to school grounds for outsiders seeking to disseminate information relating to societal issues of the day.while there may be times when nonstudents can appropriately engage in forms of expression in a campus setting for example,when attending campus events to which the community has been invited,nothing in section or related statutes suggests that school officials must permit outsiders to register and enter campus grounds.indeed,as we discuss at greater length below,the entire statutory scheme,with its emphasis on school safety and the avoidance of disruption of the school,compels a contrary conclusion.
in support of their claims,plaintiffs cite three cases braxton municipal court cal d,braxton,people hirst d.hirst,and mandel municipal court d.mandel.each is readily distinguishable from the situation before us.braxton construed another statute,section,which restricted access to a university,an institution which braxton noted serves the time honored role as a center for free intellectual debate.braxton,supra,cal d at.as we explain,the high school setting of the present case does not involve such a forum,and consequently the rules articulated in braxton do not apply.additionally,the statute at issue in braxton was far broader than that implicated in the present case.section was held to apply not only to outsiders,but also to students and their own first amendment rights,and therefore gave rise to concerns distinct from those we face here.see braxton,supra,cal d at.indeed,the opinion in braxton focused on the potential application of the statute to students.id.at,fn.
hirst and mandel narrowly construed a criminal proscription against loitering on school grounds,a statute that,again,covered any person and did not distinguish between students and outsiders.see.hirst and mandel also predate the federal cases that establish different parameters for public and nonpublic forums.moreover,we note that hirst is actually in line with the rusd policies,as it concluded that those who are not students and are not otherwise engaged in the normal operations of a school must be subject to such regulations governing a school and its property as the legislature or the school administration may impose.hirst,supra,d at.the court clarified that school authorities have the right to forbid handbilling on school grounds by person
