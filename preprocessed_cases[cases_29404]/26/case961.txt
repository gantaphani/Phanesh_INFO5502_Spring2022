depending on whose version of this case you hear,defendant judy green is either a dedicated public schoolteacher who spent the years before her conviction working to help impoverished schools across the country,or the mastermind of a massive fraudulent scheme that bilked the federal government out of almost million.the government takes the latter view,and charged green with defrauding,a federal communications commission fcc program that funds technology projects at schools and libraries.green insists the former is true,maintaining that she is guilty of nothing more than helping schools maximize their federal funding by exploiting loopholes in the rules and regulations.a jury eventually convicted green of all counts brought against her eleven counts of wire fraud,nine counts of bid rigging,one count of conspiracy to commit bid rigging u,and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud.because we conclude that green actions amounted to fraud on the federal government,we affirm her conviction.
background 
i.the program 
at the center of this case is a part of the fcc universal service program,known as the schools and libraries program,or for short.funded by a universal service fee placed on telecommunications providers and generally passed along to consumers,the universal service program is designed to promote telecommunications access for,rural,or otherwise underserved communities.see.as its official name implies,uses its portion of universal service funding to finance telecommunications projects at school and libraries.
the schools and libraries division sld of the universal service administrative company usac is charged with distributing annual budget of billion.sld accepts applications from schools for technology projects and subsidizes those projects on a sliding percent to percent of a project by the percentage of the school students that participate in the national school lunch program.sld is required to give funding priority to applications for the provision of telecommunications services,voice mail,and internet access.g.the most economically disadvantaged schools have priority for the remainder of the funds.id.
as with any sizeable program,is governed by a complicated and,at times,less than clear set of rules and regulations.two program rules are particularly relevant to this case.first,sld has detailed rules governing what equipment and services may be purchased with funds.in general terms,sld will subsidize the purchase and installation of equipment needed to establish a school connectivity.enduser devices that are needed to actually make use of that connectivity,such as computers,telephones,or fax machines,are not eligible for a subsidy by sld.in jargon,these categories are referred to as eligible and ineligible equipment,respectively.
second,because only subsidizes a portion of the cost of eligible equipment and services,a school must have the ability to cover the remaining balance of an project costs.thus,the school must be able to obtain any ineligible equipment that is necessary to make use of the project.the school must also have the wherewithal to cover its,that portion of the project cost that will not be covered by the subsidy.
when a school wants to apply for funds,it must first fill out an fcc form,identifying the technology project for which it seeks funding.the school provides this form to sld,which posts it on a website to solicit bids from vendors.after the bidding is complete,the school selects the winning bid.based upon its chosen bid,the school submits a detailed application for funding to sld,specifying the equipment and services to be purchased from each vendor.the application requires the school to set out the total cost of the project,the amount of eligible and ineligible equipment included in that cost,the subsidy rate for which the school qualifies,and finally,based on the above information,the ultimate amount of funding the school seeks from sld.
sld reviews this detailed application to ensure that it is in compliance with regulations.occasionally,sld conducts a review and asks a school to provide more information about its application.once it has completed its review,sld either approves or denies the school funding request.
ii.the fraudulent scheme 
green first learned of in the,after spending more than thirty years as a public school teacher in new york city and los angeles.she saw an opportunity in the program and,in,left teaching to set up a consulting business to help guide schools and school districts through byzantine application process.green marketed her services to the poorest of schools almost all of her clients were eligible for the maximum percent subsidy.
according to the evidence introduced at trial,much of which was undisputed,green obtained most of her clients by approaching school administrators at conferences held by the national alliance of black school educators.at these conferences,green,or one of her,promised to help school districts obtain funding for significant technology projects.even better,they promised that the schools would be forgiven their percent,and that the contractors would donate to the school districts thousands of dollars in bonus,such as equipment,that was ineligible for funds.needless to say,a number of school districts leapt on board.
once hired as a consultant,green helped her clients design their technology projects and filled out the sld forms to solicit project bids from vendors.at the same time,green approached potential contractors to assemble a team capable of performing the projects to her specifications.green decided what services and equipment the contractors would supply,dictated the bonus items the contractors were required to provide at no charge to the school,and informed the contractors that the schools would not be paying their share of the projects costs.the contractors then submitted bids based upon green specifications.
after receiving the bids,the school districts chose green contractors to implement their technology projects.because green had arranged the bids in advance,her chosen contractors had inflated their bids to cover the costs of the bonus equipment and services green required them to provide.one witness,for example,testified that the bid green arranged,and that his school district ultimately selected,was three to four times higher than the other bids that the school district received.
finally,when the school districts submitted their funding requests to sld,green took steps to ensure that sld would not ask questions about the projects.if sld did ask questions,green took steps to ensure that it would be provided with answers that minimized the chances it would follow up with further review.for example,green wrote equipment lists to hide the fact that potentially ineligible equipment was included within the projects scopes.she instructed the school districts to tell sld that they planned on paying their share of the projects costs,even though they did not.and she altered school budget information to show that the schools could afford their.
green conduct was eventually discovered by usac.she was later indicted in a count indictment.the first twenty counts charged green with wire fraud and bid rigging in connection with completed projects at eleven school districts across the country the final two counts were conspiracy counts based upon uncompleted technology projects at an additional fifteen school districts.
following a trial,a jury convicted green of all charges against her.the district court sentenced her to a term of imprisonment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
green challenges her conviction,as well as her sentence.we affirm.
wire fraud convictions 
green overarching contention on appeal is that her actions were not fraudulent because they were not prohibited by the rules and regulations that governed the program during the time period charged in the indictment.specifically,green raises three challenges to her wire fraud convictions,all of which are variations on this common theme the rules and regulations were so poorly set out during the relevant time period that her conviction violated her due process right to fair warning that her conduct was criminal her convictions relied on regulations that took effect after the conduct charged in the indictment,violating the ex post facto clause of the constitution and the district court instructions erroneously gave the jury unfettered discretion to decide the legal question of which regulations were in effect during green purported fraud.
we review questions of law de novo.see united states kaczynski,cir we review de novo questions of federal constitutional law united states,cir whether a jury instruction misstates elements of a statutory crime is a question of law reviewed de novo.we conclude that the offense of wire fraud does not require that green conduct violated a rule or regulation of the program thus,her specific challenges fail.
surprisingly,few courts have considered the precise issue green raises whether actions that are not otherwise expressly prohibited can nonetheless violate the federal fraud statutes.indeed,the government,while proclaiming that green arguments are obviously incorrect,has not cited a single case in support of its position.
we have been unable to find a case in which a court has considered the interplay between the fraud and a federal rule or regulation.a number of courts,however,have considered the related issue of whether the crime of wire fraud must be predicated on a violation of state law.we have addressed this issue,albeit briefly,on at least one prior occasion.in united states louderman,cir,we disposed of the argument in a single sentence furthermore,state law is irrelevant in determining whether a certain course of conduct is violative of the wire fraud statute.id.at united states weyhrauch,cir citing louderman and concluding in an honest services fraud case that we have never limited the reach of the federal fraud statutes only to conduct that violates state law,cert.granted in part.
the eighth circuit recently reached the same conclusion.in united states frost,cir,the defendant,a certified public accountant,acted as one of two trustees for a charitable trust.id.at.at some point the defendant began withdrawing money from the trust for his personal use without the consent of the other trustee,placing the other trustee name or initials on invoices or checks when it was required.id.he was convicted of both mail and wire fraud.id.at.
frost appealed his conviction,arguing in part that his conduct was not fraudulent because arkansas law permitted him to withdraw reasonable compensation from the trust without the other trustee consent.id.at.because the government could not prove that his actions were illegal,he argued,his convictions for mail and wire fraud should be overturned.id.at.the eighth circuit rejected this argument,stating we do not agree that the government,having proved beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offense,must also prove a violation of arkansas law.see also united states williams,cir per curiam a conviction for mail fraud does not depend upon a violation of state law.united states scallion,cir united states bush,cir.
in a related context,the supreme court has also rejected the argument that the elements of wire or mail fraud include the violation of a separate law or regulation.in schmuck united states,the defendant was convicted of mail fraud based upon his scheme to roll back the odometers on automobiles and sell them to dealerships in wisconsin.id.at.on appeal,the defendant argued that odometer tampering was a lesser included offense to the mail fraud charge,and that the jury should have therefore been given a offense instruction.id.at.the court rejected this argument,concluding that the crime of mail fraud was a distinct crime that did not rely on proof of odometer tampering 
turning to the facts of this case,we agree with the court of appeals that the elements of the offense of odometer tampering are not a subset of the elements of the crime of mail fraud.there are two elements in mail fraud having devised or intending to devise a scheme to defraud or to perform specified fraudulent acts,and use of the mail for the purpose of executing,or attempting to execute,the scheme or specified fraudulent acts.the offense of odometer tampering includes the element of knowingly and willfully causing an odometer to be altered.this element is not a subset of any element of mail fraud.knowingly and willfully tampering with an odometer is not identical to devising or intending to devise a fraudulent scheme.
based on the above,we believe it is settled that wire fraud does not require proof that the defendant conduct violated a separate law or regulation,be it federal or state law.rather,wire fraud has only three elements a scheme to defraud use of the wires in furtherance of the scheme and a specific intent to deceive or defraud.united states shipsey,cir.the scheme to defraud must only include an affirmative,material misrepresentation.united states benny,cir.a defendant conduct need not otherwise be illegal in the sense that the government must also prove that the defendant conduct violated a specific statute or regulation.
we reject green contention that if we unmoor her wire fraud conviction from the rules and regulations,her conviction will be based on nothing more than her having deprived the federal government of its right to make an informed decision.to support this argument,green invokes the honest services fraud cases,which simply are inapplicable to her case.although the law of honest services fraud remains unsettled,the debate over the reach of the crime of honest services fraud need not detain us.for at the heart of that debate is the concern that honest services fraud does not require any form of tangible harm thus,it has been argued that there is no principled limit to the reach of the statute.see,united states sorich,cir g iven the amorphous and nature of,courts have felt the need to find limiting principles,cert.denied.united states urciuoli,cir the central problem is that the concept of honest services is vague and undefined by the statute.see also sorich united states.scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari but where,as here,financial harm to the victim is an integral part of the offense,there has never been any suggestion that a further limitation on the fraud statutes is required.
that green scheme involved millions of dollars in federal funds was sufficient to bring it squarely within the heartland of the federal fraud statutes.in such a case,the government needed only to prove a scheme to defraud it was not required to establish that the scheme separately violated the regulations.accordingly,we reject green contention that her conduct needed to violate a rule or regulation of the program in order to be fraudulent.under circuit precedent,as discussed in part ii,below,proof of such a violation is not an element of the fraud offense.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
green also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for all but one of her counts of conviction.we review de novo sufficiency of the evidence claims.united states overton,cir.evidence is sufficient to support a conviction unless,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict,no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
wire fraud counts 
in order for the jury to convict green of wire fraud,it had to find a scheme to defraud use of the wires in furtherance of the scheme and a specific intent to deceive or defraud.shipsey,at.on appeal,green challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to the first and third elements.
green,however,did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for her wire fraud convictions below.w hen a defendant does not preserve a claim of sufficiency of the evidence by failing to make a motion for acquittal at the close of the evidence,the review is deferential,requiring reversal only upon plain error or to prevent a manifest injustice.united states delgado,cir.thus,we review only for plain error.
we find no such manifest injustice here.the government introduced ample evidence of both a scheme to defraud and intent to defraud,much of which was undisputed.green,as well as representatives from the school districts she worked with,testified that the school districts were promised that the entire project would be paid for out of funds,and that the school districts would obtain substantial bonus items for free.these promises were never revealed to sld.further,green testified about her own role in the scheme and admitted to much of the charged conduct.for example,green admitted to editing equipment lists to prevent sld from learning that the projects included potentially ineligible equipment.she also acknowledged that she took steps to conceal from sld the fact that the schools would not be paying their.
in light of the fact that much of the evidence against her was undisputed,green argument does not focus on the amount of evidence against her.rather,she challenges the interpretation of that evidence.green contends that there is an innocent explanation for her she was helping impoverished schools by getting contractors to donate equipment and to waive the portion of the contract price that the school was required to pay.see delgado,at w hen there is an innocent explanation for a defendant conduct as well as one that suggests that the defendant was engaged in wrongdoing,the government must produce evidence that would allow a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the latter explanation is the correct one.because she was merely exploiting loopholes in the application process,green contends,her conduct was not criminal.
we fail to see the innocent explanation that green describes.even accepting that her ultimate motives were laudable,she concealed material facts from the federal government in an attempt to induce it to fund her projects.that,standing alone,is fraud.
this case is reminiscent of united states baum,cir,in which the defendant was charged with wire fraud based upon a complicated mortgage fraud scheme 
baum acted as the agent for the buyer,who was seeking a home loan in the subprime market because of weak credit.the buyer generally could not afford the down payment required by the lender from to of the cost of the home,so the buyer borrowed that money from baum and his associates.baum client agreed to buy the home at the seller listed price,which often had been reduced over time as the home failed to sell but baum and his client obtained the consent of the seller and the seller agent to list an inflated price on the purchase contract.the price inflation did not benefit the seller because baum prepared an addendum to the purchase contract requiring the seller to pay the excess over the listed price to a named company for remodeling or repairing the home.apparently unbeknownst to the seller,the company was merely a bank account used to funnel the money to provide cash to the purchaser and to pay baum and his associates for their services and for advancing the down payment.
the mortgage lender,of course,was not informed of the true nature of the transaction.
baum was convicted of mortgage fraud.one of his arguments for reversal on appeal was that the failure to have remodeling or repair work done on the homes amounts merely to breach of contract,not a crime.id.the tenth circuit disagreed the fraud was that the mortgage lender was led to believe that it was lending money to purchase a home for x,not to purchase a home for x y and then undertake y worth of remodeling or repairs.id.at.
as in baum,green fraudulent scheme led sld to believe it was funding something other than what it was actually funding.the applications green helped prepare did not disclose the true nature of the agreements she had reached with the vendors.instead,they distorted the full scope of the projects,concealing the added costs and the bonus equipment the school districts would receive.in baum formulation,green actions led sld to believe it was funding the listed equipment for x,not x y with the school district receiving y worth of extra equipment and was not funding its own.
there was ample evidence to support the wire fraud convictions.no plain error occurred.
conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud count 
in order to convict green of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,the jury had to find an agreement to engage in criminal activity,one or more overt acts taken to implement the agreement,and the requisite intent to commit the substantive crime.united states montgomery,cir.in a conspiracy charge,t he agreement need not be explicit it is sufficient if the conspirators knew or had reason to know of the scope of the conspiracy and that their own benefits depended on the success of the venture.id.the agreement may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.united states hubbard,cir.
the conspiracy count was based upon green relationship with richard favara.favara was the owner of expedition networks,a technology company that worked with green to bid on projects.he also was the founder of the american education alliance the alliance,a nonprofit started with the goal of providing computers to underprivileged schools.
favara testified that in he worked with green to secure fifteen projects for expedition networks.as part of this process,favara agreed to allow green to become director of grants for the alliance,despite the fact that it had no assets.green intended to use the alliance to award bogus grants to schools to strengthen their applications for funding.under this scheme,the alliance would purport to make a grant to a poor school district so the district could claim that it had the assets to make its.green would ensure that the school selected expedition networks to perform the project.favara would then funnel a portion of the contract payments from expedition networks to the alliance,which would use the money for the grant it had awarded to the school district.those funds would eventually be returned to expedition networks in the form of the school.
to help green convince the school districts to hire her,favara agreed to let green post on the alliance website a falsified financial overview of the nonprofit.according to favara,green wanted to post this information to make the company look stronger when she was talking to schools.favara agreed to green request because expedition needed the business to breathe financially.
this testimony established that both green and favara were committed to the common goal of obtaining the fifteen contracts,and that both agreed to utilize false financial information to achieve that goal.this is sufficient evidence for the jury to find an agreement existed.see montgomery,at.
there was also sufficient evidence that green had the intent to defraud.evidence introduced at trial established that green knew the alliance had no assets,but that she nonetheless had favara post the false financial information on its website.further,green proposed to make grants to schools to cover their out of the inflated profits that expedition networks would receive from the contracts it received.she even submitted falsified letters to usac informing it of grants that the alliance had awarded,even though no such grants had been made.this was sufficient to support the jury finding of intent to defraud.
bid rigging counts 
finally,green challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the counts.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude that the evidence at trial easily supported the jury finding that green participated in multiple conspiracies.
section of the sherman act provides every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.the section does not prohibit all restraints of trade,but only those that are unreasonable.united states brown,cir.generally,the question whether a restraint of trade is unreasonable involves a detailed factual inquiry.id.this analysis is unnecessary,however,when the restraint falls into a category of agreements which have been determined to be per se illegal.such agreements are those that always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output.id.quoting northwest wholesale station
