background 
on august,shanklin,an woman,began teaching marketing education for the pattonville school district in louis,missouri.shanklin taught at the positive school,an alternative high school for at risk students.
from to,mike black black was the assistant principal of the positive school and shanklin immediate supervisor.during his supervision of shanklin,black rated shanklin performance as acceptable.marc montgomery montgomery replaced black as the assistant principal at the start of the school year.montgomery immediately had concerns regarding shanklin performance.in particular,montgomery observed shanklin classes and was troubled shanklin did not use a variety of teaching methods effectively,demonstrate an ability to communicate effectively with students,or manage student behavior in a constructive manner.notwithstanding these concerns,montgomery rated shanklin performance as acceptable in her formative evaluation.
during the school year,montgomery reprimanded shanklin on two occasions in march,montgomery reprimanded shanklin for using the word fucking during a confrontation with a student and in may,montgomery reprimanded shanklin for distributing an individual personal income tax form to the class for instructional purposes without the individual consent.shanklin admitted to cursing and to disseminating the tax form without the individual prior knowledge or consent.montgomery summative evaluation of shanklin for the school year stated shanklin needed improvement in four areas using a variety of teaching materials effectively,demonstrating an ability to communicate effectively with students,managing student behavior in a constructive manner,and demonstrating positive interpersonal relationships with students.on may,montgomery placed shanklin on a performance improvement plan pip,which was designed to help shanklin cure her four areas of deficiency.
montgomery reprimanded shanklin twice more during the school year.montgomery first reprimanded shanklin in october,after students complained shanklin told them they could not go to college given their past patterns.the second reprimand occurred in may,after a student complained shanklin called the student a dumb shit and told him,if shanklin was not a teacher,she would knock the student upside his head with a stick.after montgomery observed shanklin classroom on several occasions during the school year,montgomery did not believe shanklin had cured the deficiencies noted in the pip.at the end of the school year,montgomery met with shanklin to implement another pip.since it was the end of the school year,the school administrators decided not to implement the pip until the start of the next school year.
in the spring of,the board created a new business education teacher position at the positive school.when the board was unable to fill the new position with a qualified individual,the board transferred shanklin to the position because shanklin was qualified for the position.the board then hired a white female to teach marketing education.on october,shanklin filed a grievance with the board regarding the transfer.on october,shanklin filed a race discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the superintendent of schools,hugh kinney kinney,denied shanklin grievance on november,finding the board followed the applicable policies relating to teacher assignments.in his denial letter,kinney further express ed a concern regarding shanklin relationships with students,and suggested a pattern is developing which is inconsistent with a productive learning environment.on november,shanklin accepted kinney decision.shanklin voluntarily dismissed her eeoc charge on february.
in october,montgomery issued shanklin a second pip.shanklin refused to sign the pip until december.in the meantime,shanklin performance deficiencies continued.on october,montgomery reprimanded shanklin for cursing in class.a few days later,montgomery again reprimanded shanklin,this time for tape recording her class after she was directed not to use a tape recorder.
on november,the board,through kinney,issued shanklin a warning letter,notice of deficiencies,specifying several items of incompetency,inefficiency and insubordination.the notice of deficiencies advised shanklin the board believed shanklin conduct reflects a mental condition making shanklin unfit to instruct or associate with children.the notice of deficiencies further warned that if her performance did not improve within thirty days,the board would recommend shanklin dismissal.during shanklin probationary period,she failed to cure her deficiencies.shanklin,on the other hand,expressed concerns about montgomery supervision and about not having enough time to resolve her deficiencies.
rather than beginning the process to discharge shanklin,the board,in january,issued shanklin a second notice of deficiencies,giving her an additional five months to correct her deficiencies.during the probationary period,a team evaluated shanklin performance.at shanklin request,the board removed montgomery from shanklin evaluation team.shanklin requested assistant principals sharron washington washington or vince grippi be placed on the evaluation team.the board placed washington,an,on shanklin evaluation team.the board also granted shanklin request that her classes be videotaped.
the evaluation team observed shanklin classes by announced and unannounced classroom visits as well as by reviewing videotapes of shanklin classes.after reviewing shanklin classroom performance,each evaluator expressed specific concerns about shanklin performance.based on the evaluators observations,on june,kinney issued a statement of charges,alleging shanklin was incompetent and inefficient in failing to maintain satisfactory relationships with students and failing to utilize effective instructional methods,and insubordinate in failing to comply with board policy.
pursuant to shanklin request,the board conducted a hearing regarding the statement of charges.at the hearing,shanklin was represented by counsel,and her counsel adverse witnesses and presented evidence in shanklin defense.all three members of shanklin evaluation team testified they had concerns about shanklin performance,and each evaluator recommended the board discharge shanklin.after considering the evidence presented at the hearing,the board unanimously voted to discharge shanklin.
shanklin sued the board in federal court,alleging race,sex,and age discrimination harassment and retaliation.shanklin later abandoned all her claims except race discrimination and retaliation.the board filed a motion for summary judgment on shanklin remaining claims.in opposing summary judgment,shanklin submitted exhibits,many of which were unauthenticated.shanklin states her supporting affidavits were inadvertently left out of the paper filing.the board filed a motion to strike shanklin unauthenticated exhibits,which shanklin did not oppose.the district court granted the board motion to strike,because shanklin submitted no affidavits in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.without any affidavits to authenticate shanklin exhibits,the district court considered shanklin own sworn statements and the board authenticated evidence.
citing the dearth of evidence supporting shanklin claims,the district court granted the board motion for summary judgment.with regard to her race discrimination claim,the district court held shanklin failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination,and to show the board reasons for discharging her were pretextual.as to shanklin retaliation claim,the district c
