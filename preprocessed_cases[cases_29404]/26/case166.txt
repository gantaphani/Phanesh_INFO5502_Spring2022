richard riley,originally named as,in his official capacity as the of the united states department of education doe,appealed from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york owen,in favor of beth medrash eeyun hatalmud bmeh,an educational institution devoted to judaic and rabbinical studies.the judgment directed payment with interest of the portion of pell grant funds that was withheld by the doe,pursuant to a settlement agreement,pending resolution of bmeh ultimately unsuccessful challenge to the termination of its eligibility to participate in the pell grant program.the district court determined that the funds withheld should be treated as a bond posted by bmeh under the security provision of a temporary restraining order previously issued but subsequently dissolved.we disagree with that determination for the reasons that follow.
background 
the pell grant program the program,established under title iv of the higher education act of,provides grants to assist students in need of financial aid for meeting the costs of their education.see.under the program,the doe has discretion to provide funds,through several different methods,to institutions participating in the program.see id.a.the method of funding for bmeh was called the reimbursement method,in which the school paid student awards from institutional funds and later sought reimbursement from the doe.id.d.
in february,the doe issued a notice for the termination of bmeh eligibility to participate in the pell grant program.the basis for the termination was the doe finding that bmeh did not prepare its students for employment in a recognized occupation,a requirement for pell grant eligibility.hatalmud riley,ro,wl,at.on july,bmeh brought an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york challenging the doe decision that it would not pay bmeh requests for reimbursement pending an administrative decision on whether bmeh eligibility was properly terminated.when bmeh brought its action,it simultaneously sought a temporary restraining order tro requiring the doe to pay two requests for reimbursement that previously had been submitted and remained unpaid.
at the hearing on the tro,the district court,in granting bmeh reimbursement requests,stated i t seems to me that it is in order to direct that payments be forthwith resumed,made or otherwise.the doe thereupon requested a bond,in accordance with.c,to secure the doe for any costs and damages it might suffer if the tro were found to be wrongfully issued.bmeh counsel suggested that the doe hold back ten percent of the payments as a bond because t here are loans to everyone.adopting this suggestion,the district court directed the doe to withhold ten percent of the ordered reimbursements as a rule c bond.on july,the court issued a written order granting the tro,requiring the doe to release all monies due to bmeh,and,i n lieu of a bond,permitting the doe to withhold ten percent of the monies currently held by it.the order also scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction sought by bmeh to require future reimbursement payments pending trial.on july,prior to any further proceedings,the parties resolved their dispute in its entirety and entered into a settlement agreement.
under the terms of the settlement agreement,the doe admitted neither the factual allegations in bmeh complaint nor liability on account of any of the facts or circumstances alleged in the complaint.the parties agreed to seek expedited proceedings in the pending administrative proceedings relating to the doe proposed termination of bmeh participation in the pell grant program.the doe also undertook to pay otherwise eligible claims for reimbursement submitted by bmeh during the pendency of the termination proceedings,except that the doe would be entitled to retain ten percent of the amount thereof pending final agency decision.
the parties agreed that the tro would be dissolved and that no force and effect would be given to the findings made on the record by the district court in connection with the tro application.finally,the parties stipulated that the action be dismissed with prejudice and without costs and that any dispute relating to compliance with the terms of the settlement be resolved by the district court without the need to file a new action.the stipulation of settlement was so ordered by the district court on august.
thereafter,an administrative law judge alj held a hearing on bmeh eligibility to participate in the pell grant program.on april,the alj issued a ruling that bmeh was not eligible to participate in the program.hatalmud riley,ro,wl,at may.following a remand by the secretary of education for a further elaboration of the alj decision,the alj issued a more detailed decision on september.in the decision on remand,the alj reiterated his determination that bmeh was properly terminated from the pell grant program,finding that,although some students have found employment as teachers in the field of orthodox jewish education,these programs were neither intended nor designed to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.in re hatalmud,eoha lexis,at dep t of educ.june.the alj accordingly concluded that bmeh did not meet the definition of an eligible institution.on january,the alj decision was affirmed by the secretary of education as the final agency decision,and bmeh participation in the pell grant program was terminated as of that date.the secretary termination decision was upheld by the district court in an order dated april.hatalmud riley,ro,wl,at.bmeh did not appeal from that order.
meanwhile,on march,the doe had issued a final program review determination fprd,concluding that bmeh was liable to the doe for,which the doe had calculated to be the amount of federal funds disbursed to bmeh under the pell grant program since bmeh began its participation.the doe ruled that,because bmeh programs were ineligible for the pell grant program,bmeh was required to refund to the doe all federal funds it had received under the program.on april,bmeh advised the doe that its calculation was incorrect and that the liability should be reduced because the doe had included the that the doe had retained pursuant to the settlement agreement.bmeh did not assert any right to the.the doe agreed with bmeh calculation,and,on may,issued a revised fprd assessing a liability of,reducing the prior assessment by to account for the retained amount.the doe further agreed to reduce the liability to based on additional calculations submitted by bmeh.
on june,bmeh challenged the doe liability assessment and requested an administrative hearing.in its statement of issues and facts in dispute,bmeh renewed its argument that its programs were eligible for federal funds and further argued that it would be unfair to require it to repay the funds because the money was received when it believed its educational program was eligible.bmeh did not in its statement assert any claim for,or otherwise contest,the doe right to keep the retained pursuant to the settlement agreement.for its part,the doe continued to take the position that bmeh program had been ineligible from its inception,and,therefore,that the federal funds had been improperly spent and must be returned.
on june,the chief administrative law judge,in a written opinion,addressed the issues raised in bmeh appeal.the chief judge reaffirmed,on the grounds of res judicata,the previous determination that bmeh was ineligible to participate in the pell grant program.hatalmud,eoha lexis,at.however,the chief judge conclude d that absent any evidence of fraud or misleading information,and based on the fact that the statutory provision and the regulations in question are subject to varying interpretation,it would be unfair and impermissible,and possibly a violation of substantive due process,to direct repayment of the amount in issue.id.at.accordingly,the chief administrative judge ordered that beth medrash eeyun hatalmud is relieved of any obligation to repay the united states department of education the sum of.id.
