a wyoming jury found that a school superintendent in sheridan county had unconstitutionally discriminated against two administrators.the judge allowed the jury to award damages for the superintendent conduct against the school district but not against the superintendent himself.both the plaintiffs and the school district have appealed,requiring us to decide the scope of municipal liability and qualified immunity under.we conclude that the superintendent was not the final policymaker for the district,and therefore that the district is not liable to pay for his wrongdoing.we also conclude that in early,the discrimination at issue the basis of sexual not clearly established to be unconstitutional,and therefore that qualified immunity protects the superintendent from personal liability as well.thus,the plaintiffs are not entitled to damages against any of the defendants in this lawsuit.
background 
kathleen and kathryn roberts lived and worked together in sheridan,wyoming.worked as an assistant principal at an junior high school roberts was the principal of the middle school there.both were employed under a series of contracts.before moving to sheridan,they had lived in rock springs,where their personal relationship began.
in may,and roberts accompanied a school field trip to montana.afterward,superintendent craig dougherty received a complaint from parents who told him that their daughter had seen the couple holding hands and walking into a victoria secret store.and roberts later testified that this account was false,and dougherty also acknowledged that it did not sound like a likely story.app.nonetheless,that fall he discussed the complaint with each of them because,he said,he wanted to let them know that this complaint had occurred.id.
the content of these discussions was disputed at trial.according to roberts,dougherty called her into her own office where he was sitting in her chair and told her about the complaint.after she denied the incident,dougherty responded that he had called rock springs and he knew all about the two of them.app.she testified that he was angry,and that his face was red and his voice slightly raised.testified to a similar conversation dougherty also told her,i called rock springs and i know all about you two.app.he was angry and during this version of the conversation as well,and she felt that her job could be in jeopardy.app.in contrast,dougherty testified that he was not upset during these conversations,did not mention rock springs,and told roberts that her sexual orientation would never be an issue so long as he was superintendent.app.
matters rested there until,when the construction of a new school building and a reorganization of grades meant that several administrative positions would be moved or eliminated.instead of one school for grades six and seven and one for grades eight and nine,there was to be a single sixth,seventh,and middle school.ninth grade was moved to the high school.administrators at the eliminated schools,including and roberts,as well as some administrators at the high school,were required to submit applications and compete for positions at the new school.
over the first half of,and roberts both applied for jobs as assistant principals at the high school,and as principal and assistant principal at the new middle school.also applied for a job as elementary school principal.these applications did not go well.for the position as principal at the new middle school,roberts testified that she interviewed poorly for the position.app.testified that her interview was l ess than adequate.app.after the interview,no member of the hiring committee voted for roberts.oddly,in light of their status as the sole individually named defendants,dougherty and his assistant terry burgess were only supporters on the committee each listed her as his second choice.the committee recommended scott stults,who had been principal of the district highland park elementary school,lauded for its extremely high standardized test scores.the school district board of trustees hired him on the committee recommendation.to select stults assistant principal,the committee told stults to interview the three,roberts,and roberts assistant,kadera.after the interviews,stults selected kadera.plaintiffs applications for two positions as assistant principal at the high school were also unsuccessful.acknowledged that she was less qualified than the assistant principals who were selected,and roberts had no significant complaints about the process.app.
finally,unsuccessfully applied to be principal of highland park elementary.stults previous job.out of or applications,burgess gave to of those,including,to the hiring committee.dougherty testified that her application was the exact same as the one she had submitted unsuccessfully for the middle school,and that she had not given an indication about why she wanted to be at the elementary school.app.burgess testified that he stayed neutral on whether to interview her,and the committee decided not to.app.the district hired roberts to teach physical education for a year and the two later moved to lander,wyoming,and found work at schools there.
in october,they filed this lawsuit under and the fourteenth amendment against the board of trustees of the school district,dougherty in his individual and official capacities,and assistant superintendent terry burgess in his official capacity.the suit against dougherty in his personal capacity was dismissed on summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.although the district court found that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether dougherty actions had been unconstitutional,it held that the law governing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation had not been clearly established in and early,before the supreme court decision in lawrence texas,d,which arguably clarified the issue.
the other claims were all construed as a suit for municipal liability against the school district,to which qualified immunity does not apply.it proceeded to trial.the district court instructed the jury that it could decide,as a factual matter,that the district had delegated its policymaking authority to dougherty,in which case his conduct could subject the municipality to liability.after receiving this instruction,the jury found that the school district had violated the equal protection clause and awarded total damages of.the jury found no liability on the plaintiffs other claims,such as for violation of their rights to intimate association.
the school district appealed the verdict to this court.and roberts the grant of summary judgment for dougherty.
ii.municipal liability and policymaking authority 
while allows suits against individual state officials who have violated their constitutional rights,plaintiffs frequently wish to seek damages further up the chain of command.officials sued personally are shielded by qualified immunity,meaning that they are liable for damages only where they had fair warning of the illegality of their conduct.even when held liable they do not always have the money or the insurance to pay large judgments against them.the municipalities that employ them have more money and no immunity,so they are tempting targets for lawsuits when municipal officials have erred.section,however,rejects the tort principle of respondeat superior and does not subject municipalities to vicarious liability for the acts of their employees municipal taxpayers are liable only for the municipality own misdeeds.monell dep t of soc,d.
federal law forces municipal taxpayers to pay damages for official actions through municipal liability only if those edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy of the district.id.at.because the sheridan county school district had no official policy of discrimination,these plaintiffs must show that their rights were violated by one of the district final policymakers.simmons uintah health care special serv,cir.although the board made the final decision not to hire and roberts,the plaintiffs contend that final policymaking authority over the hiring decisions was delegated to the superintendent,who exercised it in an intentionally discriminatory manner.the plaintiffs do not contend that the hiring committees themselves were discriminatory,apart from any involvement from the superintendent.the district court treated the superintendent policymaking authority as a question of fact and presented it to the jury,which concluded that dougherty was the final policymaker of the district we must reverse this judgment because the question of dougherty final policymaking authority is a question of law,which should not have gone to the jury.the district court should have concluded that as a matter of law,dougherty did not make district hiring policy 
adjudicating policymaking authority 
the judge,not the jury,should determine who exercises final policymaking authority in a municipality.this issue was settled by the supreme court decision in jett dallas indep.sch,d.in jett,the supreme court held that allowing a jury to decide whether a school principal and superintendent could have been delegated final policymaking authority was manifest error.id.at.the court explained that it was incorrect to give this issue to a jury because the identity of those final policymakers whose conduct can create municipal liability is a question of state law.id.at.quoting city of louis praprotnik,d plurality opinion.it thus concluded that the identification of those officials whose decisions represent the official policy of the local governmental unit is itself a legal question to be resolved by the trial judge before the case is submitted to the jury.id.at.therefore,jury instructions regarding policymaking authority are inappropriate because the judge,not the jury,identifi es those officials whose wrongs can create municipal liability.id.
in adopting this standard,jett expressly rejected as unworkable the view the plaintiffs now advance.during the previous term in city of louis praprotnik,the court failed to produce a majority opinion explaining how final policymaking authority should be determined.justice brennan had argued in a concurring opinion that determinations of municipal liability should be based on the realities of municipal decisionmaking,which would entail a factual and practical inquiry into a municipality actual power structure.at.brennan,concurring in the judgment.the plurality,however,rejected justice brennan view,explaining that it would be capricious to hold a municipality responsible for every decision that is perceived as final through the lens of a particular factfinder evaluation of the city actual power structure.id.at.the plurality went on to say that a federal court would not be justified in assuming that municipal policymaking authority lies somewhere other than where the applicable law purports to put it.id.at.in jett,the court explained that it had taken the case to clarify the application of our decisions in louis praprotnik and pembaur cincinnati to the school district potential liability for the discriminatory actions of a principal.at.internal citations omitted.a majority then adopted the plurality opinion in praprotnik and squarely rejected the alternative of letting factfinders decide where final policymaking authority lies.id.at.
this rule is true to the logic of monell.because municipalities are responsible only for their own misdeeds,municipal taxpayers are liable only for those official actions that represent the municipality in a legal sense.monell,at.by ensuring that liability follows legal authority,jett provides incentives for cities to give final authority only to responsible officials.moreover,if municipal liability depended on the unpredictable results of a analysis of the actual power structure of each municipality sued,cities might be forced to insure broadly against potential misconduct by every significant official.the jett rule is more predictable and depends on a factor largely controlled by the.see praprotnik,at.municipalities can not be expected to predict how courts or juries will assess their actual power structures,and this uncertainty could easily lead to results that would be hard in practice to distinguish from the results of a regime governed by the doctrine of respondeat superior.thus jett ensures that cities are held liable only for their own choices about where to vest authority,as monell requires,not forced to provide mutual insurance against unforeseeable usurpations of power,as monell forbids.monell,at.quoting cong.globe,sess.statement of butler.
to be sure,as both jett and praprotnik acknowledged,this rule could in some cases allow a municipality to use legal forms to hide the function of its true policies.but the supreme court concluded that there is a different mechanism for guarding against this risk allowing plaintiffs to hold a municipality liable not only for the actions of its legal policymakers but also for its unwritten customs and policies.as praprotnik put it whatever analysis is used to identify municipal policymakers,egregious attempts by local government to insulate themselves from liability for unconstitutional policies are precluded by a separate doctrine t he court has long recognized that a plaintiff may be able to prove the existence of a widespread practice that,although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy,is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.at.emphasis added quoting adickes kress,d further internal quotation marks omitted.this doctrine is not at issue here.
our circuit has repeatedly adhered to jett holding.in ware unified school district,cir,decided the year after jett,we held that,as a matter of law,a kansas superintendent was not the final policymaker of the school district.because of the supreme court admonition that the identification of final decisionmakers must be done as a matter of law,we refused to consider evidence in the record that could be construed to support an inference that the board delegated its final authority.id.at.similarly,in jantz muci,cir,we rejected a claim that a kansas school principal,rather than the school board,had final policymaking authority over hiring decisions.we noted that while the district court found the principal to have virtual de facto hiring authority,the court did not discuss kansas law,and we reversed its decision.id.at.
despite the weight of this authority,the plaintiffs argue that this circuit decision in randle city of aurora,cir,establishes that juries can sometimes determine who has final policymaking authority.in randle,we held that a liquor licensing assistant fired by the city of aurora might be able to hold the city liable for the allegedly discriminatory actions of the city manager,finance director,and human resources director,because it was unclear whether those officials were the city final policymakers.id.at.in analyzing the issue,randle confirmed that final policymaking authority is a legal issue to be determined by the court.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,we refused to decide whether the city officials sued in that case had been delegated policymaking authority,because disputes of material fact preclude d a grant of summary judgment for the city.id.at.this disposition might seem to imply that issues of fact could be relevant to identifying officials with final policymaking authority.thus,the plaintiffs argue,the identification of those officials whose decisions represent the official policy of the local governmental unit,jett,at,may sometimes be resolved by the jury as a factual issue.
in light of the governing precedent and the details of the case,we do not think that the reference to material fact in randle should be read so expansively.another reading is equally plausible and would be more consistent with supreme court precedent.after the randle opinion referred to a dispute of material fact,at,it went on to describe a dispute that was legal,not factual.the decision explained that randle claim survived summary judgment because provisions in the city of aurora charter and a city personnel policy appeared to grant the city manager full authority over personnel policies and prevent the city council from any involvement in employment decisions.id.at.the court then acknowledged that the manager authority could in theory be restrained by city council regulations,but noted that no such regulations had been mentioned in the record or in the city brief.id.at.on the basis of these three documents charter,personnel policy,and the absence of any court remanded the issue for further proceedings of an unspecified form 
the charter,policy,and regulations are all essentially legal documents.our prior cases analyzing municipal liability under jett and praprotnik have treated city ordinances as law.see,melton oklahoma city,cir.indeed,we regularly read and apply city ordinances,not in the record,just as we do federal and state statutes.id.city ordinance united states v.one thunderbird,cir state statutes united states van buren,cir federal statute jackson denver producing ref,cir city ordinance similarly,the randle court noted that the personnel policy had apparently been incorporated by the city charter.randle,at quoting charter of city of aurora,b.jett made clear that for purposes of municipal liability,municipal ordinances and regulations are not facts to be scrutinized by lay juries but rather legal documents whose contents should be applied by judges.thus,when the court in randle turned to an analysis of the city charter,regulations,and official personnel policy,we do not think it intended to contradict its earlier statement that final policymaking authority is a legal issue to be determined by the court.at internal quotation marks omitted.instead,randle recognized what the supreme court final policymaking authority must be determined by a judicial examination of state and local law,not turned over to the jury.
superintendent dougherty was not the final policymaker 
we have concluded that the instruction authorizing the jury to determine who was the final policymaker for these hiring decisions was erroneous.our inquiry,however,can not end there.if as a matter of law dougherty was the final policymaker,then submitting the issue to the jury may have been inconsequential because the correct procedure would have yielded the same answer.however,we conclude that dougherty did not exercise such authority,and therefore that the municipality is not liable for any discrimination he may have committed 
under wyoming law,the board of trustees is vested with the authority to make personnel decisions.the statute governing school trustees gives them the power to e mploy and determine the salaries and duties of superintendents,principals,teachers,and all other school personnel.stat.ann.a vi.the plaintiffs do not dispute this,but argue that because the school board did not adequately supervise dougherty,it delegated this authority to him and gave him the school board status as final policymaker.in light of the of the municipal liability inquiry,however,we are interested only in delegations of legal power,not in whether the board actual exercise of its power of review was sufficiently aggressive.see jantz,at.with this in mind,we conclude that the board delegation of administrative power to the superintendent did not turn him into the final policymaker.
the school board has adopted a policy entitled relationship explicitly delegating its executive powers to the school superintendent.the policy explains 
the board believes that the legislation of policies is the most important function of the school board and that the execution of the policies should be the function of the superintendent.
delegation by the board of its executive powers to the superintendent provides freedom for the superintendent to manage the schools within the board policies and frees the board to devote its time to policymaking and evaluation functions.
the board holds the superintendent responsible for the administration of its policies,the execution of board decisions,the operation of the internal machinery designed to serve the school programs,and for keeping the board informed about school operations and problems.
the board shall strive to procure,when a vacancy exists,the best professional leader available for the chief administrative post.
app.it then concludes by describing the powers that the board agrees to extend to the superintendent,including a promise that the board shall a ct only upon the recommendation of the superintendent in matters of employment or dismissal of school personnel.id.a second policy,titled staff hiring,makes the superintendent responsible for developing selection procedures and recommending candidates to the board.app.following praprotnik,we look primarily to two factors in deciding whether an official is a final policymaker within his area of authority first,whether his discretionary decisions are constrained by general policies enacted by others,and second,whether those decisions are reviewable by others.dill city of edmond,internal quotation marks omitted.under these factors,we are not persuaded that the board policies enact a delegation so final that the superintendent edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.monell,at.
first,the board policy explicitly provides that the superintendent decisions are to be constrained by general policies enacted by the school board.see dill,at.the superintendent is charged with executi ng only the policies legislat ed by the board,and the policy reiterates his duty to manage the schools within the board policies.app.emphasis added.the additional policy instructing him to develop selection procedures and make recommendations does not change this like all of the superintendent duties,it is subject to the general instruction that he implement the board policies rather than creating his own.the fifth circuit,confronting a similar distribution of executive and legislative power by a school board,has reached the same conclusion.in barrow greenville independent school district,cir the court held that a superintendent final power to make recommendations or personnel transfers did not make him the final policymaker over those personnel decisions.the court noted its prior decisions that under texas law,school boards make policy and superintendents administer,id.at,and concluded that a superintendent authority to execute policies did not make him the final policymaker for purposes of monell.id.at 
second,under the board policies at issue in this case,the superintendent hiring decisions are reviewable by others.dill,at.when the superintendent puts forward the candidates recommended by the committee,the board may decide not to hire them.if the board does not like the candidates the superintendent puts forward,it may demand new ones.this review prevents the superintendent from being a final policymaker.
the plaintiffs challenge this conclusion on two grounds.they argue that the policy providing that the board shall hire only upon the recommendation of the superintendent,app,gives him a final veto power over particular candidates although in one case dougherty actually supported one of the plaintiffs.other circuits have rejected the argument that a potential ability to veto new candidates by failing to recommend them turns a school administrator into a policymaker,see barrow,at adkins board of,cir,and so do we.the ultimate authority to hire employees and to decide what rules govern hiring is retained by the board.the superintendent power to recommend is simply a component of the board hiring power,not a separate source of district,the recommendation power has meaning only within the hiring system run by the board.thus,any complaint about the superintendent failure to properly recommend candidates to the board belongs in a suit against him personally,not the district.
alternatively,the plaintiffs complain that in practice the board supervision of the superintendent role in the hiring process was so deferential that he was functionally unreviewed.but this appears to confuse the legal question of the locus of final decisionmaking authority with the factual question of how aggressively or independently the board tends to exercise the power it has.if the board retains the authority to review,even though it may not exercise such review or investigate the basis of the decision,delegation of final authority does not occur.jantz,at.as a plurality of the supreme court put it in praprotnik,s imply going along with discretionary decisions made by one subordinates is not a delegation to them of the authority to make policy.at.plurality opinion.regardless of whether plaintiffs are right that the board did not aggressively supervise dougherty decisions,the board had the authority to do so.whether it used it or not,that authority makes the board,not the superintendent,the proper target in a municipal liability suit.to hold otherwise and attempt to dig into the details of the board supervisory activities in this case would be to make the un justified assump tion that municipal policymaking authority lies somewhere other than where the applicable law purports to put it.id.at.that would subject school boards to capricious review by federal juries for every municipal squabble.id.at,
it is true that in analyzing this element of municipal liability in randle we held that review must be opposed to merely hypothetical.at.this caveat must not be taken out of context,however.as we have explained,randle did not attempt to repudiate the rule that policymaking authority is discovered by looking to the presence of legal authority rather than examining the facts of its exercise in a particular case.randle held that the city council potential ability to pass regulations making the city manager decisions reviewable did not stop him from being a final policymaker,because no such regulations had been passed.id.at.in other words,randle requires us to look to the legal structure actually in place,not to imagine hypothetical review mechanisms that might exist if the legal structure changed.analogously,we have held that the power of others to remove an official from his position does not necessarily keep him from being a final policymaker,because the the power of ouster i s too general to function as a mechanism of reviewing individual decisions,starrett wadley,cir,just as the fact that a city council is elected does not keep it from being a city final policymaker.however,we have never held a legally reviewable decision unreviewable for purposes of municipal liability merely because we were unsatisfied with the actual exercise of a board oversight authority.that rule would immerse us into disputes about municipal politics and administration in nearly every case,the very approach rejected by jett.
judgment as a matter of law 
because superintendent dougherty was not the final policymaker in sheridan county school district,nothing remains of the plaintiffs case against the district.the district appealed the district court decision denying it judgment as a matter of law,which means we must decide the correct legal evidence at trial was sufficient for the jury to find that the school district itself had discriminated.see sims great am.life ins,we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the opposing party and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom i f there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the issue against that party we reverse a jury verdict.quoting.a.
on appeal the plaintiffs do not argue that their claims can survive if neither dougherty conduct nor burgess can form the basis for municipal liability.see aplee.br.id.at p laintiffs claim is a simple one dougherty and burgess,through the authority of the superintendent office,manipulated the hiring selection processes to ensure that hitt and roberts were deprived of future employment as administrators in the district,and they did this because of hitt and roberts sexual orientation.see also app.plaintiffs closing argument this case is about delegated authority here my clients lost out,not because the board voted against them,but because dougherty violated my clients rights.because this is the only ground on which the plaintiffs defend the judgment below,we conclude that the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b should have been granted.
iii.qualified immunity 
in addition to suing the school district under a theory of municipal liability,and roberts sued dougherty in his personal capacity for the same actions discussed above.this portion of the suit faces a different obstacle,because dougherty is a state actor shielded by qualified immunity.see anderson creighton,d butz economou,d.the district court dismissed the suit on a motion for summary judgment,finding that while the plaintiffs had alleged facts demonstrating that dougherty actions were unconstitutional,the law was not clearly established,and therefore he could not be sued personally for damages.app.thus,the claims against dougherty never went to trial,even though his conduct was the focus of the suit against the district.after the jury verdict,the plaintiffs the grant of summary judgment in favor of dougherty.they argue that the constitutional violation found by the district court was a violation of clearly established law,and therefore that they ought to be permitted to proceed to trial against dougherty himself.we disagree,and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
a.the record and appendix 
at the outset,dougherty argues that deficiencies in either the record on appeal or the appendix he refers to each in his brief prevent us from adequately reviewing the grant of summary judgment in his favor,and that we therefore must affirm without considering the merits.the plaintiffs respond that the record and appendix both contain all of the information necessary for us to decide their claim.
because of the parties confusion about the relationship between the appendix and the record,we wish to clarify.the record on appeal comprises all of the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court the transcript of proceedings if any and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the district clerk.fed.a.however,in this circuit we leave the record on appeal in the district court and rely primarily on an appendix that the parties are obligated to produce,containing the relevant parts of the record.cir.see travelers indem.accurate autobody,cir in this circuit the appendix often serves the purpose of the record on appeal.we sometimes refer to this appendix colloquially as the record on appeal,but technically it is not.the appellant appendix must be sufficient for considering and deciding the issues on appeal.cir.a.if the appendix is insufficient on an issue that the appellee wishes us to decide,he may file a supplemental appendix of his own.cir.a.if the appendix and its supplements are not sufficient to decide an issue,we have no obligation to go further and examine documents that should have been included,and we regularly refuse to hear claims predicated on record evidence not in the appendix.cir.a see,travelers,at.however,we retain the authority to go beyond the appendix if we wish,because all of the transcripts if they have been ordered and documents and exhibits filed in district court remain in the record regardless of what the parties put in the appendix.united states williams,cir.
we ordered the parties to this litigation to produce a consolidated appendix adequate to resolve both the appeal and the.see order clarifying parties and briefing,at.the bulk of the evidence in the appendix consists of the transcript of the trial against the school district.dougherty wears two hats in this personal defendant and as alleged policymaker for the school evidence produced at the trial against the school district is not carried over into the personal capacity suit.although the appendix contains the district court summary judgment order,it does not contain the evidence that the court examined when it concluded that there was a material issue of fact as to whether the defendant had violated the constitution.dougherty argues that the plaintiffs should have included these materials from the record in the appendix,and that their failure to do so should cause us to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment without conf
