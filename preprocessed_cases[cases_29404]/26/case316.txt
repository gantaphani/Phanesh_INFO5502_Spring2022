opinion of the court 
in this appeal,stafford township school district stafford and stafford officials collectively stafford contesta preliminary injunction granted by the united states district court for the district of new jersey in favor of child evangelism fellowship of new jersey,and child evangelism of new jersey,bayshore chapter collectively child evangelism.finding that child evangelism was likely to succeed in showing that stafford was engaging in viewpoint discrimination and that this discrimination was not required by the establishment clause,the district court ordered stafford to treat child evangelism like other community organizations with respect to the distribution and posting of materials and participation in back to school nights.we affirm.
stafford operates four schools,including ocean acres elementary school ocean acres and mckinley avenue elementary school mckinley.ocean acres instructs students in grades through second,and mckinley instructs students in the third and fourth grades.ja stafford has adopted written policies on the use of its facilities by community groups and the distribution of community group materials to students in addition,stafford has developed practices concerning the placement of flyers on school walls and the distribution of flyers and the staffing of tables at back to school nights.
distribution of community group materials.stafford proclaims that it has an overall policy of assisting community groups.its written policy on the use of its facilities states that the schools should be used to the fullest extent possible by community groups and agencies.ja.similarly,its written policy on the distribution of community group literature expresses a commitment to assist all organizations in our rapidly growing community.ja emphasis added.this policy sets out the following standards regarding materials that may be handed out to students 
material being sent home with pupils should relate to school matters or community activities.except when it pertains to the individual pupil,all such material must be approved in advance by the.
pupils shall not be used to distribute partisan materials or partisan information pertaining to a school or general election,budget or bond issues,or negotiations.pupils shall not be exploited for the benefit of any individual,group,or organization.
no staff member may distribute any materials on school property without prior approval of the superintendent.
all surveys,questionnaires or other similar items requiring pupil or response shall be reviewed and approved by the superintendent prior to distribution.
to implement these standards,stafford has adopted the following specific rules 
the principal is authorized to duplicate scheduled memos and send them home with the children.all school activities may be advertised on these memos.
the following organizations are permitted to distribute information to go home with the children 
stafford athletic association 
boy scouts 
four h club 
southern regional high school 
lions club 
civil defense 
stafford township fire department 
j.other groups will be added at discretion of the superintendent.
none of the aforementioned organizations may solicit money through the children for any activity.the board permits them to advertise their fund raising activity,however,the principal has no authority to collect money for the associations.flyers must be prepared by the organization and packaged in then given to the school secretaries who will distribute to the target group.
all activities must be directly associated with the children who are enrolled in the stafford township school district.
exceptions the pta may collect membership fees and class sponsor moneys through the office of the principal.
all other associations must receive special approval from the board of education.
the stafford policy thus addresses both the groups whose materials may be distributed and the types of materials that are allowed.as for the groups,ten named organizations are specifically approved,and the superintendent is given the discretion to add other groups although stafford has not kept a comprehensive record of the groups whose materials have been sent home at ocean acres and mckinley,these groups include the cub scouts,ocean county girl scouts,long beach island foundation of the arts and sciences,southern ocean county hospital,stafford wrestling club,college funding,stafford basketball association,municipal alliance,ocean county library,stafford township volunteer fire company,stafford basketball club,pop warner football,and the pta.ja,c.
as for the contents of the materials,it appears that five requirements must be met.first,materials other than those pertaining to a particular student must be approved in advance by the superintendent or perhaps by a designee second,there must be a nexus between the content of the materials and the students or school.it is said that m aterial being sent home with pupils should relate to school matters or community activities and that a ll activities must be directly associated with the children who are enrolled in the stafford township school district.emphasis added.third,materials are prohibited if they are partisan or if they relate to an election or negotiations presumably stafford negotiations with its teachers or other employees.fourth,it is said that pupils are not to be exploited for the benefit of any individual,group,or organization.fifth,with the exception of pta materials,documents sent home may not solicit money but may advertise activities.
the process of distribution works as follows.community organizations produce flyers or other information at their own expense and place these materials in faculty mailboxes,and the teachers then distribute these materials to the students,usually at the close of the school day just prior to dismissal.ja except when a flyer deals with a current curriculum,health or safety issue,it appears that the materials sent home are not discussed in class.id.as the district court noted,a lthough the distribution of materials occurs and flyers remain hung during school hours the messages of these fora are not incorporated into the instructional component of the school day.child evangelism fellowship of stafford twp.sch,d.
back to school nights.each fall,ocean acres and mckinley hold back to school nights.these events are intended for the benefit of parents,but occasionally a child accompanies a parent or other adult attendee.ja.stafford has no formal policy governing the materials that may be displayed at these events or the groups that are allowed to staff information tables,but stafford asserts that it uses the same procedures employed with respect to the distribution of materials.ja.when requests are made for use of the tables,the superintendent gives priority to the largest organizations,those that are viewed as having the greatest impact on the curriculum,and those that emphasize learning and safety and health issues.id.stafford does not claim that any group other than child evangelism was ever denied the opportunity to display its literature or staff a table based on the content of the material or the nature of the group,but on one occasion,the boy scouts request for a table was denied because of space limitations.id.
stafford does not maintain a comprehensive list of the groups that have previously requested or have been permitted to participate in back to school nights,but groups whose materials have been distributed include the ocean county library system,the pta,the municipal,stea,boy scouts,and stafford township recreation.id.at.the organizations whose materials have been distributed at the back to school nights may have staffed tables at those events at one time or another.id.at the ocean acres back to school night in september,stafford also allowed various community groups,including the rotary club and the american cancer society,to staff and promote extreme event,a sporting event involving bikers,skaters,and skateboarders.ja.
posting materials on school walls.although stafford does not have a written policy governing the posting of community group flyers on school walls,stafford has allowed a variety of groups to post material on the walls of ocean acres and mckinley.these groups include the rotary club,ocean county first night activities,the pta,the new jersey school boards association,the children hospital of philadelphia,the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals,the united states marine corps toys for tots drive,and local theater groups.ja.stafford has not argued that its policy or practice with respect to the posting of flyers on the walls of the schools is any more restrictive than its policy regarding the distribution of materials.as the district court wrote t he school district does not distinguish the criteria for access to the forum from the distribution and back to school night fora nor does the school district indicate that groups promoting character building and moral and social development,such as the girl scouts and boy scouts,would be excluded.child evangelism of,d at.
child evangelism describes itself as a,worldwide organization composed of believers whose purpose is to evangelize boys and girls with the gospel of the lord jesus christ and to establish disciple them in the word of god and in a local church for christian living.ja.child evangelism sponsors good news clubs,which host weekly meetings for children during hours.the stated objectives of the good news clubs include instilling or cultivating,character,and morals in children,providing children with a positive recreational experience,providing a community where children feel loved,respected,and encouraged,teaching children life skills and healthy lifestyle choices,teaching children to encourage and lead other children to the same sorts of choices,improving memory skills,grades,attitudes,and behavior at home,improving relations among the races,instructing children to overcome feelings of jealousy and to treat others as they want to be treated themselves,teaching children to be obedient and to respect persons in authority,and instructing children to follow the numerous other moral and other teachings of jesus christ.ja.a good news club flyer states good news clubs are groups meeting one hour per week designated to serve boys and girls through bible oriented and character building learning and moral object lessons,as well as recreational activities like singing and bible review games.ja.
another child evangelism flyer describing the good news club states 
you invited to good news club 
purpose of the club regular weekly meetings will provide various activities to help young people make smart choices that will effect sic the rest of their lives.using the bible as the main textbook,you will learn how to apply the stories and biblical principles to your life.
club activities include a snack,singing,learning bible verses,listening to a bible lesson and playing learning games.
have a fun time as you learn from god word 
students can not attend a meeting of the good news club without the consent of a parent or a guardian.see ja.when a student first attends a meeting,the student must bring a written permission slip.see ja.in addition,child evangelism flyers clearly state that the group is not.see ja child evangelism flyer stating this is not a activity.
the events that led to the filing of this action began in early.child evangelism submitted an official stafford form,application for use of building,seeking permission to use a classroom at mckinley for weekly good news club meetings.ja.this form was signed as approved by the principal on march,and by the superintendent on march.child evangelism also asked to have its flyers and permission slips distributed to pupils at mckinley,but according to child evangelism,the superintendent orally rejected this request on the advice of counsel due to establishment clause concerns.ja.
in may,child evangelism contacted the school district again and asked,among other things,that its flyers and permission slips be distributed to pupils and that child evangelism representatives be allowed to hand out materials and staff a table at back to school nights.child evangelism of,d at.the school district rejected these requests.in the summer of,child evangelism submitted applications to use classrooms at mckinley and ocean acres during the upcoming school year,as well as requests to have good news club materials distributed to pupils.ja.
on september,the school district responded but did not provide a final decision on the requests.because the dates of the ocean acres and mckinley back to school nights were approaching,child evangelism advised stafford that it would be forced to commence litigation,and it subsequently filed the present action and sought a temporary restraining order.child evangelism complaint alleged that stafford was violating its rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion under the federal and state constitutions,as well as its federal constitutional right to equal protection.
counsel for stafford subsequently advised child evangelism that its request to use the school facilities had been approved,see ja,but child evangelism other requests were denied due to concerns about violating the establishment clause,the effect of child evangelism requests on the children in the school system care,the effect of child evangelism requests on the relationship between the schools and the parents as well as the effect of opening the schools as limited public fora in the future if the schools compl ied with child evangelism requests.ja.stafford also believed that distributing child evangelism materials would tend to create divisiveness between and amongst parents to parents and children to children,as well as the staff.ja e.
the district court denied the request for temporary restraints but issued an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.after further proceedings,the district court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction,finding that child evangelism was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under the free speech clause of the first amendment with respect to the distribution of its materials,the posting of its materials on the school walls,and participation at back to school nights.child evangelism,d at.the district court concluded that child evangelism was asserting the right to speak in several different fora,including what it termed the distribution,school wall,and back to school fora.id.at.the court concluded that it was likely that these were limited public fora,but the court found it unnecessary to decide that question,because viewpoint discrimination is unconstitutional even in a forum.id.
with respect to the distribution forum,the district court held that child evangelism had sought to speak on a topic that was otherwise permissible,but had been denied that opportunity because it wished to address the topic from a religious perspective.id.at.the court noted that other groups that conducted children activities for character building and social development,such as the girl scouts,had been permitted to have their literature distributed.id.the court reached a similar conclusion with respect to the back to school night and school wall fora.id.at 
the court then concluded that stafford was likely to fail in its argument that discrimination against child evangelism was necessary in order to comply with the establishment clause.id.the court further held that,although child evangelism free exercise and equal protection claims were not likely to prevail,there was a substantial possibility that the stafford policy would be held to be facially unconstitutional on the ground of vagueness.id.at.finding that the irreparable harm that would be suffered by child evangelism if a preliminary injunction did not issue outweighed any harm to stafford,and finding that the public interest would be served by granting the requested relief,the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering stafford to treat child evangelism the same as other community groups with regard to the distribution and posting of literature and participation at back to school nights.stafford then took the present appeal.
we ordinarily use a standard to review a district court decision to grant a preliminary injunction.the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error the district court conclusions of law are evaluated under a plenary review standard and the ultimate decision to grant the preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see warner lambert breathasure,cir.when first amendment rights are at issue,however,this standard is modified.although we normally will not disturb the factual findings supporting the disposition of a preliminary injunction motion in the absence of clear error,we have a constitutional duty to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole when a case presents a first amendment claim.see tenafly eruv ass borough of tenafly,cir.
the test for preliminary relief is a familiar one.a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show a likelihood of success on the merits that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied that granting preliminary relief will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and that the public interest favors such relief.kos,andrx,cir.consequently,a panel entertaining a preliminary injunction appeal generally decides only whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling on the request for relief and generally does not go into the merits any farther than is necessary to determine whether the moving party established a likelihood of success.the pitt news pappert,cir.however,a panel is not always required to take this narrow approach.if a preliminary injunction appeal presents a question of law and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance,the panel may decide the merits of the claim.id.at emphasis in original omitted see also thornburgh am.college of obstetricians gynecologists,d maldonado houstoun,cir.
we first consider stafford contention that the speech at issue in this case,the materials that child evangelism wished to have distributed and posted represented speech,not private speech,and that stafford was therefore allowed to control the content of that speech under hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d,so long as the regulation served a legitimate pedagogical purpose.appellant br.at.this argument falls very far from the mark.
school or speech occurs when a public school or other government entity aims to convey its own message.rosenberger rector and visitors of of,d.by contrast,when a school or other government body facilitates the expression of a diversity of views from private speakers,the resulting expression is private.id.at.
here,stafford purpose is not to convey its own message through the distribution and posting of community group materials but to assist all organizations in the community.ja emphasis added.materials that are handed out are written and paid for by community groups,and stafford teachers do no more than retrieve the materials from their mailboxes and distribute them to the children,usually at the end of the school day.the teachers do not discuss or express approval of the materials.stafford standards for acceptable materials are broad,and a great many community groups have had their flyers distributed.
contrary to stafford suggestion,the present case bears little resemblance to cases involving speech.in hazelwood,a high school newspaper was held to represent speech where the paper was the official school newspaper it was printed with school funds and produced by students in a journalism class that was part of the school curriculum the students work was reviewed and graded by the teacher a faculty member closely supervised all aspects of the paper,including the selection of the editors,the number of pages in each edition,the assignment of stories,and the editing of everything that appeared in the paper,including letters to editor and the entire paper was reviewed by the principal before publication.see hazelwood,at.
here,by contrast,the good news club flyers and permission slips were obviously not official stafford documents.on the contrary,stafford had no hand in writing the materials in question and did not pay for them.nothing in the materials suggested that stafford had any role in their production or approved of their content.indeed,the good news club flyer contained an express disclaimer stating that the good news club was not a school sponsored activity.ja.
nor do the materials at issue here resemble the invocation that was held to be speech in santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d.there,past practice clothed the speech with the mantle of school approval,since the invocation had previously been delivered by the school student chaplain.id.at.in addition,the speech was incorporated into an official event a high school football game that was staged on school property,and the speech was broadcast on the school public address system.id.at.moreover,this event was one that played a central part in the social life of the school and that some students football team and band members were required to attend.id.at.the school also regulated the identity of the speaker.id.at.only one student could speak,and the prescribed method of selecting the speaker an election insured that minority views would probably never be expressed.id.finally,the school regulated the content of the speech,prescribing that it had to be an invocation,a type of address that naturally suggests a prayer,and that it could not be denominational or proselytizing.id.not one of these features is present in the case at hand.
while this case is unlike hazelwood and santa fe,it is comparable to cases in which public educational institutions have properly facilitated speech by a broad array of private groups.see,good news club milford cent,d use of school facilities by community groups lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d same rosenberger,d university program subsidizing broad array of student activities.like those cases,this case involves private,not,speech.
stafford next contends that,even if the speech at issue here was private,stafford was permitted to regulate the content of the speech because the three fora identified by the district court were closed.we disagree.
first,as the district court suggested,it is evident that stafford created limited public fora when it opened up the three fora at issue for speech by a broad array of community groups on matters related to the students and the schools.stafford had no constitutional obligation to distribute or post any community group materials or to allow any such groups to staff tables at back to school nights.but when it decided to open up these fora to a specified category of groups,community groups for speech on particular topics,speech related to the students and the schools,it established a limited public fora.see,iskcon lee,d widmar vincent,d.as a consequence,it is bound to respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.rosenberger,at.it may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint.id.citations omitted 
second,even if the three fora were not limited public fora but were closed,stafford still could not engage in viewpoint discrimination.as the supreme court observed in lamb chapel,at.emphasis added,c ontrol over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.see also cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d the existence of reasonable grounds for limiting access to a nonpublic forum will not save a regulation that is in reality a facade for discrimination christ bride ministries,southeastern.transp,cir.therefore,assuming for the sake of argument that the fora at issue in this case were,if stafford engaged in viewpoint discrimination,it violated child evangelism rights.
we thus turn to the central questions in this case whether stafford excluded child evangelism from the fora at issue pursuant to criteria that are reasonable in light of the purpose of the fora or whether,as the district court suggested,stafford engaged in viewpoint discrimination.the answers to these questions are clear.
we have summarized stafford rules regarding access to the distribution forum,and as the district court noted,it appears that stafford criteria for access to the and back to school night fora were similar.thus,the relevant requirements seem to be as follows the group must be and the speech must receive prior approval by the district,have a nexus with the students or school,be and unrelated to an election or labor negotiations,not seek to exploit children for the benefit of any individual,group,or organization,and not solicit money except for the pta.see ja.
child evangelism and its materials satisfy all the requirements set out in this list.indeed,stafford briefs make no direct effort to show that child evangelism materials fail to meet any of these requirements,and any such effort would be fruitless.child evangelism is a group,and it sought advance approval from the superintendent its materials,which invite students to attend club meetings on school premises after school,relate to the students and the school the materials are not partisan and have nothing to do with elections or negotiations they do not seek to exploit children for commercial gain and they do not solicit money.
in its brief,stafford offers a list of other,purportedly reasons for excluding child evangelism.stafford contends that it excludes all groups representing special interests appellants br.at,all groups that do not restrict themselves to mundane recreational activities id.at,all groups whose views are divisive or controversial id.at,all speech that promotes any point of view,whether religious,commercial or secular id.at,all groups that proselytize id.at,and all speech about religion id.these rationalizations are either incoherent or euphemisms for religious discrimination.
every group in a sense represents special interests,namely,the interests to which the group is dedicated.even a noncontroversial and beneficent organization like the stafford pta represents special interests the interests of the stafford pupils and schools and at times even these interests may conflict with those of others in the community.thus,if this criterion is literally interpreted and applied,it fails to set a meaningful,standard.of course,the term special interest group is often used to express the view that the group in question is dedicated to ends that conflict with the common good.if stafford uses the term in this sense,the criterion is not.
stafford argument that it excludes groups that promote anything other than mundane recreational activities is hard to take seriously.if a group of parents organized a youth team in a sport not popular in this country say,cricket would stafford refuse to distribute their flyer on the ground that the activity was not mundane if parents organized a club dedicated to the study of an uncommon foreign language,would stafford refuse to hand out their materials because the activity was neither mundane nor recreational nothing in the record suggests that stafford would rebuff such requests.
to exclude a group simply because it is controversial or divisive is viewpoint discrimination.a group is controversial or divisive because some take issue with its viewpoint.see cornelius,at.warning that the purported concern to avoid controversy excited by particular groups may conceal a bias against the viewpoint advanced by the excluded speakers.although the ten groups specifically approved by stafford are apparently not controversial or divisive in that community,at least some would be controversial and divisive elsewhere.even in the school setting,a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint is not enough to justify the suppression of speech tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.
all speech promotes a point of view.all of the specifically approved groups,including such familiar and groups as the pta and the h club,have a point of view.thus,this criterion is devoid of meaning.
to proselytize means both to recruit members for an institution,team,or group and to convert from one religion,belief,opinion,or party to another.webster third new international dictionary.the record shows that stafford does not reject groups that proselytize in the sense of recruiting members.many of the groups specifically approved in the stafford rules do so,and the record contains numerous flyers produced by groups from the cub scouts to the local wrestling club that stafford has distributed and that seek to recruit members.see ja.
what stafford appears to mean when it says that it excludes groups that proselytize is that it rejects religiously affiliated groups that attempt to recruit new members and persuade them to adopt the group views.this is viewpoint discrimination.
finally,stafford attempt to justify its actions on the ground that it excludes all speech on religion as a subject or category of speech flies in the face of supreme court precedent.p rivate religious speech,far from being a first amendment orphan,is as fully protected under the free speech clause as secular private expression.capitol square review advisory bd.pinette,d.cases such as lamb chapel,rosenberger,and good news club establish that if government permits the discussion of a topic from a secular perspective,it may not shut out speech that discusses the same topic from a religious perspective.in lamb chapel,a school district was held to have violated the right of free speech by permitting school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.lamb chapel,at.in rosenberger,a free speech violation occurred because the university refused to support a student publication called wide awake on the ground that the contents of wide awake reveal an avowed religious perspective.rosenberger,at.the court observed 
it is,in a sense,something of an understatement to speak of religious thought and discussion as just a viewpoint,as distinct from a comprehensive body of thought we conclude,nonetheless,that here,as in lamb chapel,viewpoint discrimination is the proper way to interpret the university objections to wide awake.
most recently,in good news club milford cent,supra,the supreme court rejected an argument that was virtually identical to the one that stafford advances here.the school allowed its facilities to be used for instruction in any branch of education,learning or the arts and for social,civic and recreational meetings and entertainment events,and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community,provided that the events were open to the general public.good news club,at.the school refused,however,to permit the use of its facilities by a good news club,stating that the kinds of activities proposed to be engaged in by the good news club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing,development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective,but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself.id.at.the second circuit sustained this policy,holding that the good news club activities fell outside the bounds of pure moral and character development because they were quintessentially religious.good news club milford cent,rev,d 
applying lamb chapel and rosenberger,the supreme court reversed and held that the school had engaged in impermissible viewpoint discrimination.the court pointed out that the good news club sought to address a subject otherwise permitted under the school rules,the teaching of morals and character,from a religious standpoint,good news,at,and the court rejected the second circuit position that something that is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature can not also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint.id.at.the court elaborated what matters for purposes of the free speech clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of christianity by the club and the invocation of teamwork,loyalty,or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons.id.this holding forecloses stafford argument that its disparate treatment of child evangelism was not viewpoint discrimination.
not only did stafford discriminate against child evangelism because it teaches morals and character,from a religious standpoint,good news club,at,but it also appears that stafford disfavored child evangelism because of the particular religious views that child evangelism espouses.several of the groups that stafford has allowed to distribute and post materials specifically the boy scouts,the girl scouts,and the elks espouse religious views and require or encourage members to endorse these beliefs.
the boy scouts describes itself as an organization with strong religious tenets.ja.the stated mission of the boy scouts is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law.ja.the boy scout oath begins with the words on my honor i will do my best to do my duty to god and my country.ja.in describing this portion of the oath,official boy scout literature states our nation is founded on showing reverence to a higher faith.in these words,the scout promises to recognize,to honor and to respect his religious faith.and in the boy scouts of america,he is given an opportunity to grow in that faith and to respect the beliefs of others.id.and though the boy scouts of america is a nonsectarian group,it still maintains that no child can develop to his or her fullest potential without a spiritual element in his or her life.id.
the girl scout promise includes a commitment to serve god.ja.the group takes the view that god can be interpreted in a number of ways and permits the word god in the promise to be replaced by whatever word a girl spiritual beliefs dictate.id.the benevolent and protective order of elks of the united states of america requires its members to believe in god.id.at.
in discovery,stafford propounded an extraordinary set of requests for admissions that sought to elicit child evangelism admission that it adheres to a variety of traditional christian doctrines.see ja.stafford brief highlighted these beliefs as grounds for its actions,see appellant br.at,and at argument stafford counsel stated we were concerned that,what the child evangelism fellowship teaches appears to be inconsistent with what we obligated to teach,that being diversity and tolerance.oral arg.tr.at.suppressing speech on this ground is indisputably.
stafford argues that even if it engaged in viewpoint discrimination,its conduct was justified for the purpose of avoiding a violation of the establishment clause.similar arguments were rejected in lamb chapel,at,rosenberger,at,and good news club,at,and stafford rendition here is no more convincing.
the supreme court has not settled the question whether a concern about a possible establishment clause violation can justify viewpoint discrimination.see good news club,at.while w e have said that a state interest in avoiding an establishment clause violation may be characterized as compelling,and therefore may justify discrimination,it is not clear whether a state interest in avoiding an establishment clause violation would justify viewpoint discrimination.internal citation omitted quoting widmar vincent,d.but we need not decide this issue here,because giving child evangelism equal access to the fora at issue would not violate the establishment clause.the supreme court has repeatedly rejected the position that the establishment clause even justifies,much less requires,a refusal to extend free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in government programs neutral in design.rosenberger,at.
contrary to the arguments of stafford and its amici,equal access would not result in an impermissible endorsement of religion.an unconstitutional endorsement of religion is said to occur when government makes adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person standing in the political community.allegheny county greater pittsburgh aclu,d,concurring quoting lynch donnelly,d,concurring.endorsement sends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders,not full members of the political community,and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders,favored members of the political community.id.disapproval of religion conveys the opposite message.id.
in order to determine whether a challenged practice constitutes an endorsement or disapproval of religion,the practice must be judged in its unique circumstances.allegheny county,at,concurring quoting lynch,at,concurring emphasis in allegheny.in addition,the challenged practice must be considered from the perspective of a hypothetical reasonable observer who is aware of the history and context of the community and forum.capitol square review advisory bd.pinette,d,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.
the supreme court has repeatedly held that granting equal access to facilities in educational institutions does not offend this principle.in bd.of educ.of the westside cmty.schs.mergens,d,the court found that a public school recognition of a religious student club would not be perceived as endorsement where the school recognized a broad spectrum of clubs and allowed its students to initiate and organize additional student clubs.these features,the court held,counteract ed any possible message of official endorsement of or preference for religion or a particular religious belief.id.official recognition of the club carrie d with it access to the school newspaper,bulletin boards,the public address system,and the annual club fair,id.at,fora very similar to those at issue in the present case.
in lamb chapel,the court ruled that allowing a film with a religious message to be shown on school premises after school hours in a gathering that was sponsored by a private group and open to the public would not have created any realistic danger that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion or any particular creed.at.and in good news club,at,the court concluded that even small children would not perceive that allowing the good news club,like other community groups,to meet on school premises represented an endorsement by the school of the group beliefs.the court added e ven if we were to inquire into the minds of schoolchildren in this case,we can not say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the club were excluded from the public forum.id.
applying these precedents,we see no endorsement problem here.child evangelism flyers specifically disclaim any school sponsorship.in addition,a reasonable observer,aware of the history and context of the community and forum,pinette,at,would know that stafford has a policy of assisting a broad range of community groups,that stafford plays no role in composing the flyers that are sent home and does not pay for them,and that stafford teachers do not discuss the flyers in class.if permitting good news club meetings on school premises shortly after the end of the school day does not convey a message of endorsement,the lesser activities at issue here can not be viewed as bearing the school implicit approval.
stafford and its amici contend that the relevant reasonable observer in this case is an elementary school child and that such a child is likely to interpret school facilitation of private speech as amounting to an endorsement of the speech.indeed,they contend that elementary school children are incapable of understanding the difference between extracurricular activities and privately run activities that the school assists in publicizing.however,good news club and decisions of other courts of appeals undermine that argument.
in good news club,it was argued that young children would interpret the use of the school building for club meetings as signifying that the meetings were endorsed by the school.in response,the court stated that even if we were to inquire into the minds of the schoolchildren in this case,we can not say the danger that children would misperceive the endors
