in,a member of the united mine workers of america,local filed a grievance with the marrowbone development company asserting that marrowbone assigned to members certain work that rightfully belonged to union employees under the governing collective bargaining agreement.the company prevailed in arbitration,but the district court vacated the arbitration award finding that the union did not receive a full and fair hearing.because the arbitrator exceeded his authority under the governing agreement and failed to provide a fundamentally fair hearing,we affirm.
prior to,marrowbone operated a coal mining complex in mingo county,west virginia.in may,the parties to this litigation signed an interim collective bargaining agreement,and the national labor relations board certified local as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for marrowbone union employees.the national bituminous coal wage agreement of agreement superseded the interim agreement in december and controlled work assignments and dispute resolution.
in,members of the union filed six grievances against the company pursuant to the agreement.five of the six grievances asserted that marrowbone used salaried as company perform various delivery tasks that the agreement assigned to union employees.the sixth grievance alleged that marrowbone used an outside contractor to deliver parts to one of its that the union claimed belonged to union employees exclusively.
all six grievances were submitted to an arbitrator,who ordered marrowbone to cease using employees or subcontractors to perform the disputed work.marrowbone appealed to the district court,but sought vacatur of only a portion of the arbitration arbitrator decision as to the sixth grievance.the company asserted that this decision violated e of the national labor relations act,e,because it required marrowbone to cease doing business with contractors the parties entered into a joint stipulation of undisputed material facts to serve as the findings of fact for the ensuing summary judgment motions.the relevant portion of the joint stipulation provided 
in april and august,disputes developed regarding whether classified employees in the bargaining unit were entitled to perform the work of delivering parts and supplies at the marrowbone complex.prior to that time,all parts and supplies had been delivered by contractors,supervisors,or other unit personnel.
that dispute was ultimately decided by this court in marrowbone development district,cir marrowbone i.we held that preventing marrowbone from employing outside contractors to do transportation and delivery work not previously performed by union employees violated e prohibition against union agreements.id.at.in other words,to permit this would allow the union to use its bargaining position with marrowbone to acquire new work that was previously done by contractors,thus producing an illegal secondary effect.id.because marrowbone never challenged the arbitrator decision regarding the first five grievances,we did not address the question of whether forcing marrowbone to cease using its own employees,as opposed to outside contractors,for transportation and delivery work similarly violated e.id.
three months after the marrowbone i decision,a union employee filed the instant grievance,asserting that 
the company has violated the collective bargaining agreement by assigning to supervisors and to vendors the type of work traditionally performed by bargaining unit employees,in connection with the delivery of parts through the mining complex.the work wrongfully assigned outside of the unit includes that traditionally performed by surface utility and supply motormen utility employees,and electricians,among others.
this grievance is governed by the national bituminous coal wage agreement of agreement,which superseded the agreement but is identical in all relevant respects.article xxiii of the agreement controls the settlement of disputes and outlines the grievance procedure.it provides that if the parties fail to resolve a dispute under the first two steps of the procedure,the grievance is referred to step,where company and union representatives meet and review the facts and pertinent contract provisions in an effort to reach agreement.if the parties fail to reach agreement at step,the matter is referred to step,where an arbitrator shall conduct a hearing in order to hear testimony,receive evidence and consider arguments and ultimately decide the case.
in accordance with the agreement,the grievance at issue here eventually proceeded to a step meeting that failed to resolve the complaint.the grievance was then referred to a new arbitrator,who initiated a hearing on february.at the outset of the hearing,the arbitrator accepted a handful of joint exhibits,listened to marrowbone summary judgment argument,and heard the union opening statement.
in that statement,the union representative noted that the facts the union sought to prove were very different from those presented in marrowbone i,and promised that the union would present evidence that the disputed work is the same type of work that the company assigned simultaneously to bargaining unit employees and is indisputably covered by the contract.the union attempted to offer testimony,submit evidence,and present arguments in support of its position,and also requested permission to brief issues upon which there was some confusion from the union as well as the company.the union concluded that t he grievance before you seeks only to preserve the right of bargaining unit employees to be assigned the type of bargaining unit work which they have traditionally performed.no more,and no less.
upon hearing this,the company asked for a recess.then the company requested that the arbitrator remand this case back to step.the company representative explained that b ased on the representations made by the union in their opening statement of the evidence and arguments that they intend to present throughout the course of this hearing,a remand was necessary for a full open,frank negotiation of the issues of fact that were disputed by the parties.
without hearing testimony or considering the evidence the union sought to introduce or the arguments it sought to make,the arbitrator decided to remand the case for another step meeting.although initially resistant to the delay that a new step meeting would create,the union ultimately consented to the remand after the arbitrator agreed to schedule a specific date march for a full arbitration hearing in the event that the step meeting failed to resolve the grievance.before the aborted february hearing adjourned,the union asked whether the parties should file briefs.the arbitrator responded by stating that they should not,because i f we going back to step,we starting over.emphasis added.
however,prior to the scheduled date of the full arbitration hearing,the arbitrator reviewed marrowbone i and decided that it controlled the outcome of the new grievance.on march,the arbitrator issued his opinion and award dismissing the grievance.the award quoted extensively from marrowbone i,which held that 
the bargaining unit employees never engaged in delivery and transportation work before the enforcement date of the national agreement i n turning over such work to employees,marrowbone was required to cease its business relations with other parties,thus the agreement is secondary in nature and therefore contrary to the dictates of e.
marrowbone i,at.the arbitrator determined that the grievance filed in this case also pertains to the subject of the grievances filed in,and therefore concluded that he wa s bound by marrowbone i.
the union brought this action seeking to have the district court vacate the arbitration award.both parties then moved for summary judgment.finding that the arbitrator denied the union a full and fair hearing,the district court granted the union motion,and remanded the case for an evidentiary arbitration hearing.marrowbone timely appealed to this court.
it is that an arbitrator acting within the scope of a collective bargaining agreement receives great deference as to procedural matters and legal interpretation.see,united paperw
