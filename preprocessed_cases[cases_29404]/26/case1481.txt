in this appeal,we conclude that the standard of adverse employment action that our state supreme court recently defined and applied to an employment retaliation lawsuit under the california fair employment and housing act feha also applies to an employment retaliation lawsuit under labor code section,subdivision b retaliation for whistleblowing regarding reasonably believed legal violations.see yanowitz usa,cal th,d.
in applying this standard,we reverse a summary judgment in favor of the defendant employer,grant joint union high school district grant.we conclude that plaintiff colleen patten patten has raised a triable issue of material fact regarding whether her transfer from one principal position to another constituted an adverse employment action.
background 
at the time of the relevant events here,labor code section,subdivision b hereafter b provided no employer shall retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute,or violation or noncompliance with a state or federal regulation.section b was amended in,but remains substantively the same.stats,ch.
the summary judgment papers show the following.
patten was the principal at foothill farms junior high school foothill during the and school years.the year before patten arrived as principal,foothill had been designated an underperforming school.this made foothill eligible for additional special funding under the immediate schools program.
patten contends she disclosed four legal violations for which grant retaliated against her.
the first disclosure arose from grant financial audit for the school year.grant discovered a surplus of approximately in foothill budget.grant wanted to reassign expenditures already incurred for at least one other educational program,and perhaps others,to nearly of this surplus.this would allow grant to retain this amount of unspent funds rather than return the amount to the state and,as patten maintains,would provide grant with funds to clean up its budget grant was allowed to hold on to the difference in any event.
to effectuate this reassignment of expenditures,grant,in early september,requested that patten sign blank transfer of funds forms.patten refused,and explained to grant why.according to patten,there was no way to ensure that the reassigned expenditures were legitimate based on guidelines she was fearful of the legality of this action.district personnel subsequently carried out this reassignment.in october,patten met with a state assembly member and a representative of a state senator regarding this matter.
the second disclosure also arose from events in september.patten received complaints from female students that a male physical education teacher at foothill was peering into the girl locker room.patten disclosed this information to her district superiors for personnel action.
the third disclosure involved an remark that a male science teacher at foothill had made to a female student in april.again,patten disclosed this information to her superiors for personnel action.
the fourth and final disclosure encompassed the issue of school safety.in april,a student had been assaulted on the foothill campus.foothill is a large campus and,at the time,was geographically split.patten requested on this occasion,as on others,additional staff to keep the campus safe.
patten attended a grant school board meeting on march.there,she apparently provided information related to the funding issue that contradicted what the superintendent had previously told the board.
on june,grant notified patten that she was being transferred to another principal position this position was to a much smaller junior high school comprised of students,the campus verdes alternative magnet school cvams.patten never began work at the cvams position.patten had been diagnosed with mononucleosis in late march.although she missed about three weeks of work,she returned to duty and completed the school year at foothill while continuing to experience symptoms of her infection through july.patten health initially precluded her from returning to work during the summer and early fall months of.eventually,she claimed in late october that she had been forced to quit her job based on grant retaliatory conduct.
in february,patten sued grant for whistleblower retaliation under section b based on the four disclosures of legal violations described above.she also sued grant for constructive discharge and for violation of free speech.
the trial court upheld grant motion for summary judgment.the court found that only the disclosure regarding the funding constituted protected whistleblowing.as to that disclosure,however,the court determined that grant had not retaliated against patten by subjecting her to an adverse employment action because the wages,benefits and duties as set forth by the job descriptions of the cvams principal position were the same as at foothill,and both schools were junior highs.
in this appeal,only the whistleblower retaliation cause of action under section b is at issue.
discussion 
standard of review and the section b cause of action elements 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the evidentiary papers submitted,which we review independently,show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.we do not resolve factual issues but ascertain whether there are any to resolve.code civ,subd.c flait north american watch th,d flait colores board of trustees th,d colores.
a defendant may move for summary judgment in any action or proceeding if it is contended that the action has no merit.code civ,subd.a.a cause of action has no merit if it is shown that the plaintiff can not establish one of the action elements.code civ,subd.o rio linda unified school dist.superior court th,d.
because a summary judgment denies the losing party a trial,we liberally construe the evidence in support of that party and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in that party favor.wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d,colores,supra,th at,d.
as noted,under section b,an employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency that the employee reasonably believes discloses a violation of,or noncompliance with,a state or federal statute or regulation.in addition to statute and regulation,the recently amended version of section b adds a state or federal rule.stats,ch.
the elements of a section b retaliation cause of action require that the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of retaliation,the defendant provide a legitimate,nonretaliatory explanation for its acts,and the plaintiff show this explanation is merely a pretext for the retaliation.see flait,supra,th at,d see also akers county of san diego th,d akers morgan regents of university of california th,d.
we are concerned here with the first element of a section b retaliation claim,establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.to do that,a plaintiff must show she engaged in a protected activity,her employer subjected her to an adverse employment action,and there is a causal link between the two.akers,supra,th at,d.grant moved for summary judgment,contending that patten could not establish any of these prima facie elements.
protected activity 
we first consider the issue of whether patten disclosures regarding the teacher,the science teacher,the safety of the school,and the reassignment of expenditures,presents a triable issue of material fact as constituting protected activities.we agree with the trial court that the teacher and safety disclosures do not amount to whistleblowing as a matter of law,but that the disclosures do present a triable issue of material fact of protected whistleblowing under section b.
the disclosures involving the two teachers do not amount to whistleblowing as a matter of law because,although the disclosures were made by a government employee patten to a government agency grant,the disclosures indisputably encompa
