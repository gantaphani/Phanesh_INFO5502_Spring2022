factual and procedural background 
reyes son,is a autistic student with deficits in cognitive functioning receptive,expressive,and pragmatic language abilities and fine and gross motor skills.in addition to autism,he has been diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction,moderate mental retardation,and disorder.sensory needs are significant if he does not receive various kinds of sensory input at regular intervals throughout the day a sensory diet,he is unable to maintain control over his behavior and may speak in a very loud voice,press on his eyes,rock his body back and forth,knock over objects,or pace.
was sixteen years old during the school year at issue and had been attending the rebecca school in manhattan,a therapeutic private school for students with neurodevelopmental delays in relating and communicating,since may.compl.doe paid for his placement at the rebecca school in the school year pursuant to a november,iho decision.
on may,a cse meeting was convened to develop iep for the school year.reyes,a doe psychologist named rose fochetta,a doe special education teacher,and a parent attended.then teacher at the rebecca school participated by telephone.to determine abilities and instructional needs,the cse team considered a classroom observation conducted on november,two psychological evaluations,conducted on december,and january,and a may progress report regarding performance at the rebecca school for the school year.
the iep produced by the cse team recommended that be placed in a special class six students,one special education teacher,and one classroom paraprofessional with various related services,including occupational therapy,speech and language therapy,physical therapy,and counseling.the iep also recommended that be assigned a paraprofessional for three months to ease the transition from private to public school.
on or about june,doe sent reyes a final notice of recommendation offering a seat at.reyes visited on june,with rebecca school occupational therapy supervisor mary wiener.on that visit,reyes and wiener toured the school,observed two classrooms,spoke with classroom teachers and an occupational therapist,and visited the therapy room and the cafeteria.both classes that reyes and wiener observed employed the methodology,with students seated at individual workstations and working independently.neither classroom teacher was familiar with the term.sensory diet.a personalized regimen of activities that provides the sensory input a child like requires to stay focused throughout the day.reyes and wiener were also told that did not have a sensory gym,a facility with specialized equipment that provides therapeutic sensory inputs.they observed tables,mats,and balls,but no swings or other equipment designed to create a sense of movement referred to as vestibular equipment.when wiener asked about the absence of such equipment,she was told that the school had none.as wiener testified,she and reyes were also told by a occupational therapist that the school was currently understaffed for occupational therapists and that they were using contractors,but that not all of the mandates were being met.hearing tr.at.
reyes ultimately rejected the proposed placement because she thought the school teacch methodology was not appropriate for,the school did not provide an adequate sensory diet or sensory equipment,the school did not provide an adequate level of individual attention,and the school was unable to meet related services mandate.on june,reyes enrolled in a program at the rebecca school for the school year.
reyes filed the due process complaint that initiated this action on march.on april,the iho issued an order on pendency requiring that doe pay tuition at the rebecca school during the course of the litigation.see j providing that during the pendency of proceedings the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child.
an impartial hearing was held over four days between april,and july.at the hearing,fochetta and anne duquette,a teacher at,testified on doe behalf.fochetta opined that require d a lot of support,but that doe proposed placement of a class with a transitional paraprofessional a service that could have been continue d if it was warranted c ould promote progress.hearing tr.at,id.at.duquette described how she implemented the teacch methodology in her classroom and explained the tailored strategies that she would have employed to meet particular needs.hearing tr.at,id.at.
reyes testified on her own behalf,as did five witnesses from the rebecca school.tina mccourt,the school program director,detailed significant sensory needs and expressed her skepticism that could make progress in a class or if instructed using the teacch methodology.she also asserted that terminating the transitional paraprofessional services after only three months would confuse by ending a relationship upon which he had become dependent.wiener described and criticized the lack of sensory equipment available at,while occupational therapist,speech pathologist,and teacher at the rebecca school further explained his needs and how the school staff met them.
the iho concluded in a decision dated september,that doe had denied a fape.she found that the class was inappropriate to meet needs and that it was insufficient to augment that ratio by providing paraprofessional support for three months only.iho decision,at.noting that doe argument that the paraprofessional services could have been extended beyond three months was merely speculative,the iho declined to determine whether a class with paraprofessional support for the entire school year would have been sufficient.id.the iho further found no proof that the resources available at would meet significant sensory needs or that the teacch methodology wa s individualized to meet needs.id.at.the iho concluded that placement at the rebecca school was appropriate and that there was no equitable impediment to tuition reimbursement.she therefore ordered doe to pay rebecca school tuition.
on september,doe appealed the iho decision to the new york state education department office of state review.on november,the sro overturned the iho decision,finding that doe had offered a fape for the school year.the sro found that the record did not support the iho determination that the class was inadequate to address needs,and further determined that,even if the record established that required paraprofessional services,the iep could have been modified to provide those services.in support of this conclusion,the sro cited the testimony of fochetta,the doe psychologist,that the cse recommended three months of paraprofessional support with the understanding that need for the service would be reassessed and that the service would be extended as needed.sro decision,at.the sro also concluded that reyes concerns regarding ability to address sensory needs,and the appropriateness of the teacch methodology utilized were not supported by the preponderance of the evidence contained in the hearing record.id.at.the sro did not reach the iho findings regarding the appropriateness of placement at the rebecca school or the balance of the equities.
reyes appealed from the sro decision to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the parties for summary judgment.on december,following oral argument,the district court upheld the conclusions of the sro.reyes dep t of,civ.whp,wl,dist.lexis.the court concluded that although the sro reliance on fochetta testimony that the iep could be modified was impermissible,the remainder of the evidence supported his determination that the iep was substantively adequate,wl at,dist.lexis at.the district court also upheld the sro conclusions that could meet sensory needs and that the teacch methodology was appropriate for,and declared any burden shifting on the part of the sro inconsequential,wl at,dist.lexis at.because the district court deferred to the sro conclusion that had been offered a fape,it did not consider the appropriateness of the rebecca school placement or the balance of the equities,wl at,dist.lexis at.
reyes appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment in an idea case is reviewed de novo.ex rel.bd.of,cir.after conducting an independent review,this court must base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,giving due weight to the state administrative decision because the judiciary generally lack s the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.gagliardo arlington cent.sch,cir quoting rowley,at.
in deciding what weight is due to an idea administrative decision,the analysis often will hinge on the kinds of considerations that normally determine whether any particular judgment is persuasive,at.such considerations include the quality and thoroughness of the reasoning,the type of determination under review,and whether the decision is based on the administrative body familiarity with the evidence and the witnesses.id.when an iho and the sro reach conflicting conclusions,we defer to the sro decision,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.but because the administrative factual findings must be reasoned and supported by the record to warrant deference,at quoting gagliardo,f d at,if a court concludes that an sro decision is inadequately reasoned,a iho opinion may be considered instead,at.
ii.issues for judicial review 
reyes argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that any burden shifting by the sro was inconsequential and in deferring to the sro findings that the class with three months of paraprofessional support was substantively adequate,was capable of addressing sensory needs,and the teacch methodology was appropriate for 
burden shifting 
in new york,the local school board bears the initial burden of establishing the iep validity.id.at see educ.law.the idea,by contrast,is silent on the burden of proof the supreme court has interpreted the statute to place the burden of challenging an iep on the party bringing the challenge.schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast.it remains an open question whether states may deviate from the idea default rule,as new york does,by placing the initial burden on the school board.see id.at declining to decide the issue.
we need not answer that question here.because the sro concluded that the iep was proper,and the courts are bound to exhibit deference to that decision,the burden of demonstrating that the sro erred is properly understood to fall on the plaintiff,at.moreover,because the standard here is preponderance of the evidence,which party bore the burden of persuasion in the state review scheme is only relevant if the evidence was in equipoise.id.as we explain below,we think that reyes has met her burden on appeal 
challenges to the iep substantive adequacy 
reyes contentions that the class with three months of paraprofessional support was inadequate,that was incapable of addressing sensory needs,and that the teacch methodology was inappropriate for all challenge the substantive adequacy of iep.for this reason,if reyes prevails on any one of these arguments,doe has failed to prove that its proposed iep provided with a fape.see,at.
the class ratio and the transitional paraprofessional.reyes argues that the class ratio specified in the iep,comprising both the placement and the dedicated paraprofessional for three months only,was inappropriate to meet academic and behavioral needs.as a threshold matter,we must decide whether the sro improperly relied on testimony asserting that iep could have been modified to include additional services.because we agree with the district court that the sro reliance on this evidence was improper,see reyes,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,we consider whether the iep as written was sufficient to provide with a fape.
we first conclude that the sro reliance on testimony that the iep could be modified to extend the paraprofessional services was improper under new york city department of education,at.prohibits using retrospective to materially alter a deficient written iep by establishing that the student would have received services beyond those listed in the iep.id.the purpose of discouraging reliance on retrospective testimony is to ensure that parents
