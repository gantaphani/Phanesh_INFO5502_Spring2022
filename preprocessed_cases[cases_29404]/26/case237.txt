opinion of the court 
now years of age,was a minor diagnosed with a learning disability and enrolled in school in the central dauphin school district central dauphin.parents,maria english and ronald sheffy,claimed that while was enrolled in central dauphin he was deprived of a free appropriate public education fape,in violation of the individuals with disabilities education idea,and that he was discriminated against based upon his various disabilities,in violation of the americans with disabilities ada and the rehabilitation act of ra.the district court dismissed idea claims,and later granted summary judgment in central dauphin favor as to the ada and ra claims.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
attended school in central dauphin from kindergarten to the seventh grade prior to his entrance into the school district,was enrolled in preschool at the capital area intermediate unit caiu.there,parents completed an early intervention referral form for purposes of a evaluation.on that form,they indicated that had attentional concerns.after undergoing several evaluations,caiu determined that was eligible for early intervention services and placed in speech and language therapy.
when began his transition into central dauphin in june,his school file indicated that he was entering the school district with an individualized education program iep to address his speech and language issues.in spite of that,was not placed in any specialized courses.three months later,mother signed a form permitting the school district to evaluate seven months after receiving permission,central dauphin conducted the evaluation.the only test conducted at that time was for speech and language therapy.the resulting comprehensive evaluation report cer and subsequent iep thus contained only speech and language goals.the cer described as a pleasant,friendly,outgoing child who got along well with other children and appeared to have self confidence.his report card for that school year,however,indicated that he was having considerable difficulty academically.by the end of his kindergarten year,he had not acquired the skills necessary to move on to the first grade and had to repeat his kindergarten year.
within one month of the start of repeat kindergarten year,in approximately september of,his mother initiated a request for another evaluation.the cer was completed on december,and identified as having a learning disability and as in need of specially designed instruction.that cer did not include recommendations for learning support services or address the attentional concerns raised by parents or any other impairments.was then placed in a learning support resource room where he received speech and language therapy.his new iep was completed on december,and contained learning support goals and objectives,as well as recommendations for speech and language services.parents approved of these recommendations.despite the changes in placement and services,teacher indicated at the end of his repeat year in kindergarten that he was still not performing academically at.
started his year at central dauphin in the fall of.at that time,his iep was modified to recommend that he be placed in a learning support room,which his parents approved.following that change,however,behavior became more erratic.his parents,concerned by this change in behavior,obtained both wraparound services and therapeutic support staff tss to attend school with him.parents continued to have concerns and,in april,had evaluated by an external medical provider,pinnacle health services pinnacle.pinnacle diagnosed as having borderline retardation,extreme difficulties with visual and motor skills,and disorder.pinnacle administered the wechsler intelligence scale for children wisc,which measures a child general cognitive abilities,and ultimately recommended that cognitive performance be closely monitored and by central dauphin within the next year.
central dauphin did not reevaluate for cognitive ability,as pinnacle had recommended,but did administer an additional wechsler independent achievement test wiat,which provides a comprehensive measure of a student basic scholastic skills.that evaluation report included results from the wiat scale and pinnacle wisc results.during that evaluation,central dauphin also determined that needed emotional support services.
entered the second grade in in a learning and emotional support program.during the school year,second grade teacher expressed concern about whether tss was necessary.the tss was later discontinued.at some point during his second grade year,began regressing behaviorally.as a result,mother requested an additional evaluation.the was completed by teacher,who expressed concerns about academic goals and placement.behavioral issues increased and he was eventually diagnosed with depression.central dauphin did not provide with a behavior support program or conduct an additional assessment.
iep was modified again in third grade to read seriously emotionally disturbed,a classification usually associated with mental retardation.as a result,was placed in a life skills support program,which focused on providing additional support geared towards children with a diagnosis of mental retardation.he was later mistakenly identified as having mental retardation.no adaptive behavior assessment was completed.remained in the life skills support program throughout the third and fourth grades.when mother realized was identified as mentally retarded,she filed a complaint and withdrew from the program.in response,central dauphin apologized to parents,found the designation error,fixed it,and advised mother of the change.later that year,was also inaccurately found to be ineligible for other extended school year services.
in,iep was changed to recommend that he participate in regular education courses for his year,with an emphasis on his specific learning disability.the very next year,however,goals and the specially designed instruction regarding his behavior and social issues were dropped from the iep without explanation.to further compound that error,was again found ineligible for extended school year services.
seventh grade iep goal was to increase his math skills to a level.however,teacher was not trained in any math instruction and she did not maintain any records demonstrating progress on the iep goal.during that same year,the team responsible for overseeing iep delayed the process while awaiting a new evaluation report.that delay resulted in working under an expired iep for three months.the new cer,once received,failed to assess in detail emotional and behavioral needs.in addition,although the new cer identified issues with social skills,the resulting iep never addressed that area,and central dauphin never conducted any in the form of classroom observations or assessments.
beginning in eighth grade,central dauphin convened a meeting with parents where they reviewed the previous iep and an evaluation report.moved from central dauphin shortly thereafter.following the move,parents requested a due process hearing with central dauphin to determine whether had been provided a fape during his time in central dauphin.
the administrative hearing was held in january and february of before an impartial hearing officer.at the conclusion of that hearing,the hearing officer found that central dauphin had violated both the idea and the ra during time with the school district.the hearing officer further concluded that had been denied a fape for all eight years while at central dauphin and that central dauphin knew had more needs than those answered by speech and language therapy upon his entry into the school district for his first year of kindergarten.
in an order dated march,the hearing officer awarded compensatory education in the amount of one hour for each hour of each school day for each year he attended central dauphin and fifteen hours for each of six weeks for missed summer programs for the years from to.app.at.the award went on to note that parents may decide how the hours should be spent,with some limitations,and that reimbursement for the services would be at the rate that the parent is obligated to pay,and not at a district determined rate.id.finally,the award noted that s hould the parties agree,central dauphin may set up a fund with a set dollar amount that the parent may draw upon for educational services and equipment.id.neither party appealed the hearing officer order.
on december,and his parents brought an action before the district court against central dauphin seeking to recover a monetary equivalent of the nearly hours of compensatory education awarded to in the hearing officer march order.and his parents also sought compensatory damages under the ada,idea,and of the ra.in an order dated march,following central dauphin motion for judgment on the pleadings,the district court dismissed idea claims,citing failure to exhaust administrative remedies,the fact that there existed no evidence that the hearing officer order required enforcement,and due to the unavailability of damages.the district court then denied central dauphin motion regarding ada and ra claims,noting that actions brought pursuant to those statutes did not require administrative exhaustion and that compensatory damages were available for those claims.
thereafter,central dauphin filed a motion for summary judgment as to ada and ra claims.the district court granted the motion on january,after finding no evidence that central dauphin had intentionally discriminated against now appeals the district court order dismissing his idea claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,as well as its conclusion that no evidence existed that the hearing officer order required enforcement and its order granting central dauphin motion for summary judgment on his ada and ra claims.
we note,at the outset,that a question of appellate jurisdiction potentially blocks our consideration of this appeal.we will,therefore,pause for a moment to determine our jurisdiction.see united states ruiz,it is familiar law that a federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.
on march,the clerk office issued an amended order addressing,among other things,ability to pursue the instant appeal on his own behalf.the order stated 
it is noted that appellant is now more than years old.given this,the parties must,within seven days of the date of this order,advise the court,in writing,whether is capable of prosecuting his own claims 
in addition,if is pursuing the appeal in his own behalf,he must personally sign the notice of appeal filed by his mother,maria english,and return it to the clerk office within fourteen days of the date of this order.failure to do so will result in dismissal of the appeal as to 
app.at citations omitted.the court of appeals docket indicates that signed notice of appeal was received on april,more than fifteen days later.
central dauphin urges this court to dismiss appeal because his signed notice of appeal was not received within the day timeframe designated by the order,by contrast,argues that an appellant failure to sign a notice of appeal is curable and should not result in dismissal so long as that failure is promptly corrected,as he argues he has done here.he directs our attention to becker montgomery,a supreme court decision cited within the amended order and which he claims supports his position.is correct.
it is well established that decisions on the merits should not be avoided on grounds of technical violations of procedural rules.polonski trump taj mahal,cir discussing rule c of the federal rules of appellate procedure see also drinkwater union carbide,cir noting that notices of appeal are to be construed liberally.here,failed to sign and return the notice of appeal within fourteen days of the date of the order.failure was cured,however,upon receipt by the clerk office of the signed notice approximately four days later on april.the supreme court has made clear that an appellant failure to sign a timely notice of appeal can be cured after the deadline to file the notice,as such a failure is curable and not a jurisdictional impediment.see becker,at.because the signature requirement was curable,and did indeed cure the defect shortly after the deadline,our jurisprudence counsels in favor of exercising appellate jurisdiction over appeal.we therefore conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the merits of the instant appeal

argues that he has demonstrated that central dauphin acted with deliberate indifference to his federally protected right to a fape.he relies heavily upon the hearing officer findings of fact in this regard,citing to various points in the administrative record which,in his opinion,demonstrate that central dauphin knew that it was violating his rights.directs our attention to the following findings made by the hearing officer central dauphin placement of into restrictive learning environments during his first and second grade years following certain evaluations that he considered to be lacking,as well as his subsequent misclassifications and misdiagnoses the failure of his ieps to address adhd concerns and his learning disabilities central dauphin placement of into a regular kindergarten classroom without an iep and the delay in his first evaluation following his mother request central dauphin incorrect designation of as ineligible for extended school year services and central dauphin failure to respond to concerns raised by his second and fourth grade teachers regarding his classroom placement and classification.these findings do not point to deliberate indifference.
to begin,the findings relied upon by largely relate to errors with the implementation of his iep and certain classifications assigned to him following his evaluations.without more,these errors fail to demonstrate that central dauphin knew that it was misclassifying misdiagnosing.we have stated this point before the relevant inquiry is knowledge,and evidence that the school district may have been wrong about a student diagnosis is not evidence that the school district had knowledge that it was a wrong diagnosis.nor does evidence that the school district evaluation processes were defective bear on our analysis,at.appears to suggest in his brief that central dauphin ignored the evaluation and recommendations conducted by pinnacle in however,in the same breath,he concedes that central dauphin relied upon the pinnacle findings in order to misclassify argument in this regard fails to acknowledge the fact that,although central dauphin did not conduct the exact tests recommended by pinnacle,it did indeed administer additional testing the wiat the results of which it incorporated with pinnacle test results into the new cer.arguments demonstrate,at best,possible defective evaluation processes,which,of course,have no bearing on the question of knowledge.
similarly unavailing are the points raised by regarding central dauphin incorrect designation regarding extended school year services and the delayed evaluation during his first year in the district.both allegations are premised upon what central dauphin should have known rather than what it actually knew.id.at deliberate indifference requires actual knowledge allegations that one would have or should have known will not satisfy the knowledge prong of deliberate indifference.there is nothing to suggest,in either instance,that central dauphin actions constituted anything more than negligence or poor.id.at deliberate indifference requires a deliberate choice,rather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction quoting loeffler,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the strongest argument makes with respect to knowledge are the concerns raised by a few of his teachers regarding his performance and placement.but even that argument is flawed,as there are several instances in the record in which parents approved of his ieps and subsequent placements,including his placement in learning support.by contrast,the record reveals only one instance in which parents disapproved of his placement and classification when central dauphin incorrectly identified as mentally retarded.however,even if we were to proceed to the second prong of the deliberate indifference test on that point alone,we would have no basis to conclude that central dauphin failed to act on this knowledge,because central dauphin immediately issued an apology to parents,found the designation error,fixed it,and advised mother of the change.
the fact of the matter is that each year was enrolled in the school district,central dauphin provided with special education and other related services through the completion and implementation of cers and ieps.while the points raised by are most certainly unfortunate,we can not agree that those findings are sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment on the question of deliberate indifference,particularly as to central dauphin knowledge.for these reasons,we must affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of central dauphin as to ada and ra claims

specifically argues that,at the time he filed his lawsuit,the administrative process in pennsylvania only allowed appeals in circumstances where a party objected to the hearing officer decision.because he prevailed at his hearing and was ultimately awarded damages,contends that he had no reason to file an administrative appeal.even still,points out that it was not until after the applicable timeframe for an appeal had passed that he truly became an aggrieved party as a result of central dauphin refusal to work with him and his parents regarding his award.further argues that the district court misconstrued his specific request for relief.he contends that his claim merely seeks an equitable remedy that will guarantee him the services to which he is entitled and which neither he nor his parents can otherwise afford not,as the district court concluded,an attempt to rewrite the hearing officer award.notes that to base the availability of a remedy under the idea on whether a student or his parents are able to front the costs of such remedies is inconsistent with public policy principles underlying the idea.
central dauphin argues,in contrast,that we should affirm the district court dismissal of idea claims in their entirety.according to central dauphin,the plain language of the hearing officer decision and order gave and his parents the responsibility to determine and initiate compensatory education services,and made central dauphin responsible for only reimbursements of any such services once attained.central dauphin asserts that was fully aware of the foregoing and still failed to appeal the decision despite his alleged inability to front the costs for the services.central dauphin further notes that the exhaustion requirement may be set aside only in certain circumstances and that failed to argue that any of those exceptions apply to his case.for that reason,central dauphin also contends that argument has been waived for failure to preserve it before the district court.finally,in further support of its position,central dauphin asserts that,to the extent that seeks to enforce or rewrite the hearing officer decision,the federal courts have no jurisdiction.
in order to resolve the issues presented by the parties,we must first address the district court conclusion that sought to rewrite,rather than enforce,the administrative decision.the district court concluded that the plain language of the order gives the parents the responsibility of determining and initiating the compensatory education services and makes central dauphin responsible for paying for those services at face value once they have been attained.cent.dauphin sch,cv,wl,at.based upon that interpretation of the hearing officer award,the district court concluded that there was no evidence to support contention that the order needed enforcement or that central dauphin had failed to compensate them for services for which they had previously paid.we disagree with that conclusion.while it is true that the hearing officer award contemplates reimbursement for services paid for by parents,it also states that,s hould the parties agree,central dauphin may set up a fund with a set dollar amount that the parent may draw upon for educational services and equipment.app.at.the inclusion of this language within the award demonstrates that the hearing officer clearly envisioned the method of payment that seeks to obtain here.of course,the parties must agree to set up the fund,but it remains true that the hearing officer award did contemplate such a remedy 
the inclusion of the fund language in the hearing officer award also demonstrates that central dauphin and parents were to work together for the benefit of going forward.indeed,it is more likely that the hearing officer intended that the parties work together to create the fund that seeks,than to give central dauphin an option to not agree to set up a fund.the district court and central dauphin ignore this point,and instead base their conclusions largely on the portion of the order that calls for reimbursement.this interpretation,however,which places all of the responsibility on and his parents to remedy central dauphin failures under the idea,is contrary to the very purpose of the statute,which is to provide a remedy for those denied a fape.see collingswood borough bd.of,cir to comply with the idea,a school district no longer responsible for educating a child must still be held responsible for its past transgressions.were we to uphold the district court ruling,we would create an enormous loophole in that obligation and thereby substantially weaken the i d ea protections.specifically alleges that he is being denied this remedy,as central dauphin is unwilling to cooperate with him to create the fund envisioned by the hearing officer.this allegation is certainly reinforced by central dauphin interpretation of the award that it was only required to reimburse for services already attained by the student and his parents.
the gravamen of complaint is that he can not afford to front the costs of the services that central dauphin was obligated to have provided him for free under the idea,and which they failed to do.our court,as well as several others,has recognized that the availability of idea remedies should not depend upon whether a student or his parents have the financial means to front the costs of those remedies.see,id.at holding that a claim for compensatory education is not rendered moot by an move,even if that move takes the child out of state because,to hold otherwise,would particularly impact special needs students reid district of columbia,w ere it impossible to obtain an award of the compensatory instruction itself,children access to appropriate education could depend on their parents capacity to front its costs a result manifestly incompatible with idea purpose of ensuring that all children with disabilities have available to them a fape.internal quotation marks omitted lester gilhool,cir w e conclude that congress,by allowing the courts to fashion an appropriate remedy to cure the deprivation of a child right to a fape,did not intend to offer a remedy only to those parents able to afford an alternative private education.miener missouri,cir we can not agree with the defendants that they should escape liability for these services simply because plaintiff was unable to provide them in the first instance we are confident that congress did not intend the child entitlement to a free education to turn upon her parent ability to front its costs.the district court,in adopting and applying central dauphin interpretation of the hearing officer award,made access to a fape dependent upon his family ability to front the costs of his compensatory education award.
in sum,the district court had within its power to formulate an appropriate remedy that would effectuate the purpose of the idea and the hearing officer award.instead,the district court interpreted the hearing officer award in a manner inconsistent with public policy principles underlying the idea,and effectively provided central dauphin a way to escape liability for its past idea violations by refusing to agree with and his family to set up a fund for purposes of obtaining the educational services to which he was clearly entitled.we can not uphold such an interpretation,as doing so would create an enormous loophole in a school district obligations under the idea,while substantially weaken ing the idea protections for students in position,at.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in finding that claims sought to rewrite,rather than enforce,the administrative decision.
since we have concluded that did indeed seek to enforce the hearing officer order,we must resolve a question of first impression,that is,whether a party seeking to enforce a favorable decision from an administrative due process hearing must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit in a court of law.
the idea is a spending clause statute that seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a fape.schaffer weast,internal quotation mark omitted.the statute leaves to the states the primary responsibility for developing and executing educational programs for handicapped children,but imposes significant requirements to be followed in the discharge of that responsibility.id.at alteration in original quoting bd.of ed.of hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley.the core of the statute,however,is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.id.at.the statute places significant emphasis on a parent involvement in the disabled child education,and requires the school to maintain contact with the parents throughout the entire process.id.if a parent is displeased with the school actions with respect to the fape provision,the idea provides for certain procedural safeguards available to children with disabilities and their parents.see a.
one such procedural safeguard is the right of those aggrieved by violations of the idea to a due process hearing before an administrative official.see id.at b see also,at noting that a child or a parent who claims violations of the idea can file a complaint with a due process hearing officer.a ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered by the administrative official may appeal such findings and decision to the state educational agency.g.at the final stage of the aforementioned enforcement procedure,the idea permits any aggrieved party to bring a civil action in state or federal court.jeremy mount lebanon sch,cir see also i.there,the court will review the records of the administrative proceedings,hear additional evidence at the request of either party,and grant relief as may be appropriate.komninos upper saddle river bd.of,f d,cir see also i c.
as noted above,the idea grants subject matter jurisdiction to the federal district courts.see komninos,at.the language of the idea makes clear,however,that congress intended plaintiffs to complete the administrative process before resorting to federal court.id.this includes the process detailed above,participation in a due process hearing and,where appropriate,an appeal to the state educational agency.g.the supreme court has noted as much regarding administrative exhaustion under the idea 
a llowing an equal protection claim without requiring exhaustion under the predecessor statute,would not only render superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute,but,more important,it would also run counter to congress view that the needs of handicapped children are best accommodated by having the parents and the local education agency work together to formulate an individualized plan for each handicapped child education.
komninos,at quoting smith robinson,u.it follows,then,that in order to give effect to these important purposes,courts must enforce the rules of exhaustion.it bears noting,however,that there are four exceptions where exhaustion would be unnecessary.those recognized by this court include situations where exhaustion would be futile or inadequate the issue presented is purely a legal question the administrative agency can not grant relief and exhaustion would cause severe or irreparable harm.id.absent the existence of any of those exceptions,failure to exhaust will deprive a federal court of subject matter jurisdiction.
here,neither party disputes that failed to appeal the hearing officer findings and decision.however,contends that there was no need to appeal since he won at his due process hearing in all regards.according to,once a party receives a completely favorable administrative decision,there is nothing left to appeal administratively.we agree.two cases from the fourth and ninth circuit courts of appeals provide support for this conclusion.see porter bd.of trs.of manhattan beach unified sch,cir robinson pinderhughes,cir.
