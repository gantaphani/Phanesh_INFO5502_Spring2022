background 
individuals with disabilities education act 
the idea is a spending statute that imposes obligations on the states to provide certain benefits in exchange for federal funds.ellenberg ex rel.military,cir.one of its purposes is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a fape that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,employment,and independent living.d a.states receiving federal funds under the idea are to provide a fape to all children with disabilities residing in the state between the ages of and.a a.the supreme court has held that a state satisfies this requirement by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.bd.of educ.rowley,d.
a child fape must conform with his or her individualized education program iep.see d.the iep is a written statement that sets forth the child present performance level,goals and objectives,specific services that will enable the child to meet those goals,and evaluation criteria and procedures to determine whether the child has met the goals.ass for cmty.living in romer,cir see d a defining iep.the iep may include esy services if such services are necessary for the provision of fape to the child.a see johnson ex rel.johnson indep.sch.dist.of bixby,tulsa county,cir provision of esy services turns on whether the benefits accrued to the child during the regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is not provided an educational program during the summer months internal quotation marks omitted.if provided,esy services must m eet the standards of the state educational agency,b,which in this case is the cde,see id.ann.a.
prior proceedings 
on may,joshua parents and district personnel met to review his iep for the school year.the meeting also considered whether he was eligible for esy services for the summer of.district personnel determined that joshua was eligible for esy services.joshua alleges that the services offered were to be limited to one hour and ten minutes per day from june to august.his parents requested that the esy services focus on skills identified in the iep that he had not yet achieved,as well as skills identified for the iep.at mem.op.order,d.but their request,apparently premised on their understanding that autistic children require continual development of new skills to retain previously learned skills,was rejected.they then allegedly supplemented the district esy services for joshua in the summer of with additional educational services at their own expense.
on july,joshua attorney filed a demand for a hearing.it contended that the district policy,which followed guidelines established by the cde,violated the idea because it limited esy services to maintaining learned skills and did not permit teaching new skills.the demand proposed resolution of the dispute sought the following determinations and relief 
a.the esy services offered by the district are not appropriate for joshua based on his individual needs in that they do not provide a sufficient number of hours and are limited to maintaining existing skills rather than teaching new skills in areas of joshua curriculum that need continuous attention.
b.that the district proposed esy services were not reasonably or appropriately designed to provide joshua with any meaningful or appropriate educational benefit and therefore deny him the free and appropriate education he is entitled to receive under colorado exceptional children educational act and idea.
c.that the services provided to joshua and paid for by the mcqueens during the extended school year are appropriate and necessary to provide joshua with an appropriate public education.
d.that the mcqueens are entitled to claim and recover reimbursement for all of their educational expenses incurred during the extended school year in providing joshua with an appropriate education 
for reimbursement of all of the mcqueens costs,disbursements,expert fees,and reasonable attorneys fees and 
for such other and further relief as the hearing officer deems fair and reasonable.
demand for impartial due process hr g at,mcqueen.springs sch.dist,no.dep t of educ.july.
on september,the parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings.in the first stage a hearing officer would hear argument on the primary legal issue in the case,namely,whether the cde guidelines for determining esy services and the district esy policy violate the idea by limiting required esy services to maintaining learned skills rather than developing new skills.at stipulated mot.for bifurcation of due process hr g.with respect to this issue,each party could call one expert witness to testify generally about educating children with autism.id.at.after the hearing officer ruled,the parties could either appeal the ruling to a state administrative law judge alj or proceed to an evidentiary hearing focusing on the particulars of joshua case.
at the september proceeding joshua parents called an expert witness on the education of children with autism,and the parties presented legal argument.the only exhibits were a copy of the cde guidelines on esy services and the resume of the expert.in a written order filed november,the hearing officer concluded that the cde guidelines and,by implication,the district policy did not violate the idea.he noted that his decision did not consider whether joshua iep as implemented during the school year or extended school year provided a fape.id.at.
joshua parents appealed the hearing officer decision on his behalf,and an alj affirmed on april.the alj noted,however,that his review was 
limited to the legal issue of whether the esy process established by cde and used by the district violates the idea on its face.it is possible in an individual case,based on the particular facts of that case,that an esy program as designed would significantly jeopardize the benefits previously gained by the child.to decide whether that occurred in joshua case would require much more extensive evidence than was presented in the limited hearing conducted by the hearing officer.this factual issue was not before the hearing officer and is not before the alj on this state level review.
rather than continue to an evidentiary hearing,joshua parents on june,filed on his behalf a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado.the complaint,which names as defendants the district and various of its elected and appointed representatives in their official capacities,id.at,asks the court to rule that the district esy policy violates the idea and then remand to the hearing officer to determine how much to reimburse joshua parents for costs and expenses incurred by them in providing esy services to joshua over the summer of,to determine what compensatory educational services should be provi
