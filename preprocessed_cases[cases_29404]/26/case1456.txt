we conclude that the trial court correctly dismissed the action because plaintiff published summons did not specify a concrete date for response,the date calculable from the language of the summons did not provide the full amount of time required,and plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause for his failure to comply with these statutory requirements.
i.the applicable law 
in order to place our discussion in context we begin with a summary of the applicable law.under the validation statutes a public agency may seek a judicial determination of the validity of some matter,such as an ordinance,resolution,or other action taken by the agency.if the agency does not seek validation within the time required,any interested person may file what is sometimes called a reverse validation action to test the validity of the matter.the validation procedure is intended to provide a uniform mechanism for prompt resolution of the validity of a public agency actions.planning conservation league department of water resources cal th,d.the procedure assures due process notice to all interested persons and settles the validity of a matter once and for all by a single lawsuit.hills for everyone local agency formation com.d.

ii.procedural background 
a.the complaint 
plaintiff lawsuit challenges an parcel tax approved by school district voters to fund programs to reduce class size,retain qualified teachers,and improve academics and safety at schools within the school district.the measure was approved in an election in which the phrase qualified electors was defined as natural persons actually residing within the school district territorial boundaries who were registered according to law with the registrar of voters.plaintiff objection is that although he will ultimately have to pay the tax because he owns property within the territory covered by the school district,he was not qualified to vote in the election since he did not reside within the district.plaintiff argued that the definition of qualified elector unconstitutionally disenfranchised him and enfranchised residents who would never have to pay the tax.according to plaintiff,the phrase should have been defined as t he elector who owned property which would be subjected to the new tax t he elector who directly or indirectly would pay the new tax and t he elector who would vote to directly or indirectly tax rather than someone else.
the complaint includes three causes of action against the school district.in the first cause of action plaintiff expressly seeks to invalidate the tax under sections et.the second cause of action requests a judicial declaration defining the phrase qualified elector as plaintiff proposes it should be defined and a declaration stating that,since the measure did not provide for an election among qualified electors so defined,the election approving the measure was invalid.the third cause of action requests an injunction restraining imposition of the parcel tax.
b.the summons 
plaintiff published a summons in two different newspapers on three consecutive fridays february,and.in pertinent part,the summons read as follows all persons interested in the matter described herein have calendar days after the last day this summons is published in which to file a written response with this court contesting the legality or validity of the challenged tax a nd to have a copy served upon plaintiff.italics added.three dates appear at the end.
c.the summons defects 
the summons contains two defects that are pertinent to this appeal.first,plaintiff summons did not specify a concrete response date.section requires the summons to give notice that a response is due no later than the date specified in the summons and section provides that jurisdiction is complete upon the date specified in the summons.the date specified must be a concrete date certain,not a date calculable from the language of the summons.county of riverside superior court th,d county of riverside.
second,the direction to respond within days of the last day this summons is published did not provide the full amount of time required,which is or more days after the completion of publication of the summons,italics added.plaintiff had assumed that completion of publication would be the last day the summons was published.but section requires the summons to be published in accordance with section of the government code,which in turn provides that the period of notice commences upon the first day of publication and terminates at the end of the day,including therein the first day.completion of publication occurs when the period of notice has days after it began.arnold newhall county water dist.d.arnold.since plaintiff commenced publication on february,publication was complete when the period of notice expired on february.days after that would have been march.the instruction in the summons,to respond within days of the last day of publication,would make the last day to respond february,nearly a week shy of the time allowed by law.
d.the motion to dismiss 
the school district filed a motion to dismiss the entire action based upon the defects in the summons.the trial court granted the motion,holding 
plaintiff did not comply with and in that he failed to timely complete publication of summons and failed to file proof of publication within days after filing of the complaint.pursuant to,dismissal may be avoided upon a showing of good cause for the failure to comply with the statutes.plaintiff,however,did not make such a showing.
plaintiff argued that if the court were inclined to conclude that he failed to comply with the cited statutes,he should be given an opportunity to cure the defects with the publication of the summons.the court is of the opinion that compliance with and is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining a reverse validation proceeding and that the failure to comply therewith can not be cured as proposed by plaintiff.
iii.issues 
plaintiff contentions on appeal may be summarized as follows 
the summons publication requirements are not jurisdictional 
the court must disregard deficiencies in the published summons when all indispensable parties are actually before the court 
plaintiff causes of action for declaratory and injunctive relief were not subject to dismissal 
the summons substantially complied with the statutory requirements and,in any event,the court had jurisdiction to permit plaintiff to cure any defects and 
the trial court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiff had not shown good cause for the deficiencies in the summons.
iv.discussion
