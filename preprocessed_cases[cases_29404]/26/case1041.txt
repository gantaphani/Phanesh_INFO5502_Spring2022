the world trade organization wto is the international organization charged with dealing with the rules of trade between nations.in late november,top trade officials from countries met in seattle.the seattle gathering gained national attention,not just for the policy debate on international trade issues but also because of the demonstrations and violence that occurred.
this civil rights case stems from a community college instructor claim that the college retaliated against her after she attended wto protests with some of her students.her claim is a hybrid involves both speech and associational rights under the first amendment.we are presented with an issue of first impression,namely the appropriate test for benchmarking this hybrid right.we conclude that this case should be evaluated under the balancing test established in pickering board of education,d,and that under pickering,the college legitimate safety and pedagogical concerns outweighed the instructor rights.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the college.
factual and procedural background 
in,clark college,a community college in vancouver,washington,hired barbara hudson as an adjunct instructor to teach economics,introduction to economics.in the fall of,a few of hudson students suggested that the class attend a public rally and march opposing the wto.hudson thought that her students attendance at the rally organized by the on behalf of the labor movement would be a good idea,and that the speakers would expose the students to points of view not widely disseminated in the mainstream media.
when james craven,the lead tenured professor in clark college economics department,became aware of hudson plan to attend the rally with her students,he was absolutely opposed to it.the internet and news accounts warned about the potential for violence during the demonstrations and the seattle police department was undertaking preparations in anticipation of rioting.the event was cast as the battle for seattle.craven told hudson that attending the rally would put the students in danger and threatened to have her terminated if she went ahead with her plan.
although these concerns did not stop craven from attending the wto protests himself,he was worried about the potential risk to students and potential liability for the college.craven communicated to hudson that the students who attended the rally would have access to their teacher for schmoozing and networking in a way that other students would not that a teacher should not mix her professional responsibilities with her politics and that there was only marginal educational benefit in attending the demonstration.nonetheless,craven said that it was fine if hudson or the students attended the wto rally independently,without any affiliation with clark college.
patti serrano,head of the business division at the college,also was troubled that hudson wanted to attend the wto as part of a field trip.serrano felt that hudson was not completely forthright about her plans,and eventually learned that hudson and the students planned to participate in a demonstration explicitly opposing the objectives of the wto.serrano recommended to yvette jackson,of the college,that hudson not be permitted to attend the demonstrations with students in a manner that suggested association in any manner with the college.
two days before the protests in question,jackson wrote a letter to faculty members that voiced grave concerns about any involvement by clark college students and faculty in the wto rallies.her major concerns were the safety of students and faculty,and she laid down the following guidelines for faculty 
your participation in this event,as well as the participation of any clark college student is as an individual,and not as a representative of clark college.
the participation of students must be entirely voluntary.
there can not be any connection or participation in this event to any grade or activity in the class.
students must be made aware that they are participating in this activity as individuals,and not as students at clark college.
students who do not participate in this activity can not in any way be penalized in terms of grade or be required to do any extra activity to make up for their lack of involvement.
you will be responsible for the safety of the students accompanying you,and are charged with making prudent decisions as to the safety of participation in certain activities.
emphasis in original.
hudson backed off from her idea of organizing a field trip under the auspices of the college,and she wrote to jackson that she would tell the students planning to go to seattle that we are not an official clark college field trip.she stressed that t he students will not be carrying placards in the parade identifying them as clark college students.
although she disclaimed any official role for herself as the instructor of students who would be in attendance,hudson emphasized the educational value of observing the protests and the caliber of the organizations cosponsoring the wto literature that she distributed in class to her students.she told students attending the rally to observe information as it might be on the test.hudson claimed that no students were pressured to attend,and that her role was confined to finding transportation because private vehicles would be unable to reach downtown seattle on the day of the rally.in the materials setting out trip details,she wrote 
this will be the political mardi gras of the century in washington state.of course,there are just a few more days in the century 
take care of one another.stick with your buddy and your group.make lots of noise.dress warmly.slickers will be provided if necessary.take along a peanut butter or other sturdy sandwich that will not spoil just in case no vendors are available when you are hungry.smile,laugh,tell jokes,observe information it might be on the test 
the prediction of rioting and mass demonstrations erupted into reality.on november,the mayor of seattle declared a civil emergency and imposed a curfew over a large portion of the city.that same day,hudson took a bus with some of her students,her husband,and others from churches and unions.their participation in the rally was without incident.although hudson attempted to circumvent the clear directive that she could not sponsor a field trip on behalf of the college,the trip was,in effect,a de facto class field trip.as structured,from hudson organization of the trip to her integration of the trip into the final examination,it was impossible to separate the trip from the college.
shortly after the wto protests,craven recommended of hudson contract.he wrote to hudson that her services in teaching economics would not be required for the winter,and that wambalaba,the tenured faculty member who was on leave,indicated a desire to return to the college to teach economics.craven also advised her that he would be assuming responsibility for economics classes in order to establish course content and scope consistent with the college needs.
hudson then filed suit against craven and four other administrators of clark college collectively the college or clark college.she alleged a cause of action under for violations of the first amendment and a state law theory of tortious interference with a business expectancy.
the district court granted the college motion for summary judgment.the court found that under the pickering test,the interests of clark college outweighed those of hudson in associating with her students at the rally.in the alternative,under the test in healthy city school district board of educ.doyle,d,the district court found that hudson contract with the college would have been discontinued anyway,and that the administrators enjoyed qualified immunity.the court also dismissed her state law claim.
ii.discussion 
a.the pickering standard and hybrid first amendment claims 
the essence of hudson claim is that clark college retaliated against her because she exercised her first amendment rights.in a prototypical retaliation scenario,to establish a prima facie case under the first amendment,a public employee like hudson must show that she engaged in protected speech the defendants took an adverse employment action against her and her speech was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action.thomas city of beaverton,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.once that showing has been made,the burden shifts to the employer who must 
demonstrate either that,under the balancing test established by pickering,the employer legitimate administrative interests outweigh the employee first amendment rights or that,under the mixed motive analysis established by healthy,the employer would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the employee protected conduct.
id.internal alterations,quotations,and citations omitted.
hudson claim,however,is not prototypical.as the district court explained,her claim is more one involving freedom of association than freedom of speech.hudson does not claim that clark college terminated her employment because of any statements she made to her students or to anyone else.she was free to express her views about the wto,which her supervisor in fact shared,both inside and outside the classroom.she also was free to participate in the rally as an expression of her views.nor does hudson claim that the college curtailed her right to associate with other protesters unconnected to the college.hudson concedes in her brief that i t was fine with craven if hudson went or if individuals who happened to be students at the college went to the wto rally he just objected to them going together.
the deprivation of first amendment rights that hudson asserts is thus very,the right to associate with a small group of students during a specific time frame for the particular purpose of attending an rally.yet,while hudson claim revolves around a right to associate with students,it is not purely associational.the very purpose of the rally was to speak out against the wto,an exercise that implicates core speech rights.even though associational aspects predominate,the speech rights are inextricable from the claim.her claim is best characterized as a hybrid claim 
we have not directly addressed the question of whether pickering applies where the associational freedoms claimed to be infringed predominate over the freedom of speech per se.the pickering balancing test stems from the proposition that the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.at.the test,stated simply by the supreme court,requires courts to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.the pickering analysis involves a inquiry whether the speech that led to the adverse employment action relates to a matter of public concern and whether,under the balancing test,the public employer can demonstrate that its legitimate interests outweigh the employee first amendment rights.
a review of our sister circuits consideration of pickering,hybrid rights and related issues is instructive.in a case that closely parallels our own,the second circuit recently considered the relationship between first amendment speech and associational rights.melzer bd.of,cir.melzer,a public high school teacher,was fired when it came to light that he was an active member of the north american love association,an organization that promotes pedophilia.the court noted that the case was unusual in that the activity which prompted the school board to fire melzer was not a specific instance of speech,or a particular disruptive statement,but an associational activity of which speech was an essential component.id.at.
although it could be argued that,as with hudson,melzer was free to articulate his views so long as he did not associate in a way proscribed by his employer,the court stated that t he root of the disruption at bronx science can not be identified discretely as either melzer associational activities or the attendant speech,for the two are dependent on one another.id.at.the court observed that the pickering test had been applied by courts in other hybrid rights cases and then analyzed melzer claim under that standard.id.at.
the most problematic aspect of applying the pickering balancing test to associational claims is the public concern component.fifteen years after pickering,in connick myers,d,the supreme court fleshed out the meaning of public concern.the court drew a distinction between employee speech on matters of public concern and matters only of personal interest.id.at.the court recognized that an assistant district attorney speech related to official pressure to work on a campaign was a matter of public concern because it was a matter of interest to the community upon which it is essential that public employees be able to speak out freely without fear of retaliatory dismissal.id.at.
as the second circuit noted in melzer,a pplication of the public concern test is made awkward in such a case given the hybrid nature of the rights involved.at.in such circumstances,an association engaged in advocacy may deliver many different statements at many different times and places and under many different circumstances.what statements,at what locations and in what context are the ones that should be analyzed is shrouded in uncertainty.id.the second circuit ultimately sidestepped the problem,assuming that melzer association did involve a matter of public concern and deciding that his claim failed anyway in the second step of the pickering analysis.id.at.
although connick was a pure speech case,the sixth circuit has invoked the supreme court framework in an associational freedom claim.boals gray,cir.in boals,the court zeroed in on connick statement that 
in all of these cases,the precedents in which pickering is rooted,the invalidated statutes and actions sought to suppress the rights of public employees to participate in public affairs.the issue was whether government employees could be prevented or chilled by the fear of discharge from joining political parties or other associations that certain public officials might find subversive.
id.at quoting connick,at.emphasis in boals.recognizing that although pickering and connick both involved freedom of speech,the court underscored that both cases are based upon freedom of association cases.id.consequently,in boals,the court perceive d no logical reason for differentiating between speech and association in applying connick to first amendment claims id.
two seventh and eleventh expressed concern that the connick test does not adequately protect associational claims that do not fit neatly within the bounds of public concern.although the seventh circuit is firmly in the camp of those circuits that apply connick to associational claims,balton city of milwaukee,cir,one panel expressed misgivings that the connick public concern test may not adequately protect freedom of association for public employees because some associational instance,whom to purely private matters.id.at.these private associational matters often would not qualify as matters of public concern and,therefore,would not be protected from retaliatory action under the connick test.
the eleventh circuit explicitly rejected the application of the approach in hatcher board of public education,cir.in hatcher,a former school principal argued that she had been reassigned in part because of her association with parents and others who opposed the school closing plan that had eliminated her position as principal,and because she brought her minister and a school board member to her meeting with the assistant superintendent.id.at.
the court declared that it did 
not view connick as a retreat from naacp alabama,at,in which justice harlan wrote for the court it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertains to political,economic,religious or cultural matters state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freed
