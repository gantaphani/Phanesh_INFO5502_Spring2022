kathy jones brought this action against national american university nau alleging that nau had failed to promote her in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.et.a jury found nau had discriminated against jones and that its conduct was willful.the district denied nau motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial,and judgment was entered for in damages,as well as attorney fees and costs.nau appeals,and we affirm.
jones began working for nau in as a part time corporate liaison at the university rapid city,south dakota campus.she became a full time admissions representative the same year.in february the director of admissions position at the rapid city campus became available.jones,then age,applied for the position.nau formed a four person committee to make the hiring decision.the committee was comprised of members of the rapid city campus administration,including richard buckles,its president,as well as the academic dean,business manager,and dean of student success.
a few months prior to the opening of the director of admissions position,nau had interviewed candidates for the position of vice president of admissions for the university online program.on behalf of the rapid city campus hiring committee,buckles contacted the candidates who had not been offered the vice president position and inquired into whether they were interested in the director of admissions position.based on the candidates responses,buckles narrowed the list of qualified applicants to six of the prior vice president candidates plus jones.
the hiring committee conducted phone interviews with each of the applicants,after which the list was further narrowed to three candidates tim schnabel,jeff babbe,and jones.each of the candidates met with the hiring committee for an in person interview.the committee first offered the position to schnabel,then age,who was at the time an admissions coordinator for nau online program.schnabel declined.the committee then offered the position to babbe,who had a sales and management background but no recruiting experience.babbe also declined.
the committee did not offer the position to jones after schnabel and babbe turned it down,deciding instead to expand its search.buckles asked jones to take over the majority of the director of admission duties on an interim basis while the committee sought out new candidates.as part of those duties,jones participated with buckles in interviewing applicants for vacant admissions representative positions.at trial jones testified that while she and buckles were discussing one applicant,a man in his mid fifties,buckles made the comment,i not sure we want a grandpa working with our high school students.jones believed the remark was discriminatory,but she did not report it to anyone at nau.
one of the applicants for the admissions representative position who had been interviewed by jones and buckles was angela beck.then age,beck was a former associate hospital administrator with the army.following her interview,buckles offered beck an administrative representative position.she declined it due to the salary.buckles then arranged for the hiring committee to interview beck by telephone for the director of admissions position.the committee offered her the position after the interview,and she accepted.
when jones learned that beck had been offered the director position,she submitted a letter of resignation to buckles.jones testified at trial that when she turned in her letter of resignation,buckles told her that while she would have been the better choice for the position in the short term,beck was a better choice for the long term.jones believed that buckles was referring to the fact that beck might work in the position longer because she was significantly younger.
jones filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc,alleging that nau had wrongfully failed to promote her to the director position because of her age.nau submitted a written response to the charge denying the allegation and asserting that jones had not been promoted due to her deficient performance.the eeoc dismissed jones charge with a finding of no probable cause and issued her a right to sue letter.
jones then brought this action claiming nau had discriminated against her in violation of adea.she also alleged that the university failure to promote her amounted to a constructive discharge.the court granted summary judgment on jones constructive discharge claim but denied it on her adea claim.a jury trial was held from november.jones presented evidence to show that she was the most qualified applicant for the director of admissions position and that she had not been offered the position because of her age.nau denied discriminating against jones because of her age.the university presented evidence that jones had not been promoted because of her lack of management experience,which jones claimed was only pretext.
during trial jones sought to enter exhibit into evidence,a job posting for the director of admissions position.that posting provided that a minimum of three years post secondary recruiting experience was required for the director position.the court admitted the exhibit over nau objections.nau entered into evidence an alternate job posting for the director position which stated that three years of post secondary recruiting experience were preferred,rather than required.neither job posting listed management experience as a minimum requirement or preference for the director position.
jones testified that she had received positive reviews during her six years at nau,that she had significant recruiting experience,and that buckles age related comments caused her to believe that she was not offered the director position because of her age.several members of the hiring committee,including buckles,testified that jones was not promoted due to her lack of management and marketing experience.the court allowed jones,over nau objection,to introduce for impeachment purposes the university response to her eeoc charge,which provided that jones had not been promoted to the director position due to her deficient performance.
after a four day trial,the jury returned a verdict in jones favor,finding that nau had failed to promote her to the director of admissions position as a result of age discrimination.the jury awarded jones in compensatory damages.the total damages award was then doubled to because the jury found nau discrimination to be willful.
nau moved for judgment as a matter of law and alternatively for a new trial.the district court denied both motions and upheld the damage award and added attorney fees and costs.nau appeals from this order and argues that its motion should have been granted because of evidentiary errors and evidence insufficient to support the verdict.nau also argues that the court erred by giving a changed reasons jury instruction and by declining its request for an honest belief jury instruction.
nau first argues that the district court erred by admitting into evidence the three job postings offered by jones and by allowing her to introduce nau eeoc charge response for impeachment purposes.we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,disregarding any error that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.mcpheeters black veatch,cir.a.
nau first challenges the admission of exhibit,the job posting for the director of admissions position.the exhibit listed recruiting experience as a requirement for the position,experience that jones had,but beck did not.nau argues that the document was not properly authenticated.federal rule of evidence a provides that the requirement of authentication is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.the party authenticating the exhibit need only prove a rational basis for that party claim that the document is what it is asserted to be.united states wadena,cir.this may be done with circumstantial evidence.id.
at trial jones testified that she had seen the job posting on an nau bulletin board in an administration building.another nau employee,darlene poste,testified
