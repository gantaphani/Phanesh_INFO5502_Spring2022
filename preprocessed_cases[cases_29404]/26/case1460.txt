in this sexual harassment action,a visiting student appeals the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of an incorporated charter high school,its teacher and the chartering school district on the ground that she failed to comply with and was not excused from meeting the claim presentation requirements of the government tort claims act et the tca.following wells learning foundation cal th,d,wells,we conclude that,as an alleged nonprofit public benefit corporation,the charter school is not a public entity under the tca.it is further not required to file identifying information on the roster of public agencies under section.thus,claims against the incorporated charter need not satisfy the tca.accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions.
factual and procedural background 
the following facts are undisputed.plaintiff and appellant courtney knapp lives with her parents in pacific palisades.defendant and respondent palisades charter high school pchs,a california corporation whose charter was granted by defendant and respondent los angeles unified school district lausd,is the public high school that serves the area.in february,then knapp was in the eighth grade at calvary christian school calvary,a private school.knapp parents planned to send her to pchs for high school upon graduation from calvary.
on february,pchs sponsored a shadow day,which provided prospective students the opportunity to attend two classes with a pchs student.knapp shadowed pchs student kaylie mcallister,her friend and neighbor.they attended an advanced placement european history class taught by defendant and respondent ronald cummings,who allegedly made allowed other students to make sexual statements or innuendos toward knapp.
specifically,upon learning that knapp attended calvary,cumming made the sign of the cross and said,may god bless you.he then asked knapp to make his tea.during class,cumming allegedly slapped,hugged and kissed two male students.in the middle of his lecture,cummings brought up the topic of janet jackson exposing her breast on the super bowl show,whereupon a student commented that knapp probably did not know the meaning of the word boob.a student was surprised to learn that knapp was in the eighth grade,exclaiming that she was huge.the remark drew laughter from the class in light of the janet jackson discussion.when the embarrassed student explained that he meant knapp was tall,cummings looked at knapp breasts and commented that she had a nice pair of knockers.later,the word boob was again injected into the class discussion.another student remarked,maybe we should show the grader what they look like.for the rest of the class period,cummings interspersed his lecture with profanity and discussed the shuttlecock loom,which he called the cock.
the experience in cummings class made courtney knapp feel embarrassed,humiliated,exposed,and afraid that cummings and his students would single her out again for sexual banter.fearful of running into cummings again and of being teased by students from the class,she stopped attending athletic events to support her friends at pchs.knapp ultimately decided against going to pchs for high school.instead,she elected to enroll at the private oaks christian high school in westlake village,a bus ride from pacific palisades.

a.the demand 
on the night of shadow day,courtney knapp father,thomas knapp,directed an to pchs then principal and executive director linda hosford about cummings conduct with his daughter,and demanded a call within one business day and a meeting within two business days.however,the he sent to hosford was apparently directed to the wrong address.thomas knapp then forwarded hosford a written account of the events.mcallister and her mother also complained orally and in writing to hosford and the pchs board of directors about cummings.hosford declined to meet with the knapps until she completed an investigation of the incident.hosford enlisted the help of assistant principal ann davenport with the investigation and advised her that the school was being sued.
on february,knapp retained counsel and demanded that pchs either terminate cummings or pay for four years of courtney knapp private education.in a letter dated february by its counsel,pchs declined to negotiate with knapp on her demands and gave the following notice should you wish to file a claim for such alleged damages with the school,you will need to first file a claim which meets the requirements of the government tort claims act under california law.
