norma woman who has worked for the pulaski county special school district the school district since for a buyer position with the school district in.she was not given an interview for the position,and she sued for racial discrimination under,e and arkansas code section.the district court granted summary judgment for the school district,finding that although dixon had established a prima facie case,she was unable to show that the school district proffered nondiscriminatory reason was pretext for discrimination.dixon appeals.we affirm.
dixon joined the school district in as a purchasing clerk.william rains,the director of purchasing,sought to have the purchasing clerk position upgraded to a purchasing specialist position,which,unlike the purchasing clerk position,would progress into the buyer position.the school district denied his request.after one year,dixon obtained a bookkeeping position in the school district department.a few months later,she returned to the purchasing department with a promotion to secretary to the director of purchasing.
in late,william rains retired,and sinclair winburn was promoted from buyer to director of purchasing.the school district human resources department posted a job announcement for winburn buyer position.the minimum qualifications for the position were,inter alia,a college degree and f ive years experience in public purchasing.the school district policy required that a biracial,interview committee screen the applications and that all applicants meeting the minimum qualifications be given an interview.winburn stated that he was unaware of the requirement and that he had considered rebecca rains the woman the school district ultimately hired,to be the sole qualified applicant.nevertheless,winburn,in his new position,scheduled interviews with all six applicants,including dixon and rebecca rains.the superintendent,however,pulled the announcement because none of the six applicants met the minimum requirements,possessed a college degree,and winburn accordingly cancelled the interviews.
winburn then submitted a corrected job announcement,which was posted after review by his superiors.the title of the position was changed from buyer to asset administrator,and the requisite experience and the position responsibilities were also amended to include references to fixed assets.the revised job posting did not include a requirement.according to winburn,the change in the job description was meant to update the description to reflect the actual responsibilities of the buyer position the fixed asset specialist position had been frozen several years before for budgetary reasons,and the person in the buyer position had taken over the responsibilities.dixon claims that the new position was phoney and that winburn tailored the qualifications specifically to render dixon unqualified.she also argues that the amendments to the job description resulted in an entirely new position,which required the board of education policies approval and that,in failing to obtain the approval,the superintendent violated school district policy.in support of her argument that the asset administrator position was fictitious,dixon points to minutes that refer to rebecca rains position only as buyer and to rebecca rains employment contract,which states the position primary responsibility as buyer.dixon does not contest,however,that there had been,and still is,a separate fixed assets specialist position that was frozen rather,she asserts that adding the responsibilities to the buyer position contravened the school board will and procedures since the fixed assets position had been frozen indefinitely.
dixon and rebecca rains,among others,submitted applications in response to the revised job posting.in violation of school district policy,winburn alone screened the applicants for the revised posting,though the school district contends that his actions were in line with customary practice.unlike with the previous posting,winburn selected only two individuals for interviews,rebecca rains and kenneth guillotte,neither of whom are.winburn stated that he did not select dixon for an interview because she did not meet the minimum qualifications specifically,he stated that dixon did not have the requisite five years experience as a buyer in public purchasing.school district accountant and member tasha thompson,however,stated in an affidavit that winburn had told her that he believed dixon did have the requisite experience.thompson also stated that by dixon was able to provide information regarding the purchasing department policies and procedures while william rains was away 
although winburn alone made the decision whether to interview each candidate,he discussed the candidates with the other members of the interview committee,and the other members of the interview committee had reviewed the applications at the time of the first job announcement,including those of dixon and rebecca rains.moreover,thompson stated that after reviewing the applications,she felt that rebecca rains had superior qualifications to the other applicants.rebecca rains had over twenty years experience in public purchasing,much of it at senior levels.after the interview committee interviewed the two candidates selected by winburn,it selected rebecca rains.
the district court found,for purposes of establishing a prima facie case,that dixon had the minimum experience needed.the district court further concluded,however,that the school district put forth a legitimate,reason for not hiring dixon and that dixon was unable to show that the school district proffered reason was mere pretext for a discriminatory animus.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to dixon,the party.arnold nursing and rehab.ctr.at good shepherd,llc,cir.although summary judgment is to be used sparingly in employment discrimination cases,it is appropriate where one party has failed to present evidence sufficient to create a jury question as to an essential element of its claim.id.quotation omitted.
the parties agree that the mcdonnell douglas analysis applies to dixon claims.see mcdonnell douglas green,d.under this analysis,a claim proceeds in three stages.first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case for discrimination.id.at.second,the defendant may rebut the prima facie case by articulating a rationale for its action.texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.third,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant proffered rationale was merely pretext for discrimination.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
to establish a prima facie case,dixon must show that she is in a protected class she was qualified for an open position she was denied that position and the school district filled the position with a person not in the same protected class.arraleh county of ramsey,cir.the school district contends that the fourth element also requires that dixon show that the school district filled the position with a person similarly qualified to dixon and that therefore,in light of rebecca rains superior qualifications,dixon is unable to establish a prima facie case.but the higher standard argued by the school district does not apply in this circuit,for we have squarely rejected the proposition that a plaintiff need prove her relative qualifications to meet her prima facie burden.see turner honeywell fed,llc,cir.we do have doubts concerning whether dixon has created a material question of fact as to whether she met the minimum qualifications required for the position so as to satisfy the second element of her prima facie case but even assuming dixon has established her prima facie case,her claim ultimately fails for other reasons,as discussed below.
assuming that dixon has established a prima facie case,then,it falls to the school district to articulate a legitimate,reason for not hiring her.burdine,at.the school district meets this burden by asserting that it did not hire dixon because she did not possess the minimum qualifications required for the position.qamhiyah iowa state of sci.and,cir treating lack of qualifications as a legitimate,reason to deny tenure.on the particular facts of this case,we note that the second prong of the prima facie test is exceedingly similar to the proffered reason in this second stage of the analysis,as both concern whether dixon was minimally qualified for the position.we are cautious not to conflate the two.mcginnis union pac,cir slattery swiss reins.am,cir the qualification prong must not be interpreted in such a way as to shift onto the plaintiff an obligation to anticipate and disprove,in his prima facie case,the employer proffer of a legitimate,basis for its decision.for purposes of her qualifications in her prima facie case,dixon needed to show that she met the requirements for the position.for purposes of the second stage of the analysis,the school district need only articulate,through admissible evidence,that it did not believe dixon to be qualified.the tension between these two positions underlies our analysis in the next,and final,stage of the analysis.
in the third stage of the mcdonnell douglas analysis,the burden falls on dixon to show that the legitimate reasons offered by the school district were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.reeves,at.quotation omitted.at this final stage of the analysis,dixon burden merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination.burdine,at.in evaluating the showing of pretext,evidence used to support the prima facie case is considered along with the other evidence before the court to determine whether there exists a triable fact on the ultimate issue of discrimination.wallace dtg operations,cir.a plaintiff may make this showing of pretext in more than one way.as we have previously stated 
there are at least two routes by which a plaintiff may demonstrate a material question of fact at this final stage of the analysis.first,a plaintiff may succeed indirectly by showing that the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence because it has no basis in fact.second,a plaintiff may succeed directly by persuading the court that a prohibited reason more likely motivated the employer.
id.internal quotations,citations,and alterations omitted.dixon attempts to support her claim under both routes.
under the first route,dixon contends both that the school district proffered explanation was factually incorrect and that it was falsely given.dixon argues that because she is,in fact,qualified for the position,a negative assessment of her qualifications is incorrect and evidence of pretext.a misjudgment on the part of the employer as to whether the applicant possesses the required qualifications does not invalidate the resulting proffered reason,see burdine,at.dionne shalala,cir stating that an employer view of qualifications was a legitimate,reason even though employer inadvertently applied an incorrect standard when reaching its conclusion,but a n employer misjudgment of an employee qualifications may be probative of whether the reasons articulated for an employment decision were merely pretexts for discrimination.peru state,cir citing burdine,at.as mentioned,dixon qualifications were questionable.even assuming that she was factually qualified for the position,any misjudgment on the part of the school district was slight,and as such,provides no evidence of pretext.such a narrow miscalculation on the part of the school district is insignificant because the essential question is not whether dixon was actually unqualified for the position it is whether the school district honestly believed that she was unqualified.see johnson v.at t,cir hitt harsco,cir.on the present facts,even if a jury were to conclude that the proffered reason was incorrect,such a finding would not support a conclusion that the school district misjudgment was tainted by discrimination.
dixon also addresses the school district honest belief directly in that she contends the proffered reason was falsely given that is,she contends that the school district did believe her to be qualified for the position and that its stated reason for not interviewing her,and thus not hiring her,was false.falsity of the proffered explanation can serve as evidence of pretext.reeves,at.i t is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer explanation.dixon only supporting evidence that winburn believed her qualifications to be sufficient for the position,however,is hearsay evidence of limited probative value.see johnson baptist med,stating that a plaintiff proof of disparate treatment appear ed to consist entirely of hearsay,which can not defeat a motion for summary judgment.
moreover,while evidence that winburn or others may have considered dixon to be sufficiently qualified would directly contradict the school district proffered rationale for not interviewing her,in the context of this case,it is still insufficient to create a material question of fact as to pretext.p retext often must be read as shorthand for indicating that a defendant proffered explanation is a pretext for unlawful discrimination,not that it is merely false in some way.strate midwest bankcentre,cir see also hutson mcdonnell douglas,cir p roof that the defendant articulated explanation is false or incorrect does not,standing alone,entitle the plaintiff to judgment instead,the showing must be that the explanation is a pretext for discrimination.a showing that winburn considered dixon to be minimally qualified would not demonstrate that the school district explanation is unworthy of credence or without basis in fact,because it does not diminish the school district broader explanation founded on dixon relative qualifications.
of course,dixon argument that the proffered reason is unworthy of credence would carry more weight were there any evidence that the school district broader explanation founded on her relative qualifications was false.the route of discriminatory inference based on falsity of the proffered reason typically involves a broader rebuttal of the employer factual claims.wallace,at.to this end,dixon attempts to frame the issue such that we consider only whether she met the minimum requirements for the position,ignoring that the school district selected a more qualified candidate.relative qualifications may not be relevant for the prima facie stage,but they are for the pretext stage.dixon has no evidence rebutting the school district broader claims that it simply hired someone far more qualified,and dixon has presented no evidence indicating that her qualifications are comparable to those of the successful applicant.dixon attempts to argue that a meaningful comparison of qualifications is impossible because she was not granted an interview,but at least one of the two other members of the interview committee,thompson,did review dixon application for the original posting and believed rebecca rains to have superior qualifications.we see no reason that thompson evaluation would not apply at least as much to the revised posting.especially given the disparity of qualifications between dixon and rebecca rains,the failure to grant dixon an interview did not remove dixon from meaningful consideration such that we are in a position to the school district employment decision.see,arraleh,at stating that federal courts do not sit as departments to review employers business decisions quotation omitted.
dixon also attempts to show pretext under t he second route,which,in contrast,does not necessarily involve disproving the underlying factual claims of the employer.wallace,at.to succeed under this route,dixon must adduce enough admissible evidence to raise genuine doubt as to the legitimacy of the school district motive,even if that evidence does not directly contradict or disprove the school district articulated reasons for its actions.buettner arch coal sales,cir.dixon contends that pretext is evidenced by the revision of the job description and winburn unilateral review of the applications.
regarding the job description,dixon does not directly contest the school district assertion that the revised job description and the attendant job requirements accurately reflect the curren
