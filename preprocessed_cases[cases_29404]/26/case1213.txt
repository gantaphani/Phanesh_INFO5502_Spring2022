this is a sexual suit arising out of the acts of a physical education teacher,defendant kelvin mency mency,at knollwood elementary school.plaintiffs appellants here,filed complaints against the dekalb county school district dcsd,william duncan,principal of knollwood elementary duncan,and mency under title ix of the education amendments of,title ix,title section,and georgia tort law.after consolidating the cases,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dcsd and duncan.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in applying the incorrect legal standard for institutional liability under title ix,and in concluding that plaintiffs failed to create a jury question on their section claim.we do not decide whether the district court applied the incorrect standard because we conclude,under gebser and section jurisprudence,that plaintiffs have failed to produce any evidence that defendants knew of or acted with deliberate indifference to mency misconduct.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment with respect to both claims.
factual and procedural history 
kelvin mency,a physical education teacher and faculty advisor of the safety patrol at knollwood elementary school,sexually molested plaintiffs during the school year there is no evidence that anyone witnessed any of these events.moreover,the plaintiffs never told their parents,legal guardians,or anyone at school what was happening while the events were occurring.in the fall of,one of the plaintiffs confided in a friend that mency was touching her inappropriately.the friend told a police officer who lectured at the school,and the police began an investigation into mency contact with students.as a result,mency resigned from his post.mency was subsequently convicted on six counts of child molestation and one count of criminal attempt to commit child molestation,and is currently serving a sentence.
after mency criminal conviction,plaintiffs brought this action against the dcsd,duncan,and mency the complaints alleged violations of title ix,section,and georgia tort law.the district court consolidated the cases by consent order,and granted summary judgment in favor of dcsd on plaintiffs title ix claim.the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to produce any evidence that the school board or school superintendent had actual notice of the sexual harassment.the district court went on to find that plaintiffs also failed to produce evidence that any official with supervisory authority knew or should have known that mency was molesting plaintiffs.in addition,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of duncan and dcsd on plaintiffs section claim concluding that plaintiffs could not show that defendants either knew that mency was harassing plaintiffs or that defendants acted with reckless disregard to the possibility that he would do so.
plaintiffs action against mency proceeded to trial,and a jury found mency civilly liable to the plaintiffs for the amount of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the district court entered final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against mency in accordance with the verdict.subsequently,plaintiffs filed this appeal requesting reversal of the district court orders granting summary judgment to dcsd and duncan.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court applied the wrong legal standard for the institutional liability of a school district under title ix.plaintiffs contend that the evidence,viewed in light of the proper standard,establishes that the principal and other school officials were aware of facts sufficient to alert them to mency misconduct and that the school response was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.on their section claim,plaintiffs contend that they produced sufficient evidence for a jury to find that dcsd and duncan knew that mency was a danger to the plaintiffs or that dcsd and duncan were deliberately indifferent to facts that put them on notice of the danger.we disagree.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.see gordan cochran,cir.we,like the district court,are required to view the facts in the light most favorable to the.see walls button gwinnett bancorp,cir.
title ix provides,in pertinent part,that n o person shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance a.the supreme court has recognized an implied private cause of action for money damages in title ix cases of intentional sexual discrimination.franklin gwinnett county public schools,d.moreover,the court has held that sexual harassment of a student by a teacher constitutes actionable discrimination for the purposes of title ix.id.
after the district court granted summary judgment in the instant case,the supreme court clarified the standard under which a school district may be held liable under title ix for a teacher sexual harassment of a student.see gebser lago vista indep.sch,d.the court held that 
a damages remedy will not lie under title ix unless an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient program and fails adequately to respond.
id.at.at.moreover,the court decided that the response must amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination for liability to attach.id.the court concluded that the lago vista school district could not be held liable where the only official alleged to have knowledge was the high school principal,and the information consisted of a complaint from parents of other students that the teacher had made inappropriate comments during class.id.at.at.this information,the court reasoned,was plainly insufficient to alert the principal to the possibility that the teacher was involved in a sexual relationship with a student.id.
following the supreme court decision in gebser,the eleventh circuit determined that a title ix plaintiff must establish two things to survive summary judgment in a cause of action against a school district for the discriminatory acts of its employees first,some supervisor with authority to take corrective action was placed on notice of the bad conduct.second,the supervisor possessing this authority was a school official high enough up the that his acts constitute an official decision by the school district itself not to remedy the misconduct.floyd waiters,cir,cert.denied,d.
supervisor with authority to remedy the misconduct 
the district court held that plaintiffs could not recover under title ix,as a matter of law,because the evidence failed to show that the school board or school superintendent had actual notice of the sexual harassment alternatively,the district court found no evidence that any school official with supervisory authority had notice that mency was molesting the three students we find that it is unnecessary to decide whether duncan,as principal of knollwood elementary,was a supervisory official with authority to take corrective action on behalf of the school district.assuming,arguendo,that a principal could be such,we find no evidence to support the claim that duncan acted with deliberate indifference to notice of mency misconduct.
actual notice 
a school district must have actual notice before it can be held liable in damages for intentional discrimination based on sex.see gebser,d reasoning that recovery based on principles of vicarious liability or constructive notice is at odds with express enforcement scheme requiring notice to an appropriate person,and would divert education funding from beneficial uses where a recipient was unaware of discrimination in its programs and is willing to institute prompt corrective measures defendant dcsd contends that the school district did not have actual notice that mency was sexually abusing students until september.plaintiffs argue that the school district had actual notice of mency misconduct as early as november.plaintiffs do not contest the district court finding that plain
