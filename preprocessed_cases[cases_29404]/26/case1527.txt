factual and procedural background 
in march,the commission on teacher credentialing cotc sent cross a letter informing him of a preliminary investigation of his fitness to hold a credential.included with the letter was a copy of an affidavit signed by,a former student,alleging cross had sexually harassed him.cross requested discovery of all writings in his file,except those that were privileged.
in july,the cotc again wrote cross informing him that it was in receipt of information requiring an investigation of his fitness to hold a credential.included with this letter were two affidavits from former students alleging cross had sexually abused them.cross again requested discovery of all writings in his file.cross specifically requested cotc correspondence in soliciting these affidavits.the cotc provided the letters,but the addresses of those signing the affidavits were redacted.the cotc later confirmed it would not provide the addresses.the cotc also provided cross with witness lists from a police report again the addresses and certain other identifying information were redacted.
the two matters were consolidated.
in september,the committee on credentials the committee informed cross it would consider information in a confidential investigative report at its november meeting.the confidential investigative report summarized the affidavits and the police investigation.the criminal case was closed due to lack of evidence.the school district had begun proceedings to terminate cross,but dismissed the action after moved away.a polygraph examiner found that cross passed the test,indicating he did not make sexually explicit comments to and did not suggest sexual relations.a psychological report found cross was not seeking sexual gratification but acted out of a sincere desire to be energetically involved in his job.cross admitted he made mistakes as to and vehemently denied the other allegations of sexual misconduct.cross provided letters of support.
cross and the cta petitioned for a writ of mandate commanding cotc and the committee not to hold the meeting to review the confidential investigative report until full materials,without redaction,were provided to cross in conformity with education code section and california code of regulations,title,section regulation.the petition alleged that since early cotc and the committee have deleted addresses and sometimes names of witnesses.in an unrelated matter,the division of professional practices claimed the redaction was pursuant to the information practices act of ipa,et.the petition argued neither education code section nor regulation provided for redaction and due process required that names and addresses in general and the addresses of the complaining parties in particular be provided to a teacher under investigation.
the trial court granted a stay of all proceedings and actions relating to cross teaching credential.
the cotc and the committee admitted identifying information was redacted in documents provided to cross.they argued neither statute nor due process required disclosure the information was protected by privacy statutes and disclosure must be consistent with the ipa and public policy dictated no disclosure.
the trial court ruled cross had no right to the addresses.to the extent that regulation expands the disclosure required under education code section,the court declared it invalid.
cross and the cta moved for a new trial and for a stay pending appeal.both motions were denied.
