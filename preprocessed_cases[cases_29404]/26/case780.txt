fred gilbert gilbert appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of des moines area community college dmacc on gilbert claims of racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,to,and the iowa civil rights act icra,iowa code chapter.we affirm.
background 
in may,dmacc commenced a search for a new president.dmacc has six separate campuses,one of which is known as the urban campus.at the time of dmacc search,gilbert served as urban campus provost of dmacc urban campus and was responsible for the operation and administration of that campus.
to assist with the presidential search,dmacc board of directors hired larry ebbers ebbers,an iowa state university professor teaching courses focusing on community college organization and higher education administration.ebbers suggested a small screening committee initially review the applications and select six to eight candidates to present to a larger search committee.the search committee then would meet to discuss and rank the candidates and select three to five finalists for recommendation to dmacc board of directors to interview.
dmacc received approximately presidential applications,including gilbert.on july,the screening committee,which consisted of four dmacc board of directors members,met with ebbers to review the applications.the screening committee reviewed the applications and ranked gilbert twelfth.when asked by the screening committee regarding the number of candidates to forward to the search committee,ebbers suggested submitting twelve candidates because gilbert,an,was ranked twelfth.later,an application was submitted by another candidate.thus,to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates,the screening committee ultimately presented thirteen candidates to the search committee.
ebbers then met with the search committee,which consisted of faculty,staff,students,alumni,and community members.the search committee was asked to review the thirteen candidate applications before meeting again on july.between july and,ebbers contacted at least three references on each candidate reference list,as well as three other persons who were familiar with the candidate,and prepared a written summary of his reference checks.
at the july meeting,the search committee discussed the thirteen candidates.ebbers directed the search committee to rank each of the candidates from one most qualified to thirteen least qualified.the candidate receiving the lowest numerical score would be the candidate.the four candidates finalists were kim linduska linduska,with points robert denson denson,with points karen rafinski rafinski,with points and jean goodenow goodenow,with points.the candidate had a score of points.gilbert was ranked eleventh with points.the other candidates were ranked sixth and twelfth,receiving points and points,respectively.the search committee recommended the board of directors interview the finalists.
sandy tryon tryon,dmacc executive director of human resources and designated affirmative action officer,examined the presidential search process as part of an affirmative action review.this review included examining the scores of the finalists and comparing that range to the scores received by the three candidates.tryon concluded none of the candidates received a point score sufficiently close to the scores of the finalists to receive an interview thus,no additional candidates were added to the interview list.
the board of directors interviewed the finalists for the presidency position and ultimately selected denson president denson,who had been serving as president of northeast iowa community college since.
on march,gilbert filed a complaint with the iowa civil rights commission icrc,and the complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging discrimination on the basis of age,race,color,and retaliation.on september,after receiving a letter,gilbert filed a lawsuit against dmacc and various individuals collectively,the defendants in state district court,which was later removed to federal court.
after gilbert filed suit and in preparation for responding to gilbert complaint,dmacc officials began investigating both the presidential search process and gilbert application.during the course of the investigation,dmacc officials discovered substantial portions of essay answers in gilbert application were plagiarized almost from two separate textbooks.gilbert application included a signed certification stating,i understand that any misrepresentation or omission may be grounds for rejection of my application for current and future employment or for termination if i have been employed.on december,during an interview with tryon,dmacc counsel,and gilbert counsel,gilbert acknowledged his application contained plagiarized materials,but gilbert denied having knowledge of or being involved in the actual act of plagiarism.gilbert stated he had hired a consultant to assist him in completing his application,the consultant prepared the essay answers for gilbert and apparently committed the act of plagiarism,and he was unaware any plagiarism had occurred.
dmacc officials interviewed gilbert again on december,and gilbert again claimed the consultant,whom gilbert stated he had paid about one thousand dollars in cash with no receipt from the consultant,had prepared the essay answers.however,gilbert could not recall the consultant name,the number of times he met with the consultant,or the length of their meetings.gilbert was unable to provide a description of the consultant.when asked whether the consultant was male or female,gilbert replied,both.gilbert then said,i met with more than one sex.when asked how many people he consulted,gilbert stated,it would be one or two,because i think there was sic two,but i not sure.
based on the results of dmacc investigation,the dmacc board of directors voted to terminate gilbert contract as urban campus provost on the ground gilbert application for president of dmacc contained substantial acts of plagiarism and acts of misrepresentation.the decision to remove gilbert from academic administrative employment was influenced largely by dmacc consideration of gilbert academic governance duties,which included administering academic programs and determining sanctions for academic misconduct.in president denson words,plagiarism is a serious matter in academia,and dmacc did not want gilbert in a position where gilbert was judging students for plagiarism when he has been involved in plagiarism.dmacc offered gilbert a new position as a grants specialist,which carried a significant reduction in salary.
gilbert lawsuit alleged dmacc decision not to hire gilbert for the position of president was motivated by race,and dmacc retaliated against gilbert based on gilbert engagement in protected activity.the district court granted summary judgment in dmacc favor on both claims gilbert appeals.

we review de novo an order granting summary judgment.green franklin bank of minneapolis,cir.summary judgment is proper if,after viewing all the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c libel adventure lands of,cir.mere allegations,unsupported by specific facts or evidence beyond the nonmoving party own conclusions,are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.thomas corwin,cir.we may affirm a district court grant of summary judgment on any basis supported by the record.tenge phillips modern ag,cir.
racial discrimination claim 
gilbert first contends the district court erred in finding there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether race was a motivating factor in dmacc decision not to hire gilbert as president.because gilbert fails to produce direct evidence to support his claim of intentional racial discrimination,we analyze his claim under the familiar framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d see wells sci,cir.under this analytical framework,once the plaintiff employee establishes a prima facie case of discrimination,the burden shifts to the defendant employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.mcdonnell douglas,at.wells,at.if the defendant offers such a reason,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to put forth evidence showing the defendant proffered explanation is a pretext for unlawful discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.wells,at.
for summary judgment purposes,dmacc concedes gilbert established a prima facie case of discrimination.thus,we need only determine whether dmacc articulated a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions,and,if so,whether gilbert demonstrates a genuine issue of material fact with respect to pretext.
dmacc asserts gilbert was not selected for an interview due to gilbert low search committee score and the superior qualifications of the four finalists.the record indicates the search committee members were directed to review independently each candidate application materials before meeting as a group.at the july,meeting,the search committee discussed and considered the applicants education,leadership,and job experience,including prior experience in serving as president of a community college,working with governing boards of directors,and executing board policy.furthermore,the search committee also discussed gilbert experience as leader of the urban campus,as well as the size differential between the urban campus and dmacc as a whole.during the meeting,ebbers reported on comments received from each applicant personal references,and he also solicited comments regarding each candidate from the search committee.following this process,the search committee ranked gilbert eleventh out of the thirteen candidates.although gilbert and the four finalists had relatively comparable academic credentials the finalists all were sitting or acting interim presidents of community colleges who reported directly to a governing board of directors gilbert,in contrast,lacked community college presidential experience.
following the search committee decision,tryon performed an affirmative action review.based on a review of all thirteen candidates rankings and point allocations,tryon determined none of the minority candidates were close enough in points to the finalists to be interviewed.on these facts,we conclude dmacc offered legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for not selecting gilbert for an interview.
thus,the burden shifts to gilbert to produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether dmacc proffered reasons are mere pretext for intentional discrimination.before the district court,gilbert argued a finding of pretext is supported by dmacc failure to follow its affirmative action policy and its practice of interviewing internal applicants as well as by gilbert similar or superior qualifications as compared to the finalists.on appeal,gilbert attempts to buttress his pretext argument with several additional contentions we reject gilbert belated attempt to advance new arguments or theories not presented below.see orr stores,cir ordinarily,we do not consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal.we consider a newly raised argument only if it is purely legal and requires no additional factual development,or if a manifest injustice would otherwise result.internal citations omitted.gilbert contends the district court was generally informed of these facts and issues argued now on appeal.we follow our standard practice and limit our review to the specific arguments gilbert raised before the district court in support of a finding of pretext,as opposed to those arguments the district court might have deduced from the record as a whole.a district court is not required to speculate on which portion of the record the nonmoving party relies,nor is it obligated to wade through and search the entire record for some specific facts that might support the nonmoving party claim.white mcdonnell douglas,cir per curiam quotation omitted.nor will our court mine a summary judgment record searching for nuggets of factual disputes to gild a party arguments.rodgers city of des moines,cir.we therefore turn our attention to those arguments that are properly before us.
gilbert first contends dmacc failed to perform an affirmative action review of the search committee selection process we disagree.tryon involvement in the presidential search process included discussing with ebbers on various occasions the advertisement for the position of president,the search process and the timeline to be followed,the makeup of the search committee,and the progress of the search process.additionally,after the search committee votes were tabulated,tryon reviewed the score range of the finalists and compared that range to the scores received by the three minority candidates.tryon and ebbers noted the substantial gap in the scores between the candidate and the fifth and candidates.tryon concluded none of the minority candidates received a total point score sufficiently close to the scores of the finalists selected for an interview.
gilbert next argues dmacc failure to follow its practice of interviewing qualified internal candidates demonstrates pretext.again,we disagree.although gilbert presented evidence dmacc has an unwritten practice of interviewing qualified internal candidates,we are unable to find any evidence in the record this practice has ever been applied specifically to the position of dmacc president.even assuming dmacc ignored this practice with regard to the president position,the disparity in scores between gilbert and the finalists contradicts gilbert claim that dmacc alleged deviation from its unwritten policy occurred based on racial discrimination.see chock nw.airlines,cir affirming summary judgment in employer favor where plaintiff presented no evidence employer deviation from established promotion policies occurred due to racial discrimination.thus,the failure to afford gilbert an interview based on dmacc unwritten practice does not constitute evidence of pretext sufficient to rebut dmacc legitimate basis for not selecting gilbert for an interview.
finally,gilbert attacks dmacc reliance on presidential experience in evaluating candidates and argues the finalists were less qualified than gilbert was for the position of president.evidence of similar qualifications between gilbert and the selected candidates is insufficient to support a finding of pretext rather,gilbert must show the finalists were less qualified than he.see kincaid city of omaha,cir.although an employer selection of a less qualified candidate can support a finding that the employer nondiscriminatory reason for the hiring was pretextual,it is the employer role to identify those strengths that constitute the best qualified applicant.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.however,we repeatedly have noted the laws have not vested in the federal courts the authority to sit as departments reviewing the wisdom or fairness of the business judgments made by employers,except to the extent that those judgments involve intentional discrimination.hutson mcdonnell douglas,cir see,arraleh county of ramsey,cir,cert.denied,d kincaid,at.
although dmacc did not require prior presidential experience at a community college when screening candidates,such experience was considered a strength in evaluating the candidates job experience and leadership skills.gilbert possessed similar educational qualifications as the finalists,but he lacked prior presidential experience.viewed in the light most favorable to gilbert,the record shows gilbert qualifications,at best,were somewhat similar to those of the finalists,which is insufficient to rebut dmacc legitimate reason for not selecting gilbert.gilbert fails to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether dmacc chose a less qualified applicant.see pierce marsh,cir the mere existence of comparable qualifications between two applicants alone does not raise an inference of racial discrimination.
having reviewed gilbert remaining allegations on this issue,we find the allegations unavailing.because gilbert offered insufficient evidence to rebut dmacc legitimate,nondiscriminatory reaso
