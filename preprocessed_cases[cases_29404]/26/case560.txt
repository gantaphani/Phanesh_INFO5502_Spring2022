laura flaskamp taught physical education in the dearborn public schools.in april,the board of education for the school system denied her tenure after learning that flaskamp had a sexual or relationship with a former student within nine months of the student high school graduation.in acting upon the school principal recommendation that her tenure application be denied,the board relied in part on the view that the relationship had begun before graduation and in part on the view that flaskamp had failed to be candid in addressing the school system concerns about the relationship.
flaskamp sued the school system and the individual board members,claiming that they had violated her right to intimate association,her right to privacy and her right to be free of arbitrary state in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on each claim.because the board in our view did not violate the due process clause in any of these respects in denying flaskamp tenure application,we affirm the district court judgment in favor of the board,its members and the school system.
in,the dearborn public schools hired laura flaskamp as a physical education teacher and assigned her to one of the schools within the district,fordson high school.under michigan law,flaskamp had to serve a probationary period before she was eligible for tenure.see.comp.laws.
in the spring of,jane doe,a senior at fordson high school,enrolled in a leadership class that gave students an opportunity to assist physical education instructors in teaching their classes.doe registered to serve as flaskamp teaching assistant.id.
as the semester proceeded,doe and flaskamp not only communicated with each other during the class but also began to communicate with each other outside of class through and instant messages.a friendship developed and by the end of the school year the two had given each other several cards and gifts.flaskamp,for example,gave doe a birthday card in may on her eighteenth birthday,gave her a card wishing her good luck in a choir concert,gave her a graduation card and gave her a toy gun for her graduation.
during the semester,flaskamp sent doe an inappropriate joke,which apparently was filled with sexual innuendos.doe mother happened to see the and sent flaskamp a message explaining that the joke was offensive and demanding an apology.flaskamp apologized to doe mother.
at some point during the semester,flaskamp asked doe to meet her at a park after school.according to doe,flaskamp wanted to tell me something but she never actually said it that day rather,the two just sat and hung out and talked.ja.after this meeting,but before graduation,flaskamp told doe that she was gay.and then she had asked me if i was.ja.doe responded i do know,and the two proceeded to talk about it for a little while,ja.
in june,flaskamp attended doe graduation party.that same day,doe sent flaskamp a note that included the following my heart aches for you and my stomach is in knots.now i had to declare.the thoughts of my heart in hopes that you give me a place in your heart.ja.flaskamp told doe that she was in shock that doe felt this way or that she would put it down on paper and feel that deeply.ja.
the relationship did not end with doe graduation.after doe enrolled at eastern michigan university,she traveled regularly to fordson high school to visit flaskamp.the two also continued to communicate by phone,and instant message.
in december,doe mother came to the conclusion that her daughter relationship with flaskamp went beyond the inappropriate joke that she had intercepted the prior spring.as a result,she sent an to flaskamp warning her to stay away from her daughter and threatening a civil suit if she did not comply.she also told flaskamp that she planned to inform the school about the relationship,which she believed had started before doe graduation.
after reading this from doe mother,flaskamp contacted fordson principal,paul smith,to tell him about doe mother concerns.during her conversation with smith,flaskamp told him for the first time about the inappropriate message she had sent to doe during the prior spring,explaining that she had mistakenly sent the message to everyone in her address book.she then told smith that doe mother believed that flaskamp and doe had an inappropriate relationship.denying the allegation,flaskamp said that she merely had a relationship with doe,an explanation that smith accepted.
the end of the school year marked the anniversary of flaskamp employment with the school district,and it required the school board to decide whether she would receive tenure.smith held flaskamp in high regard as a teacher and recommended her for tenure on march.
that same day,however,doe mother called smith to arrange for a meeting to discuss flaskamp relationship with her daughter.when doe mother and smith met four days later,she told smith that flaskamp went directly to her daughter,not to everyone in flaskamp address book.and doe mother told smith that flaskamp and her daughter frequently communicated by and instant messages and that flaskamp had sent as many as greeting cards to doe.according to smith,doe mother believed that flaskamp was chasing after her daughter and that the relationship developed while doe was a student.ja.
smith met with flaskamp later that day,at which point flaskamp continued to deny having an inappropriate relationship with doe.flaskamp later met with her union president,with the school human resources director and again with smith.smith reminded flaskamp of the serious nature of the allegations and told her to sever any ties with doe,which flaskamp agreed to do.
during the following week,flaskamp had a confrontation with doe brother,who still was a student at fordson.when flaskamp asked him how doe was doing,he exploded and threatened flaskamp.flaskamp reported the incident to smith,which prompted another meeting with doe mother.
at this second meeting in march,doe mother insisted that flaskamp instigated the confrontation with her son by asking him about his sister,and she reiterated her complaint that flaskamp was pursuing her daughter.she also told smith of a recent session between flaskamp and her daughter that contained a number of sexually explicit references.among other things,flaskamp and doe discussed showering together and sharing a bed,and both ended the instant messaging with xoxo and sweet dreams.ja.flaskamp added love yo u very very much.id.relying on these messages,smith became convinced that flaskamp had not been truthful with him about her relationship with doe,and he accordingly suspended flaskamp with pay.
at the same time,smith revised his evaluation of flaskamp as well as his tenure recommendation.he rated flaskamp performance unsatisfactory and recommended that the school board deny her tenure because she had not been truthful about her interactions with doe.on april,the school board unanimously agreed to deny flaskamp tenure.
on june,flaskamp filed a action against the dearborn public schools and the individual members of its board for discharging her and for denying her tenure.in her complaint,she claimed that the defendants had violated several of her fourteenth amendment right to intimate association,her right to privacy and her right to be free of arbitrary state action.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.acknowledging that a right to intimate association exists,the district court held that the right did not extend to flaskamp relationship with doe.the court reasoned that a relationship between close friends,even one with a sexual component to the relationship,is not the type of relationship that has played a critical role in shaping our nation culture.flaskamp dearborn pub,d.because the constitution did not protect flaskamp relationship with doe,the court concluded,flaskamp argument that she was deprived of her right to intimate association fails.id.at.
declining to decide whether flaskamp had suffered a violation of her right to privacy,the court granted qualified immunity to the individual defendants because the contours of that right were not sufficiently clear to have put defendants on notice that they violated plaintiff right.id.at.flaskamp failure to identify a municipal policy or custom resulting in a constitutional violation,the court determined,also required judgment in favor of dearborn public schools on this claim.id.at.
lastly,the district court held that the school board made a tenure decision,which included a hearing for flaskamp and her attorney.the district court found that smith recommendation itself was reasonable,and relying heavily on it was not unusual for the members of the school board.id.at.the defendants actions,the court therefore concluded,did not result in a violation of flaskamp right to be free of arbitrary state action.id.at.
we give fresh review to a district court summary judgment decision,applying the same familiar standard that district courts apply.barrett harrington,cir.while government officials may be subject to actions for violating an individual constitutional right,a plaintiff must overcome the officials qualified immunity in bringing such an action.to do so,the plaintiff must establish the violation of a constitutional right and must show that the right is sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.saucier katz,d quotations omitted.we must consider the first question,the supreme court has instructed,before we consider the second one.id.at.
a case that the parties variously describe as being about the right to intimate association,the right to privacy and the right to be free of arbitrary state action tends to excite the constitutional imagination.and while this case also arises in a relatively unusual fact pattern,it ultimately turns on the application of straightforward and settled fourteenth amendment principles.the parties themselves,moreover,have narrowed the scope of inquiry.they both agree that the sexual orientation of the plaintiff in this case makes no difference to the outcome of the dispute.and they both agree that a school district may prevent teachers from having intimate relationships with current students,even students that have reached the age of eighteen.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prevents a state from depriv ing any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.although a literal reading of the clause might suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a state may deprive persons of liberty,the supreme court has interpreted the clause to contain a substantive component as well,one barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.planned parenthood of casey,d quoting daniels williams,d.
over time,the supreme court has construed the substantive component of the due process clause to protect two types of liberty.it incorporates most of the guarantees of the bill of originally restricted only the federal government,see barron baltimore,pet.and protects these rights from state infringement.and it protects other fundamental rights not expressly mentioned in the bill of rights but implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,roe wade,d,and deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,moore city of east cleveland,d including personal decisions relating to marriage,procreation,contraception,family relationships,child rearing,and education,lawrence texas,d citing casey,at.see loving virginia,d marriage zablocki redhail,d same eisenstadt baird,d contraception griswold connecticut,d same skinner oklahoma ex rel.williamson.procreation pierce society of sisters.child rearing meyer nebraska.same.
the supreme court has also held that certain kinds of personal bonds,roberts united states jaycees,d,and certain kinds of intimate conduct,lawrence,at,are protected by the substantive component of the due process clause.whether called a right to intimate association,see roberts,or a right to privacy,see lawrence,the point is similar choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the state because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme.roberts,at.see lawrence,at.when sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person,the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.the right to intimate association is not limited to familial relationships but includes relationships characterized by relative smallness,a high degree of selectivity in decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation,and seclusion from others in critical aspects of the relationship.roberts,at.see also anderson lavergne,cir assuming for purposes that a dating relationship between two police officers qualified as an intimate association because the two were monogamous,had lived together and were romantically and sexually involved akers mcginnis,cir determining that some types of personal friendships may constitute intimate associations.
yet not all government action affecting the right to intimate association receives heightened scrutiny.only government action that has a direct and substantial influence on intimate association receives heightened review.anderson,at.government action has a direct and substantial influence on intimate association only where a large portion of those affected by the rule are absolutely or largely prevented from forming intimate associations,or where those affected by the rule are absolutely or largely prevented from forming intimate associations with a large portion of the otherwise eligible population of people with whom they could form intimate associations.id.brackets in original.see vaughn lawrenceburg,cir direct and substantial interference results only where a large portion of those affected by the rule are absolutely or largely prevented from marrying,or where those affected by the rule are absolutely or largely prevented from marrying a large portion of the otherwise eligible population of spouses.lesser that are not direct and review.see montgomery carr,cir.
prior applications of this rule by the supreme court and this court help to illustrate its contours.in califano jobst,d,the court held that a social security provision that terminated certain benefits when a recipient married someone ineligible for benefits did not directly and substantially burden a recipient freedom to choose whom to marry and thus required the government to show only a reasonable governmental objective.see also lyng castillo,d upholding a law providing fewer benefits to nuclear families than to or extended families living together.
in montgomery,this court held that an rule barring employees of the same school from marrying did not constitute a direct and substantial burden on the right to marry.m erely placing a burden on the decision to marry,or on those who are already married,the court held,is not sufficient to trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny,because rules are not direct in the sense that they place an absolute barrier in the path of those who wish to marry.id.at.see also vaughn,at terminating a municipal employee for marrying another municipal employee is not a direct and substantial interference with the right to intimate association wright metrohealth med,cir holding that an policy does not directly and substantially interfere with the right to intimate association.
the same rule has been applied to relationships less formal than marriage.see anderson,at holding that a police force policy prohibiting dating between officers of different ranks did not directly and substantially burden the right to intimate association because officers were still free to date anyone other than this small subset of the population akers,at holding that a michigan department of corrections rule prohibiting workers from having contact with prisoners,parolees,probationers and their relatives and visitors did not directly and substantially burden the right to intimate association marcum mcwhorter,cir holding that police department could terminate a police officer for having an adul
