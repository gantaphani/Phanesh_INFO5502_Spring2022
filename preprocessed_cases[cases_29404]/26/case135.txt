in this case,daniel papelino alleges that he was sexually harassed by a professor when he was enrolled as a student at the albany college of pharmacy the college.he complained to the associate dean of student affairs.shortly thereafter,the college accused papelino and his two roommates,michael yu and plaintiff carl basile,of cheating on exams.all three were disciplined,and papelino and basile were expelled.
the three students successfully brought an article proceeding in state court to challenge the college decisions.the appellate division,third department,held that the college determination that the students had cheated was arbitrary and capricious and lacked a rational basis.
papelino,basile,and yu brought this case asserting sexual harassment and retaliation claims under title ix of the education amendments of,et title ix,and breach of contract and tort claims under new york common law.in a decision dated february,the district court norman mordue,chief judge,dismissed all but two of plaintiffs claims.in a memorandum decision dated march,the district court granted plaintiffs leave to reinstate certain claims but denied leave to reinstate four claims.and in a memorandum decision dated september,the district court granted summary judgment dismissing all plaintiffs remaining claims.final judgment was entered the same day.this appeal followed.
we affirm in part and reverse in part.we conclude that while the district court properly dismissed certain claims,plaintiffs demonstrated the existence of genuine issues of material fact for trial with respect to their claims for sexual harassment,retaliation,breach of contract,and negligent supervision.accordingly,we remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,papelino,yu,and basile were pharmacy students at the college.they were roommates,study partners,and friends.all three were enrolled in a medicinal chemistry course taught by professor deanne nowak.
in the fall of,nowak began to flirt with papelino in and out of class.she would wink and smile at him.she sat on the edge of his desk during one class,and gave him excessive praise for his work.
in october,after the first medicinal chemistry exam,many students,including papelino,petitioned nowak for additional points.when papelino went to nowak office to pick up his exam,she informed him that she had awarded him extra points,and told him,in what papelino described as a voice laced with sexual innuendo n ot everyone got extra points,they truly have to earn them.you know what i mean,do you dan 
in january,papelino again visited nowak office,this time to discuss a class project.nowak stated in a flirtatious manner i can really appreciate a man who is good with his hands,if you know what i mean.as papelino tried to leave,she stated you know i am always here for you handsome.
a month later,in february,papelino visited nowak office a third time,to ask a question about class material.nowak invited papelino to sit down.as papelino began to ask his question,nowak stood up,and then bent down in front of him so that her backside was in papelino face.as nowak looked over some papers on the floor,she directed papelino to pick up a book from the shelf above her.when papelino moved to pick up the book,nowak stood up and papelino felt her hand rub against his crotch.papelino asked what was that for nowak responded,with a grin on her face it an accident,and then,do you know how lonely i been lately when papelino asked why she was telling him that,nowak replied i thought you might be interested in knowing that.papelino told her that she had him all wrong,and left the office.
in march,nowak asked papelino to stay after class.nowak invited papelino to attend a party with her so that she could teach him to dance.when papelino declined,nowak said so that means you are going to make me go alone 
finally,on april,papelino and his classmates attended a poster session in the school gymnasium,where groups of students presented posters and pamphlets of information about different prescription drugs.nowak approached papelino and asked him to go out with her the next day to celebrate her birthday.according to papelino,the following ensued 
i told her,i thought i made it clear that i am not interested in any kind of personal relationship.nowak said,what are you worried about i said,i have a girlfriend,you are married,and i not interested nowak then persisted and stated i would be too concerned about my husband,he in ohio.i told her that if she could take no for an answer,i think dean white might be interested in hearing about this.nowak attitude changed and sternly told me that doing so would be a big mistake.she then said,well,if you think it necessary,go ahead and try it and see what happens 
papelino immediately reported nowak sexual advances to the college associate dean for student affairs,albert white.as defendants conceded below,papelino spoke to white on or about april,about nowak,when he sought advice about nowak sexual overtures.according to papelino,white reported back to him in late april,stating that he had spoken to nowak and that the matter had been taken care of.dean white testified at his deposition,however,that he never spoke to anybody about the situation,nor did he go to any member of the administration cause he did want to let it out.around that time,papelino noticed a change in nowak behavior,as she started to act cold and unfriendly toward him.
on or about may,nowak told elisabeth vines,the faculty advisor to the student honor code committee,that she believed papelino and basile had cheated in her medicinal chemistry course,as well as in a pharmacology course taught by nowak roommate,professor diane sylvester.nowak testified at her deposition that she first decided to look into whether papelino and basile had been cheating in early december when she received an anonymous note slipped under the door to her office she thereafter told sylvester that she thought papelino and basile were cheating and she asked sylvester to check her exams.at some point she approached other instructors as well,including professor jeffrey voight,who had papelino and basile in their classes,asking them to look at their exams to see whether the students had cheated.
on may,just two days after nowak spoke to vines,papelino and basile received notices that they had been accused of violating the college honor code.over the next week,yu was also charged with cheating,and the number of courses in which papelino and basile were accused of cheating grew to nine.
a hearing was held on may,in support of the charges,nowak presented evidence,which consisted primarily of statistical charts that she had prepared based on her review of exams taken by papelino,basile,and yu in various courses.papelino,basile,and yu countered with the lack of evidence of the means by which the three might have managed to cheat the fact that the three studied together,and therefore had similar knowledge bases and the lack of validity of the statistical evidence.during the hearing,nowak leaned over while showing a document to plaintiffs,whereby her shirt fell forward and plaintiffs were exposed to her bare breasts.the student honor code committee found papelino guilty of cheating in three classes,basile guilty of cheating in six classes,and yu guilty of cheating in one class.
the three students appealed the decision to the college honor code appellate board,but the board declined to hear the appeal.the students received failing grades in the classes in which they were found to have cheated.in august,papelino and basile were expelled,and yu was permitted to retake the one class.
in september,plaintiffs commenced an article proceeding in new york state supreme court,albany county.they sought to annul the honor code committee decision.the supreme court dismissed their petition,but on appeal,the third department reversed and held that the college determinations to expel basile and papelino and to award yu a failing grade were arbitrary and capricious and lacked a rational basis.basile albany coll.of pharmacy of union,dep t,leave to appeal denied.specifically,the third department concluded that the honor code committee determinations were based solely on a statistical compilation that was based upon false assumptions and did not provide a rational basis to conclude that petitioners cheated.at.the third department also held that as the same statistical methodology was used to evaluate the charges,there was no rational explanation for why basile was found guilty of cheating in six out of nine courses,papelino in three out of nine courses,and yu in one out of seven courses.id.at.finally,the third department held that the allegations of cheating were based on either hearsay anonymous notes or sheer speculation,and that it was irrational of the committee to determine that it could rely solely on the inference of cheating raised by the statistical compilation,particularly when faced with proof that petitioners took these examinations in separate rooms and under the watchful eye of a proctor,who discerned no evidence of cheating.id.
after the article proceedings,the college faculty voted in may to award papelino and basile their diplomas.yu had already received his diploma after having retaken the one course.according to the president of the college,papelino diploma was issued without notation or qualification,and it was to papelino graduation date.on may,the college sent papelino transcripts to the division of professional licensing services in new any reference to the honor code proceedings or the article decision.
on july,after the commencement of this action below,papelino requested that the college certify his degree to florida pharmacy licensing authorities.the college attorney responded to papelino as follows 
the college proposes to complete the certification and attach thereto the decisions of justice malone and the appellate division,and send the same to florida.a further caveat needs to be added as to the pendency of this lawsuit,which upon resolution may effect sic the award of the degree.i would like to discuss with you appropriate language to the effect that it may be determined in a pending action commenced by papelino that the charges were true,which may result in the revocation of papelino degree.
proceedings below 
on or about may,plaintiffs commenced this action in the supreme court of the state of new york,oneida county.papelino asserted claims for sexual harassment and retaliation under title ix of the education amendments of,et,and all three plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,and prima facie tort.
defendants removed the action to the district court below on june.plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in september,adding,inter alia,negligent supervision claims and a claim that the college refusal to provide an unqualified certification of papelino degree to florida constituted unlawful retaliation for filing this lawsuit.
defendants moved to dismiss.in a memorandum decision and order dated february,the district court dismissed plaintiffs breach of contract,tort,and hostile educational environment sexual harassment claims,but permitted papelino to proceed with his claims for quid pro quo sexual harassment and retaliation.
plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.in a memorandum decision and order dated march,the district court granted plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint reinstating certain claims,but denied plaintiffs leave to reinstate four claims prima facie tort,negligent infliction of emotional distress,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and hostile environment sexual harassment.
following discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims,papelino albany college of pharmacy of union,civ.nam,wl,and entered final judgment dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,reversing where there are genuine issues of material fact.see schiano quality payroll,cir.similarly,we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b.see simmons roundup funding,llc,cir.while we generally review a district court denial of a motion for leave to amend a pleading for abuse of discretion,where the denial is based on rulings of law,our review is de novo.see spiegel schulmann,cir kassner delicatessen,cir.
b.the merits 
we address in turn the claims for sexual harassment,retaliation,breach of contract,and negligent supervision,and then we discuss the remaining claims.
sexual harassment 
applicable law 
title ix provides a remedy to a student who is subjected to sexual harassment by a teacher or professor at an educational institution receiving federal funds.hayut state of,cir see also gebser lago vista indep.sch.for an educational facility to be liable,however,the plaintiff must establish that a school official with authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures had actual knowledge of the discrimination and failed to adequately respond.gebser,at.a school fails to adequately respond if it provides no response or if it provides a response that amount s to deliberate indifference to discrimination.id.the school response to sex discrimination must be clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.davis monroe county bd.of.
in other respects,a title ix sex discrimination claim requires the same kind of proof required in a title vii sex discrimination claim.see torres pisano,cir we have held that title vii principles apply in interpreting title ix.therefore,as under title vii,a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim under title ix requires proof of three elements the rejection of sexual advances a tangible as opposed to employment consequence and a causal connection between the two.see karibian columbia,cir.in the education context,a tangible consequence occurs when some benefit or adverse action,such as a change in a grade,is made to depend upon providing sexual favors to someone in authority.wills brown,cir.
similarly,a title ix hostile education environment claim is governed by traditional title vii hostile environment jurisprudence.hayut,at.a title ix plaintiff must show that he subjectively perceived the environment to be hostile or abusive and that the environment objectively was hostile or abusive,that is,that it was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his educational environment.id.at see also davis,at for title ix sexual harassment claim,plaintiffs must show conduct that was so severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive that it effectively bar red access to an educational opportunity or benefit.
application 
we discuss first the quid pro quo claim and then the hostile environment claim.
i quid pro quo harassment 
we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exists with respect to papelino quid pro quo claim.the district court concluded that papelino had failed to present sufficient evidence that the college had actual knowledge of the serious nature of nowak sexual overtures towards him or that the college acted with deliberate indifference.we disagree.
there is sufficient evidence in the record to permit a reasonable jury to find that the college had actual notice of nowak sexual advances papelino complained to dean white about nowak sexual advances.first,white was a member of the college administration who was responsible for the administration of the student code.second,in their amended answer to the amended complaint,defendants admitted that papelino spoke to white about sexual overtures made by nowak against him.third,white testified at his deposition that papelino spoke to him on or about april,and told him that nowak was giving him favorable marks because of actions,as well as something about a blouse and something about dinners or going out.finally,papelino asserted that he gave white detailed information 
i told dean white that i was having problems with nowak.he asked me,what kind of problems i told him nowak has been making passes at me.he asked me,what do you mean by that i told him that on several occasions nowak had asked me to go out with her on a personal level.i also explained that she went so far as to touch me.dean white said,where did she touch you i then explained to him the incident that happened on,and the several other incidents that took place.i told him these incidents have made me very uncomfortable and nervous.
together,this evidence provides a basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that white and hence the college was on actual notice of nowak alleged behavior.
as for deliberate indifference,papelino was required to adduce evidence that the college or its agents knowing ly refus ed to take any action in response to the behavior,such as investigat ing or put ting an end to the harassment,davis,at,or refus ed to take action to bring the recipient institution into compliance,gebser,at.we conclude that papelino did so.white testified at his deposition that he kept quiet about papelino he did not speak to nowak or anyone else at the college about the he did want to let it out.although white was responsible for administering the student code,he did nothing to investigate papelino complaint.he did not follow the procedures established by acp for processing complaints of sexual harassment.he did not take care of the situation as he had told papelino he would.he failed to intervene in the honor code proceedings initiated by nowak against plaintiffs.a reasonable jury could surely find deliberate indifference from these facts.
finally,we also conclude that there is sufficient proof of the elements of a quid pro quo claim to entitle papelino to a jury trial.papelino adduces evidence that nowak made sexual advances toward him,he rejected them,and nowak initiated honor code proceedings against him soon thereafter,falsely accusing him of cheating.the close temporal proximity between papelino final rejection of nowak advances and her initiation of proceedings combined with the apparent speciousness of the proffered proof of cheating constitute evidence of a causal connection,especially given nowak warning that it would be a big mistake for papelino to report her to white.
ii hostile environment harassment 
as for the hostile environment claim,the district court dismissed the claim on grounds of timeliness.it held correctly that a statute of limitations applied,see torre columbia,civ.lap,wl,at july,aff,cir benzo state div.of human rights,civ.lap,wl,at,aff,cir,and determined that the claim was untimely because the last act of alleged sexual harassment occurred in april,more than three years before suit was filed on may.the district court concluded that the only harassing event alleged to have occurred within the three years prior to filing of suit was when nowak purportedly exposed her breasts to plaintiffs at the honor code hearing on may.the district court held that this incident was not sufficiently severe to constitute actionable sexual harassment.
we reverse.first,the incident at the honor code hearing can not be so easily dismissed.nowak alleged exposure of her breasts at the hearing can not be viewed in isolation.in context,a jury could reasonably find that nowak engaged in the conduct as a final sexual taunting of papelino and the others.see gregory daly,f d,cir to determine whether an environment is hostile or abusive,courts must look at the totality of the circumstances rather than individual events in isolation accord harris forklift,w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.
second,the record contains evidence of other incidents of hostile conduct within the limitations period.for example,after plaintiffs were notified by email on may,of the cheating charges,nowak spearheaded the prosecution of the charges by meeting with other professors and leading the presentation of the evidence.a reasonable jury could find that nowak engaged in this conduct because papelino rejected her sexual advances,and that these actions were part of a pattern of pervasive conduct that was sufficiently hostile or abusive to alter the conditions of papelino educational environment.while this adverse treatment was not overtly sexual in nature,in the circumstances here,a reasonable jury could find that it was on account of sex.see raniola bratton,cir both and other adverse treatment can be part of a hostile environment where the other adverse treatment was also suffered on account of sex.moreover,under the continuing violation doctrine,a plaintiff may bring claims for discriminatory acts that would have been barred by the statute of limitations as long as an act contributing to that hostile environment took place within the statutory time period.mcgullam cedar graphics,cir quoting passenger morgan.a reasonable jury could find that the,conduct was part of a continuing course of conduct that began with novak earlier sexual advances.
retaliation 
applicable law 
r etaliation against individuals because they complain of sex discrimination is intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of title ix.jackson birmingham bd.of,quoting davis,at.as in the context of title vii,a plaintiff claiming retaliation under title ix must first establish a prima facie case by showing protected activity by the plaintiff knowledge by the defendant of the protected activity adverse action and a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.see quinn green tree credit,cir.close temporal proximity between the plaintiff protected activity and the adverse action may in itself by sufficient to establish the requisite causal connection.kaytor boat,cir.
once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.mcdonnell douglas green.after the defendant has done so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the articulated reasons are pretextual.id.at.
even if the agents who carried out the adverse action did not know about the plaintiff protected activity,the knowledge requirement is met if the legal entity was on notice.gordon n.bd.of,cir title vii context.neither this nor any other circuit has ever held that,to satisfy the knowledge requirement,anything more is necessary than general corporate knowledge that the plaintiff has engaged in a protected activity.id.at.
while the individual agents claims of unawareness of the protected activity are relevant to the jury determination of causality,a jury is entitled to disregard such claims if they are unreliable.further,while lack of knowledge on the part of particular agents who carried out the adverse action is evidence of lack of causal connection,a plaintiff may counter with evidence that the was acting on orders or encouragement of a superior who did have the requisite knowledge.see gordon,f d at cir henry wyeth,cir.in a retaliation case,a plaintiff is only required to prove that a retaliatory motive play ed a part in adverse actions toward him,whether or not it was the sole cause.terry ashcroft,cir citing cosgrove sears,roebuck,cir.
application 
here,a jury could find actionable retaliation both in terms of the initiation of the honor code proceedings and the college refusal to provide an unqualified certification of papelino degree to the state of florida.
in terms of the initiation of the honor code proceedings,the district court concluded that the individuals who participated in the honor code panel decision were unaware of papelino complaints against nowak,and that,therefore,they found plaintiffs guilty of cheating only because they actually believed the students were guilty.the district court concluded,therefore,that papelino failed to establish knowledge and a causal relationship.
construing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs,however,we conclude that triable issues of facts existed as to knowledge and causation.first,there was evidence of that the college knew that papelino had engaged in protected activity.papelino complained to white,and thus white was aware that papelino was engaging in protected activity.yet,white did nothing even after
