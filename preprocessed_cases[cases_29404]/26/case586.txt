the foundation for interior design education research brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not violate the rights of savannah college of art design in denying accreditation to the college interior design program.savannah college of art appeals the district court decision granting summary judgment to the foundation on its claim and dismissing the college antitrust,breach of contract,common law due process,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraud counterclaims.we affirm the district court decisions on all claims.
savannah college of art design,a private,institution located in savannah,georgia,offers a variety of educational programs in the fields of art and design,including interior design.the college is accredited by the commission on colleges of the southern association of colleges and schools.the foundation for interior design education research,also a organization,is the sole accrediting body for interior design education programs in the united states.the foundation is organized under the laws of new york.it is located in grand rapids,michigan.
in january,the college applied to the foundation for accreditation of the college interior design program.in april,the foundation sent a group of three interior design to the college to conduct an evaluation of the college interior design program.the visiting team prepared a report that generally praised the college program,but that recommended a denial of accreditation.the team based its recommendation on deficiencies it found in ten areas of student achievement at the college.the foundation accreditation committee reviewed both the team report and comments from the college in response to the report.three members of that committee responded to the report.one member agreed with the visiting team recommendation two others disagreed with the recommendation.one of the committee members who disagreed with the visiting team found that the report is written in such a manner that it sets the program up for denial.
the foundation board of trustees,the organ responsible for making accreditation decisions,reviewed the team report,the college comments,and the comments of members of the accreditation committee.the board decided to deny the college application for accreditation on august.the college appealed this decision to the foundation internal board of appeals.the foundation board of appeals determined that the visiting team findings concerning the college student achievement deficiencies were not sufficiently substantiated in the team report,and it decided that the board of trustees should reconsider the college application.upon reconsideration,the foundation board of trustees recommended that the foundation conduct a second evaluation of the college interior design program.
the foundation conducted a second evaluation of the college in december.the second team of visitors to the college did not include any members of the first visiting team,and it did not read the first team report before visiting the college.the second team identified deficiencies in twenty areas of student achievement at the college,and it recommended that the foundation reject the college application for accreditation of its interior design program.the accreditation committee then reviewed a combination of the reports prepared by both visiting teams.five members of the accreditation committee responded to the combined report each agreed that the foundation should deny the college application.the foundation board of trustees denied the college application once again,and it informed the college of this decision on august.
the college appealed the foundation second decision to deny accreditation to the foundation appeal panel,the successor organ to the board of appeals.at this time,the college also demanded that the foundation provide the college with its accreditation reports dating from forward to enable the college to prove that it had been disparately treated.the foundation refused this demand.the college then submitted to the appeal panel eleven of the foundation accreditation reports that it had obtained from other sources.on april,the appeal panel notified the college that,based on its finding that the board decision was supported by substantial evidence,it had affirmed the board decision to deny the college application for accreditation.the appeal panel also found that the board decision was not inconsistent with its previous accreditation decisions cited by the college because the other successful schools had not been as deficient as the college.
on at least three occasions during the pendency of its application for accreditation,the college suggested to the foundation that it was considering taking legal action against the foundation.in a letter to the foundation concerning the foundation second evaluation,sent on july,the college attorney wrote while we prefer to resolve this matter privately and confidentially,should the foundation decline to award earned accreditation,the college will consider all of its options,including the filing of a lawsuit in another letter sent to the foundation on september,in the midst of discussions about the second visit,the college attorney suggested that,if discussions broke off,the college would explore the numerous options available.finally,on february,less than two months before the college second appeal of the foundation decision to deny it accreditation,the college attorney informed the foundation that,if the foundation did not grant accreditation upon appeal,the college will have no choice but to pursue its claims against the foundation,and expose its disparate practices to a public whose trust in the foundation ability to objectively evaluate applicant programs is clearly misplaced.
anticipating legal action by the college,the foundation filed a complaint on april,seeking a declaratory judgment that its decision to deny the college accreditation application was lawful.this complaint was filed ten minutes after the foundation transmitted to the college its decision to affirm its second denial of the college application for accreditation.the college subsequently filed counterclaims against the foundation alleging breach of contract,violation of common law due process,breach of fiduciary duty,antitrust violations,and fraud.on december,the district court granted the foundation motion for summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim.on september,the district court granted the foundation motion to dismiss each of the college counterclaims for failure to state a claim.
ii.jurisdiction over the foundation declaratory judgment claim 
as an initial matter,the college argues that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the foundation claim for declaratory judgment because the claim did not present a justiciable controversy.federal courts are empowered to entertain declaratory judgment actions only when a party alleges facts that show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality maryland cas.pacific coal oil.kelley dupont de nemours,cir.
even if the district court did not initially have jurisdiction to hear the foundation declaratory question we need not,and do not,college conferred jurisdiction by filing its counterclaims.see gopher oil bunker,cir.in gopher oil,a case the district court relied upon,the environmental protection agency threatened to sue gopher oil for cleanup costs.gopher oil brought a declaratory judgment claim against the representative of the previous owners of the property alleging that they would be liable for the cleanup costs if gopher oil was in fact sued by the government.the eighth circuit found that,while the plaintiff declaratory judgment claim may not have been ripe when filed,it had ripened by the time of appeal because the government had in fact brought its claim.see id.at.
while gopher oil did not involve compulsory counterclaims,it stands for the proposition that a federal court can,in certain circumstances,acquire subject matter jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment claim that was arguably unripe when filed.this case presents such a circumstance.we note that a defendant can move to dismiss a declaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction before filing its compulsory counterclaims.we find that the district court had jurisdiction to decide this case and that we have jurisdiction to review the court decision.
where a federal court has jurisdiction to hear a declaratory judgment claim,the power to do so is discretionary,and the court may refuse to hear such a claim on equitable grounds.see green mansour,d nationwide mut.fire ins.willenbrink,cir.this court reviews a district court exercise of discretion to hear a declaratory judgment claim for abuse of discretion with these factors in mind 
whether the judgment would settle the controversy whether the declaratory judgment action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for the purpose of procedural fencing or to provide an arena for a race for res judicata whether the use of a declaratory action would increase the friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach on state jurisdiction and whether there is an alternative remedy that is better or more effective.
scottsdale ins.roumph,cir quoting omaha prop.cas.ins.johnson,cir.
consideration of most of these factors supports the district court decision to hear the foundation claim.this case does not raise any significant concerns about friction between state and federal courts.the record does not indicate that there is a preferable alternate remedy.the district court declaratory judgment did help clarify the legal relations of the parties and settle the parties controversy.
the college contends,however,that the foundation used its declaratory judgment claim merely to achieve a procedural advantage.this is a legitimate concern.the fact that the foundation complaint was filed immediately after the foundation transmitted its final denial of accreditation is troubling,especially because the foundation apparently made its accreditation decision one month before it informed the college.the timing of the foundation action creates a strong inference that it acted with some strategic purpose.the college has not,however,argued that it has suffered any concrete disadvantage by the foundation action.furthermore,the college did file its numerous counterclaims before arguing that the district court should not to hear the foundation claim.we find,therefore,that the district court properly exercised its discretion in allowing the foundation to bring its declaratory judgment claim.
iii.the foundation accreditation decision 
the college appeals the district court decision granting the foundation motion for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory judgment.michigan law controls the foundation claim.unfortunately,there are no michigan cases directly on point.there is,however,a body of jurisprudence concerning academic accreditation in decisions from other jurisdictions.see,chicago sch.of automatic transmissions,accreditation alliance of career sch,cir wilfred acad.of hair beauty culture southern ass of colls,cir medical inst.of minnesota national ass of trade technical,cir marlboro association of indep.colls,cir marjorie webster junior,middle states of colls.secondary,north dakota north cent.ass of colls.secondary,cir philadelphia wireless technical inst.accrediting comm of career sch.colls.of,no.civ,wl,rockland inst.association of indep.colls.parsons coll.north cent.of colls.secondary.blende maricopa county med.soc y,falcone middlesex county med.soc y.
this jurisprudence derives from early common law relating to private,voluntary organizations.see falcone,at blende,at noting the traditional view that medical societies and other voluntary associations have unlimited discretion to grant or refuse admission to membership.despite the traditional reluctance of courts to review such membership decisions,the seventh circuit indicated as early as that it would interfere with an accrediting association decision to rescind a school accreditation if the decision was arrived at arbitrarily and without sufficient evidence to support it.north dakota,at see also parsons.at characterizing this standard as a matter of common law due process.falcone and blende,two influential state court cases on physician licensing from the,articulated a similar rule for professional associations.these cases reasoned that,because the medical societies in question exercised a monopolistic power in areas of public concern,they were required to base their decisions on substantial evidence and were not allowed to act arbitrarily or unreasonably.see falcone,at blende,at.
in a landmark case,the court of appeals for the district of columbia refined and generalized the rule from falcone and blende,finding that,where membership in an organization is a significant requirement to practice in a given profession,courts will scrutinize the standards and procedures used by the organization to select its membership.see marjorie webster,at.reviewing a decision by the middle states association of colleges and secondary schools to deny accreditation to marjorie webster junior college,however,the circuit found that the denial did not greatly hinder the school ability to continue to operate successfully and that it did not warrant heightened scrutiny.id.at.the court found that judicial review of middle states standards should accord substantial deference to middle state judgment regarding the ends that it serves and the means most appropriate to those ends.id.at.in subsequent cases reviewing school accreditation decisions,courts have held that such decisions are accorded great deference and have consistently limited their review to whether the decisions were arbitrary and unreasonable and whether they were supported by substantial evidence.wilfred acad.of hair beauty culture,at citing medical inst.of minnesota,at marjorie webster junior,at rockland.at parsons.at see also,chicago sch.of automatic transmissions,at transport careers.at.courts have refused to conduct de novo accreditation reviews,see rockland.at,and they have refused to consider claims of disparate treatment of accreditation applicants,see transport careers.at marlboro,at.
in,congress provided that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over suits brought by schools challenging accreditation decisions made by certain organizations approved by the secretary of education.see f see also chicago sch.of automatic transmissions,at.this statute does not apply in this case because the foundation was not at any relevant time approved by the secretary of education.in chicago school,a case decided under this statute,the seventh circuit determined that the common law standard for reviewing accreditation decisions is essentially the same as the standard used to review decisions by administrative,whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or reached without observance of procedure required by law.chicago sch.of automatic transmissions,at quoting a,d.
the parties and the district court have taken notice of two cases,maitland wayne state.med,and dietz american dental ass n.kennedy,that strongly suggest that michigan courts would adopt the common law standard of review for school accreditation decisions discussed above.maitland involved a suit by a medical student seeking to be reinstated in good standing at his school.the michigan court reviewed the defendant actions for arbitrariness,capriciousness,and denial of procedural due standard very similar to the school accreditation cases.maitland,at.dietz involved a challenge by an individual denied membership in a medical association.there,citing marjorie webster,the court found that it should not afford great deference to membership decisions by professional organizations that exercise monopoly power in their professions.dietz.at.the court found that,in such cases,the association has a fiduciary duty to be substantively rational and procedurally fair.id.the dietz court applied this standard and found that there were disputed issues of fact requiring,whether or not the plaintiff had been given the standard amount
