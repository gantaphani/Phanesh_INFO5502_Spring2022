nine minor school children,seven parents,the val verde unified school district the district,and the board of education of the val verde unified school district collectively referred to as val verde sought a writ of mandate,as well as injunctive and declaratory relief against the state of california,the state allocation board sab,the office of public school construction opsc,governor schwarzenegger,state department of finance director michael genest and state controller john chiang collectively referred to as the state the writ petition and complaint resulted from a dispute between val verde and the state over construction costs for school facilities.the trial court denied val verde petition for writ of mandate,and dismissed val verde complaint.
val verde essentially makes eight contentions.first,val verde asserts that the sab incorrectly interpreted education code section and california code of regulations,title,section.second,val verde contends that the sab improperly applied california code of regulations,title,section.third,val verde essentially asserts that the sab abused its discretion by concluding that money from certificates of participation cops should be included when calculating a school district ability to fund school construction.fourth,val verde contends that california code of regulations,title,section is invalid because the sab exceeded its authority when enacting that regulation.fifth,val verde asserts that substantial evidence does not support the finding that the district possessed in cop proceeds.sixth,val verde contends that the school facility program is unconstitutional.seventh,val verde asserts that the trial court erred by not making factual findings that were requested by val verde.eighth,val verde asserts that the trial court erred by overruling val verde evidentiary objections and sustaining the state evidentiary objections.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
legal background 
we begin by providing a brief summary of the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme.
california established the state school facilities fund the state fund to pay for school construction projects,subd.a,subd.a.it is the duty of the sab to apportion money from the state fund to eligible school districts,subd.a,subd.a,and to determine which school districts are eligible to receive money from the state fund,subd.a.
typically,before the sab apportions money from the state fund,a school district must show that it has money from local sources to match the money granted from the state fund.in other words,percent of school construction money typically comes from local sources,and the other percent is derived from the state fund.however,there is an exception to this rule,which is known as the financial hardship program if a school district is not financially capable of providing the required matching funds,then the sab may adjust or defer the amount of local money required for a school construction project,subd.b,subd.a.when determining whether a school district has sufficient local funds,the sab can consider the unencumbered funds in a district facility accounts however,the sab may exclude funds encumbered for a specific capital outlay purpose,and other funds that are not reasonably available for the construction project,tit,subd.a.
we separate the facts into two sections.the first section presents the issues and procedural history of the sab administrative hearing.the second section presents the facts related to the hearing at the trial court.
administrative hearing 
the district participated in the financial hardship program from through.during that time,the district received in financial hardship apportionments,constructed new facilities,and modernized two other facilities.all but three of the district construction projects received percent funding from the state fund,due to the district financial incapacity.in,the opsc reviewed the district finances to determine if the district had any money to contribute toward the construction of school facilities.during the financial review,the opsc discovered that the district possessed approximately in available net proceeds from cops.data from the state treasurer office indicated that,since the district was admitted into the financial hardship program,the district had issued cops,totaling,which would provide total net proceeds in the approximate amount of.
the executive officer of the sab the executive officer alleged that,by not disclosing the cops,the district gained a funding advantage of,because the district would not have qualified for percent financial hardship funding if the cop proceeds had been disclosed.following these discoveries,the executive officer recommended that the sab find that the district failed to disclose material information about the cops during prior financial hardship reviews direct the district to repay the,plus interest,for a total of and apply the total net cop proceeds of as a local money contribution to the district next construction project s.
the district took the position that the proceeds from the cops were encumbered,and therefore,not reasonably available for the construction projects,and were deposited into the district general fund account,rather than its facility accounts,and therefore did not constitute available funds for construction.essentially,the district asserted that the cop proceeds were encumbered because they were needed to fill the shortfall created between the construction money provided by the financial hardship program,and the money it actually took to build an adequate school.in other words,the district contended that the financial hardship program did not provide enough money to build an adequate school,and therefore,the district could not use the cop proceeds as matching funds,because it needed the money to finish the construction projects,which would be incomplete if the only money for the projects was the money from the state fund.the district asserted that it had already spent approximately to fill the shortfall in the construction funding provided by the financial hardship program,and estimated that it would need to spend an additional to fill the funding gaps for construction projects that were in the planning stages.
the executive officer contended that the construction funds provided to the district through the financial hardship program were sufficient to build a complete school,but that the district wasted the funds by making unnecessary modifications in the midst of construction,such as adding skylights to an administrative office,and by building unnecessary facilities,such as a weight room at a high school.the executive officer argued that any enhancements to a construction project should be borne by the district.if a district is receiving percent financial hardship assistance from the state,any enhancements need to be built within the apportionment provided.further,that any local funds made available should be used solely to offset the financial hardship assistance provided by the state.
the district contended that limiting construction funds to those provided by the state would lead to construction of inadequate,incomplete schools,and that children living in areas of limited resources will have to attend schools without libraries,multipurpose rooms,resource specialist spaces and other essential program support facilities.the district requested that the sab find that the cop proceeds used to supplement the money provided by the financial hardship program were encumbered,and therefore,not available for a local matching funds contribution.
at the sab meeting on july,a motion was made to deny the district request,and to recommend that the of cop revenue be deemed available for future school facility projects.the motion carried with nine votes in favor,and one abstention.
trial court hearing 
in a combined petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,val verde requested that the trial court declare the state regulatory system for allocating financial hardship funds,tit,subd.a to be invalid and unconstitutional for failing to avoid in expenditures and education quality declare that cop funding was not available for local matching contributions,and that cop funding shall not be used by the state to offset future construction funding from the state issue preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering the state to stop following the allegedly invalid and unconstitutional regulatory system when allocating financial hardship funds grant a writ of mandate directing the state to stop following the allegedly invalid and unconstitutional regulatory system when allocating financial hardship funds issue preliminary and permanent injunctions directing the state to take all steps necessary to ensure that the apportionment of financial hardship funds is completed in a constitutional manner and order the state to reimburse the money the district paid to complete the various school construction projects.
the state opposed val verde requests.the state contended that val verde did not demonstrate the regulatory system was unconstitutional,because a val verde was not similarly situated to schools,and b val verde did not demonstrate that funding from the financial hardship program was linked to a education and the definition of an adequate school is a public policy question,not the basis for a lawsuit.
at the hearing on the petition and the complaint,the trial court remarked that the record did not reflect that val verde had received disparate treatment,because the record showed that other school districts had to their school construction plans due to the amount of financial hardship funds granted to them.therefore,the trial court concluded,there no suspect classifications and no indication that anybody been selected out under any kind of equal protection analysis.the trial court found that the sab did not abuse its discretion by deciding that the district of cop revenue should be deemed available for future school facility projects.consequently,the trial court denied the writ petition,as well as the requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.
discussion 
statutory interpretation 
val verde contends that the sab erred by interpreting section and california code of regulations,title,section,as allowing the sab to deem money deposited in a general fund account to be available or unencumbered.we disagree.
as a starting point,the interpretation of an administrative regulation is subject to the same principles as the interpretation of a statute.citation.county of sacramento state water resources control bd.th,d.when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.citations.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute citation.however,the literal meaning of a statute must be in accord with its purpose as our supreme court noted in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,as follows we are not prohibited from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute in lungren deukmejian cal d,our supreme court added the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation the supreme court has held the courts must give statutes a reasonable construction which conforms to the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers.citation.citation.further,the supreme court has held we have recognized that a wide variety of factors may illuminate the legislative design,such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the time and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy and contemporaneous construction.citations.citation.citation.state ex rel.nee unumprovident th,d see also horwich superior court cal th,d.
our interpretation of a statute is typically subject to de novo review.cequel iii communications i,llc.local agency formation com of nevada county th,d.despite the similarities between interpreting statutes and regulations,an important difference between the interpretation of a statute and the interpretation of a regulation is that we defer to an agency interpretation of a regulation involving its area of expertise,unless the interpretation flies in the face of the clear language and purpose of the provision.citation.citation.county of sacramento state water resources control,supra,th at,d.
section,subdivision c,provides that the sab must adopt regulations defining the amount,and sources,of financing that a school district could reasonably provide for school facilities as follows 
unencumbered funds available in all facility accounts in the school district including,but not limited to,fees on development,redevelopment funds,sale proceeds from surplus property,funds generated by certificates of participation for facility purposes,bond funds,federal grants,and other funds available for school facilities,as the board may determine.
the board may exclude from consideration all funds encumbered for a specific capital outlay purpose,a reasonable amount for interim housing,and other funds that the board may find are not reasonably available for the project.
the pertinent regulation adopted by the sab,regarding funding sources,is california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a hereinafter sometimes the regulation,which provides that a school district may qualify for the financial hardship program if it can demonstrate that t he district is financially unable to provide all necessary matching funds for an eligible project.to determine this,an analysis shall be made of the district financial records by the opsc including data and records maintained by the california department of education and the county office of education.the analysis shall consist of a review of the district latest independent audit regarding funds available from all capital facility accounts,including,but not limited to,developer fees,funds generated from capital facility certificates of participation,federal grants,redevelopment funds,sale proceeds from surplus property,the appraised value of facilities approved for replacement pursuant to section,bond funds either encumbered,unencumbered or authorized but unsold,and savings from other sfp projects.all funds thus identified that have not been expended or encumbered by a contractual agreement for a specific capital outlay purpose prior to the initial request for financial hardship status shall be deemed available as a matching contribution.after the initial request for financial hardship status is granted,no further encumbrances will be approved by the opsc and all prospective revenue made available to the district capital facility accounts shall be deemed available as matching contribution on the subsequent financial hardship review 
the plain language of the regulation is very reflects that a fiscal review shall consist of the funds available from all capital facility accounts,italics added and that after a request for financial hardship status is granted,then all prospective revenue made available to the district capital facility accounts shall be deemed available italics added.the regulation speaks very narrowly of capital facility accounts,and does not mention matching funds being derived from any other type of account.consequently,the plain language of the regulation supports the conclusion that money from the district general fund should not be considered available for a matching contribution.
nevertheless,despite the plain language of the regulation,the statutory and regulatory schemes reveal a different intention.section,subdivision a,provides that the typical state contribution for school construction projects will be percent however,if a school district is financially incapable of paying its percent share,then the state may make an exception to the rule and pay for percent of the construction costs,tit.it is clear from this statutory scheme that the financial hardship exception was meant to assist school districts that do not have sufficient funds for constructing new schools,regardless of which account s the construction money was deposited into.in other words,the intent of the statutory and regulatory scheme is not to audit capital facility accounts,but to ensure that school districts that are not financially capable of affording new school facilities are able to construct the necessary buildings.see,tit.therefore,we can infer that it was not the intent of the legislature or the regulatory body to limit consideration of available funds to those deposited into a capital facility account,rather,the intent was to include all money designated for construction purposes,regardless of which account it was deposited into.
in sum,a reasonable interpretation of the regulation and related statute is that all funds designated for constructing school facilities that were not otherwise encumbered,should be deemed available for a school district matching contribution,regardless of which account the funds were deposited into.therefore,we conclude the sab and the trial court properly construed the applicable statute and regulation.
val verde asserts that the foregoing interpretation of section,subdivision c,renders the term facility account surplusage,and therefore,such an interpretation must be avoided.contrary to val verde position,the term facility account will not become surplusage under the foregoing interpretation,rather,the term is given a broader meaning.instead of referring to an account specifically labeled facility account,under our interpretation the term refers to any account containing money for facilities.accordingly,val verde argument is unpersuasive.
further,val verde interpretation of the the sab may only consider money in accounts labeled facility account would essentially render section,the program,surplusage,because school districts that want to save local money would simply deposit all their construction funds into their general fund accounts so as to appear financially incapable of making a matching contribution.in sum,we do not find val verde argument to be persuasive.
during oral argument,val verde stressed that the state own consultant determined that the opsc and sab do not have jurisdiction over cop proceeds that are deposited in a school district general fund.val verde relied on a document referred to as the macias report as evidence of the state consultant conclusion.as noted by the state during oral argument,the macias report was not before the trial court.at the trial court,val verde requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the macias report however,the trial court denied the request.consequently,we do not discuss val verde argument concerning the macias report,because it was not raised in the trial court.see brown boren th,d litigant may not assert a new theory on appeal.
application of the regulation 
next,val verde contends that,even if the sab believes that construction money in the general fund account is available,the sab improperly applied the regulation because the cop proceeds were already encumbered for a specific capital purpose prior to the district application for financial hardship status,and therefore,the funds could not be deemed available.we disagree.
the regulation provides all funds identified that have not been expended or encumbered by a contractual agreement prior to the initial request for financial hardship status shall be deemed available as a matching contribution.after the initial request for financial hardship status is granted,no further encumbrances will be approved by the opsc and all prospective revenue made available to the district capital facility accounts shall be deemed available as a matching contribution on the subsequent financial hardship review 
the question for the trial court and for us on appeal is the same whether the local agency decision is supported by substantial evidence.citation.the burden is on appellant to show there is no substantial evidence to support the decision.citation.fishback county of ventura th,d.
the district was initially approved for financial hardship status in december.between and,the district submitted subsequent applications to renew its financial hardship status,which we infer were approved.the record includes cops with dates of october,april,july,and march.accordingly,substantial evidence reflects that at least four cops were issued several years after the district initial request for financial hardship status was granted.therefore,substantial evidence supports the finding that the cop proceeds were not encumbered,because the regulation provides that after an initial request for financial hardship status is granted,no further encumbrances will be approved,and all revenue available for capital facility projects shall be deemed available on subsequent financial hardship reviews,tit,subd.a.consequently,the cop proceeds could not be deemed encumbered because that revenue was received after the district initial request for financial hardship status was granted.in sum,we find no error.
val verde appears to take the position that each subsequent application for financial hardship status was independent of the previous application,and therefore,each application is the initial application.accordingly,val verde essentially asserts that the cop proceeds were encumbered prior to the district receiving financial hardship status.contrary to val verde position,the regulation plainly reflects that subsequent applications are not independent or initial applications.specifically,the regulation provides after the initial request for financial hardship status is granted,no further encumbrances will be approved by the opsc and all prospective revenue made available to the district capital facility accounts shall be deemed available as a matching contribution on the subsequent financial hardship review italics added.
next,val verde contends that the sab abused its discretion by concluding that cop proceeds are the type of funds that should be included when calculating a school district ability to make a matching contribution.
the interpretation of a statute or regulation is subject to de novo review.additionally,as we noted ante,the final responsibility for interpreting a statute or regulation rests with the court,however,judicial deference must often be accorded to the construction applied by an agency charged with the law administration and enforcement.diablo valley college faculty senate contra costa community college dist.th,d matea workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
subdivision a of the california code of regulations,title,section,provides that an analysis of a school district available funds shall include funds available from all capital facility accounts,including,but not limited to,developer fees,funds generated from capital facility certificates of participation,federal grants,redevelopment funds,sale proceeds from surplus property,the appraised value of facilities approved for replacement pursuant to section,bond funds either encumbered,unencumbered,or authorized but unsold,and savings from other sfp projects.italics added.
first,cops are included in the plain language of the regulation section,subdivision c,directs the sab to adopt regulations defining the sources of school construction financing as including funds generated by certificates of participation for facility purposes.accordingly,it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended for proceeds from cops to be included in the calculation of a school district financial capacity.
second,the california school finance authority act defines b onds or revenue bonds as bonds,notes,lease obligations,certificates of participation,commercial paper,and any other evidences of indebtedness,subd.d.because certificates of participation are included within the meaning of b onds under the california school finance authority act,and bonds are included in the types of funds to be considered,we infer that the legislature and the regulatory body intended for proceeds from cops to be considered when analyzing whether a school district has funds available for a matching contribution.
third,the list of funding sources plainly reflects that it is not limited to the sources explicitly included in the statute.accordingly,even if cops were not included in the list or considered to be b onds,they could still be considered as a source of available funds,because the list is not exclusive.
val verde asserts that cop proceeds are not meant to be included in the calculation of available funds because,unlike the other sources on the list,cop revenues are borrowed funds which must be repaid from the school district own general fund revenues in the future.emphasis altered.we do not find this argument persuasive because cops are plainly included on the list of possible sources for matching contributions.
excess of authority 
val verde contends the regulation is invalid because it is inconsistent with section hereinafter sometimes the statute,which is the enabling statute for the regulation specifically,val verde asserts that the regulation exceeds the authority granted to the sab because the regulation requires cop proceeds received after a district is granted financial hardship status be deemed available val verde contends the statute did not authorize the sab to make this requirement regarding funds received after a grant of financial hardship status.additionally,val verde contends that the statute does not authorize the sab to deem money in the district general fund to be available.we disagree.
when determining whether a regulation comes within the scope of the authority a legislative body has delegated to an administrative agency,we do not defer to the agency interpretation of the enabling statute but instead exercise our independent judgment.citation.an administrative agency may not adopt a regulation that exceeds the scope of,or is inconsistent with,the enabling statute.citations.bisno santa monica rent control board th,d.
revenue received after a grant of hardship status 
we begin by addressing val verde contention related to the sab authority to define available funds as including cop proceeds received after a grant of initial hardship status.
section,subdivision c,directs the sab to define the amount,and sources,of financing that a school district could reasonably provide for school facilities as follows unencumbered funds available in all facility accounts in the school district including,but not limited to,fees on development,redevelopment funds,sale proceeds from surplus property,funds generated by certificates of participation for facility purposes,bond funds,federal grants,and other funds available for school facilities,as the sab may determine,subd.c,italics added.
the statute grants the sab the authority to determine what funds should be considered available sources for financing,the language as the sab may determine,and does not set forth an exclusive list of funding sources that the sab must adhere to,the language including,but not limited to.accordingly,the statute granted the sab the authority to define available funds as including revenue received after a district is granted hardship status.therefore,we conclude that the sab did not act in excess of its authority when enacting the regulation.
general fund 
next,we review val verde assertion that the sab exceeded its authority by deeming money in the district general fund to be available.
section,subdivision c,directs the sab to enact a regulation that allows matching funds to be taken from facility accounts.the statute makes no reference to a school district general fund,and specifically limits any sab accounting to a school district facility accounts.
nevertheless,as we concluded ante,it is clear from the statutory scheme that the financial hardship exception was meant to assist school districts that do not have sufficient funds for constructing new schools.therefore,we can infer that it was not the intent of the legislature to limit consideration of available funds to the money deposited into a capital facility account,rather,the intent was to consider all the money designated for construction purposes,regardless of which account it was deposited into.consequently,given the intent of the legislature,we conclude that the sab did not act in excess of its authority by deeming money in the district general fund to be available.
punitive actions 
in their opening brief,val verde makes a passing reference to the sab acting in a manner contrary to law by ordering the district to repay the state however,the statement is under an argument heading about statutory interpretation,and the assertion includes little analysis.in their reply brief,val verde contends that the sab exceeded its authority by establishing and enforcing punitive measures based on unreported money in the district general fund,because the sab does not have authority over a school district general fund.in other words,val verde did not develop this argument in its opening brief.therefore,we do not address this contention because i t is not proper for an appellant to raise new points in a reply brief.board of administration wilson th,d.
amount of cop proceeds 
val verde asserts that substantial evidence does not support the finding that the district possessed million in available cop proceeds.we disagree.
subdivision a of the california code of regulations,title,section authorizes funds generated from capital facility certificates of participation to be analyzed,and if not expended or encumbered,then the funds are to be deemed available as a matching contribution.
under the substantial evidence test,courts do not reweigh the evidence.they determine whether there is any evidence or any reasonable inferences which can be deduced from the evidence,whether contradicted or uncontradicted,which,when viewed in the light most favorable to an administrative order or decision or a court judgment,will support the administrative or judicial findings of fact.administrative and judicial findings are presumed to be supported by the record and orders,decisions and judgments are presumed to be correct.persons challenging them have the burden of showing that they are not supported or correct.citations.antelope valley press poizner th,fn,d.
the report of the executive officer,which relies on data gathered from the website of the state treasurer office,reflects that the district issued cops since it was granted financial hardship status.the cops were valued at.from the,the executive officer deducted the cost of borrowing,the amounts used to retire the prior cops,and other eligible capital facility expenditures,to arrive at a total net proceeds amount of.the executive officer analysis includes a list of cops issued between and,with the cop amount,cop series type,the date of issuance,and the net proceeds.the foregoing is evidence of ponderable legal significance,reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value to prove that the district received approximately in net proceeds.
val verde asserts that the sab should not have considered the full amount of the issued cops when calculating available funds,rather,the sab should only include the cop proceeds.as explained ante,substantial evidence shows that the total amount of the issued cops was,and the total amount of the net proceeds was.the sab approved using of the district money for future construction costs.accordingly,the sab only considered the net proceeds to be available and therefore,we find val verde argument unpersuasive.
constitutional challenge 
val verde contends that the regulation and the statute are facially unconstitutional,and unconstitutional as applied we disagree.
the determination of the constitutionality of a statute and a regulation is a question of law.accordingly
