in november california voters approved proposition,which is also referred to as the smaller classes,safer schools,and financial accountability act,as approved by voters.first,and most important,proposition amended the state constitution to create an exception to the percent limit on ad valorem taxes on real property,and to reduce from to percent the number of voters required to approve any bonded indebtedness proposed to be incurred by a school district for the construction,reconstruction,rehabilitation,or replacement of school facilities.ridgecrest charter school sierra sands unified school dist.th,d cal,art.xiii a,subd.b.a local measure submitted to voters under proposition must set forth certain accountability requirements,including a list of the specific schools facilities projects to be funded,and a statement that the bond funds may be used only for those projects.cal,art.xiii a,subd.b a b.
the issue in this case is the applicable statute of limitations for a taxpayer waste action,code civ.that challenges various aspects of a school district successful local measure under which it is authorized to issue bonds for school construction.under the circumstances here,we conclude the limitations period of the validation statutes applies.accordingly,we affirm a judgment of dismissal for the school district on the ground of untimeliness.
factual and procedural background 
it is undisputed that the vista unified school district district schools and students have suffered from severe overcrowding.in march,by a vote of approximately percent,the district voters approved a measure,proposition o,which authorized it to issue and sell million in general obligation bonds to fund the construction of new schools and to repair and renovate aging schools.the district intended to issue bonds four times over a period.
the voter materials listed numerous projects,which as relevant here included two new magnet high schools located on a single site with shared ancillary and sports facilities,two new schools and two new temporary schools proposition o did not set forth a particular budget for any of the listed facilities.
as required by statute,proposition o cautioned voters that a pproval of this proposition does not guarantee that the proposed projects in the vista unified school district that are the subject of bonds under this proposition will be funded beyond the local revenues generated by this proposition.the school district proposal for the projects may assume the receipt of matching state funds,which could be subject to appropriation by the legislature or approval of a statewide bond measure.
the district formed an independent citizens bond oversight committee oversight committee,as required by statute,to oversee the expenditure of proposition o bond funds and provide reports to the public on the district compliance with the measure and proposition.
in april the district approved the use of proposition o funds for the purchase of relocatable classrooms so a program called the vista focus academy could be temporarily moved from an overcrowded school to a site the district already owned,pending the construction of new permanent schools.this work was completed and accepted in early.
ultimately,the district received approximately million in matching funds from the state,which was million less than anticipated.further,after voters approved proposition o the costs of land and construction increased more than the district reasonably could have anticipated.for instance,the cost of the new dual magnet high school site increased dramatically,the price of concrete doubled and the price of steel rose percent.additionally,the district incurred unanticipated costs to defend itself in lawsuits related to projects 
because of budgetary concerns,the district hired an experienced and respected national project management firm that specializes in the construction of school facilities.by february the consultant prepared a revised bond implementation plan,which addressed required changes in the district original plan.the district approved the revised plan,which scaled back the size of some projects,including the dual magnet high schools.further,changing demographics since the passage of proposition o and the construction of new elementary schools eliminated the need for the schools listed in proposition o,and thus the district deleted them from its original plan.
minutes from the oversight committee february,meeting show that during a discussion on proposition o funds,the district advised that the schools that will not be built are the two schools and a portable school.the district legal counsel advised the oversight committee that the list of projects in proposition o was not a guarantee that all schools on the list would be built.
at the february,meeting of the district board of trustees board,the district discussed its revised plan and explained it was necessitated primarily by increased costs of the dual magnet high schools.the district explained the magnet high school project is expected to exceed the original estimate by million.in order to still fund this project,two schools and a temporary school will be eliminated from the original plan.the minutes from the meeting state it was the oversight committee consensus that the district was doing a good job and was extremely responsive to the group.
at the board april,meeting,the district adopted a resolution of necessity for the acquisition of a site in the city of oceanside near highway and north melrose drive for the dual magnet high schools.the oversight committee urged the board to adopt the resolution.jerry mcleod attended the meeting and opposed the resolution.
the oversight committee may annual report stated during the past months,the district has witnessed certain conditions which have caused the original facilities plan to seriously exceed its budget,and under the district revised plan it would save the costs previously anticipated to build two new schools.the report explained the new plan assumes that the future district student population will decrease somewhat.a third party consultant indicates that the student population should decrease by approximately students by.consequently,the district projects that fewer schools will be required than originally anticipated.the committee did not criticize the district decision and found its use of bond funds complied with proposition o and proposition.
at an april,meeting,the board voted against a proposal to return to taxpayers,the amount budgeted for the two new schools and one of the temporary schools identified in proposition o,facilities the district eliminated from its plan.jerry mcleod attended the meeting and expressed his view that proposition o funds were to be used for a list of specific projects voted on.
the oversight committee may annual report stated the district projects to see further,but less significant savings than originally projected in february,related to not building two new schools as originally planned.the report also noted the vista focus academy was one of several projects completed.the report concluded that during the previous year the district had continued to successfully fulfill its promise to the community to construct new school facilities and to improve existing school facilities as identified in proposition although certain minor concerns,which are expressed in this report,do exist,after years in progress the district facilities construction program continues to move in a positive direction.the report did not complain about the vista focus academy,the board action at the april,meeting,or the district deletion of the schools and a temporary school from its original plan.
by the time the oversight committee issued its may annual report,mcleod was a member of the committee.he conceded he did not vote against any of the language in the report.the oversight committee may report again complimented the district on steady progress in terms of timing,and good management in terms of cost control efforts.
on may,more than months after the board voted against returning any proposition o funds to the voters,jerry mcleod sued the district for declaratory and injunctive relief the first amended complaint added ann mcleod as a plaintiff.as authority for the action,the pleading cited code of civil procedure section,which generally authorizes a taxpayer waste action,and education code section,which specifically authorizes a taxpayer school bond waste prevention action,subd.e.the pleading alleged that in february the district improperly revised its original plan by deleting the two new schools and two new temporary schools listed in proposition o,and it improperly used bond funds to construct the vista focus academy,which was not listed in proposition 
at a bench trial,the mcleods argued the district was required to adhere to the letter of proposition o by constructing each of the schools listed in the ballot materials.if there were insufficient funds to construct the facilities as originally planned,the district must ask voters for additional funds or reduce the size and quality of the facilities.alternatively,if the district eliminated any schools listed in proposition o,it must not incur any indebtedness related to them.in the mcleods view,the district may not divert funds earmarked for projects eliminated from the original plan to other projects with cost overruns,such as the dual magnet high schools.
as a preliminary matter,the court considered whether the action is barred by the statute of limitations or laches.the district argued the action was untimely because it is subject to the statute of limitations set forth in validation statutes.the mcleods stated we do think there is a statute of limitations.
the court determined the lawsuit was filed substantially beyond any reasonable time limitation and was also barred by the laches theory.judgment for the district was entered february.
discussion 
istandard of review 
the determination of the statute of limitations applicable to a cause of action is a question of law we review independently.pugliese superior court th,d kaatz city of seaside th,d.
section provides in part an action to obtain a judgment,restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of,waste of,or injury to,the estate,funds,or other property of a local agency,may be maintained against any officer thereof,or any agent,or other person,acting o n its behalf,either by a citizen resident therein,or by a corporation,who is assessed for and is liable to pay,or,within one year before the commencement of the action,has paid,a tax therein.
the purpose of section is to permit a large body of persons to challenge wasteful government action that otherwise would go unchallenged because of the standing requirement.waste management of alameda county,county of alameda th,d.the essence of a taxpayer action is an illegal or wasteful expenditure of public funds or damage to public property.it must involve an actual or threatened expenditure of public funds.general allegations,innuendo,and legal conclusions are not sufficient rather,the plaintiff must cite specific facts and reasons for a belief that some illegal expenditure or injury to the public fisc is occurring or will occur.witkin,cal.procedure supp.pleading.
the mcleods assert their action has no statute of limitations since contains no limitations period.they assert that if section nonetheless has a time limitation,under the code of civil procedure it is either three years for a liability created by statute or four years for an action for relief not hereinbefore provided.
we are persuaded,however,by the district contention that under the circumstances here,the action is subject to the statute of limitations for a validation action.the gravamen of a complaint and the nature of the right sued upon,rather than the form of the action or relief demanded,determine which statute of limitations applies.embarcadero mun.improvement dist.county of santa barbara th,d embarcadero hensler city of glendale cal th,d,see also hills for everyone local agency formation com.d.it is the nature of the governmental action being challenged rather than the basis for the challenge that determines the procedure to be utilized.
the validation statutes,sections through,authorize a public agency to bring an action to validate certain matters,but they do not specify the matters to which they apply.rather,section provides the validation procedure applies to any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to this chapter.a validating proceeding differs from a traditional action challenging a public agency decision because it is an in rem action whose effect is binding on the agency and on all other persons.millbrae school dist.superior court d.validation actions are forever binding and conclusive.
the validating statutes contain a statute of limitations to further the important public policy of speedy determination of the public agency action.embarcadero,supra,th at,d city of ontario superior court cal d,city of ontario.the validating statutes should be construed so as to uphold their purpose,the acting agency need to settle promptly all questions about the validity of its action.friedland city of long beach th,d.
if the public agency does not bring a validation action,any interested person may bring an action within the time and in the court specified by section to determine the validity of such matter.a validation action by an interested person is called a reverse validation action.kaatz city of seaside,supra,th at,fn,d.under the statutory scheme,an agency may indirectly but effectively validate its action by doing nothing to validate it unless an interested person brings an action of his own under section within the period,the agency action will become immune from attack whether it is legally valid or not.california commerce casino,schwarzenegger th,d,citing city of ontario,supra,cal d at.a s to matters which have been or which could have been adjudicated in a validation action,such matters must be raised within the statutory limitations period in section et or they are waived.friedland city of long beach,supra,th at,d no contest except by the public agency of any thing or matter under this chapter shall be made other than within the time and the manner herein specified.
a validation action under sections et,and a taxpayer action under section are not mutually exclusive.regus city of baldwin park d.rather,both actions may be brought to challenge governmental action if suit is filed within the limitations period for validation actions.ibid.in regus,the court held taxpayers had standing to pursue a taxpayer waste action under section and a reverse validation action under section for illegal diversion of municipal funds to finance a redevelopment project,as they filed the action within days of the city adoption of ordinances approving the redevelopment plan.regus,supra,at.the action was based on former health and safety code sections and,which authorized a validation action to test the validity of a redevelopment plan and related financing mechanisms and specified a limitations period regus,supra,at.
similarly,in plunkett city of lakewood d.plunkett,the court held a limitations period applied to a section action since the underlying substantive right,the alleged illegal expenditure of redevelopment funds,fell within the purview of validating statutes former health,
walters county of plumas d.walters,was a taxpayer action that arose from the county implementation of a solid waste disposal program.the third cause of action sought to set aside the county guarantee agreement to assist franchisees in financing the purchase of heavy equipment needed for implementing the program.the court held the third cause of action was barred by section statute of limitations.walters,supra,at.
the court relied on government code section now subdivision a,which authorizes a validation action by a local agency to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness.the court explained we perceive the essential difference between those actions which ought and those which ought not to come under the validation statutes to be the extent to which the lack of a prompt validating procedure will impair the public
