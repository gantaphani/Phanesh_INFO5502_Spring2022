appellants challenge the seho decision on procedural and substantive grounds.appellants claim that individual education program iep team should have included her teacher or therapist from intermountain and that this procedural violation,in and of itself,denied a free appropriate public education fape.appellants further claim that the seho and district court erred in finding that did not have a serious emotional disturbance under the criteria enumerated in c and regs.tit.i.appellants contend could not form satisfactory relationships with peers and teachers,manifested inappropriate behavior under normal circumstances,and was pervasively depressed.

background 
was born in to a mother who abused cocaine,alcohol,and heroin.in infancy,demonstrated symptoms of exposure to illegal drugs in utero including irritability,delayed visual maturation,and delayed motor skills.both of birth parents were incarcerated,a single parent and schoolteacher,adopted at eighteen months of age.mother assisted in caring for 
was molested by her natural father when she was two.afterward,she required a year of play therapy because of her and inappropriate displays of affection.a psychologist diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and began prescribing medication when she was three.other diagnoses included reactive attachment disorder and post traumatic stress disorder.
was expelled from three preschool programs because of her classroom misconduct.then placed with the district,which determined was eligible for special educational services and developed an iep program for her.transitioned into a regular kindergarten class with resource support,taught by janis sparks.
during first grade year at donaldson way elementary school,the district concluded that no longer qualified for special educational services.instead,the district found was a qualified handicapped individual under rehabilitation act and developed a behavioral intervention plan.acquiesced in these changes only after the district agreed to a neutral psychological evaluation.emily jordan conducted the evaluation and confirmed the district conclusion that was no longer a child with a disability.
elementary school history includes a series of disturbing incidents.in second grade,banged a classmate head against a computer monitor for refusing to give up the computer at recess.was suspended in third grade for throwing chairs and running off campus until law enforcement restrained her.was suspended again in fourth grade when she refused to take her adhd medication,yelled at her teacher,and was again restrained by law enforcement.
behavior reached an extreme point during the second trimester of fifth grade.she was suspended twice in the span of just over a month.first,twisted a child arm during recess and said she hoped her music teacher would die.then,poked another student with a mechanical pencil while refusing to turn in her work.at the time,was alternately refusing to take her adhd medications and receiving occasional double dosages from working with and,the district adopted a behavior management plan,which largely remedied misconduct.throughout elementary school,excelled in her classes,scored high marks on achievement tests,and frequently made the honor roll.
in the spring of,met with an educational consultant who referred to paula solomon for a psychological evaluation.without observing in the classroom,solomon recommended treatment in a residential placement program.therefore,on july,wrote to the district that had reached a crises sic point.said that she would place in a residential treatment facility within ten days and expected the district to reimburse her for the placement.
placed with intermountain.tina morrison,the intermountain staff psychologist,was therapist.morrison observed that engaged in controlling and physically aggressive behavior toward staff and fellow students,to the point that was derailed cognitively at times.teacher at intermountain was kathy brandt.took almost twice as long as the average intermountain student to transition into brandt classroom.from november to march,brandt observed intimidating other students almost daily.
on august,requested an impartial due process hearing,pursuant to f.therefore,the district arranged for its psychologist,denise struven,to travel to intermountain to conduct an evaluation.struven concluded that did not qualify for special education benefits under the idea.
on january,the following individuals met as part of the district iep team laura miller,a special education teacher and director of special education for the district sparks,then a principal of donaldson way elementary struven and donna poninski,district psychologists sally dutcher,attorney for the district jane reid,for appellants and no one from intermountain attended,although struven reported her observations of there.the iep team concluded was not eligible for special education benefits.

on january,filed a complaint for violation of the idea in the northern district of california.the district court granted the district motion for summary judgment,and denied appellants.after independently reviewing the record and giving due deference to the seho,the district court agreed that did not have a serious emotional disturbance under the idea and that any procedural violation did not result in a lost educational opportunity.appellants timely appealed on july.

one of the idea procedural requirements is the creation of an iep team to determine a child eligibility for idea benefits.b a,c.prior to the amendments,the iep team required the presence of the teacher.a.by contrast,under the amended statute and implementing regulations,the iep team must include at least one regular education teacher of such child if the child is,or may be,participating in the regular education environment and at least one special education teacher,or where appropriate,at least one special education provider of such child.d b ii iii a cal.b.appellants claim the district iep team failed on both counts by including sparks,who taught in kindergarten six years before the iep meeting,and by not including brandt,special education teacher at intermountain.
whether sparks participation on the iep team was a procedural violation requires us to interpret the phrase at least one regular education teacher of such child.d b ii a.although appellants acknowledge the statutory amendments in a footnote,they seek to minimize the significance of those amendments by relying on cases that interpreted the prior version of the statute to require the participation of the student current teacher on the iep team.shapiro ex rel.shapiro paradise valley unified sch.dist,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,individuals with disabilities education act amendments of,d b,stat.target range,at.by using shapiro and target range to assert that our law requires the presence of a child private school teacher at an iep meeting,appellants are essentially asking us to conclude that the statutory amendments had no effect.did not resolve this issue because the iep team there included no regular education teacher,although dicta in two of the opinions take a position at odds with appellants argument 
we conclude that,after the amendments,the idea no longer requires the presence of the child current regular education teacher on the iep team.the phrase at least one regular education teacher of such child gives a school district more discretion in selecting the regular education teacher than the phrase the teacher.as the shapiro court explained in its interpretation of the idea,the teacher was congress way of requiring more than simply a teacher on the iep team.at.allowing a teacher to assume the role set aside for the teacher interpreted the statute too broadly.id.this case is simply shapiro in reverse.if congress had wanted the child current regular education teacher on the iep team,congress would have used more specific language than at least one regular education teacher of such child.indeed,the phrase at least one contemplates that the iep team will include regular education teachers other than the child current teacher.requiring the current regular education teacher to assume the role set aside for at least one regular education teacher would interpret the statute too narrowly.
like the shapiro court,we find support for our construction in the authorities of the office of special education programs osep.see at referencing a footnote in an osep regulation to show that the child current teacher must participate on the iep team.osep notice of interpretation explains,t he regular education teacher who serves as a member of a child iep team should be a teacher who is,or may be,responsible for implementing a portion of the iep,so that the teacher can participate in discussions about how best to teach the child.pt.app.this interpretation imposes no stringent requirement that the child current regular education teacher attend the iep meeting.an agency interpretation of its own regulations carries controlling weight unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or is inconsistent with the regulations themselves.stinson united states,d ass of home builders norton,cir.because the agency failure to require the participation of the current regular education teacher is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation,we do not impose such a requirement 
whether the district failure to include brandt on the iep team was a procedural violation requires us to interpret the phrase at least one special education teacher or,where appropriate,at least one special education provider of such child.d b iii a.like the companion provision on the regular education teacher discussed supra,we interpret this provision not to require the participation of the child current special education teacher.therefore,brandt exclusion from the iep team was not a procedural violation per se.
this is not the end of the argument,however,for nothing in the record establishes that miller,the special education teacher on the iep team,ever taught.we conclude that miller participation did not satisfy the idea because we interpret the statute and regulation to require a special education teacher who has actually taught the student.although this requirement would be even clearer if the phrase of such child also appeared immediately after special education teacher and not merely after special education provider,we think the statute and regulation are clear enough as written.furthermore,the osep notice of interpretation states,t he requirements of the regulation can be met by either a special education teacher of the child or another special education provider of the child.pt.app.osep interpretation of the regulation to require a special education teacher of the child is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation itself.see stinson,at.norton,at.although the district did not have to include brandt,it did not satisfy its legal obligations by including miller.therefore,the district failure to include a special education teacher or provider on the iep team who actually taught was a procedural violation of the idea.we now address the question of whether that violation resulted in a loss of educational opportunity for,or was instead harmless error.
we recognize that we have,more often than not,held that an idea procedural violation denied the child a fape.compare,at gould,concurring,shapiro,at,amanda,at,and target range,at all finding that the child was denied a fape with park,at,and ford,at both finding no denial of fape.all of these cases except ford,however,concern students who were eligible under the idea and alleged that the procedural violations resulted in some defect in their iep.in,for example,the iep team improperly excluded a regular education teacher and provided the student with an iep that had few opportunities for mainstreaming,interaction with students.at alarcon.judge gould concurrence emphasized the statutory preference for mainstreaming and cited evidence from past school years to show that the student could be placed in regular education classrooms with students.id.at.the procedural violation resulted in a lost educational opportunity,and thus denied the student a fape,because a properly constituted iep team would likely have given greater consideration to mainstreaming and provided the student an iep with more mainstreaming opportunities.id.at.
in shapiro,the failure to include the child current special education teacher from her private school under the idea resulted in a loss of educational opportunity because the private school was the only place where the child had received special education.at.without a representative from the private school at the iep meeting,the school district refused to continue placing the student with the private school and instead offered placement in its own program.id.at.the school district program was far inferior because,at the time of the iep meeting,the district had not hired a teacher,the program might not continue past the upcoming school year,and the student would be the first and only enrollee.id.at.the loss of educational opportunity was similar in target range,where,in the absence of the regular education teacher from the child private school,the school district proposed a preexisting,predetermined iep and refused to consider alternatives.at.see also amanda,at failure to disclose student records,including documents that suggested the possibility of autism,denied child a fape by preventing parents full participation in the iep meeting.
in these cases involving flaws in the iep,the child has already jumped through a significant hoop by establishing idea eligibility.once the child qualifies for special education services,the district must then develop a n iep which addresses the unique needs of the child.amanda,at.if the iep team is improperly constituted,the reviewing court is to know what the iep would look like if the school district had included all the required participants on the iep team.nor can the court substitute its judgment for educational policymakers by determining what kind of iep will best suit the disabled child needs.a properly constituted iep team is in the best position to develop an iep that suits the peculiar needs of the individual student.see rowley,at.explaining that procedural compliance would almost always achieve what congress intended with respect to the substantive iep provisions.
like this case,ford presented a different,more preliminary question whether the student qualified for idea benefits in the first instance.in ford,the district assessed the student and found that she was not.at.the student claimed the assessment violated an osep regulation because it did not include classroom observation by someone other than her current regular education teacher.id.at.we held that the procedural violation did not result in a lost educational opportunity for the student because three of the student former teachers testified at the administrative hearing.id.at.in effect,the hearing cured the procedural violation by including those viewpoints which should have been considered when the iep team met.
similarly,in this case,the administrative hearing cured the procedural error in the composition of the iep team.if the iep team had included brandt or morrison,the district would have satisfied the requirement that a special education teacher or provider of the child be included.although iep team lacked such a person,brandt and morrison both testified at length during the hearing.to the extent that brandt and morrison believed should be,they were able to say why.the seho,district court,and now this court all have the benefit of their testimony in determining whether the district correctly concluded that was ineligible for special education services.we then apply the law of idea eligibility to the facts including the new facts that brandt and morrison presented for the first time to the seho.in so doing,we apply the same eligibility criteria to all cases and are,therefore,better situated to find an error harmless than in the context of whether an iep satisfies the unique needs of a child with particular disabilities.
a procedural violation does not constitute a denial of a fape if the violation fails to result in a loss of educational opportunity,at gould,concurring target range,at.a child ineligible for idea opportunities in the first instance can not lose those opportunities merely because a procedural violation takes place.nack ex rel.nack orange city sch,cir procedural violation denies a fape only if such violation causes substantive harm to the child or his parents internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in other words,a procedural violation can not qualify an otherwise ineligible student for idea relief.therefore,the omission of a special education teacher or provider from iep team is harmless if is ineligible for idea benefits.because we affirm the district court acceptance of the seho determination that does not qualify for idea relief,we hold that the district procedural violation in the composition of iep team is harmless error.
substantive eligibility 
deference to the seho decision 
before we reach the merits of idea eligibility,we must address appellants arguments concerning the degree of deference we should give to the seho underlying decision.appellants argue for no deference because they claim the seho omitted or distorted certain pieces of evidence.the district argues for the particular deference that we accord to thorough and careful findings.see smith,at.
we treat a hearing officer findings as thorough and careful when the officer participates in the questioning of witnesses and writes a decision contain ing a complete factual background as well as a discrete analysis supporting the ultimate conclusions.see park,at.those criteria were satisfied here,as the seho asked questions of many witnesses,included several pages of factual background in the decision,and discretely analyzed all the issues presented for each of the two academic years in question.to this extent,the seho findings deserve particular deference.
therefore,we can summarily dismiss most of appellants objections as impermissible attempts to the seho characterization and weighing of the evidence.we find no reason for according less deference to the seho decision because she described misconduct as episodic or labeled the transition to intermountain a difficult adjustment period.nor do we quibble with the seho citation to achievement test scores as evidence that performed at or above grade level even though achievement test scores were even higher or the failure to compare grades at donaldson way elementary to her grades at intermountain we reject appellants assertion that the seho distorted the testimony of joanna gardner,the mother of one of friends the seho conclusions that spent time with and participated in extracurricular activities with gardner daughter were properly drawn from gardner testimony.we also refuse to question the seho reliance on the struven report,which included observations of in the classroom,rather than the solomon report,which did not.the seho weighing of the evidence was consistent with the requirement that the iep team review c urrent assessments and observations and o bservations by teachers and related service providers.a ii iii.
we are concerned,however,by the seho failure to make any reference in her decision to the testimony of brandt or morrison.the absence of discussion is particularly disturbing because the omission of special education teacher provider from the iep team was the procedural violation in this case.the testimony of brandt and morrison at the due process hearing helped cure the procedural violation,but the seho decision failure to cite any of their testimony conveys the impression that the seho did not thoroughly and carefully consider their viewpoints.the district court decision is better to support its conclusion that did not meet the criteria for idea eligibility at intermountain,it cites morrison testimony that behavior eventually improved during her year there.again,however,the district court did not discuss brandt testimony,other than mentioning in passing that plaintiffs relied on it.
therefore,in our review of the seho decision,we accord particular deference to the seho thorough and careful findings,except to the extent they do not discuss brandt and morrison testimony.in other words,we accord deference to the seho finding that was ineligible for idea relief in both school years,although we independently review the testimony in the record that the seho failed to consider.katherine ex rel.cynthia kentfield sch,d,deferr
