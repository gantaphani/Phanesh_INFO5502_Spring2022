a disabled student,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the new prague school district on his claim under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,section of the rehabilitation act,and.we affirm the district court on his idea claim remand his section claim and find his claim to be without merit,and therefore do not address it here.
background 
we review the facts of the case in a light most favorable to the appellant.is a student who is schizophrenic.he lives with his parents in new prague,minnesota,within the boundaries of the new prague school district.he attended school in that district until the beginning of the school year,when his parents enrolled him in a public school in the northfield school district through open enrollment.parents removed him from the new prague school district because they believed it failed to enforce his rights as a disabled person,and because faced increased verbal and physical assaults and discrimination after the district health paraprofessional,arlene pexa,disclosed schizophrenia to the school community.
during year,his family informed school administrators of his diagnosis.the district initiated a team meeting in february and developed a section accommodation plan,pursuant to the rehabilitation act of,under which teachers were asked to monitor him for anxiety,hypervigilence,and anger management problems.as modifications,was placed with other students with comparable abilities,given permission to meet with the school counselor or social worker when needed,and to access the school nurse as needed.as the section plan was being implemented,the district proposed evaluating for special education services.his parents consented to this course of action.during the course of the assessment,over a period of weeks,began taking medication for his schizophrenia,and there was noticeable improvement in his behavior.the assessment team decided that even though met the state eligibility criteria for disorder,special education services were unnecessary.the parents agreed with the assessment team that an individualized educational program iep was not necessary for 
the team amended the section plan in february,and again in august to reflect changing needs as a result of his positive response to his new medications.was provided with extra time to complete tests and access to a learning lab class,and it was determined that the school social worker,katie hennessy,would monitor progress and maintain contact with his parents.
on january,the day that pexa disclosed condition,mother,reported pexa disclosure to hennessy,who did not investigate the complaint rather,she took a approach to her concern.within a short period of time,medical information became common knowledge within the student body,and was verbally and physically harassed by other students.did not tell his parents he suffered from harassment until april.
once parents were aware of the abuse,his mother contacted hennessy and connie nicholson,the school principal,about the harassment.and nicholson spoke on the phone two to three times a week so that could report the harassment that endured.was called druggie,fag,psycho,weirdo,mental kid,special,squealer,and idiot,among other names.students also shoved head into the drinking fountain,picked him up by his throat,slammed him into lockers,threw him to the floor,shoved,scratched,spit on,and cut him.never had experienced this treatment by classmates before pexa disclosure of his medical information.
no investigation or corrective actions were undertaken during the remainder of the school year to reduce the harassment.during the summer,was subjected to the same provocations by his peers.his mother made calls to the district throughout the summer to provide additional information to school administrators about the harassment,to express her concern for her son safety upon his return to school,and to seek solutions for the upcoming year.because the district did not return her calls,sent it a letter from treating psychiatrist,lea hogan,to clarify stress about his relations with his peers.on august,met with district administrators,who offered three solutions to remedy what perceived to be an intolerable situation,all of which were unacceptable to could arrive late and leave early from his classes could attend school half a day and be the other half of the day or could attend an alternative learning center that catered to students with disorders within the district.discussed the possibility of enrolling in the northfield school district with principal nicholson,who suggested that the new prague school district would be able to pay transportation costs to the northfield high school.decided to enroll in the northfield school district for the school year,and drove to and from school because the new prague school district refused to assist with his transportation costs because he was enrolled in a different jurisdiction.
pursuant to the idea,parents filed a request for an administrative hearing on november,before the minnesota department of children,families and learning for violations of rights as a disabled student in the new prague school district.the district requested and received summary judgment because the independent hearing officer and the hearing review officer agreed that the responsibility for providing with appropriate educational services rested with his current school district,not the new prague school district.
parents filed an action in district court against the district and pexa,alleging that defendants discriminated against on the basis of his mental handicap in the education environment in violation of idea section of the rehabilitation act the minnesota human rights act mhra section the minnesota government data practices act mgdpa and the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa.the district court granted summary judgment in the defendants favor because idea claim was moot since he was no longer enrolled in the new prague school district he failed to show the defendants acted with the requisite discriminatory intent to adequately state a claim under section and the mhra he failed to establish the existence of a continuing,widespread,persistent pattern of unconstitutional misconduct under there was no connection between pexa disclosure and alleged damages to raise a valid claim under the mgdpa and no private right of action exists under ferpa.appeals his claims related to idea,section,and.
