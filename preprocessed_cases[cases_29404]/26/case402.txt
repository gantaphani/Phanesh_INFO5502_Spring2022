in this action arising under the individuals with disabilities education act the idea,to,jh,a minor child,and his parents,jd and ss seek from the henrico county school board the county as reimbursement for the costs associated with the provision of and occupational therapy services to jh during the summer of the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county.jh,jd,and ss collectively the plaintiffs noted this timely appeal.
for reasons that follow,we vacate the judgment entered by the district court in favor of the county and remand the case to the district court with instructions that the district court remand the case to the administrative hearing officer for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
in order to put the facts of this case in their proper perspective,we will first set forth the relevant statutory and regulatory background.
in general,the idea requires all states which receive federal funds for education to provide each child between the ages of three and,who has a disability,with a free appropriate public education fape.a a.congress enacted the idea,in part,to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living.d a.notably,however,although the idea requires that s tates must provide specialized instruction and related services sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child,it does not require the furnishing of every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child potential.hartmann loudoun county bd.of,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the idea requires a school district to provide an appropriate individual educational program iep for each disabled child.mm school dist.of greenville,cir.an appropriate iep must contain statements concerning a disabled child level of functioning,set forth measurable annual achievement goals,describe the services to be provided,and establish objective criteria for evaluating the child progress.id.every iep must be prepared by an iep team,which consists of a representative of the school district,the child teacher,the child parents or guardian and,where appropriate,the child himself.d b.
with this statutory and regulatory background in mind,we turn to the facts of the present case.there is no dispute that jh,who was born on may,suffers from a high functioning form of autism which qualifies as a disability under the idea.at all times relevant to this case,jh attended dumbarton elementary school,a school operated by the county.
in may,the county classified jh as eligible for special education services under the idea.during the summer of,the summer immediately preceding jh starting kindergarten,jh received esy services from the county consisting of a total of twelve hours of therapy and eight hours of occupational therapy.
beginning in the fall of,jh attended kindergarten with nondisabled children in a regular classroom at dumbarton elementary school under an iep for the school year the kindergarten iep the kindergarten iep set goals for jh to master by the end of his regular kindergarten school year.in order to meet these goals,the kindergarten iep provided jh six hours per day of service by an instructional assistant in addition to two hours of therapy per week and two hours of occupational therapy per week.
nancy smith smith,a pathologist with years experience,provided jh his therapy,while carolyn stone stone,an occupational therapist with years experience,provided jh his occupational therapy stone had also provided occupational therapy services to jh during the school year.during jh regular kindergarten school year,smith and stone each saw jh at least three times per week and talked regularly with his classroom teacher,howard everette everette,and the instructional assistant assigned to jh.
at the time,helen mcgrath mcgrath served as dumbarton elementary school special education teacher.although mcgrath did not actually teach jh,per the kindergarten iep,she did provide everette and the instructional assistant assigned to jh with one hour each week of consulting services regarding jh.
various testing at the end of jh regular kindergarten school year revealed that he had made substantial progress in some areas,but remained weak in others.in june,jh took the henrico county assessment test,scoring in math,in science,in social studies,and in language arts.other assessment tests conducted at the end of jh regular kindergarten school year revealed that he had mastered three of the goals in the kindergarten iep,and had made progress on all but two.jh had mastered the goals of discriminating between nasal and speech with accuracy,marking final consonants with accuracy in conversation,and using the mouse and keyboard on a computer consistent with the skill level of his classmates.of specific relevance in the present appeal,although jh had improved his skills with respect to using language appropriately in social situations,referred to as social pragmatics,he remained seriously behind his peers in that area.the two goals upon which jh had made absolutely no progress were using contingent statements i like the beach too.i found shells.we go swimming.to maintain conversations for five turns in four out of five opportunities,and maintaining the same topic for five turns with no more than one verbal prompt in four out of five opportunities.
because the kindergarten iep did not provide that jh would receive esy services during the summer of,jd and ss requested an iep team meeting in order to request that the county provide jh with such services.the meeting took place on may.jd and ss took the position that not only should the county provide jh with esy services for the summer of,but that it should do so at the same level as provided in the kindergarten iep.the county agreed that jh needed esy services during the summer of,but disagreed with jd and ss regarding the appropriate type and amount of such services.the county endorsed a peer modeling approach suggested by smith and stone in which jh would interact with his peers in order to improve his social language and fine motor skills.based on smith and stone experience with jh during the regular kindergarten school year,they believed that jh had difficulty generalizing social language skills taught in individual therapy sessions to other settings such as the classroom,playground,and home.therefore,rather than focusing on services,smith and stone believed that jh would best be served by receiving esy services focused on improving jh peer communication skills.
on june,the county members of the iep team issued a final proposed iep for jh for the summer of the summer iep.the summer iep provided that while attending the regular ten week summer school session at dumbarton elementary school,jh would receive special education services four hours per day from july through august and ten hours per week from august through september special education consultation for thirty minutes per week for the entire summer assistance from an instructional assistant twelve hours per week from june through june,sixteen hours per week from july through august,and fifteen hours per week from august through august individual therapy conducted in four sessions over the course of the summer and individual occupational therapy conducted in five sessions over the course of the summer.
jd and ss objected to the summer iep on the ground that it provided jh inadequate amounts of individual and occupational therapy.jd and ss wanted such therapies to continue at the same level as provided in the kindergarten iep.under the kindergarten iep,jh had received two hours of individual therapy per week and two hours of individual occupational therapy per week.
following an unsuccessful attempt at mediation,a due process hearing before an administrative hearing officer the hearing officer was held on july.meanwhile,at the plaintiffs expense,jh received private and occupational therapy during the summer of at the same level as provided in the kindergarten iep.
before the hearing officer,the county contended that the only purpose of esy services is to maintain the progress that a disabled child had already made during the regular school year.the county also contended that the services provided in the summer iep would meet this goal and offered expert testimony and other evidence in support of this contention.
the plaintiffs,in contrast,contended that in addition to maintaining the progress that a disabled child had already made during the regular school year,esy services should also be provided in order to help a disabled child master goals in the iep for the regular school year that had gone unmet.the plaintiffs also maintained that,in the case of autistic children,the maximum amount of esy services should be provided in order to take advantage of the limited window of opportunity for when such children are most able to effectively overcome deficits due to autism.in this regard,the plaintiffs relied on the expert testimony before the hearing officer of ronald david,david,an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the medical college of virginia.according to david,jh has a window of opportunity for when he can most effectively learn to overcome his deficits due to autism,which window will close at age eight or nine.in the opinion of david,after age eight or nine,jh will have a far more difficult time learning the skills that he needs to function in life.
the plaintiffs also relied on the expert testimony before the hearing officer of donald oswald,oswald,a licensed clinical psychologist who works exclusively with autistic children and adults.according to oswald,using the summer months merely to maintain the and sensory motor skills that an autistic child has already gained as opposed to using such time to actively foster continued development of such skills,will limit the child ability to participate and benefit from a regular classroom setting and limit the extent to which he will be able to compensate for the functional limitations of autism.
the hearing officer issued his decision on august.based upon all of the evidence before him,the hearing officer found that jh needs the esy with the same level of instruction in and ot that he received in kindergarten which is two hours of each,each week four hours total.the hearing officer agreed with the plaintiffs that just maintaining the skills that jh had learned in kindergarten was not appropriate in light of jh disability which left him with only a one or two year window of opportunity before his learning patterns changed.according to the hearing officer,the purpose of esy services is to make reasonable progress on unmet goals rather than simply maintaining gains already made.id.however,the hearing officer rejected the plaintiffs position that the purpose of esy services is to master unmet goals of the iep for the regular school year.as relief,the hearing officer ordered that the summer iep be amended to provide jh with two hours of therapy per week and two hours of occupational therapy per week.finally,the hearing officer ordered that the stated goal of the summer iep should be amended from maintaining to making reasonable progress.the hearing officer did not address the issue of reimbursement for the expenses that jd and ss had already incurred in providing private and occupational therapy to jh during the summer of at the same level as the kindergarten iep.
on august,the plaintiffs filed the present action pursuant to i,seeking review of the hearing officer decision.the plaintiffs claimed that the hearing officer erred in failing to order that they be reimbursed for the therapy and occupational therapy services that jh received during the summer of at the same level as the kindergarten iep.the plaintiffs also alleged that the hearing officer erred by refusing to order that the summer iep state as its overall goal that jh master goals unmet under the kindergarten iep.the county filed an answer and counterclaim,which counterclaim sought to reverse the hearing officer decision regarding the level of and occupational therapy services.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for the county on the county counterclaim,holding that the summer iep was reasonably calculated to provide jh with educational benefit,and the proper goal for the summer iep was to make reasonable progress on,rather than master,the stated goals.
the plaintiffs noted the present appeal.significantly,on september,just three weeks after the completion of the briefing schedule in this case,we issued mm school district of greenville county,cir.in mm,we first announced a formal standard for determining when esy services are appropriate under the idea esy services are only necessary to a fape when the benefits a disabled child gains during a regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is not provided with an educational program during the summer months.id.at.in mm,we carefully emphasized that,under this standard,the mere fact of likely regression is not a sufficient basis,because all students,disabled or not,may regress to some extent during lengthy breaks from school.id.
prior to oral argument,we granted the parties leave to address,in writing,the impact of mm on the issues in the present appeal.we have that additional briefing before us for consideration.
in mm,we set forth our standard of review with respect to a district court decision to grant a motion for summary judgment in an idea case 
in a judicial proceeding under the idea,a reviewing court is obliged to conduct a modified de novo review,giving due weight to the underlying administrative proceedings.in such a situation,findings of fact made in administrative proceedings are considered to be prima facie correct,and if a reviewing court fails to adhere to them,it is obliged to explain why.the court is not,however,to substitute its own notions of sound educational policy for those of local school authorities 
whether a district court has accorded the proper due weight to the administrative proceedings is a question of at least a mixed question of law and be reviewed de novo by an appellate court.in our review,we need not defer to factual recitations made by a district court from the administrative record,because that court stands in no better position than do we in reviewing the record.in conducting our review in an idea proceeding,we therefore must examine the entire record,and we must afford due weight to the administrative determinations,applying the standard of review utilized by the district court.however,where a district court has heard and considered additional evidence,we review its findings of fact for clear error.
id.at some internal quotation marks omitted citations omitted alteration in original.we further reiterated in mm that t he courts should,to the extent possible,defer to the considered rulings of the administrative officers,who also must give appropriate deference to the decisions of professional educators.id.at.
the plaintiffs primarily challenge the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the county on the basis that the district court erred by not giving appropriate deference to the hearing officer findings.relatedly,the plaintiffs argue that the reasonable progress standard used by the hearing officer and the district court required that jh receive the same level of and occupational therapy services during the summer of as he had received under the kindergarten iep.
the county essentially takes the position that this case must be analyzed under the mm standard for esy services,and under such standard,the evidence shows that the summer iep provided jh a fape.
prior to our decision in mm,the fourth circuit had not developed a standard for determining when esy services are appropriate under the idea.id.at.following mm,fourth circuit precedent is clear that esy services are only necessary to a fape when the benefits a disabled child gains during a regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is not provided with an educational program during the summer months.id.at.
