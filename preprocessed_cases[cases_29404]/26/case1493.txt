facts and procedural history 
dylan was born in to allison,and was her only child.dylan began to have emotional problems in the third grade when he moved from bakersfield to crestline,california,after the breakup of allison marriage to his stepfather.as early as dylan was hospitalized for a week at a local behavioral medicine center due to his behavior.after a brief time out of state,allison and dylan moved to redlands,california.dylan attended school in redlands for less than two months before being raped at knifepoint by a boy and subsequently moving to bakersfield to live with his for six months.allison visited him at least monthly and spoke to him on the phone nightly.upon his return,dylan was enrolled in school in loma linda,near allison employment.
very shortly thereafter,it was determined that dylan required special education services for his condition,including his prior attempts at suicide and his reaction to the fact that he had been raped.at some time in,dylan was diagnosed as bipolar manic depressive by his psychiatrist,a condition that was aggravated by post traumatic stress disorder,from which he also suffered after the rape.
dylan first placement at a nonpublic school was from june,to january.because dylan behaviors were out of control,he required a more supervised environment,and he was moved to a residential nonpublic school,where he attended from february,to august.while he was there allison visited him twice per month and spoke to him nightly.dylan made progress at the residential nonpublic school and allison wanted him to come back home,so his individualized education program team decided that he would be released from that facility,despite some continued and inappropriate behaviors.
pursuant to a contract between aes and the east valley special education local planning agency,dylan was placed at a nonpublic school owned by aes for days of instruction plus transportation between home and school each day.dylan actually began attending that school in september.
aes is a corporation created to educate special needs children on different campuses throughout california.the students at the facility dylan attended were primarily those with and learning disabilities.dylan school employed two teachers,plus two classroom aides and a program manager as well as a therapist,and an office manager.
prior to accepting dylan as a student,the aes school was provided with documentation regarding his history and therefore was aware of his diagnoses and behavioral issues,including his prior suicide attempts and his tendency to be absent without leave awol from school campuses,and was aware that he was being transferred from a residential facility.upon his enrollment,dylan was provided with a school policy statement indicating that he had a right to be safe.dylan was also provided with a list of school rules indicating that he would be supervised by a staff member at all times.these documents were signed by both dylan and allison.
after leaving the residential facility and while at the aes school,dylan behavior started to decline.several incident reports were made regarding dylan behavior while at the aes school,including fights with other students,putting a tack through his ear,intentionally cutting his thumb,carrying a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the bus,taking apart a fence,and giving a fellow student poison to drink.however,during his time at the aes school,dylan did not express any suicidal thoughts.
shortly after beginning classes at the aes school,dylan went awol twice on the same day.the first time he left campus and panhandled,then went to a feed store and bought a baby chicken before returning to school.the second time,he refused to leave the chick behind so that he could be transported home no live animals were allowed on the bus and therefore walked off on his own after school.allison was informed of these awol incidents.four days later there was a meeting among school staff,dylan and allison regarding his behavior and to discuss strategies to keep him from leaving campus.at this meeting the staff explained the aes school policy regarding awol students to allison,though she could not remember whether,and later denied that,this occurred.staff would shadow the student on campus to attempt to persuade the student to remain and to determine the student direction of travel.physical restraint was not permitted unless the student posed an immediate threat of danger to himself or others,thus,a student normally could not be forcibly kept on campus.the parent would be notified of the awol and given the option of allowing the school to contact the authorities,or if the parent could not be reached in a timely fashion,the police would be notified of the awol.there was conflicting testimony whether awol students would be followed off campus.in certain situations where a student or parent makes a request,or if a student is highly agitated,the school may retrieve the student from the community.
one morning,after this meeting,dylan used a needle and thread to sew his fingers together through the skin at their tips and reported to staff that he had not taken his medication before coming to school.the thread was removed and he calmly turned the needle over to his teacher.allison was not contacted about this incident or dylan claim not to have taken his medication.approximately one hour later dylan left the campus with another student,despite staff attempts to persuade him to return to class.dylan did not appear agitated and no attempt was made to physically restrain him.allison was called eight minutes after dylan went awol.two hours later,and after several phone calls to the school,she reported him missing to the police.
dylan was missing for three days during which time he was sexually assaulted by an adult male who subsequently pled guilty to the assault.he never returned to the aes school as a student.dylan returned to the first nonpublic school that he had attended in december.his behaviors continued there.some three months later,allison dropped dylan off with his grandparents who were to watch him while she went to work.after dinner dylan went into his grandparents bedroom,took a rifle from under the bed and shot himself.
on july,allison filed her complaint against aes,in which she pled a cause of action for general negligence resulting in dylan death and injury to herself in the form of emotional distress.she claimed that aes negligently allowed dylan to leave campus,resulting in his being sexually assaulted,which caused him to take his own life.on april,the case went to trial on theories of wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress.as to the wrongful death,the jury returned a verdict finding that aes breach of a duty of care to dylan was a substantial factor in bringing about dylan death.it found that both allison and dylan were negligent,but their negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about dylan death.it fixed the amount of damages at and apportioned fault,percent to aes,percent to allison,percent to dylan,and percent to others.as to the emotional distress,the jury returned a verdict finding that aes breach of a duty of care to allison was a substantial factor in bringing about her injury.it found that allison was not negligent,but dylan was,though his negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about allison injury.it fixed the amount of damages at and apportioned fault,percent to aes,percent to dylan,and percent to others.judgment was entered in favor of allison and against aes in the amount of,plus costs.
aes then filed its notice of intention to move for a new trial on the grounds of jury misconduct,excessive damages,and the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict,which was against law,among others.it also filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the grounds that a finding of fault against dylan precluded a finding of liability against aes,that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding either that aes breached any duty owed to dylan or that aes actions caused dylan to commit suicide,and that aes owed no duty to allison as a matter of law.thereafter,an amended judgment was filed adding an award of costs to allison in the amount of.then,after a hearing,the trial court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,but granted the motion for a new trial on the grounds of juror misconduct and excessive damages.these appeals followed.
discussion 
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
we will first address aes of the trial court denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.in determining whether to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,a trial court must accept the evidence supporting the verdict as true disregard all conflicting evidence and indulge in every legitimate inference that may be drawn in support of the judgment.the court may grant the motion only if there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict and the evidence compels a judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.on appeal from the denial of such a motion,we determine de novo whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supporting the verdict and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.sweatman department of veterans affairs cal th,d,paykar construction,spilat construction th,d tognazzini san luis coastal unified school dist.th,d.
aes raised four grounds in support of its motion the jury finding that dylan was at fault for his own death precluded a finding of liability against aes aes did not breach any duty that it owed to dylan there was no evidence that any alleged negligence on the part of aes caused dylan death and allison failed to demonstrate that aes was liable to her for negligent infliction of emotional distress due to the absence of a duty to her and the lack of evidence of damages we will consider them in seriatim fashion.
dylan fault for his own death 
aes first claims that the jury finding that dylan was percent at fault for his own death precludes a finding that it was liable according to the holding in tate canonica d.that court concluded that where the negligent wrong only causes a mental condition in which the injured person is able to realize the nature of the act of suicide and has the power to control it if he so desires,the act then becomes an independent intervening force and the wrongdoer can not be held liable for the death.on the other hand,if the negligent wrong causes mental illness which results in an uncontrollable impulse to commit suicide,then the wrongdoer may be held liable for the death if defendant is to avoid liability,the decedent act must be voluntary,in the sense that he could,in spite of his mental illness,have decided against suicide and refrained from killing himself.id.at.see also grant lathrop constr.d.in other words,for a negligent actor to be responsible for the suicide of another,the suicide must have resulted from an involuntary act resulting from a mental state caused by the negligence.
aes argues that the jury finding that dylan was percent at fault for his own death necessarily implies a finding that he was not under an uncontrollable impulse,but had control over the act of suicide.we disagree.the jury finding could have resulted from a determination that dylan was at fault during any part of the causal chain,for example,his choice to leave campus,or his choice to accompany his acquaintance to the home of the man who assaulted him.it is therefore possible that dylan could have been found in some fashion responsible for his own death without necessarily concluding that he did not suffer from an uncontrollable impulse to take his life at the time of the suicide.aes was not entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this ground.
aes further argues that demonstrating that dylan was suffering from an uncontrollable impulse to commit suicide,such that he could not have chosen against the act,was allison burden as an element of her cause of action for wrongful death the jury was so instructed and that she failed to produce any evidence that would support such a finding by the jury.on the contrary,allison expert,michael weiss,testified that at the time dylan committed suicide he did not have the ability to control the impulse to kill himself.he also testified that this impulse resulted from his reaction to the rape of november.even were we to accept aes assertion with respect to allison burden of proof as true,a question we do not decide,if credited by the jury,this evidence would have been sufficient to carry allison burden of proof on this issue.
aes breach of a duty owed to dylan 
next,aes asserts that it did not breach any duty that allison alleged it had to dylan because it could not use physical force to restrain him to prevent him from leaving campus.in her complaint,she alleges that aes had a duty to maintain custody and control of dylan,which included not allowing him to leave campus without permission,and also required prompt notification to the authorities when he had done so.education code section prohibits the use of corporal punishment,or procedures that cause pain or trauma,as methods to eliminate maladaptive behaviors in special needs children.education code section exempts from the definition of corporal punishment instances where a reasonable amount of force is necessary to prevent physical injury to persons or damage to property,for,or to divest a pupil of dangerous objects.further,california code of regulations,title,section provides that an emergency intervention one that has not been established in a behavioral intervention plan for a particular pupil may only be used to control unpredictable,spontaneous behavior which poses clear and present danger of serious physical harm to the individual or others and which can not be immediately prevented by a response less restrictive than the temporary application of a technique used to contain the behavior,subd.i.consequently,aes claims,it could not have used any physical force to prevent dylan from leaving campus unless he posed a clear and present danger of serious physical harm to himself or others.
aes asserts that the evidence did not support a conclusion that dylan posed such a danger at the time that he left the campus.therefore,it concludes,it did not breach any duty in failing to physically restrain him from leaving campus and was not responsible for failing to follow him after he left the campus aes cites no authority for this latter proposition.this argument presupposes that the only method by which aes could have kept dylan from leaving campus was through physical restraint.however,the evidence in the record supports a conclusion that the aes school staff merely called to dylan to return to class,and did not actually follow him to the edge of campus or otherwise try to convince him to stay.the evidence also supports a conclusion that based upon his behaviors in the morning,dylan should have immediately been referred to his therapist for a crisis intervention.based on the foregoing,the jury could have concluded that had the aes school staff properly discharged its duty and done more,dylan would have remained on campus without physical restraint,making the point irrelevant.aes argument also presupposes that the only method by which it could have discharged its duty to dylan would have been to prevent him from leaving campus.however,the testimony suggested that dylan could have been shadowed by a staff member once he left campus,or that the police should have been called since dylan companion was a resident of a group home.aes has not cited to any evidence or law indicating that its duty to dylan did not extend to taking these measures to ensure his safety.indeed,the testimony was that such actions were either the school policy or had been taken by staff in the past.
finally,the evidence is such that the jury could have inferred that dylan behaviors during the morning he went awol,including telling his teacher that he had not taken his medication and sewing his fingers together,indicated that he was a danger to himself and therefore that physical restraint would have been justified.
aes argues that these incidents did not support a finding that dylan was a clear and present danger to himself at the time he was leaving campus.we disagree.especially given our standard of review,which requires that we indulge in every legitimate inference that may be drawn in support of the judgment,we must conclude that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that dylan posed a clear and present danger to himself when he left campus that morning.
aes claims that if we take this view of the evidence,we must conclude that dylan was always a clear and present danger to himself,a conclusion that would do violence to the education code sections and regulation cited above.again,we disagree.because we have a record,we need not speculate about what might have been.the record shows that dylan reported having failed to take his medication,and that within an hour prior to leaving campus,he engaged in an act of.we do not believe that it was patently unreasonable for the jury to have concluded that given the school knowledge of dylan history of suicidal ideation,his reporting that he failed to take his medication,and his act of,aes should have concluded that dylan posed a danger to himself if left unattended and therefore should have attempted to physically restrain him,or called the authorities for that purpose.
aes negligence did not cause dylan death 
along these same lines,aes argues that there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that a causal link existed between any negligent act that aes was shown to have committed and dylan suicide,a required element of the negligence cause of action.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.according to aes,allison had the burden of establishing both that its failure to prevent dylan from leaving campus caused him to be sexually assaulted,and that the sexual assault caused dylan to take his own life almost four months later.it urges that she can not prove the first of these requirements,both because the sexual assault was an intervening superseding cause of dylan death and because it was unforeseeable as a matter of law that dylan would be sexually assaulted when he left the school campus.
both of these issues essentially revolve around the question of foreseeability.causation in the law of negligence is not determined by a linear projection from a but for premise.instead,it is expressed in terms of foreseeability brewer teano th,d brewer.keeping in mind that a school does have a duty to supervise its students and to take reasonable steps to provide for their safety,the law does not impose a duty upon a school to protect a student from a sexual assault unless that assault was foreseeable.leger stockton unified school dist.d.foreseeability in terms of determining whether or not a duty of care exists is a question of law to be determined by the courts.brewer,supra,th at,d.in that regard,a court determining duty is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant conduct,but rather to evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party,italics in original.these policy considerations underlie the interplay of intervening and supervening causes.ibid.
according to the restatement second of torts,a n intervening force is one which actively operates in producing harm to another after the actor negligent act or omission has been committed.citation.whether it prevents an actor antecedent negligence from being a legal cause of harm to another is determined by other rules citation,chiefly those governing the related concept of superseding cause.a superseding cause is an act of a third person or other force which by its intervention prevents the actor from being liable for harm to another which his antecedent negligence is a substantial factor in bringing about.citation.if the cause is superseding,it relieves the actor from liability whether or not that person negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.brewer,supra,th at,d.
the following considerations are of importance in determining whether an intervening force is a superseding cause of harm to another a the fact that its intervention brings about harm different in kind from that which would otherwise have resulted from the actor negligence b the fact that its operation or the consequences thereof appear after the event to be extraordinary rather than normal in view of the circumstances existing at the time of its operation c the fact that the intervening force is operating independently of any situation created by the actor negligence,or,on the other hand,is or is not a normal result of such a situation d the fact that the operation of the intervening force is due to a third person act or to his failure to act e the fact that the intervening force is due to an act of a third person which is wrongful toward the other and as such subjects the third person to liability to him f the degree of culpability of a wrongful act of a third person which sets the intervening force in motion.rest d torts.in assessing how these considerations relate to the foreseeability analysis,bernard witkin observed it is usually said that if the risk of injury might have been reasonably foreseen,the defendant is liable,but that if the independent intervening act is highly unusual or extraordinary,not reasonably likely to happen and hence not foreseeable,it is a superseding cause,and the defendant is not liable.citations.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,italics in original.
in the instant case then,the question becomes,assuming that aes was negligent in allowing dylan to leave campus without supervision,whether the risk that dylan would be sexually assaulted as a result might have been reasonably foreseen in a similar fashion to the plaintiffs in wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d,wiener,allison argues that the emphasis should not be on the risk of sexual assault,but the risk that dylan would suffer any kind of harm as a result of aes allowing him to leave campus unsupervised.id.at,d.that analysis was rejected in favor of one that focused on the criminal nature of the third party action.id.at,d.it is the injury suffered,not the mechanism of injury that is important.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.other case law also requires a focus on the type of injury suffered.akins county of sonoma cal d,romero superior court th,d robison six flags theme parks th,d.from these authorities we conclude that in this case the type of that must be foreseeable is the risk of sexual assault.allison argued in favor of this interpretation of the law below.
allison also cites hoyem manhattan beach city sch.dist.cal d,hoyem for the proposition that aes should be held liable for any injury that dylan suffered once it allowed him to leave campus unsupervised.that case can be read out of context to state that if a jury finds an absence of reasonable care in supervising the student while on campus,thus allowing a truant to leave the grounds,the school may be liable for any injury sustained by the student.id.at.however,the hoyem court,in considering the issue of foreseeability,agreed with principles of tort law,that a duty only extends to prevent reasonably foreseeable harms.id.at,fn.thus,the school duty of supervision on campus extended only to preventing those types of harms that might reasonably result from a failure to reasonably exercise such supervision.in hoyem,the risk of harm was being struck by a negligent motorist while truant.the supreme court concluded that such an event was not unforeseeable as a matter of law.id.at.as we will explain,the risk of falling victim to a child molester during truancy,while conceivable,is not foreseeable as a matter of law absent some actual prior knowledge that such a crime is likely to occur in the absence of supervision.thus,the facts of this case distinguish it from hoyem.
cases involving liability for the criminal,as opposed to merely negligent,acts of third parties require a heightened degree of foreseeability.wiener,supra,cal th at,d.there are two reasons for this first,it is difficult if not impossible in today society to predict when a criminal might strike.also,if a criminal decides on a particular goal or victim,it is extremely difficult to remove his every means for achieving that goal.id.at,d.thus,for example,in cases involving landowners failure to protect against criminal acts,it has been held that t he burden of requiring a landlord to protect against crime everywhere has been considered too great in comparison with the foreseeability of crime occurring at a particular location to justify imposing an omnibus duty on landowners to control crime.citation.ibid.allison attempts to distinguish wiener,and the cases upon which it relies,as involving the need for increased security against third party criminal acts on premises,which she claims is not at issue here.we are not persuaded.while she does not assert premises liability,in essence,allison claim against aes is based upon her contention that it should have provided a level of security for dylan higher than that afforded.and,the basic elements of tort liability are the same so long as the defendant is accused of negligence.thus,cases dealing with landowner liability provide pertinent foreseeability analysis.
the standard for foreseeability has been further heightened where sexual assaults are specifically concerned.in cases involving an employer vicarious liability for sexual assaults,it has almost universally been held that sexual assaults are not so foreseeable as a part of modern society that an employer should be vicariously liable for such criminal actions taken by an employee against another.juarez boy scouts of america,th,d,juarez and cases cited therein.further,and more on point,in cases involving third party liability for sexual assaults committed by others,it has been held that,even where a special relationship exists,such as a school has with its students rodriguez inglewood unified school dist.d.rodriguez,a party to that relationship owes a duty of supervision to prevent a third party sexual assault on the other party to that relationship only if the first party has actual prior knowledge,and therefore must have known,that the third party posed a risk of sexual assault.romero,supra,th at,d chaney superior court th,d.
from a public policy standpoint,we can not reconcile allison position with existing law.if landowners are not held liable for sexual assaults since they are not foreseeable unless they had happened before ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,how can aes be held liable for the assault on dylan unless it was aware of prior sexual assaults in other words,if aes would not have been liable had the molester attacked dylan on the campus,we find it irreconcilable that it should be held liable for an attack that occurred when dylan willingly and knowingly left campus,unless it had knowledge of the specific risk.similarly,if employers are not liable when they bring a victim into direct contact with an employee who is a molester absent some knowledge of the molester propensities juarez,supra,th at,d,then aes can not be held liable for a sexual assault based on a much less direct level of culpability.in other words,if aes would not have been liable for hiring a teacher that molested dylan,we find it irreconcilable that it should be held liable for merely failing to supervise him such that a molester had access to him when he left campus,unless it had some specific knowledge of the risk.while a school does have a special relationship with its students,which imposes upon it a duty to supervise them so as to maintain their safety rodriguez,supra,d at,a school is not a guarantor of the safety of its students any more than a parent can guarantee the safety of his or her child.hoyem,supra,cal d at,lilley elk grove unified school dist.th,d.we see no reason why the former should be held to a higher standard than the latter.see,hoff vacaville unified school dist.cal th,d,schools stand in loco parentis,in the place of parents,to their students,with similar powers and responsibilities.dailey los angeles unified sch.dist.cal d,standard imposed on school personnel in discharging their supervisory duty of care is that which a person of ordinary prudence,charged with comparable duties,would exercise under the same circumstances.
we can not hold,as allison suggests,that it is always foreseeable that an unsupervised child,even an emotionally disturbed and impulsive unsupervised child,will be sexually assaulted.here,the evidence shows that the risk that dylan would be sexually assaulted was no more foreseeable than the sexual assault of any person at any time.unlike in wallace d.wallace,there was no evidence here that aes was aware of any specific danger of molestation to awol students,such as migrant laborers or an in the immediate vicinity as in that case.further,the court conclusion in wallace,that crimes against children are always foreseeable id.at,is an outdated concept which has lost favor in the development of the law,as shown above.the same analysis applies to panama buena vista union school dist.th,d where a sexual assault was held foreseeable because the evidence showed that there was specific knowledge of a risk of assault.id.at,d lead opn.of wiseman,d conc.opn.of harris,acting.
allison has failed to cite to any evidence in support of the foreseeability that dylan would be sexually assaulted if he left the campus unattended,nor has our review of the record demonstrated the existence of any such evidence.the fact that testified that a child who has been victimized once is more likely to be victimized again does not constitute the kind of specific evidence required by the law in order to find sexual assault foreseeable.because there was no evidence from which it could be concluded that a sexual assault was a foreseeable result of dylan awol,aes can not be liable for that assault.consequently,since the only evidence linking aes culpability in dylan awol to his suicide was the occurrence of the sexual assault,aes,which is not liable for the assault,can not be held liable for the suicide.the causal chain between aes negligence and dylan death not having been demonstrated,the trial court should have granted aes motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the first cause of action for wrongful death.
aes duty to allison 
aes asserts that allison failed to demonstrate that it was liable to her for negligent infliction of emotional distress due to the absence of a duty to her and the lack of evidence of damages.in order for aes to be liable to allison for negligent infliction of emotional distress it must have had a duty to her as a direct victim of its negligence.huggins longs drug stores california,cal th,d,huggins.direct victim liability arises from the b
