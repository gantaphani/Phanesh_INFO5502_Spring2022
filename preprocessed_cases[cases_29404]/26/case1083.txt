this case has its genesis in a high school student poem,which led to his temporary,emergency expulsion from school.it arises against a backdrop of tragic school shootings,occurring both before and after the events at issue here,and requires us to evaluate through a constitutional prism the actions school officials took to address what they perceived was the student implied threat of violent harm to himself and others.given the knowledge the shootings at columbine,thurston and santee high schools,among others,have imparted about the potential for school violence as rare as these incidents may be when taken in context,we must take care when evaluating a student first amendment right of free expression against school officials need to provide a safe school environment not to overreact in favor of either.schools must be safe,but they are educational institutions after all,and creative writing and an essential part of the educational fabric.although this is a close case in retrospect,we conclude that when the school officials expelled james lavine they acted with sufficient justification and within constitutional limits,not to punish james for the content of his poem,but to avert perceived potential harm.
factual and procedural 
in the fall of,james lavine was in eleventh grade and a student in vivian bleecker sixth period english class at blaine high school.one evening in june or july,james wrote the first draft of a poem he entitled last words.the final version reads 
as each day passed,i watched,love sprout,from the most,unlikely places,wich reminds,me that,beauty is in the eye,of the beholder.
as i remember,i start to cry,for i,had leared,this to late,and now,i must spend,each day,alone,alone for supper,alone at night,alone at death.
death i feel,crawlling down,my neck at,every turn,and so,now i know,what i must do.
i pulled my gun,from its case,and began to load it.
i remember,thinking at least i wo,go alone,as i,jumpped in,the car,all i could think about,was i would not,go alone.
as i walked,through the,now empty halls,i could feel,my hart pounding.
as i approched,the classroom door,i drew my gun and,threw open the door,bang,bang.
when it all was over,were,dead,and all i remember,was not felling,any remorce,for i felt,i was,clensing my soul,
i quickly,turned and ran,as the bell rang,all i could here,were screams,screams of friends,screams of co workers,and just plain,screams of shear horor,as the students,found their,slayen classmates,
years have passed,and now i lay,roses,down upon,these stairs,as now,i feel,i may,strike again.
no tears,shall be shead,in sarrow,for i am,alone,and now,i hope,i can feel,remorce,for what i did,without a shed,of tears,for no tear,shall fall,from your face,but from mine,as i try,to rest in peace,bang 
around that time,several school shootings had the tragedy at thurston high school in nearby springfield,were frequent topics in the news the morning after james wrote the poem,he showed it to his mother.she warned james not to turn the poem in to his teachers at school,because with everything that was on the news whoever read it might overreact.
james forgot about the poem until he rediscovered it in his living room on september.he made some editorial changes and brought it to school on friday,october.he showed the poem to several of his friends,some of whom liked it and some of whom did not.at that point,he decided to ask his english teacher,bleecker,her opinion of last words.
james had not been in school for the three days prior to october.at the end of his sixth period english class,he turned in several assignments and the poem.james asked bleecker if she would read the poem and tell him what she thought.bleecker thanked james for the poem and said she looked forward to reading it.the poem was not an assignment or an extra credit project,but james had turned in other poems to his previous english teachers at blaine high school and appreciated their feedback.
that evening,bleecker read last words and became concerned.her impression of james up to that time was that he was a very quiet student.she thought the poem might be james way of letting somebody know that maybe something hurting him,maybe he upset about something,maybe he afraid.the next morning saturday,bleecker contacted karen mulholland,james school counselor,to discuss the contents of the poem.mulholland was similarly concerned and set up a meeting that evening with bleecker and tim haney,the school vice principal.
during his time at blaine high school,james had frequently confided in mulholland,who is also a school psychologist.in,james told her that he thought about suicide.mulholland made james promise her that he would talk to her before he tried to kill himself.thereafter,mulholland kept an eye out for james and tried to make time to help him when he needed it.in fall,james told her about several incidents that had occurred in his home.in particular,on september,james and his father had had an argument about james car.james father,bruce,had thrown a rock in the direction of james and his car.james called the police,who filed charges against bruce.as a result of the charges,a court issued a order that led to james moving out of his home temporarily to live with his sister.james had also missed school on september,to participate in the resulting legal proceedings.in addition,in the preceding weeks,james had broken up with his girlfriend.the school authorities had become aware of this because the mother had called the school to report that james was stalking her daughter.
mulholland disclosed these events to haney and bleecker.haney also reviewed james disciplinary file,which recorded several additional incidents,including a fight in february and an episode of insubordination with a teacher in march.moreover,haney said that a few weeks before october,he had personally disciplined james for wearing to school a emblazoned with the words eat shit and die.haney impression of james at that time was that he was a good kid,but somewhat of a loner.
given the content of the poem,and his knowledge of james suicidal thoughts,family situation and past incidents,haney decided at the saturday meeting to call james home to find out if james would be attending the school homecoming dance that evening.haney learned that james would not be attending the dance.haney,nonetheless,decided to contact the blaine police department for guidance about the situation.at the police department suggestion,the school officials called washington state child protective services,which then suggested they call the community mental health crisis line.the crisis line in turn put them in touch with charles dewitt,the psychiatrist on duty for that evening.dewitt suggested james be picked up by the police for evaluation.
the whatcom sheriff department,the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over james neighborhood,dispatched deputy sheriffs to the lavines family farm to conduct a welfare check of james.a deputy sheriff interviewed james to determine whether a medical evaluation was needed.james told the deputy that he often writes poetry and has his teachers review them.he has never written this type of poem in the past and had no explanation why he wrote this one.james further told the officer he had no access to weapons and had no intention of carrying out any of the acts in the poem.james mother assured the deputy that james had no access to weapons and was not a danger to himself or others.the deputy found no probable cause to commit james involuntarily,and james was unwilling to undergo a voluntary psychological examination.
the deputy telephoned dewitt and reported his observations.based upon dewitt conversation with the deputy and with the school officials,dewitt concluded,i n my professional opinion on a more probable than not basis based upon the information provided to me by the district and the law enforcement officers who had personally observed him,there were insufficient grounds for anyone to make a determination that james lavine was in imminent danger of causing serious harm to himself and others.dewitt accordingly decided not to commit james.
on sunday,haney met with principal dan newell regarding james and informed him of james background.by then,newell had been informed that the sheriff and mental health professionals had decided not to commit james.that sunday,based upon the information he had,newell decided to emergency expel james under washington administrative code haney left a message with james parents that day telling them to attend a meeting the next morning at the school.at on monday,newell told james and his father that james was being emergency expelled from school.this expulsion was formally expressed in a letter of the same date that letter in relevant part states 
this letter is to inform you of the following violations of the blaine high school discipline policy by your son james 
on october,at,your son james presented a paper to his english teacher,which implied extreme violence to our student body.
this violation of sic was of a nature significant enough to be classified as dangerous to your son a threat to other students a threat of serious disruption to the education process.therefore i impose the sanction of emergency expulsion.
after james father was informed of the emergency expulsion,he became hostile and began using foul language.james,too,became upset,used profanity and ran out of the office.
after james was expelled,his parents hired an attorney,breean beggs,and appealed james expulsion to the blaine school board.beggs had several conversations with the school district attorney,timothy slater,about how james could return to school.slater suggested that james be evaluated by a psychiatrist,at the school district expense,to determine whether it was safe for james to return to class.once this proposal was agreed to,james met with watson,a psychiatrist,on three occasions.after the third meeting on october,watson felt he could recommend james return to school.watson also opined that when james turned in the poem,he needed to be evaluated and that he would have recommended removing james from school.shortly thereafter,the school district rescinded its expulsion and james was allowed to return to school after missing days.he completed the school year without incident.
even though james was allowed to return to school,james and his parents continued with their appeal of the expulsion to the school board.concerned that the october letter would hurt james chances of entering the military,they requested that it be removed from james file.after a hearing on december,the board affirmed the expulsion,but agreed to rewrite the letter.a new,letter was substituted emphasizing that james was expelled for safety as opposed to disciplinary reasons the revised letter did not refer to events that had transpired subsequent to october.
james and his father filed suit in federal court on july,claiming the blaine school district,tim haney,dan newell and karen mulholland collectively the school or defendants violated james constitutional rights by expelling him and maintaining documentation in his school file.the suit asked for general and specific damages and for an order permanently enjoining defendants from maintaining any letters in james file regarding his expulsion.plaintiffs and defendants both moved for partial summary judgment on the first amendment claim.the district court granted plaintiffs motion and denied defendants motion on february,at which time the court entered an injunction preventing the school district from placing or maintaining any negative documentation in james lavine school file.

the district court had jurisdiction under,because the complaint raised federal questions based upon alleged violations of the united states constitution.the district court entered partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief.in its order,the district court stated,the lavines are entitled to the equitable remedy of an injunction preventing the placement or maintenance of any negative documentation of this incident in james lavine school file.defendants filed a timely notice of appeal of that order.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a,because the district court order granted a permanent injunction.dare california,cir.because the district court partial summary judgment order provides legal authority for the injunction and is thus inextricably bound with it,we also have jurisdiction to review the legal authority underlying the injunction.paige california,cir.

discussion 
as we noted at the outset,we live in a time when school violence is an unfortunate reality that educators must confront on an all too frequent basis.the recent spate of school shootings have put our nation on edge and have focused attention on what school officials,law enforcement and others can do or could have done to prevent these kinds of tragedies.after columbine,thurston,santee and other school shootings,questions have been asked about how teachers or administrators could have missed telltale warning signs,why something was not done earlier and what should be done to prevent such tragedies from happening again.
although schools are being asked to do more to prevent violence,the constitution sets limits as to how far they can go.just as the constitution does not allow the police to imprison all suspicious characters,schools can not expel students just because they are loners,wear black and play video games.see kevin fagan,life harder for teen outcasts for some bay area kids,times are tougher since littleton,may,at listing attributes routinely ascribed to potential school shooters.schools must achieve a balance between protecting the safety and of their students and respecting those same students constitutional rights.see karp becken,cir new jersey,d balancing,in the fourth amendment context,students interest in privacy against schools interest in maintaining discipline and security.
the lavines,in this lawsuit,argue that the school failed to reach the proper balance when it expelled james.they contend that james poem is protected by the first amendment and that he was unconstitutionally disciplined for the content of his speech.the school argues that james was not disciplined because of the poem,but was expelled based upon a confluence of factors,including the poem,that indicated he was a danger to the safety of the school and to himself.
to determine whether the school violated james first amendment rights,we must consider what those rights are.public school students are protected by the first amendment and do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d upholding students right to wear black armbands in protest against the vietnam war.the first amendment rights of public school students,however,are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d holding school principal could censor the student newspaper quoting bethel sch.dist.fraser,d holding school could punish students for making lewd remarks at school assembly,and tinker,at,respectively.for example,a school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission.hazelwood,at.compare chandler mcminnville sch,cir holding students had pled a first amendment violation where they alleged they had to remove buttons containing the word scab during a teachers strike.
in the school context,we have granted educators substan
