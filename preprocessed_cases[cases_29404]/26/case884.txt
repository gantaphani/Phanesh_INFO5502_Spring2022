individuals with disabilities education act 
the panel reversed the district court dismissal,as barred by the statute of limitations,of claims under the individuals with disabilities education act.
the plaintiffs claimed that their child school district failed to identify his disability or assess him for autism in and.agreeing with the third circuit,the panel held that f c requires courts to bar only claims brought more than two years after the parents or local education agency knew or should have known about the actions forming the basis of the complaint.because the district court barred all claims occurring more than two years before the plaintiffs filed their administrative due process complaint,the panel remanded for the district court to determine when the plaintiffs knew or should have known about the actions forming the basis of their complaint.
the panel addressed another claim in a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with its opinion.

background 
appellants barbara and miguel avila are the parents of,a student in spokane school district.in,when was five,the avilas asked the district to evaluate him for special education services based on b ehavior issues.one of the reasons for this request was a preschool teacher concern that might be showing slight signs of autism.in december,a school psychologist evaluated and concluded that although he displayed some behaviors of concern,behavior was not severe enough to qualify for special education services under the idea.mother was given a copy of the evaluation report and signed a form stating that she agreed with the evaluation results.
in the fall of,enrolled in kindergarten.a private physician diagnosed him with asperger disorder in october,and the avilas requested that the district reevaluate eligibility for special education services.a school psychologist concluded in a reevaluation dated april,that was eligible for special educational services under the category of autism and,from april until february,the avilas and representatives from the district met multiple times to discuss an individualized education program iep for him the avilas and the district initially disagreed,but eventually signed an iep in february.then began attending adapt,a specialized program in the district for students with autism.
about a year later,the district reevaluated,assessing his behavior,speech and language,occupational therapy needs,and academic achievements,including reading,writing,and mathematics.the district then drafted another iep.the avilas did not agree with the reevaluation findings and did not sign it.instead,they requested an independent educational evaluation iee at the district expense.see.admin.code.the district denied this request.
the avilas filed a request for a due process hearing with the washington state office of administrative hearings on april.as required by law after the denial of a parent request for an iee,the district also initiated a due process hearing with the washington state office of administrative hearings to consider whether the district reevaluation was sufficient.see.admin.code c.ultimately,the alj ruled that the district reevaluation was appropriate and that the avilas were not entitled to an iee at the district expense.in a separate order,the alj ruled in favor of the district on all other claims.specifically,he concluded that eleven of the avilas claims were.these claims consisted of nine procedural claims concerning the district alleged failure to give prior written notice to the avilas and two substantive claims.the substantive claims alleged that the district denied a free appropriate public education fape by failing to identify him as a child with a disability in,and that the district failed to assess his suspected disability in and.the alj concluded that no statutory exceptions applied and held that the avilas claims were,reasoning t he parents due process complaint was filed on april,and any complaint by parents regarding the district actions or inactions occurring prior to april,are barred by the statu t e of limitations.
the avilas timely appealed both decisions to the united states district court for the eastern district of washington,where their appeals were consolidated.the consolidated appeal addressed seven of the claims the alj deemed five of their prior written notice claims and the two substantive claims arguing denials of right to a fape.
the district court agreed with the alj determination that neither exception to the statute of limitations applied and affirmed the alj decision that the idea limitations period barred the avilas claims arising before april.the district court also affirmed the alj ruling that the april reevaluation was appropriate,that the iep provided with a fape,and that the avilas were not entitled to an iee at the district expense.the avilas timely appealed to this court.they argue that the district court improperly applied the idea statute of limitations to their two substantive claims.they do not appeal the district court ruling that their five remaining prior written notice claims lack merit.

discussion 
i.the idea statute of limitations requires courts to apply the discovery.statutory overview 
the idea provides federal funds to assist state and local agencies in educating children with disabilities,but conditions such funding on compliance with certain goals and procedures.ojai unified sch.dist.jackson,cir.the idea seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.d a.a fape is defined as an education that is provided at public expense,meets the standards of the state educational agency,and is in conformity with the student iep.baquerizo garden grove unified sch,cir.citing.upon request of a parent or agency,a local educational agency must conduct a full and individual initial evaluation to determine whether a child has a disability and the child educational needs.a a c.if a child is determined to have a disability,a team including a local educational agency representative,teachers,parents,and in some cases,the child,formulates an iep d b.the local educational agency must conduct a reevaluation of the child if it determines that the educational or related services needs,including improved academic achievement and functional performance,of the child warrant a reevaluation,or if a reevaluation is requested by the child parents or teacher.a a.
the idea permits parents and school districts to file due process complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.b a.the state educational agency or local educational agency hears due process complaints in administrative due process hearings.f a.if a party disagrees with the administrative findings and decision,the idea allows for judicial review in state courts and federal district courts.i a.
b.the idea statute of limitations 
prior to,the idea did not include a statute of limitations for due process hearings or complaints.see b sherwood sch,cir.the idea specifies no limitations period governing either a plaintiff request for an administrative hearing or the filing of a civil action.congress amended the idea in to add a statute of limitations period that is now codified in two different provisions of the idea b b and f c our circuit has not addressed these amendments,but in ligonier valley school district authority,cir,the third circuit described b b and f c as alike in almost all respects except for one glaring ambiguity b b limitations period runs backward instead of forward from the reasonable discovery date.id.at.
the avilas contend that f c requires this court to apply a discovery rule to idea claims,meaning that the statute of limitations is triggered when a plaintiff discovers,or reasonably could have discovered,his claim.see boeing,cir.the district does not dispute that the discovery rule should apply to trigger the statute of limitations,but argues that the district court did apply the discovery rule and that the avilas claims are barred because they failed to file suit within two years after they knew or should have known about their claims.
the application of the idea statute of limitations is a question of first impression for this court we have not squarely addressed the knew or should have known standard in the idea or the seemingly contradictory provisions in b b and f c.in the first federal appellate decision addressing how b b and f c should be reconciled,the third circuit concluded that the idea statute of limitations requires courts to apply the discovery rule described in f c.ligonier,at.the statutory text of the idea,including its language and context,persuade us that the third circuit approach in ligonier is correct and that the idea statute of limitations requires courts to apply the discovery rule described in f c.the department of education interpretation of the statutory amendments and the associated legislative history support this reading of the statute.
when interpreting a statute,we are guided by the fundamental canons of statutory construction and begin with the statutory text.united states neal,cir.citing bedroc,llc united states.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which the language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.salazar,cir.quoting robinson shell oil.if the statutory text is ambiguous,we employ other tools,such as legislative history,to construe the meaning of ambiguous terms.benko quality loan serv,cir.
read in isolation,f c appears straightforward.entitled timeline for requesting hearing,it states 
a parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing within years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a hearing under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows.
f c.however,an ambiguity arises when f c is read in conjunction with b b.the latter states,under the heading types of procedures,that the idea allows 
an opportunity for any party to present a complaint which sets forth an alleged violation that occurred not more than years before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for presenting such a complaint under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows 
the third circuit ligonier decision recognized that litigants have advanced various interpretations of the idea statute of limitations the occurrence rule suggested by b b,under which the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the injury occurs the discovery rule provided in f c or the rule.ligonier,at.under the rule,the statute of limitations is triggered when a plaintiff knew or should have known of his claim,but the scope of redressable harm is limited to the two years before the reasonable discovery date through the date the complaint was filed,which could be up to two years after the reasonable discovery date,for a maximum period of relief of four years.id.at.
we first conclude that congress did not intend the idea statute of limitations to be governed by a strict occurrence rule.both b b and f c include language pegging the limitations period to the date on which the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,not the date on which the action occurred.see b b,f c.if congress intended a strict occurrence rule,there would have been no need to include the knew or should have known language in b b and f c.
the text of the two provisions also undercuts the rule.both b b and f c allow the statute of limitations to be replaced by an explicit time limitation in such time as the state law allows.b b,f c.if states adopt their own statutes of limitations pursuant to these provisions,b b and f c provide that the federal exceptions to the statute of limitations still apply,see b b,f c d,and it would make little sense to incorporate the federal exceptions for equitable tolling if b b were a remedy cap rather than a preview of the statute of limitations set forth in f c.see ligonier,at.we hold that the text of the idea can not support the construction of the statute.
the next question is how to reconcile these two seemingly conflicting provisions.looking to the specific context in which the language is used and the broader context of the statute as a whole,at,b provides an overview of the other provisions of,including f,while f c addresses in more specific language the allowable period for requesting a due process hearing.see ligonier,at.section is entitled procedural safeguards,with subsection a mandating that any state educational agency that receives federal assistance under the subchapter must establish and maintain certain procedures.subsection b,entitled types of procedures,broadly outlines the many procedures state educational agencies are required to adopt,including the opportunity for any party to present a complaint regarding the identification,evaluation or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a fape.b.
in contrast,f,entitled impartial due process hearing,describes in detail the procedures required whenever a parent or local education agency files a due process complaint under subsection b or k.section f addresses evaluations and recommendations to be prepared in advance of a due process hearing.section f,entitled limitations on hearing,is divided into persons conducting hearing,subject matter of hearing,and timeline for requesting hearing.f a c.it is this last provision,located in the subsection that expressly limits the right to a due process hearing,which specifies that the hearing must be requested within two years from the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.f c.thus,the structure of supports the conclusion that b b,though poorly penned,was intended merely as a synopsis of f c knew or should have known benchmark for the statute of limitations.see ligonier,at.
we have considered that congress might have intended different limitations periods for presenting complaints and requesting due process hearings,but that possibility is inconsistent with the overall statutory scheme.read that way,subsections b and f can not be harmonized because b would bar a complaint arising from conduct occurring more than two years before the discovery date,but f would preserve the right to request a due process hearing concerning the same conduct.our task is to harmonize the statutory scheme as a whole,and our interpretation of as having just one applicable limitations period is consistent with the department of education position that the two provisions provide the same limitation
