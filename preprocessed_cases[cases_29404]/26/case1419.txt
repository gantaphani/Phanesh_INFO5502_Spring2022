john travis appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court denied his mandate petition,which sought a determination that the trustees of the california state university violated the open meeting act,et when they met in closed session to discuss former chancellor barry munitz decision to return from a leave of absence and assume a teaching post.because the topic of that closed session fell within the act exception for discussions about personnel matters,we affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
john travis is the president of the california faculty association,the union that represents faculty members employed at the various campuses within the california state university csu system.he brought a mandate petition code civ,against csu board of trustees the board,as well as board chairman murray galinson and csu chancellor charles reed,alleging that they violated the open meeting act,et when they met in closed session to discuss former csu chancellor barry munitz decision to return from a lengthy leave of absence and assume a guaranteed teaching post at csu los angeles campus after considering the parties briefs and supporting evidence,the trial court determined that the closed session did not violate the act because it fell within an exception for discussing personnel matters,subd.a.
the facts before the trial court were few.munitz became csu chancellor in.at that time,csu had in place an executive compensation plan known as the trustee professor program,which granted certain csu executives a tenured professorship at a csu campus.although the trustee professor program was eliminated in,it still applied to munitz and others who were hired before then by way of various amendments to the program,a formula was established to set both the salary and office budget of any trustee professor.in july,munitz announced his plan to resign as chancellor effective january in order to become president of the paul getty trust the getty,which oversaw the operations of several prominent institutions,including the getty museum.instead of ending his employment at csu,however,munitz exercised his vested right to become a trustee professor.csu agreed to grant munitz yearly unpaid leaves of absence so that if he ever left the getty,he could return to csu and assume a faculty position.these yearly leaves were requested by munitz and granted by csu every april through.
munitz time at the getty was marked by controversy and in february he resigned in march,munitz phoned reed and said that instead of requesting another yearly leave of absence extension,he intended to return to csu and assume his post as a trustee professor.according to reed declaration,he anticipated that munitz return to csu would also result in publicity and reed therefore scheduled the subject as a closed session topic on the board march,agenda.reed said that he did so pursuant to the act exception for matters,subd.a.reed said he wanted to inform the members of the board of munitz return before they read about it in the newspapers,and also to advise them that csu was going to put out a press release regarding the circumstances of the munitz employment.i also wanted to be able to answer candidly any questions they might have had about this situation.i did not want the board of trustees to be surprised about the announcement of this important personnel matter.although the actual appointment was made long ago in,i wanted to make certain that the board members understood the,that munitz had a vested right to return to csu,and that the university had no choice but to take him back.during the closed session,there was a candid discussion about munitz circumstances.i can not disclose the contents of that closed session discussion,because i am required by law to keep it confidential.
on april,munitz sent reed a letter to give formal notice of his decision to return to csu as a trustee professor.after discussing the matter with board chairman galinson,reed sent munitz a letter on april,that set forth the duties reed had decided to assign munitz reed letter also informed munitz that his annual salary would be,and detailed his office supply and staff budget.munitz salary and office budget were based on the trustee professor program formula that the board had approved years earlier.his job duties were selected by reed pursuant to reed discretion to do so.in short,munitz return was guaranteed as a matter of right and neither his return,job duties,salary,or office budget required board action of any kind.
travis first amended mandate petition alleged that the board violated the act when it met in closed session march,to discuss munitz return to csu as a trustee professor.travis asked the trial court for a declaration to that effect,and an order that csu disclose what was said during the closed session.the trial court disagreed,ruling that the closed session was proper because respondents met to consider matters relating to munitz employment.the court then entered judgment for respondents.travis contends the trial court erred by improperly expanding the act personnel exception for discussions relating to a person employment beyond the initial hiring decision.
standard of review 
in reviewing the trial court judgment in a mandate action,we apply the substantial evidence standard to the trial court factual findings where the facts are in dispute.we exercise independent review of legal questions and of questions based on undisputed facts.taxpayers for livable communities city of malibu th,d.the interpretation of statutes is a legal question that calls for independent review.lewis nelson sons,clovis unified school dist.th,d.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law in doing so,we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language,at the same time not rendering any language mere surplusage.the words must be construed in context and in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear the statute must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the legislature,practical rather than technical in nature,and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity if the language of a statute is clear,we should not add to or alter it to accomplish a purpose which does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.statutes must be harmonized,both internally and with each other.citation.pasadena metro blue line construction authority pacific bell telephone th,d.
discussion 
the act requires that,with certain exceptions,a ll meetings of a state body shall be open and public,subd.a.the policy behind this rule is set forth in section,which states that public agencies and public servants exist to help conduct the public business,that they may not decide what the public should know,and that the proceedings of public agencies must be conducted openly 
the board does not dispute that it is a state body under the act.see.nor does it dispute that on march,it held a meeting for purposes of that act.see,subd.a meeting under the act includes congregation of majority of members of a state body to hear,discuss,or deliberate on any item that is within its subject matter jurisdiction.at issue here is whether the board closed session discussion about munitz return from leave of absence was proper under the act personnel exception,which provides nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent a state body from holding closed sessions during a regular or special meeting to consider the appointment,employment,evaluation of performance,or dismissal of a public employee or to hear complaints or charges brought against that employee by another person or employee unless the employee requests a public hearing,subd.a.
the trial court found,and respondents contend,that the term employment in section must be construed to include the circumstances surrounding munitz right to return from his leave of absence and assume his job as a trustee professor.travis contends the trial court erred because the employment exception to the act should be narrowly construed to mean only the initial decision to employ someone.
no reported decision has construed the act personnel exception.as the parties note,however,the ralph brown act provides a virtually identical open meeting scheme that is applicable to local public agencies.et several decisions have construed other aspects of the brown act personnel exception,and the parties have rightly relied on those decisions as authority for construing the act personnel exception santa clara valley transportation authority public utilities com.th,d see southern california edison peevey cal th,d,stating that parallels,and looking to authority construing the latter to interpret the former.none,however,has construed what it means to consider the employment of a public employee.
the personnel exception exists to permit free and candid discussions of personnel matters by a local governmental body.versaci superior court th,d.it represents a reasonable compromise by the legislature,leaving most personnel matters to be discussed freely and candidly in closed session,but permitting an employee to request an open session to defend against specific complaints or charges brought against him or her by another individual.furtado sierra community college th,d.however,the exception should be strictly and narrowly construed and will not be extended beyond the import of its terms.citation.san diego union city council d.san diego union.
travis contends that the personnel exception use of the phrase to consider the appointment or employment of a public employee means nothing more than the initial act of hiring and can not be expanded to include any matter related to an individual status as appointee or employee after that time.he argues that his interpretation is compelled in part by comparisons with section,which requires a state body that has met in closed session to later report publicly on any action taken to appoint,employ,or dismiss a public employee,and with section,which requires a state body to provide a copy of the act to each new member upon his or her appointment to that body.according to travis,this shows that when the legislature mentions employment or appointment in the personnel exception,it means hiring.
we disagree.by their terms,the sections cited by travis come into play only when some action has actually been by hiring a new employee or when a new member of a state body has been appointed.by contrast,section allows a closed session when a state body is doing nothing more than considering the employment of a public employee regardless of whether it takes any action at that time.see lucas board of trustees d.brown act personnel exception includes the power to both consider and act in closed session.if the legislature had intended to limit section to the initial hiring decision,it could have easily done so by stating that closed sessions were proper when a state body meets to consider whether to employ someone as a public employee.at a minimum,the language is ambiguous and leaves room for doubt as to travis proposed interpretation.
travis also contends that the trial court interpretation of employment violates the rules of statutory interpretation because it effectively swallows the other aspects of the personnel job performance,considering and imposing discipline,and effect making them surplusage.see commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,d,when a statute contains a list of items,courts will not adopt an expansive meaning of one item that would make the others unnecessary or redundant.this might be true if,as travis claims,the phrase consider the employment were construed to include all matters related to a public employee employment status after he is hired.however,that does not accurately frame the issue,which is best defined as whether munitz return from his leave of absence warranted a closed session in order to consider his employment with csu.
there is authority for reading some flexibility into the provisions of the personnel exception.in duval board of trustees th,d duval,the court considered whether the brown act personnel exception for the evaluation of an employee performance applied when a school board met in closed session to discuss performance issues related to one teacher who had already received his formal performance evaluation.on appeal from a summary judgment for the defendant school board,the court acknowledged that the personnel exception must be read narrowly,but rejected plaintiff contention that evaluation of performance meant nothing more than a formal,periodic,structured review.in the context of section,the phrase to consider the evaluation of performance clearly is meant to extend to all employer consideration of an employee discharge of his or her job duties after appointment or employment of the employee,up to but excluding discipline or dismissal of the employee.id.at,d.because the personnel exception was designed to permit candid discussions in closed session about the majority of personnel issues,and because nothing in the statutory language indicated an intent to limit evaluation of performance to a formal,periodic review process,the court held that the phrase encompasses a review of an employee job performance even if that review involves particular instances of job performance rather than a comprehensive review of such performance.ibid.
the duval court did not stop there,however,expanding evaluation of performance to include consideration of the criteria for such evaluation,consideration of the process for conducting the evaluation,and other preliminary matters,to the extent those matters constitute an exercise of defendant discretion in evaluating a particular employee.in doing so,the court reasoned that those items were an integral part of the actual evaluation this would necessarily include,the court held,taking action to find the evaluation satisfactory and giving the employee feedback about his evaluation.duval,supra,th at,d.
opinions of the california attorney general have consistently interpreted the personnel exception use of the term employment broadly.those opinions,while not binding on us,are entitled to great weight,especially when the legislature either amends a statute to conform to such an opinion,or fails to pass an amendment that is contrary to an earlier attorney general opinion.orange county employees.county of orange th,d.
we find the review of three attorney general opinions and the legislative response to be particularly useful.in,section did not yet include the evaluation of employee performance exception and permitted closed sessions only to consider the appointment,employment,or dismissal of a public employee or to hear complaints or charges brought against such employee as amended by stats,ch,see list of amendments,deering ann.ed.foll.even so,the attorney general interpreted the term employment to include all personnel matters relating to an individual employee at executive sessions and not simply matters relating to initial employment or final discharge,thereby permitting a closed session to evaluate a school superintendent performance.according to the attorney general,this interpretation squared with the personnel exception purpose of sparing public employees undue publicity and embarrassment.ibid.in,the legislature amended section consistent with the attorney general opinion so as to include performance evaluations as amended by stats,ch,see list of amendments,deering ann,supra,foll,then did the same for section in.see list of amendments,deering ann.ed.foll.
the attorney general later used the same reasoning when concluding that the brown act personnel exception permitted closed session discussions of employee salaries.that interpretation was rejected five years later in san diego union,supra,d.the court agreed that the personnel exception was designed to prevent public embarrassment.id.at.however,it reasoned that requiring public sessions for employee salary decisions was consistent with the brown act stated purposes because those decisions implicated munici
