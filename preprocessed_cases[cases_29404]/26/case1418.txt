a motorist killed one child and injured others as they crossed a city street on their way to school.a lawsuit was brought against the city and school district upon allegations that their negligence contributed to the accident.the trial court granted defendants summary judgment upon concluding,among other things,that the city intersection did not create a dangerous condition,and that the school district was not responsible for the safety of students outside school premises.we affirm the judgment.
on the morning of january,an unlicensed motorist struck six pedestrians as they walked in a marked crosswalk at the intersection of international boulevard and avenue in oakland,california.the pedestrians were a family on the way to school,and consisted of maribel espinoza and her three children juan,kathy,and anylene espinoza,and maribel niece and nephew,ana and juan cerna.the collision killed ana and injured the others.the motorist was convicted of vehicular manslaughter,subd.c.
this appeal concerns a lawsuit brought by the surviving pedestrians and family members against the city of oakland city,for the alleged dangerous condition of its intersection,and the oakland unified school district district,for its alleged negligence in failing to assure safe school access the trial court granted summary judgment to the city and district.we now turn to the facts established on the motion for summary judgment 
photographs of international boulevard show it to be a four lane road,with two lanes in each direction separated in places with a concrete island divider between the opposing lanes of traffic.the intersection of international boulevard and avenue has a marked crosswalk the roadway is painted with white parallel lines at the intersection,the eastbound approach to the intersection has ped xing painted on the roadway,and two yellow traffic signs posted on the pavement separately depict a pedestrian and school crossing.
the international community school school opened in the fall of.at the time of the accident on january,pupils and staff at the school were housed in temporary buildings and the only school entrance was on avenue.the intersection nearest the school,at avenue and international boulevard,is controlled with a traffic light.plaintiff maribel espinoza knew from the first day of school in september that there was no traffic light or crossing guard at the intersection of international boulevard and avenue.maribel concluded that she and her children could cross international boulevard at avenue safely,and that the crosswalk at that intersection was equally as safe as the crosswalk along international boulevard at avenue,where there is a traffic light.with only one exception,maribel crossed international boulevard at avenue four times each school day between september and the day of the accident in january.
on the day of the accident,maribel and the children remained within the crosswalk from the time they stepped off the curb until the accident.maribel and the children crossed safely to the center divider.maribel,pushing a baby stroller,stood on the center divider and looked down international boulevard to avenue,where eastbound traffic coming from downtown oakland was stopped at a traffic light.maribel stepped off the center divider with the children just as the traffic began to move in their direction.maribel saw several cars approaching and thought they would stop and yield to her and the children in the crosswalk.maribel first saw the green car that struck them when it was in the curb lane about three car lengths away.maribel thought the car would stop.instead of stopping,the car changed lanes to the lane closest to the center divider,where it struck maribel and the children.
a police officer testified that there was no physical evidence that the motorist,osvaldo urzua,slowed or swerved before striking the pedestrians.photographs of the accident scene show the weather conditions to be sunny and dry.both the photographs and the testimony of a police officer who responded to the scene attest to the fact that the sun rises in the direct line of sight of eastbound motorists on international boulevard,and the glare from the rising sun was intensely strong along international boulevard minutes after the accident.
ii.discussion 
the trial court granted the city and district summary judgment on several grounds.two principal grounds are dispositive on appeal the city intersection at international boulevard and avenue did not create a dangerous condition,and the district was not responsible for the safety of students outside school premises,
standard of review 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in considering a request for summary judgment by a defendant,the statute instructs that such a party has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.an appellate court reviews de novo a trial court decision to grant a summary judgment motion.panagotacos bank of america th,d.
general principles concerning a dangerous condition of public property 
a public entity like the city is not liable for an injury arising out of an act or omission of the public entity or its employees except as provided by statute,subd.a.the sole statutory basis for imposing liability on public entities as property owners is government code section.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,brenner city of el cajon th,d.under that statute,a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury,that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition,that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred,and that either a a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition or b the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.the element at issue here is the existence of a dangerous condition.
a dangerous condition is defined as a condition of property that creates a substantial as distinguished from a minor,trivial or insignificant risk of injury when such property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used,subd.a.the existence of a dangerous condition is ordinarily a question of fact but can be decided as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.bonanno central contra costa transit authority cal th,d.the legislature has specified that a condition is not dangerous if the trial or appellate court,viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff,determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the condition was of such a minor,trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding circumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created a substantial risk of injury when such property was used with due care in a manner which was reasonably foreseeable that it would be used.
a claim alleging a dangerous condition may not rely on generalized allegations citation but must specify in what manner the condition constituted a dangerous condition.brenner city of el cajon,supra,th at,d.a plaintiff allegations,and ultimately the evidence,must establish a physical deficiency in the property itself.zelig county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,brenner,supra,th at,d.a dangerous condition exists when public property is physically damaged,deteriorated,or defective in such a way as to foreseeably endanger those using the property itself,or possesses physical characteristics in its design,location,features or relationship to its surroundings that endanger users.bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th at,d.
a public entity may be liable for a dangerous condition of public property even where the immediate cause of plaintiff injury is a third party negligent or illegal act like urzua grossly negligent driving if some physical characteristic of the property exposes its users to increased danger from third party negligence or criminality.bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th at,d.but it is insufficient to show only harmful third party conduct,like the conduct of a motorist.t hird party conduct,by itself,unrelated to the condition of the property,does not constitute a dangerous condition for which a public entity may be held liable.zelig county of los angeles,supra,at,d.there must be a defect in the physical condition of the property and that defect must have some causal relationship to the third party conduct that injures the plaintiff.id.at,d.p ublic liability lies under government code section only when a feature of the public property has increased or intensified the danger to users from third party conduct.bonanno,supra,at,d.
c.the city intersection was not in a dangerous condition 
plaintiffs identified seven features that allegedly made the city intersection dangerous the crosswalk was painted white,not yellow there was no sign painted in the approaching roadway with the words xing there was no traffic signal there were no crossing guards signs warning of the presence of student pedestrians were either missing or in an incorrect position the crosswalk was not painted with diagonal or longitudinal lines and there were no blinking lights in the pavement along the parallel painted lines of the crosswalk.the trial court,after viewing the evidence most favorably to plaintiffs,concluded that the risk created by the identified features of the intersection was of such a minor,trivial,or insignificant nature that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created a substantial risk of injury.the trial court was correct.
most of plaintiffs allegations of a dangerous crosswalk rest on the claim that the crosswalk was mismarked as a standard pedestrian crosswalk white paint instead of a school pedestrian crosswalk yellow paint with additional signage.plaintiffs rely upon vehicle code section,which provides whenever a marked pedestrian crosswalk has been established in a roadway contiguous to a school building or the grounds thereof,it shall be painted or marked in yellow as shall be all the marked pedestrian crosswalks at an intersection in case any one of the crosswalks is required to be marked in yellow.other established marked pedestrian crosswalks may be painted or marked in yellow if either a the nearest point of the crosswalk is not more than feet from a school building or the grounds thereof,or b the nearest point of the crosswalk is not more than feet from a school building or the grounds thereof,there are no intervening crosswalks other than those contiguous to the school grounds,and it appears that the facts and circumstances require special painting or marking of the crosswalks for the protection and safety of persons attending the school.there shall be painted or marked in yellow on each side of the street in the lane or lanes leading to all yellow marked crosswalks the following words,xing,except that such words shall not be painted or marked in any lane leading to a crosswalk at an intersection controlled by stop signs,traffic signals,or yield signs.a crosswalk shall not be painted or marked yellow at any location other than as required or permitted in this section.
plaintiffs claim the subject crosswalk is contiguous with school grounds and thus vehicle code section required that the crosswalk be painted yellow instead of white and have xing painted in the roadway instead of ped xing.plaintiffs expert traffic engineer also opined that,as a school crossing with heavy motor vehicle traffic,the crosswalk should have had additional signs warning of the presence of student pedestrians,a roadway painted with diagonal or longitudinal lines within the intersection,and blinking lights set in the pavement along the parallel painted lines of the crosswalk.
plaintiffs rely on vehicle code section in two respects.first,plaintiffs claim the city was under a mandatory duty to comply with the vehicle code,as an enactment designed to protect against the injuries plaintiffs suffered.second,plaintiffs claim the intersection nonconformity with vehicle code section is evidence that the intersection was in a dangerous condition.the first claim is not cognizable on appeal.to assert liability under government code section for breach of a mandatory duty,a plaintiff must specifically allege liability in his or her complaint and identify the applicable statute or regulation that imposes the alleged mandatory duty.washington county of contra costa th,d.while plaintiffs mention vehicle code section in their operative third amended complaint,they do not specifically allege violation of a mandatory duty under government code section.the pleadings limit the issues on a motion for summary judgment fpi development,nakashima d,and theories that were not fully developed in the trial court can not create a triable issue on appeal uriarte united states pipe foundry th,d.
in any event,plaintiffs reliance on vehicle code section to create a mandatory duty or to demonstrate a dangerous misplaced because the statute is inapplicable.the intersection was not contiguous to school grounds and thus vehicle code did not require demarcation in yellow paint and additional signage warning of a school crossing.the location of the crosswalk relative to the school grounds is not in dispute,and thus the applicability of vehicle code section is a question of law.lewis city of los angeles d.lewis.the evidence establishes that the only entrance to the school was on avenue,three blocks from the avenue crosswalk where plaintiffs were injured.the subject crosswalk was about feet from the periphery of undeveloped school property.at the time of the accident,the school was still under construction and the nearest school property to the crosswalk was an empty lot surrounded by a tall chain link fence.the lot has subsequently been developed into a gated parking lot.
plainly,the school grounds were not contiguous with the crosswalk roadway if the primary meaning of applied.collegiate dictionary online,www.merriam webster.com dictionary contiguous as of.plaintiffs argue for a looser meaning of contiguous to mean simply near,rather than physically touching.there is some support for their position.lewis,supra,d at.
in lewis,the court held that the word contiguous,as used in vehicle code section,does not require an actual physical touching between the crosswalk roadway and school grounds.lewis,supra,d at.there need only be a natural relationship,a physical relationship between the roadway,the crosswalk,and the school because the purpose of the statute is to protect school children.ibid.we question whether this is a proper interpretation of vehicle code section.while the statute was undoubtedly meant to protect school children,and perhaps deserves a broad interpretation to effectuate that intent,the statute also clearly establishes three categories of crosswalks crosswalks contiguous with school grounds that shall be painted yellow,crosswalks that are within a specified distance of school grounds that may be painted yellow,and all other crosswalks which shall not be painted yellow.the statutory distinction between crosswalks contiguous to school grounds that shall be painted yellow and those within feet of school grounds that may be painted yellow suggests that only those crosswalks actually touching school grounds must be painted yellow.for roadways near but not touching school grounds,yellow crosswalks are discretionary.if vehicle code section is interpreted to mandate yellow crosswalks on roadways that are near schools and have a natural relationship to school grounds,how are we to understand the provision allowing discretion for the establishment of crosswalks on roadways within feet of school grounds 
even if we accept the lewis court broad interpretation of contiguous in vehicle code section,the subject crosswalk was not contiguous to school grounds.the lewis court found no natural relationship between a crosswalk and school grounds,and thus no contiguity,where the crosswalk was feet from school grounds and separated by a city block.lewis,supra,d at.there is likewise no natural relationship between the crosswalk and school grounds at issue here.the crosswalk is feet from the nearest school property,and that property was an undeveloped lot providing no student access.the only school entrance was three blocks from the crosswalk.the crosswalk was not contiguous to school grounds,and thus need not have been painted yellow and marked with additional school crossing signs.
moreover,drivers of vehicles are required to yield the to pedestrians in any marked crosswalk,whether they are painted white or yellow.moritz city of santa clara d.in moritz,the court affirmed summary judgment for a city defendant where plaintiffs,pedestrians walking in a yellow crosswalk at night,were struck by a motorist.id.at.plaintiffs argued that the yellow crosswalk constituted a dangerous condition of public property because motorists would think that the crosswalk was only operational during school hours.id.at.the court rejected the argument,noting that motorists must yield to pedestrians in any crosswalk and that plaintiffs were endangered by the motorist violation of the law,not the color of the crosswalk.id.at.the same applies here.any risk to pedestrians created by the color of the crosswalk markings was of such a minor,trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding circumstances that no person would conclude that the condition created a substantial risk of injury.
plaintiffs reliance on other features of the intersection to prove that it was in a dangerous condition is similarly misplaced.the lack of a traffic signal at the intersection does not constitute proof of a dangerous condition.a condition is not dangerous merely because of the failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals,brenner city of el cajon,supra,th at,d.nor does the lack of crossing guards prove a dangerous condition.the presence or absence of crossing guards is not a physical characteristic of the intersection and thus not actionable as a dangerous condition.a lack of human supervision and protection is not a deficiency in the physical characteristics of public property.see zelig county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,lack of police screening at courthouse not a dangerous condition of property bartell palos verdes peninsula sch.dist.d.lack of supervision at school playground not a dangerous condition of property.as the city argues on appeal an intersection is not dangerous because there are no crossing needs crossing guards because it is dangerous.plaintiffs may not presuppose the dangerousness of the intersection and then fault the city for not posting crossing guards.moreover,crossing guards provide essentially a police function in providing traffic control and enforcement of traffic laws.wright arcade school dist.d.public entities are immune from liability for asserted failures to provide police and security services,zelig,supra,at,d.
the trial court rightly found,as a matter of law,that the city intersection at international boulevard and avenue did not create a dangerous condition.while the existence of a dangerous condition is ordinarily a question of fact,the issue can be decided as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.bonanno central contra costa transit authority,supra,cal th at,d.applying that principle,a number of courts have found in similar contexts that a dangerous condition did not exist,city of san diego superior court th,d racing motorist struck another motorist brenner city of el cajon,supra,th,d motorist struck pedestrian antenor city of los angeles d.motorist struck pedestrians.plaintiffs argument that the allegedly dangerous features of the city intersection must be considered in combination does not alter our conclusion.whether considered independently or cumulatively,the identified features of the intersection did not create a dangerous condition.
general principles of school district responsibility for students outside school 
school districts and their employees have never been considered insurers of the physical safety of their students,but rather are placed under a general duty to supervise the conduct of children on school grounds during school sessions,school activities,and lunch periods.bartell palos verdes peninsula sch,supra,d at.see hoff vacaville unified school dist.cal th,d,duty to supervise students.early california cases consistently held that a school district has no duty to safeguard students traveling,on their own,to and from school,gilbert sacramento unified school dist.d.student killed by train while walking home from school wright arcade school,supra,d at.student injured by motorist while walking to school kerwin county of san mateo d.student injured in fall from bicycle on way home from school girard monrovia city school dist.d,student killed by motorist while walking home from school.
in,the legislature enacted a law endorsing the common law principle that a school district is not legally responsible for accidents to students on their way to and from school,hereafter,section hoyem manhattan beach city sch.dist.cal d,hoyem.section provides notwithstanding any other provision of this code,no school district,city or county board of education,county superintendent of schools,or any officer or employee of such district or board shall be responsible or in any way liable for the conduct or safety of any pupil of the public schools at any time when such pupil is not on school property,unless such district,board,or person has undertaken to provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises,has undertaken a activity off the premises of such school,has otherwise specifically assumed such responsibility or liability or has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.in the event of such a specific undertaking,the district,board,or person shall be liable or responsible for the conduct or safety of any pupil only while such pupil is or should be under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board.
a close reading of section discloses a linguistic ambiguity,and that ambiguity has emboldened plaintiffs to argue that section does not endorse the early common law principle that a school district has no duty to safeguard students outside school premises and supervision but instead subjects school districts to general negligence liability whenever the school district fails to exercise reasonable care.the ambiguity arises in the long first sentence of the statutory provision,where the legislature provides that no school district is liable for the safety of any pupil not on school property,unless such district has undertaken to provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises,has undertaken a activity off the premises of such school,has otherwise specifically assumed such liability or has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances,italics added.does the reasonable care phrase establish the standard of care applicable to specific undertakings and assumptions of duty like transportation,or does the phrase itself establish a duty of care and thus make a district liable for any negligence,anywhere as plaintiffs argue despite some early confusion on the point,the weight of authority holds that the reasonable care phrase does not create a common law form of general negligence it refers to the failure to exercise reasonable care during one of the mentioned undertakings.bassett lakeside inn,th,d.
e.a statement of law made when issuing an alternative writ without a written opinion is not law of the case 
the district maintains that no further discussion of section is necessary on appeal.the district argues that a prior proceeding in this case determined that section does not create general negligence liability,and the prior determination is law of the case binding on appeal.the law of the case doctrine states that when,in deciding an appeal,an appellate court states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision,that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress,both in the lower court and upon subsequent appeal.kowis howard cal th,d.the doctrine has limited application to pretrial writ proceedings id.at,d,and has no application here.
in earlier proceedings,the district petitioned for a writ of mandate to this court,seeking an order directing the trial court to grant its motion to strike allegations of negligence from plaintiffs first amended complaint.the district asserted immunity for student injuries under education code section.we issued an alternative writ directing the trial court to reconsider its denial of the district motion in light of authorities we cited,or to show cause why it should not be compelled to do so.in issuing the writ,we stated there are limited exceptions to the immunity provided by section.those exceptions require a specific undertaking by the school district and direct supervision by a district employee.
the trial court reconsidered its ruling and granted the motion to strike,with an opportunity to amend the complaint.plaintiff third amended complaint which alleges a specific undertaking survived demurrer but was defeated by summary judgment,with which we are now concerned.the district argues that this court statement of law in issuing the alternative writ is law of the case.the district is mistaken.a bsent a written opinion following issuance of the alternative writ,this court reasoning in issuing the alternative writ is not the law of the case binding on appeal.ross san francisco bay area rapid transit dist.th,fn,d.we must consider the legal issues anew.we do,however,reach the same conclusion.
education code section does not create general negligence liability 
plaintiffs argument that section imposes a form of general negligence upon school districts is founded upon the first judicial interpretation of the statute in,by a sharply divided california supreme court.hoyem,supra,cal d at,dis.opns.of clark,richardson and mosk.in hoyem,a student who departed school during school hours without permission was injured when struck by a motorcycle.id.at.the student and his mother sued the school district,alleging that if the school had provided adequate supervision then the student would never have left school and been injured.id.at,fn.the court had to determine whether a school district may ever be held liable when,as a result of school authorities negligent supervision of students on school premises,a pupil leaves the school grounds during school hours and is subsequently injured by a motorist.id.at,italics added.the court held the district may be liable if plaintiffs can prove that the pupil injury was proximately caused by the school district negligent supervision.id.at.the high court emphasized that it was concerned with alleged negligence while the student was under direct school supervision at school and not negligence before or after school hours we merely reaffirm that school districts must exercise reasonable care in supervising their pupils while the pupils are on school premises.id.at,italics added.the school district had argued that it was immune from liability for any injury incurred off school premises.id.at.the court rejected the argument,and remarked that the defendant district emphasis on the situs of the injury is totally misplaced.contrary to defendant assertion,no california decision suggests that when a school district fails to properly supervise a student on school premises,the district can automatically escape liability simply because the student ultimate injury occurs off school property.id.at,italics in original.
in reaching its conclusion,the hoyem court addressed section.hoyem,supra,cal d at.the court found the statute inapplicable,in that plaintiffs alleged school responsibility for a pupil while the pupil was on school premises.id.at.in contrast,section,is principally concerned with limiting a school district liability for injuries to pupils either before or after school hours while children were either going to school or coming home after school.id.at.the court observed that section in no way limits a school district responsibility to supervise students during school hours on school premises id.at.
the court recognized that the intent of section is to continue the common law rule restricting a school district liability for accidents to students going to or from school after school hours.hoyem,supra,at.but the court also made some additional remarks about section that have engendered confusion over the last years.in rejecting the district claim that section provides blanket immunity for injuries unless the school undertakes to furnish supervision or sponsors an activity,the court stated a lthough the initial portion of the statute provides that no school district shall be responsible for the conduct or safety of any pupil at any time when such pupil is not on school property,the section goes on explicitly to withdraw this grant of immunity whenever the school district,inter alia,has failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.plaintiffs complaint alleges that the school district failed to exercise reasonable care.assuming,as we must on appeal from a sustained demurrer,the truth of the allegations of the complaint citations,section,by its own terms,does not bar liability in the present case.id.at,italics in original,fn.omitted.the court further remarked that the intent of the legislature in adding the reasonable care exception is clear when a school district fails to exercise reasonable care the immunity of this section evaporates.id.at,fn.
the hoyem court statements about section are problematic.on the one hand,we are told the legislature intended section to free school districts from liability for accidents to students en route to school,consistent with the common law.hoyem,supra,cal d at.on the other hand,we are told the legislature intended to hold school districts liable for every failure to exercise reasonable care.id.at.which of these apparently conflicting interpretations of section are we to follow 
litigants and jurists have grappled with this problem for years.the consensus of decisions from the court of appeal is that section limits the liability of schools for,activity,absent a specific undertaking.guerrero south bay union school dist.th,d.the portion of section that refers to failing to exercise reasonable care does not create a common law form of general negligence it refers to the failure to exercise reasonable care during one of the mentioned undertakings.bassett lakeside inn,supra,th at,d.with a single exception joyce simi valley unified school dist.th,d,every court that has considered the matter since hoyem,supra,cal d,has interpreted section to provide that school districts are not responsible for the safety of students outside school property absent a specific undertaking by the school district and direct supervision by a district employee.bassett,supra,th,d mosley san bernardino city unified school dist.th,d guerrero,supra,th,d ramirez long beach unified school dist.th,d wolfe dublin unified school dist.th,d torsiello oakland unified school dist.d.torsiello.
plaintiffs argument that section establishes school district liability whenever a school district fails to exercise reasonable care is an argument this court considered,and rejected,over twenty years ago.torsiello,supra,d,at.in torsiello,we considered section provision that no school district is liable for the safety of any pupil not on school property,unless such district has undertaken to provide transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises,has undertaken a
