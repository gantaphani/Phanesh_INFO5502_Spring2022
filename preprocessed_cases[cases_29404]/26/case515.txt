tennessee middle school students sued various officials of the overton county,tennessee,public school system under and others,alleging that the defendant school authorities violated the students constitutional right to privacy by installing and operating video surveillance equipment in the boys and girls locker rooms in livingston middle school lms,and by viewing and retaining the recorded images.
the defendant overton county school board members,the director of schools,the lms principal,and the assistant principal,moved for summary judgment claiming qualified immunity.the district court denied their motions and they now appeal.
we conclude that the district court correctly denied summary judgment to the school officials,who are not entitled to claim the defense of qualified immunity,and incorrectly denied summary judgment to the defendant board members and the director of schools,who are immune.
in an effort to improve security at lms,the overton county school board approved the installation of video surveillance equipment throughout the school building.the school board engaged the education technology firm,edutech,to install cameras and monitoring equipment.the board ordered the director of schools,william needham,to oversee the project.needham delegated his authority for the installation of the monitoring equipment to the lms principal,melinda beatty,who delegated her authority to the assistant principal,robert jolley.none of the defendants promulgated any guidelines,written or otherwise,determining the number,location,or operation of the surveillance cameras.
after several meetings,assistant principal jolley and an edutech representative decided to install the cameras throughout the school in areas facing the exterior doors,in hallways leading to exterior doors,and in the boys and girls locker rooms.the cameras were installed and were operational by july.
the images captured by the cameras were transmitted to a computer terminal in jolley office where they were displayed and were stored on the computer hard drive.jolley testified that,in september,he discovered that the locker room cameras were videotaping areas in which students routinely dressed for athletic activities.he said that he immediately notified principal beatty of the situation and suggested that the placement of the cameras be changed.but,the cameras were not removed nor were their locations changed for the remainder of the fall semester.
in addition to jolley receiving the images on his computer,they were also accessible via remote internet connection.any person with access to the software username,password,and internet protocol ip address could access the stored images.neither jolley nor anyone else had ever changed the system password or username from its default setting.the record indicates that the system was accessed different times between july,and january,including through internet service providers located in rock hill,south carolina clarksville,tennessee and gainsboro,tennessee.
during a girls basketball game at lms on january,visiting team members from allons elementary school noticed the camera in the girls locker room and brought this to the attention of their coach,kathy carr.carr questioned principal beatty,who assured carr that the camera was not activated.in fact,the camera was activated and had recorded images of the allons team members in their undergarments when they changed their clothes.after the game,carr reported the camera incident to the allons school principal,who contacted defendant needham later that evening.needham immediately accessed the security system from his home and viewed the recorded images.the following morning,january,needham,beatty,and two other officials viewed the images in needham office by remote access.needham later stated that in his opinion,the videotapes of the to year old girls contained nothing more than images of a few bras and panties.school employees removed the locker room cameras later that day.
from july to january,when the cameras were operational,a number of children from overton county schools and schools from the surrounding counties used the lms locker rooms for athletic events and were videotape recorded while changing their clothes.
the plaintiffs insist at the outset that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear the defendants appeal because denial of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity does not constitute a final decision under.it is true that as a general rule,a denial of summary judgment is not an appealable final judgment.solomon auburn hills police dep t,cir,but there are exceptions,and this case presents one of them.
the law is that an order denying a defendant public official a right to assert a defense of qualified immunity is the procedural equivalent of an appealable final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d williams mehra,cir en banc.qualified immunity is not a mere defense to liability it is a rule of law that the defendant public official is immune to suit and any obligation to defend it.mitchell,at.if a public official is unable to appeal the denial of qualified immunity immediately,he would be forced to endure the cost,expense,and inconvenience of defending an action to which he may be immune.to require him to delay his appeal challenging the trial court rejection of his qualified immunity defense until the underlying liability issue is determined,would defeat one of the very purposes for which the doctrine exists.thus,we have jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity,but only to the extent the appeal turns on an issue of law.estate of carter city of detroit,cir.for purposes of this appeal,the appellants have conceded the plaintiffs version of the facts and raise only the issue of the students right to privacy from videotaping under the fourth amendment.
for these reasons,we are satisfied that the order rejecting the defendants claim of qualified immunity is a final judgment and that we have jurisdiction to entertain the defendants appeal.we proceed,now,to the substantive issue.
congress enacted to permit an injured person to recover in federal court against defendants who violate a plaintiff federal statutory or constitutional rights while acting under color of state law.neuens city of columbus,cir.there is no dispute in this case that the defendant school officials were acting under color of state law when they authorized the installation and operation of the security cameras at lms.however,public officials are entitled to be dismissed from a lawsuit on qualified immunity grounds if they can show that they did not violate any of the plaintiff federal statutory or constitutional rights that were clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct and of which the defendants could reasonably be expected to have been aware.see saucier katz,d.
on appeal of a district court order denying summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds,we consider all the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and review de novo the district court determination on the legal question of the availability of qualified immunity.solomon,at.the approach we take in determining whether the defendants are entitled to claim the legal defense of qualified immunity is to decide whether a constitutional right of the students was violated and whether the constitutional right violated was clearly established and one of which the defendants can reasonably be expected to have been aware.beard whitmore lake sch,cir.
the students argue that their constitutionally protected right to privacy encompasses the right not to be videotaped while dressing and undressing in school athletic locker place specifically designated by the school authorities for such intimate,personal activity.the plaintiffs also argue that the basis of their privacy right resides in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment as well as in the fourth amendment as made applicable to the states through incorporation into the fourteenth amendment.we conclude that the privacy right involved here is one protected by the fourth amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches,and that in this case,the defendants violated the students rights under the amendment.
before explaining our fourth amendment analysis,we think it might be useful to explain why we do not assess the students privacy claims under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.this court has held that the constitutional right to privacy,which includes the right to shield one body from exposure to viewing by the opposite sex,derives from the fourth amendment,rather than the due process clause.see cornwell dahlberg,cir kent johnson,cir.we are aware that some circuits have found that the same privacy right is located in the due process clause.see everson michigan of corrections,cir citing other circuits.however,since the fourth amendment approach is the precedent in this circuit,and the supreme court seems to prefer it,infra,we will follow our precedent.
the fourth amendment to the united states constitution provides that the federal government shall not violate t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures const.amend.iv.the supreme court has held that the fourth amendment applies in the public school context to protect students from unconstitutional searches conducted by school officials.see vernonia sch.dist.acton,d new jersey,d.
neither the supreme court nor this court has ever addressed the applicability of video surveillance to the fourth amendment proscription against unreasonable searches.however,the supreme court has applied the amendment guarantees to practices that were not in existence at the time the amendment was enacted and has instructed that in such cases,the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of such searches is one of reasonableness.vernonia,at.some other courts that have considered the constitutional implications of video surveillance have held that such practices are subject to the strictures of the fourth amendment.see united states gonzalez,cir united states falls,cir and united states,cir.
this court has considered the constitutional implications of surveillance policies in the context of prison security.in kent,there was the question whether a policy allowing female prison guards to observe male inmates in the shower and in various states of undress violated the privacy right under the fourth amendment.we noted that n either the supreme court nor the sixth circuit has ever expressly recognized that the fourth amendment right to privacy encompasses the right to shield one naked body from view by members of the opposite sex.kent,at.we concluded,however 
perhaps it is merely an abundance of common experience that leads inexorably to the conclusion that there must be a fundamental constitutional right to be free from forced exposure of one person to strangers of the opposite sex when not reasonably necessary for some legitimate,overriding reason,for the obverse would be repugnant to notions of human decency and personal integrity.
id.before kent,we had not articulated the fourth amendment protection as extending to the right to shield one naked body from view by members of the opposite sex.but,since kent,we have recognized this privacy right.see beard,at cornwell,at.we recognize,of course,that this is not a case of naked bodies being viewed by the surveillance cameras,but rather underwear clad teen and boys and girls.however,the difference is one of degree,rather than of kind.
our conclusion,mentioned earlier,that the method of surveillance involved in this governed by the fourth amendment,is informed by the supreme court reasoning in vernonia and,in which the court addressed the constitutional prerequisites of valid school searches.the standards for testing the constitutionality of searches in the public school setting depend,to considerable extent,on the context.as the court pointedly observed in vernonia,the students fourth amendment rights are different in public schools than elsewhere the reasonableness inquiry can not disregard the schools custodial and tutelary responsibility for children.vernonia,at.in,the court offered a framework for analyzing this issue that we think is helpful in this case first,we consider whether the state installation of the cameras was justified at its inception and second,whether the the videotaped surveillance as actually conducted was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the in the first place,at.quoting terry ohio,d.
a student search is justified in its inception when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will garner evidence that a student has violated or is violating the law or the rules of the school,or is in imminent danger of injury on school premises.id.at.in this case,the policy of setting up video surveillance equipment throughout the school was instituted for the sake of increasing security,which is an appropriate and common sense purpose and not one subject to our judicial veto.however,the scope and manner in which the video surveillance was conducted is subject to fourth amendment limitations,and therefore,appropriate for our inquiry.
a there can be no dispute that videotaping students in a school locker room is a search under the fourth permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.id.emphasis added.it is a matter of balancing the scope and the manner in which the search is conducted in light of the students reasonable expectations of privacy,the nature of the intrusion,and the severity of the school officials need in enacting such policies,beard,at,including particularly,any history of injurious behavior that could reasonably suggest the need for the challenged intrusion.
to meet the requirements imposed by the constitution,the method chosen by the defendants to improve school building security in this case need not have been the only method available or even the one this court might have chosen it is necessary,however,that the method chosen was,in the circumstances,justifiably intrusive in light of the purpose of the policy being carried out.
the fourth amendment does not protect all expectations of privacy only those that society recognizes as reasonable and legitimate,at.the supreme court has acknowledged that generally,students have a less robust expectation of privacy than is afforded the general population.id.at.powell,concurring.indeed,this expectation may be even less for student athletes in locker rooms,which the court has previously observed are places not notable for the privacy they afford.vernonia,at.
this does not mean,however,that a student expectation of privacy in his or her school locker room is nonexistent.in fact,we have stated before that even in locker rooms,students retain a significant privacy interest in their unclothed bodies.beard,at.unlike the situation in vernonia,where the students and their parents were well aware that participation in school sports was conditioned on the students submitting to the drug testing policies,neither the students nor their parents in this case were aware of the video surveillance in the locker rooms,to say nothing of the videotaping.further,while the court in vernonia pointed out the lower level of privacy typically associated with school locker rooms,we are satisfied that students using the lms locker rooms could reasonably expect that no one,especially the school administrators,would videotape them,without their knowledge,in various states of undress while they changed their clothes for an athletic activity.
video surveillance is inherently intrusive.as one authority has put it,a video camera sees all,and forgets nothing.constitutionality of secret video surveillance.in vernonia,the supreme court addressed the intrusiveness of a procedure employed for obtaining urine samples from students in order to conduct drug screening.the male students produced urine samples at a urinal along a wall while a male monitor watched from a distance.the female students produced samples in individual enclosed stalls while a female monito
