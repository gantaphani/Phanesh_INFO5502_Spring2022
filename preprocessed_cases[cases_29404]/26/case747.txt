on may,the arkansas state board of education ordered the consolidation of the lake view school district with the school district under act,a law enacted by the arkansas general assembly in its second extraordinary session of act required school districts with an average daily membership of fewer than students to be consolidated with or annexed by another school district.after the board consolidation order took effect,the plaintiffs in this action collectively,friends of lake view sued the governor of arkansas,the commissioner of the arkansas department of education,the arkansas state board of education,and the state of arkansas,alleging numerous violations of federal and state law.friends of lake view appeal the district court grant of the defendants motion to dismiss.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
on june,the arkansas supreme court issued its opinion in lake view school district huckabee lake view,the latest iteration in a series of cases dealing with the financing of public education in arkansas the court had previously held that the state public education system did not meet the requirements of the arkansas constitution,including the absolute duty to provide an adequate education to each school child.lake view sch.dist.huckabee lake view.in lake view,the court found that the arkansas general assembly and the arkansas department of education had complied with the court order in lake view by taking significant remedial action.see lake view,at.accordingly,the arkansas supreme court released jurisdiction over the litigation and ordered its mandate to issue.id.at.
on october,friends of lake view sued in federal court,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as damages,restitution,and attorney fees.although the complaint included eleven separate causes of action,the only claim that friends of lake view address on appeal challenges the constitutionality of act under the fourteenth amendment.
on june,the arkansas supreme court recalled its mandate in the lake view litigation and appointed special masters to evaluate whether governor huckabee and the other defendants had complied with the court previous orders.lake view sch.dist.huckabee lake view.thereafter,the district court denied friends of lake view motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from implementing act.friends of lakeview sch.dist.incorporation huckabee,wl,at.while both sides insisted that this action did not involve the same issues as the proceedings,the district court announced that it would abstain from taking further action under the younger doctrine pending completion of the proceedings before the arkansas supreme court.id.at.
the arkansas supreme court stayed the issuance of its mandate until december.lake view,at.on november,the court stayed the issuance of its mandate for another days.lake view sch.dist.huckabee lake view.finally,on may,the arkansas supreme court concluded that arkansas system of financing is now in constitutional compliance and ordered its mandate to issue.id.at.
on october,the district court reopened this case for the limited purpose of determining jurisdiction and claim preclusion under the full faith and credit statute.friends of lakeview sch.dist.incorporation huckabee,wl,at.the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under the doctrine the defendants argued in the alternative that some of the claims raised in friends of lake view complaint were barred by sovereign immunity and that other claims were barred by the preclusive effect of the lake view litigation before the arkansas supreme court.
on april,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss.in lieu of issuing a full opinion,the district court adopted a order issued by a different judge in a different case.friends of lakeview sch.dist.incorporation huckabee,wl,at,adopting friends of eudora pub.sch.dist.beebe,wl.friends of lake view appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss.schaaf residential funding,cir,cert.denied,d.the reviewing court must accept as true all factual allegations set out in the complaint.hastings wilson,cir.an action may be dismissed under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure if the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.schaaf,at.
at the outset,we note that friends of lake view object to the manner in which the district court dismissed this action.to be sure,friends of eudora involved many of the same issues that were raised in the present case,including the doctrine,issue and claim preclusion,failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and sovereign immunity.on the other hand,friends of eudora involved different parties,different facts,a different procedural history,some different claims,and some different arguments.as a result of those differences,some of the court reasoning in friends of eudora was plainly inapplicable here nevertheless,we find that a remand is not warranted in this instance because we may affirm the district court grant of the defendants motion to dismiss on any basis supported by the record,phipps fdic,cir citing migliaccio int l,in re int l.sec.litig,cir.
we turn next to the defendants argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction over this action due to the operation of the doctrine.the basic theory of the doctrine is that only the united states supreme court has been given jurisdiction to review a decision,so federal district courts generally lack jurisdiction over attempted appeals from a judgment.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at,ed see dornheim sholes,cir.the supreme court has made clear that the doctrine occupies a narrow ground.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.more specifically,the court held in exxon mobil that the doctrine is confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.id.and we have held that the doctrine does not bar federal claims brought in federal court when a state court previously presented with the same claims declined to reach their merits.simes huckabee,cir see also riehm engelking,cir.
friends of lake view do not claim to be aggrieved by the outcome of the lake view litigation hence,this action is not an attempt to appeal from an adverse judgment.friends of lake view instead complain of injuries resulting from the consolidation of the lake view school district under act.that fact alone would seem to foreclose the defendants argument that the doctrine applies.see exxon mobil,at.see also riehm,at.
still,the defendants contend that friends of lake view challenge to the constitutionality of act was raised,briefed,and rejected in lake view,so a federal judgment in favor of friends of lake view would effectively overrule the arkansas supreme court contrary decision while the constitutionality of act does appear to have been raised and briefed in lake view by the lake view school district,the arkansas supreme court did not decide the issue one way or the other.instead,after noting that the lake view school district had asked the court to retain jurisdiction in order to declare act unconstitutional,lake view,at,the court released jurisdiction and ordered its mandate to issue without addressing the claim on the merits,id.at.this too would seem to foreclose the defendants argument that the doctrine applies.see simes,at riehm,at.
the defendants suggest,however,that the arkansas supreme court implicitly decided that act comported with the fourteenth amendment,since the court could not otherwise have determin ed that the state complied with its obligation to provide arkansas children with an adequate and substantially equal education.but the state obligation to provide an adequate and substantially equal education arises under article of the arkansas constitution,not the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.see lake view,at w e conclude that the clear language of article imposes upon the state an absolute constitutional duty to educate our children id.the critical point is that the state has an absolute duty under our constitution t
