factual and procedural background 
ryan hayes,who was years old at the time of the underlying litigation,suffers from autism.he has been receiving service agency services since he was two years old.on december,alta california regional center alta notified hayes parents it was denying ongoing funding for the educational portion of their son discrete trial program because the goals of the program were educational and not the regional center s responsibility to fund.it informed them they could file an appeal with the department of developmental services on the enclosed fair hearing request form.
on december,hayes parents filled out the fair hearing request form.an alj from oah conducted the hearing in february and march of.on june,the alj issued an order affirming alta decision,reasoning that alta could terminate funding for the educational portion of hayes discrete trial program because the local school district was responsible for teaching hayes the majority of skills that were goals of the program.the alj informed the parties that his order was a final administrative decision by which they were bound and either party could appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction within days.
on september,days after the alj had issued his filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court.hayes named himself as petitioner,the department and its director as respondents,and alta as the real party in interest.
alta answered the petition and raised as an affirmative defense hayes failure to join oah its director as a party or parties.alta requested that the court dismiss the petition and enter judgment against hayes.
the department filed a notice of appearance stating it would not take an active part in the litigation.it also noted that hayes had failed to name oah as a respondent or a real party in interest even though oah appear ed to be an indispensable or necessary party.
on february,the trial court dismissed hayes petition.the court reasoned that the decision being challenged was one made by an alj from oah and not one made by the department.if the court were to find the decision to be an abuse of discretion,the appropriate relief would be a writ of mandate directing the to set aside the decision and enter a new and different one consistent with the ruling of the court.however,hayes failed to name the as a party,the days to do so had passed,and effective relief could not be granted.the court conclude d that in equity and in good conscience the action should not proceed among the parties before it and that the action should be dismissed.
on march,the court entered judgment of dismissal against hayes.hayes filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
inecessary or indispensable parties 
hayes contends that oah is not a necessary or indispensable party to the action because oah acted as a neutral,judicial tribunal that had no discernable interest in the outcome of the writ of administrative mandamus proceedings.
alta and the department argue that oah is a necessary and indispensable party because,as the trial court reasoned,a writ granting hayes petition would have to be directed to oah and would be ineffective because oah is not a party to the action.we disagree.
a necessary party is one in whose absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties or who claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in its absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of those already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of its claimed interest.code of civ,subd.a.
a necessary party is regarded as indispensable if the court determines in good conscience the action must be dismissed in the party absence in light of the extent to which a judgment rendered in the party absence might be prejudicial to it or those already parties the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided whether a judgment rendered in the party absence will be adequate whether the plaintiff or will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.code civ,subd.b.
whether a party is necessary indispensable is a matter of trial court discretion in which the court weighs factors of practical realities and other considerations.kaczorowski mendocino county bd.of supervisors th,d see deltakeeper oakdale irrigation dist.th,d a determination that a party is necessary is the predicate for a determination of whether the party is indispensable.we review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.kaczorowski,at,d.
