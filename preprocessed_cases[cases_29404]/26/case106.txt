following disagreements over the iep for,the parent placed the student in a private school outside the district,and continued to privately obtain some but not all of the related services previously funded by the board.the board refused to pay for the private school or any related services on the ground that it ceased to be responsible for the student once he was enrolled outside the district.
the parent brought suit under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,alleging that the board offered an inadequate iep for and failed to offer any iep for and subsequent school years,thereby denying the student a free appropriate public education fape,see a.
the district court dismissed these claims.as to,the court ruled that the iep provided the student with a fape.as to and subsequent school years,the court ruled that the board violated the idea by failing to offer any ieps,but that the parent was not entitled to relief because the private school in which she enrolled the student was an inappropriate placement.
the court did award the parent some relief.citing the provision of the idea,j,which provides for a child continuance in the educational placement during the pendency of proceedings absent agreement otherwise,the court ruled that the board was in violation for failing to fund the related services described in the iep once the parties reached an impasse.accordingly,the court ordered the board to reimburse the parent for any such services she actually paid for out of pocket.
we affirm the judgment in most respects,but vacate the award of reimbursement and remand the case for further proceedings.we hold that the appropriate equitable relief for a violation is reimbursement or compensatory education or both for the full value of services that the educational agency was required to fund,not the lesser value of services the parent was able to afford.we further hold that an educational agency obligation to maintain placement is triggered when an administrative due process proceeding is initiated,not when an impasse is reached.
background 
the student was nine years old at the beginning of the school year.because of his autism,the student experiences difficulties with social interaction and communication,particularly,speech and reading.he and the parent both reside within the district in east lyme,connecticut.
the student attended public school in the district until december,when the board and the parent agreed on placement at hope academy,a private school.in,dissatisfied with the student progress at hope academy,the parent placed him at solomon schechter academy solomon in new london,connecticut.solomon is a private religious school that provides no specialized instruction to students with disabilities.the parent and the board agreed that the parent would pay the tuition at solomon,while the board would fund additional related services,such as specialized reading instruction and speech therapy,which would be delivered by private providers outside the classroom.
accordingly,the board issued an iep in december the iep,which provided that the parent would pay for tuition at solomon,while the board would pay for the following related services orton gillingham reading instruction,speech therapy,and therapy.in february,the parties amended the iep to increase speech therapy to hours per week.as discussed in greater detail below,it is this amended iep that furnishes the educational placement for purposes.
on june,the parent met with board representatives to discuss the placement.corinne berglund,the board director of special education,advised the parent that the board would not pay for tuition at solomon and suggested that the student be enrolled instead at niantic center school niantic,a public school in the district.the parties reached an impasse.a month later,the board issued an iep the iep placing the student at niantic or his local elementary school and offering a program that included a case manager,code emphasis reading that incorporates orton gillingham principles,speech therapy,occupational therapy,and physical therapy.the parent rejected the iep,advised the board that she would keep the student at solomon,and conveyed her expectation that the board would continue paying for related services.the demands for related services were based on recommendations by the student treating clinician,robert kemper.
the student continued to attend solomon during the school year,and was regularly pulled out of the classroom to receive special education services which solomon did not offer from private providers.the parent also arranged for the student to receive some instruction over the summer.the parent absorbed all of these educational expenses.
in august,the parent advised the board that,unless she received a satisfactory iep,she would continue the enrollment at solomon for,and demanded reimbursement of her expenses.the board refused,on the ground that the student enrollment at solomon terminated the board obligations under the idea.
on april,the parent filed an administrative due process complaint,which she temporarily withdrew,but then refiled,in september.see f,i.the parent alleged that the board failed to provide the student with a fape and violated various procedural requirements under the idea and connecticut law.the parent sought reimbursement of the tuition at solomon and the costs of the related services 
the administrative hearing officer ruled in favor of the board.the officer found inter alia that the board had offered a fape during the relevant school years,and that the lack of special education services at solomon made it an inappropriate placement.accordingly,the officer awarded no reimbursement.the parent then sought judicial review in the united states district court for the district of connecticut see i.
the parties for summary judgment on the basis of the administrative record.the district court arterton,ruled that as to,the board offered the student a fape,and that though the board failed to propose an iep for and the subsequent school years,the parent was not entitled to relief because solomon was an inappropriate placement 
however,the court concluded that the board violated the provision of the idea,j,by refusing to continue funding the related services described in the amended iep once the parties reached an impasse.the court held that the board obligation to fund those services triggered as of june,when impasse was reached,and ordered the board to reimburse the parent for related services she funded since that date.over the parent objection that the board owed more services than she had been able to afford,the court limited the amount of reimbursement to the parent expenses.
the parties.the board argues inter alia that the student enrollment at solomon terminated its obligations under the idea altogether,that it prevailed on the fape claim,and that liability for a violation is conditional on the parent prevailing on the fape claim.the parent argues inter alia that the board failed to provide a fape,and that solomon was an appropriate placement.the parties also contest the award of reimbursement on a number of grounds.most significantly,the board argues that the court improperly awarded reimbursement for services rendered before the parent initiated administrative due process proceedings,while the parent argues that the court should have awarded relief for the full value of the related services,not just the lesser value of services she was able to afford.
discussion 
the parent asserts two conceptually distinct claims i a claim based on the inadequacy of the iep,the board failure to issue ieps for later school years,and the appropriateness of solomon as an educational placement,see u.a and ii a claim based on the board refusal to fund related services described in the amended iep during the pendency of proceedings,see j.in connection with the claim,on which the parent prevailed below,both parties contest the appropriateness of the relief fashioned by the district court,see i c iii.

the parent argues that the student was denied a fape for the school year because the iep issued by the board that year was deficient both procedurally and substantively.we disagree.
the premise of the procedural claim is that the parent was deprived of the right to participate in the development of the iep,because it was issued after the last meeting at which she was present.
under the idea,the iep team responsible for developing an iep must include the child parents d b.in addition,e ach local educational agency or state educational agency shall ensure that the parents of each child with a disability are members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child.e see also b,c.agencies regs.the idea thus confers on parents a right of participation throughout the development of the iep.bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch,westchester cnty.rowley.at the same time,the duty to issue an iep remains with the educational agency,see d a,and a parent right of participation is not a right to veto the agency proposed iep,at.parental dissatisfaction is channeled through administrative and if necessary judicial proceedings.m.ex rel.voluntown bd.of,cir see i.
the parent right of participation was not violated.she fully participated in the june,meeting of the iep team at which the placement was discussed.nothing in the record suggests that the iep team ever met without her presence.
the argument comes down to whether the board could,after the meeting,issue an iep without the parent being physically present.we conclude that it could.the right of participation encompasses the right to offer input and to have that input considered it does not entail a right to be physically present throughout the agency own decisional process.see b participation right does not require parental presence at informal or unscheduled conversations involving public agency personnel or preparatory activities that public agency personnel engage in to develop a proposal.so long as a parent has a meaningful opportunity to offer input,parental rights to be part of the iep team,d b,and to participate in any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of the child,e,have been respected.see cerra,at finding no procedural violation where final iep was issued over two months after iep team meeting at which parent actively participated.
the parent substantive challenge to the adequacy of the iep is likewise rejected.to be substantively adequate,an iep must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits while an iep need not furnish every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child potential,it must be likely to produce progress that is more than trivial advancement.cerra,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.on this question,substantial deference is owed to the judgments of state administrative officers.id.at.c ourts lack the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.rowley,at internal quotation marks omitted see also gagliardo arlington cent.sch,cir cerra,at.
the iep offered placement at a public school niantic staffed with a special education teacher,as well as a case manager,code emphasis reading that incorporates orton gillingham principles,speech therapy,occupational therapy,and physical therapy.the administrative hearing officer concluded that this combination of placement and services was substantively adequate.we see no basis in the record to reject that conclusion.
for the foregoing reasons,the board provided the student with a fape for the school year.
the board refused to propose an iep for the school year or any of the subsequent school years the district court concluded that this amounted to a denial of a fape,but that in any event the parent was entitled to no relief because the student enrollment at solomon was itself inappropriate.we agree.
the board was required to offer the student an iep for and each of the following school years.the idea requires that a t the beginning of each school year,each local educational agency,state educational agency,or other state agency shall have in effect,for each child with a disability in the agency jurisdiction,an individualized education program.d a emphases added see also.it is undisputed that the student was,at all relevant times,resident in east lyme and within the board jurisdiction.the board therefore violated the idea by failing to offer ieps for these school years,and these violations deprived the student of a fape.w hen a child requires services,a school district failure to propose an iep of any kind is at least as serious a violation of its responsibilities under idea as a failure to provide an adequate iep.forest grove sch.dist.
the board argues that the student enrollment at solomon,outside of the district borders,terminated any obligations it owed under the idea.that is incorrect.a local educational agency duty to provide a fape is not ended by enrollment of a resident child in a private school outside the district.true,the educational agency in the jurisdiction where the private school is located may have its own obligations,most notably,the obligation to conduct child find.see a each local educational agency must locate,identify,and evaluate all children with disabilities who are enrolled by their parents in private schools located in the school district served by the agency.but the duty to offer a fape remains with the agency where the child resides and a fape can not be offered unless an iep is issued.see,if a determination is made by the local educational agency where the private school is located that a child needs special education and related services,the local educational agency where the child resides is responsible for making fape available to the child.emphasis added.
the idea thus provides that a local educational agency is relieved of its obligation to pay for a resident child private school tuition if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child elsewhere.a c i emphasis added see also frank,at.but without the benefit of an iep from the district of residence,a parent could not intelligently evaluate whether the child was offered a fape or elect to place the child elsewhere thus an educational agency must issue an iep for a resident qualifying child,even if that child has been enrolled in a private school outside the boundaries of the school district.
the board failure to provide a fape notwithstanding,the parent is entitled to relief only if she meets the burden of demonstrating that the private placement was appropriate.gagliardo,at.generally,the same considerations and criteria that apply in determining whether the school district placement is appropriate should be considered in determining the appropriateness of the parents placement accordingly,the private placement must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.frank,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the administrative hearing officer found that the placement at solomon was inappropriate because that school was not tailored to meet the student special needs,which had to be addressed by outside providers.true,a n appropriate private placement need not meet state education standards or requirements or provide certified special education teachers or an iep for the disabled student.frank,at see also carter,at.however,assessment of educational progress is a type of judgment for which the district court should defer to the administrative hearing officer educational experience.frank,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we see no reason to overturn the administrative officer finding,which is adequately supported by the record.a representative from solomon testified that the school did not offer any special education services and did not modify its curriculum to fit the student to receive the special instruction recommended by kemper,the student had to be pulled out of classes frequently the main benefits of solomon to the student were small class sizes and some modified grading procedures.but the former is the the kind of educational and environmental advantage that might be preferred by parents of any child,disabled or not.gagliardo,at.and the latter,while an accommodation,did not provide the special education services specifically needed by the student namely,an educational setting consistent with the clinician recommendation.id.at.solomon did not provide any of the specialized instruction recommended by kemper.
in summary the board denied the student a fape during the school year and subsequent school years the district court nevertheless properly awarded no relief as to that claim because enrollment at solomon was itself inappropriate for the student accordingly,and in light of our conclusion that the student received a fape for,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in the board favor on the fape claim.
we turn to the claim,on which the parent prevailed before the district court.
the provision of the idea provides that during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree,the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child.j.the purpose of the provision is to maintain the educational status quo while the parties dispute is being resolved.ex rel.cornwall cent.sch,cir.it therefore requires a school district to continue funding whatever educational placement was last agreed upon for the child until the relevant administrative and judicial proceedings are complete.id.at.
to determine a child educational placement,a court typically looks to the placement described in the child most recently implemented iep the operative placement actually functioning at the time when the stay put provision of the idea was invoked or the placement at the time of the previously implemented iep.mackey ex rel.thomas bd.of educ.for arlington cent.sch,cir internal quotation marks,ellipsis,and brackets omitted 
as the district court determined,the student placement was the placement described in the iep as amended in february,which was both the most recently implemented iep and the last one agreed upon by the parties.it is undisputed that the board refused to pay for the services described in that iep during the pendency of administrative and judicial proceedings.the board thus violated the provision.
the board arguments to the contrary are meritless.
first,the board argues that the parent should not be permitted to obtain reimbursement for tuition at solomon by unilaterally enrolling the student there.but the claim does not seek reimbursement of solomon tuition it seeks relief for the related services.
second,the board argues that the related services it agreed to fund did not form part of the student educational placement for.to the contrary,the idea defines free appropriate public education to include special education and related services,emphasis added and the term related services is defined to mean services that may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education,a emphasis added.we have applied the provision to payments for related services,at 
third,the board argues that the iep can not be a placement because the parties intended it to be a temporary arrangement.that is beside the point.the board obligation to fund placement is rooted in statute,not contract.the parties intent as to the duration of the iep or the february amendment to it therefore does not matter.
finally,the board contends that it can not be held liable for a violation if it in fact provided a fape.not so.a claim for tuition reimbursement pursuant to the provision is evaluated independently from the evaluation of a claim for tuition reimbursement pursuant to the inadequacy of an iep.mackey,at.section j represents congress policy choice that all handicapped children,regardless of whether their case is meritorious or not,are to remain in their current educational placement until the dispute with regard to their placement is ultimately resolved.id.citation,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted see also,at.in short,the provision means that an educational agency is required to maintain the status quo placement even if the child would otherwise have no substantive right to it.see mackey,at.
the supreme court decision in burlington is not to the contrary burlington observed that parents who unilaterally change their child placement during the pendency of review proceedings,without the consent of state or local school officials,do so at their own financial risk because i f the courts ultimately determine that the iep proposed by the school officials was appropriate,the parents would be barred from obtaining reimbursement for any interim period in which their child placement violated j.at.
burlington stands for an unremarkable proposition when a parent rejects a placement by unilaterally placing the child elsewhere,retroactive reimbursement for the unilateral placement is available,if at all,only through a fape claim.see,at when the child parents rejected the agency offer to provide pendency services directly for the year,they took responsibility for the cost of obtaining those services from private providers.citing burlington,at.
we are not confronted with a burlington scenario.under the iep,the student was to attend solomon at parental expense and to receive related services at the expense of the board.while paying for the related services herself,the parent m
