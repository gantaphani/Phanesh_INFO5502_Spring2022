californians have a constitutional right to access the records of their public agencies.they have a strong interest in knowing how government officials conduct public business,particularly when allegations of malfeasance by public officers are raised.
here,a school district board of education hired an investigator to prepare a report analyzing allegations of misconduct by the district superintendent.portions of the report were released to a newspaper by persons the investigator had interviewed.
after receiving the full report in confidence,the board of education entered into an agreement with the superintendent accepting his resignation in exchange for terms of payment and a promise to keep the report confidential.the public and the media smelled a sweetheart deal and demanded the board release the report.the board refused,and the trial court upheld the board decision.
we must determine whether the california public records act,et public records act or the act requires the report to be released or allows it to remain confidential.under the circumstances presented here,we conclude the public records act requires disclosure,subject to conditions.
real party in interest dunsmuir joint union high school district the district operates dunsmuir high school.the school serves about students in grades through.in march,the district received approximately letters complaining about the behavior of real party in interest robert morris,superintendent of the district and principal of dunsmuir high school.the letters alleged morris verbally abused students in disciplinary settings and sexually harassed female students.
on april,the district board of trustees met in closed session,where it listened to parents voice their complaints about morris.
on may,the board convened a special meeting.the meeting agenda noted the board would meet in closed session to discuss,among other matters,public employee performance evaluation superintendent and.following the closed session,the board in open session voted unanimously to retain diane davis,a private investigator,to investigate the complaints against morris.
the board directed davis to interview complaining witnesses by telephone and to prepare written summaries of those interviews.it also asked davis to provide her conclusions regarding the truth of the complaints and whether the evidence provided by the complainants supported the allegations.
on may,the board met in closed session with morris for over two hours.at the conclusion of the closed session,it was announced that morris had requested,and the board had agreed,that morris employment contract would not be renewed after its scheduled expiration in june.
meanwhile,davis conducted numerous interviews.the district informed the trial court davis interviewed people.she interviewed parents,current students,former students,and district employees.she prepared summaries documenting these interviews.davis prepared nine additional memoranda recording various investigative steps she took.also,davis prepared a lengthy letter detailing her findings and opinions following her investigation.she dated the report june,and submitted the letter,the interview summaries,the additional memoranda,and her interview notes as her report to the district.
under cover of letters dated july,the board transmitted to a limited number of complainants a copy of davis interview summary of that complainant,and solicited the complainant review and comment.petitioner brv,brv,publisher of the redding record searchlight newspaper,obtained copies of eight such letters,nine interview summaries,and the responses of each complainant to those summaries.they are included in the record.the word confidential appears at the top of each interview summary.
on july,morris resigned from his positions effective december,conditioned on the board accepting a written agreement between him and the district,also dated july.the agreement had been negotiated by legal counsel for the district and for morris.on july,the board accepted morris resignation and agreed to the terms of the written agreement.
under the agreement,morris was placed on paid administrative leave from july through december,at which time his retirement would take effect.his salary was increased by payable during the time he spent on leave.morris also agreed not to participate in any district or school activities,functions,meetings or otherwise nor shall he appear on any district property at any time during the paid leave of absence 
the district agreed not to release any documents in morris personnel file except with morris consent or as required by law.the district also agreed to seal and place in a sealed envelope in morris personnel file any and all documents relating to the investigation conducted by diane davis on behalf of the district and no information on such investigation shall be released to any third party except as required by law or in accordance with any court order or subpoena.
between july and august,some tort claims were filed with the district regarding morris conduct and davis investigation.
on july,brv filed a request with the district under the public records act to obtain copies of davis report,any documentation relating to the district retention of davis,and any letter of resignation submitted by morris.
on august,the district provided brv with everything it had requested except davis report.the district stated davis report was exempt from disclosure under the public records act.
brv filed a petition for writ of mandate against the district seeking disclosure of davis report.all siskiyou county superior court judges recused themselves or were disqualified.the petition was heard by the john letton,retired trinity county superior court judge.
following an in camera review,the trial court determined almost all of davis report,including the interview summaries she prepared,were not required to be disclosed under the public records act personnel records exception,section,subdivision c.it ordered only those portions of the report regarding complaints of morris yelling at students be disclosed.all other portions would remain confidential,even though they tended to exonerate morris.the court found this to be an odd result,but felt constrained by case law not to disclose complaints that were determined not to be credible or to concern serious matters.
the court also determined the district did not waive its right to prevent disclosure of the report by transmitting interview summaries to the complainants for their review and comment.
brv sought writ relief from this court,claiming the trial court erred.we issued an alternative writ,and now address the merits

istandard of review 
a trial court order directing disclosure of records by a public official,or supporting the official refusal to disclose records under the public records act,is immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for issuance of an extraordinary writ,subd.c times mirror superior court cal d.factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if based on substantial evidence.but the interpretation of the public records act,and its application to undisputed facts,present questions of law that are subject to de novo appellate review.cbs broadcasting superior court th,d.
statutory background 
the public records act provides for the inspection of public records maintained by state and local agencies.citation.the legislature enacted the act in to give the public access to information in possession of public agencies in furtherance of the notion that government should be accountable for its actions and,in order to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.citation.but r ecognition of the importance of preserving individual privacy is also evident in the act.the act begins with the phrase in enacting this chapter,the legislature is mindful of the right of individuals to privacy citation.citation.disclosure of public records thus involves two fundamental yet competing interests prevention of secrecy in government and protection of individual privacy.citation.gilbert city of san jose th,d.
in,california voters approved proposition,which enshrined in our state constitution the public right to access records of public agencies.cal,art.i,subd.b.by its own terms,however,the amendment has little impact on our construction of the public records act as that statute applies to this case.the amendment requires the public records act to be broadly construed if it furthers the people right of access,and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.cal,art.i,subd.b,para.such was the law prior to the amendment enactment.california state university superior court th,d.
moreover,the amendment does not modify or further limit an individual right of privacy as protected by the public records act.nothing in the amendment supersedes or modifies the right of privacy guaranteed by section of the state constitution or affects the construction of any statute such as the public records act,court rule,or other authority to the extent that it protects that right to privacy cal,art.i,subd.b,para.as will be explained below,morris right to privacy is implicated by brv request.we thus will rely on the terms of the public records act and its jurisprudence to resolve this matter.
all public records are subject to disclosure unless the act expressly provides otherwise.williams superior court cal th,d.the trial court found two exemptions relevant here.the first,subdivision c of section,exempts from disclosure p ersonnel,medical,or similar files,the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.the second is the act catchall exception,section.this provision allows an agency to withhold public records where no express exemption may apply if the agency can demonstrate that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record,subd.a.
we directed the parties to address in supplemental briefing a third exemption that may apply,one originally raised by the district at trial.under education code section,a school district may not grant any person access to pupil records without written parental consent or judicial order except under circumstances not relevant here.this statute prevails over the public records act,code,subd.k.we thus turn our attention first to this provision,determining whether davis report constitutes pupil records within the meaning of education code section.
pupil records 
education code section is part of a statutory response to congress adoption of the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa.congress enacted ferpa to assure parents of students access to their educational records and to protect such individuals rights to privacy by limiting the transferability of their records without their consent.citation.under its terms,educational institutions,with a few exceptions not material here,must obtain written parental consent prior to releasing students records or information derived therefrom.the statute takes a approach the carrot is federal funding the stick is the termination of such funding to any educational institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of educational records or personally identifiable information contained therein of students without the written consent of their parents.b.frazier fairhaven school committee cir.the california legislature adopted a statutory scheme to eliminate potential conflicts between ferpa and state law,including the public records act.
california law defines pupil records as any item of information directly related to an identifiable pupil,other than directory information,which is maintained by a school district,subd.b.ferpa defines education records in nearly identical terms,subd.a a.
implementing regulations promulgated by the state department of education further explain the term pupil record means information relative to an individual pupil gathered within or without the school system and maintained within the school system,regardless of the physical form in which it is maintained.essential in this definition is the idea that any information which is maintained for the purpose of second party review is considered a pupil record,tit,subd.d.
judicial authority interpreting the term is scant.federal courts interpreting ferpa,for example,have held the following records not to be education records students individual assignments handled by student graders in their separate classrooms owasso.school dist.falvo,d,falvo transcripts of students depositions in a sexual harassment case against a school coach that were not maintained by the school jennings at chapel hill d,and a voluntary student survey participated in anonymously ridgewood bd.of educ.d,affd.in part,revd.in part cir.
records found by federal courts to be education records under ferpa include student disciplinary records united states miami university d,and district records relating to a student juvenile court proceedings and kept in the school district attorney files belanger nashua,new hampshire,school dist,belanger.
the belanger court noted congress intended the definition of education record to be broad.the current definition,enacted in,define s education records in order to make clear what documents and other material parents and students will have access to the intent to be that,except as provided in the definition,parents and students should have access to everything in institutional records maintained for each student in the normal course of business and used by the institution in making decisions that affect the life of the student.at emphasis added.belanger,supra.at.
nonetheless,in holding students assignments were not education records,the supreme court clarified that not every record in a school concerning a student is an education record.the court relied in part on a provision of ferpa that requires agencies to keep a separate record listing those who request access to a student education records,subd.b a.ferpa requires a record of access for each pupil.this single record must be kept with the education records.this suggests congress contemplated that education records would be kept in one place with a single record of access.by describing a school official and his assistants as the personnel responsible for the custody of the records,ferpa implies that education records are institutional records kept by a single central custodian,such as a registrar,not individual assignments handled by many student graders in their separate classrooms.falvo,supra,at.at,italics added.
the tenth circuit court of appeals also limited the scope of education records in an unreported decision which that court local rule allows us to cite for persuasive value,cir.cal.rules of,rule a,c prohibition against citing unpublished opinions applies to opinions of california courts.in jensen reeves cir,wl jensen,a school official sent reports to the parents of victims and witnesses of a particular student verbal and physical harassment.in one instance,the report explained the investigation conducted in response to a complaint,the facts discerned,and the discipline taken against the offending student.in another instance,the reports summarized the incident,explained the addressee child had been involved and had been interviewed,and stated the alleged perpetrator had been warned.id.at.
the court of appeals determined the school did not violate ferpa by releasing the investigation reports.the reports were not education records.t he contemporaneous disclosure to the parents of a victimized child of the results of any investigation and resulting disciplinary actions taken against an alleged child perpetrator does not constitute a release of an education record within the meaning of a a.reading such disclosures to fall within the ambit of would place educators in an untenable position they could not adequately convey to the parents of affected students that adequate steps were being undertaken to assure the safety of the student.nor do we think that such a targeted,discrete,contemporaneous disclosure fits within the bounds of the plain language of a a.jensen,supra.at.
