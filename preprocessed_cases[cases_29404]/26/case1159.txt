plaintiff,a minor with physical and developmental disabilities,formerly attended school in denver school district.she brought an action against the school district and the board of education,alleging violations of the americans with disabilities act ada.she also brought an action against the district,the board,and several individual district employees,alleging violations of based on defendants failure to provide rights guaranteed by the individuals with disabilities education act idea.defendants moved to dismiss on various grounds,including qualified immunity,but the district court denied their motion except as to one of the individual defendants.this court has jurisdiction over the remaining individual defendants qualified immunity appeal pursuant to mitchell forsyth,d,and over the appeal of the district court other determinations pursuant to its certification for immediate appeal under b 
in,congress enacted the education of the handicapped act eha,the idea predecessor its primary purpose is to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected.d a b to implement these goals,congress mandated that state and local educational agencies receiving assistance under the idea establish procedures to ensure the provision of such services and the protection of these rights.see id.a.to identify necessary services,the idea requires representatives of the responsible educational agencies,in meetings with parents and teachers,to develop an individualized education program iep for each child with a disability.the iep includes a written statement of the present educational level of such child,of annual goals and instructional objectives,and of specific educational services to be provided to such child.a.before developing or changing a child iep,the agency must provide written notice to the parents.see id.b c.the agency must also provide parents who present complaints regarding these matters an impartial due process hearing.see id.b.any party aggrieved by the decision of a local educational agency may appeal to the state educational agency.see id.c.further,an aggrieved party has the right to bring a civil action with respect to its complaints if the state has not provided an administrative appeals process or if the aggrieved party is dissatisfied with the findings or decision of the administrative appeal agency.see id.e.
because this appeal arises on a motion to dismiss,we construe the facts,and reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them,in favor of the plaintiff.breidenbach bolish,cir.according to plaintiff,during the period between and,defendants failed to provide her with the behavioral programming,augmentative communication,and tube feeding services identified in her iep.
she also asserts defendants repeatedly placed her in a windowless closet,restrained in a stroller without supervision,contrary to her iep.during one of these incidents she tipped over and hit her head on the floor,suffering serious physical injuries,including a skull fracture and exacerbation of a seizure disorder,which kept her from attending school for the remainder of the term.the school district thereafter failed to provide homebound schooling adequate to insure the free appropriate public education to which she was entitled.
in august,plaintiff moved to a new school district and began attending a different school,neither of which is a party to this action.in february,she requested an administrative hearing from the defendant school district to contest certain actions of district personnel.in her request,plaintiff sought any relief available through the administrative process,including money damages and attorney fees.plaintiff hearing request was denied by the hearing officer,who ruled that he lacked jurisdiction as the petitioner does not reside within the school district,and that he lacked authority to grant the requested relief.
thereafter,plaintiff filed the instant suit,raising two claims.first,she alleged that the school district and the board of education violated her rights under the ada by excluding her from participation in publicly funded general and special education programs based on her disability.second,she brought an action under,alleging that the school district,the board of education,and several individual district employees violated her rights under the idea by denying her a free and appropriate public education.plaintiff specifically seeks monetary damages for both the ada and claims.
defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies damages are unavailable under the idea and therefore unavailable in a claim based on an idea violation the idea does not allow individual liability actions,and,therefore,individuals can not be liable under a claim based on an idea violation and the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court dismissed plaintiff claim as it applied to one of the individual defendants but denied the motion in all other respects,and the remaining defendants brought this appeal.
we review the denial or grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court.breidenbach,at.we first address the viability of plaintiff claims.the district court determined that the idea allows for damage awards and that it may be enforced against individuals.therefore,the court reasoned,plaintiff can likewise sue individuals and seek damages in a suit based on the idea.the district court analysis presupposes that may be used to enforce the idea in the first place.this court has not previously ruled on this issue circuits that have addressed the question have not come to the same conclusion 
it is well settled that is a generally and presumptively available remedy for claimed violations of federal law.livadas bradshaw,d.nonetheless,congress can foreclose recourse to either by express words or by providing a comprehensive alternative enforcement scheme.see also blessing freestone,d.congress has not expressly prohibited suits as remedies for idea violations,so we must turn to the question of whether the idea administrative remedies nevertheless imply congressional intent to do so.supreme court precedent guides our inquiry.
in smith robinson,d,the supreme court considered whether the plaintiffs could pursue virtually identical claims for a free appropriate education under the eha idea predecessor,the rehabilitation act,and based on alleged equal protection and due process deprivations.id.at.the court concluded that the eha thorough enforcement mechanisms indicated congress intent to proscribe such a course of action.see id.at.for example,as to the plaintiffs claim based on the equal protection clause,the court stated that 
where the eha is available to a handicapped child asserting a right to a free appropriate public education,based either on the eha or on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the eha is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or guardian can pursue their claim.
id.at.smith did not specifically involve the question of whether the eha precludes suits based on eha violations.in fact,the court expressly recognized that the plaintiffs claims alleged constitutional violations,not eha violations.see id.at.nonetheless,the court holding that the eha provided a comprehensive enforcement scheme that preempted other overlapping but independent statutory or constitutional claims necessarily meant that the eha also supplanted claims based simply on eha violations.
in response to smith,congress amended the eha in.see,stat,at,reprinted in.among other provisions,congress added f,which stated in pertinent part nothing in this title shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,title v of the rehabilitation act of,or other federal statutes protecting the rights of handicapped children and youth.this provisio
