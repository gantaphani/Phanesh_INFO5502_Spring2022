the university filed with the district court in washington a covenant not to sue tegic for past,present,or future acts of infringement,and thereafter filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,see.b,because there was no case or controversy between the university and tegic.the university also stated that it,as an arm of the state of texas,is not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts and is protected from tegic suit by the immunity granted pursuant to the eleventh amendment to the constitution the university also moved for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction in washington.see.b.in the alternative,the university requested transfer of tegic action to the western district of texas.see a for the convenience of the parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it may have been brought.the university also asked the court to exercise its discretion to decline declaratory judgment jurisdiction,see wilton seven falls,d federal courts have discretion in determining whether and when to entertain an action under the declaratory judgment act,even when the suit otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites.tegic opposed all of the grounds of dismissal and transfer.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss,on the ground that the university is immune from suit in the federal courts pursuant to the eleventh amendment and had not waived its immunity as to tegic declaratory judgment action.the district court considered and rejected each of tegic arguments first,the court held that the university had not waived its immunity by filing a covenant not to sue.the court reasoned that the covenant was evidence that the university had not consented to suit,rather than the reverse.second,the court held that the university had not waived its immunity by obtaining patent rights and taking steps to enforce those rights in federal court,citing college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense,d a state does not constructively waive eleventh amendment immunity by obtaining federally created rights,even when it does so solely as a market participant.third,the district court held that the university had not waived its immunity to suit in washington by filing suit in texas as to the same patent,reasoning that precedent does not support tegic position.
the district court considered whether it should transfer the case to the western district of texas in accordance with a,rather than dismiss it,but held that the appropriate course was to dismiss the case.the court expressed serious doubts as to whether tegic could have brought this declaratory action in texas,since tegic was not a party to the suit filed by the university.the district court also noted tegic objection to transfer of the suit.the court reasoned that tegic proper recourse,if any,is to seek intervention in the texas action.the court did not discuss the university other grounds for dismissal.tegic appeals.
