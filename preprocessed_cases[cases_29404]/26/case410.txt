pam davis,a student at the wilmington branch of the university of north carolina,brought an action alleging that violated the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act of when it removed her from a teacher certification program.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of,and davis appeals.we affirm.
davis was diagnosed in as suffering from dissociative identity disorder did,also known as multiple personality disorder.she has seventeen distinct personalities,including michael,michael,and michael.although davis receives social security disability benefits as a result of her disorder,her disorder has not prevented her from succeeding in the academic arena.davis earned a bachelor of science degree from barton college in,and she met academic eligibility requirements for participation in a sixty undergraduate teacher certification program.davis initially enrolled in the certification program solely to satisfy the prerequisites for the master degree program that she hoped to enter she did not intend to pursue teaching as a career.
davis began attending in january and quickly started experiencing some problems.a professor was convinced that davis plagiarized from various professional journals for an assignment.after discussing the issue with davis,the professor permitted her to the assignment.thereafter,the dean of school of education became concerned upon learning that davis was distributing a business card that seemed to indicate that she had already received the master degree,even though she had not even completed the certification program.davis compounded the problem by misrepresenting to the dean the number of people to whom she had given the card and attempting to pass it off as a joke.
in addition,professors were becoming concerned about davis inappropriate and sometimes aggressive behavior towards them.for example,davis approached professor lanunziata after a class,accusing him of slighting her during a class discussion and demanding to know how he would redress the problem.just over a week later,davis challenged lanunziata in class,stating that she was appalled by a statement he had made and aggressively disagreeing with his views on an issue.professors also learned about various incidents of aggressive behavior involving davis and other students,including an incident where davis fl ew into a fit of rage during a group project,scattering books or papers on the floor.
on june,davis was preparing to take the final examination in professor lanunziata class.davis went to lanunziata office to pick up the exam,and he took her through a hallway into the classroom.she returned to his office a few minutes later obviously shaken and crying,saying that she could not find michael and that she could not take the test without michael.another professor took davis to the campus counseling center,where davis met with a therapist.davis regained her composure sufficiently to take the final examination and one for another class that day,and she spoke to lanunziata about the incident later that afternoon.davis describes the incident as an abreaction triggered by a childhood memory which caused a different personality to emerge.
officials met with davis on june and informed her that they were removing her from two education classes for which she was registered in the upcoming summer session.by the middle of august,had removed davis from the certification program entirely.there is no dispute that davis informed officials at the june meeting that she suffered from did.although professor lanunziata disagrees,davis contends that she told him about her disorder at the end of may and again after the final exam incident.
explanation for removing davis from the program was that she failed to meet the school requirements as set forth in the performance review process portion of its procedures manual.these requirements set forth standards of professional behavior that students are expected to meet,including professional demeanor professional interactions with university students,faculty,staff,and administrators and adherence to school rules and ethical standards.in light of the plagiarism,the business card incident,and davis aggressive manner with students and professors,believed that davis failed to exhibit the honesty and professional demeanor required of its students.
in addition,there is evidence in the record from which a jury could conclude that action was motivated at least in part by its apprehension about whether davis should work with children.davis admitted to school officials that she occasionally suffered from memory blackouts because of her disorder,a fact that caused some concern because completion of the certification program required contact with young children.
after removing davis from the certification program,offered to waive the certification requirement and allow davis to apply to the master program,but davis never applied.although she had in the past told school officials that she did not want to teach,davis believed that she met the requirements for the certification program and she believed that she was entitled to complete it.administratively enrolled her in other classes that were appropriate for the master degree she initially wanted,but davis did not stay in the classes,nor did she enroll in any other classes,even though she was free to do so.
davis then brought this action,alleging that removed her from the certification program because of her did,however,contends that it removed her from the program not because she suffers from did but because,given the problems she had at school,she did not meet the standards necessary to continue in the program.after referring the case to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of,concluding that davis failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was disabled and as to whether she was qualified for the certification program.
title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.west.such discrimination is similarly proscribed by the rehabilitation act.see a west supp no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance id.b a west defining program or activity as including all operations of a college,university,or other postsecondary institution.thus,to state a claim under the rehabilitation act or title ii of the ada,davis must establish that she has a disability as defined by the acts she is otherwise qualified for the benefit or program at issue and she was excluded from the benefit or program on the basis of her disability.see baird rose,cir parker universidad de puerto rico,cir.although the ada and the rehabilitation act have different causation standards,the language of the acts otherwise is similar.see baird,at.and because causation is not an issue in our disposition of this case,we will consider together davis claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act.see see also bragdon abbott,d noting that congress has directed courts to construe the ada to grant at least as much protection as provided by the regulations implementing the rehabilitation act.
for purposes of this opinion,we will assume that davis is otherwise qualified and that removed her from the certification program because of her did the dispositive question,then,is whether davis is disabled within the meaning of the statutes.
an individual is disabled under the ada or the rehabilitation act if he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the individual major life activities has a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment.see b west supp.on appeal,davis does not argue that she is in fact disabled by her disorder,b
