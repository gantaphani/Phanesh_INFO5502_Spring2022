elaine has appealed from the final judgment entered against her rejecting each of the claims set forth in her amended complaint.she contends that the district court erred in granting sheriff kevin beary the county motion for a summary judgment dismissing her claims for sexual harassment.in granting the motion,the district court concluded that did not demonstrate that she was subjected to suffering pervasive harassment to constitute a hostile and adverse work environment.
she also challenges the district court conclusion that the record showed that the county exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any sexual harassing behavior,and that unreasonably failed to take advantage of her employers corrective measures or to avoid any harm to her.also seeks reversal of the dismissal of her retaliation claim based on the district court determination that she failed to demonstrate that the decision not to appoint her as the school resource officer sro at the gateway middle school was based on her gender.
in addition,seeks reversal of the order granting judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,of her claims for her gender discrimination and constructive discharge.after reviewing the record,we are persuaded that the district court did not err and conclude that the judgment must stand.
the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment dismissing sexual harassment based on the evidence presented to it by the parties at that stage of the proceedings.the facts set forth in opposition demonstrate that she was hired by the orange county sheriff office in july as a deputy sheriff.in may,she was assigned to the property division.

i have no personal agenda here.my consideration is to put the best qualified person in a position.gateway middle school is a horrible place to work.i tried to put the person that i thought would probably go there,do a good job and more than anything else be safe.my intention really was to protect elaine.i did think that was a good place to put her.i think other i said,the physically imposing,tactically sound people are better.the way i look at things is this officer safety first,last,and always.and that how i make my decisions.

contends that the district court erred in concluding that mankewich conduct was not sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of her employment and create an abusive and hostile work environment.title vii provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privilege of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by title vii,gupta.bd.of regents,cir.
an employee must present evidence of the following elements to support a cause of action for a hostile environment claim created by sexual harassment 
that he or she belongs to a protected group that the employee has been subject to unwelcome sexual harassment,such as sexual advances,requests for sexual favors,and other conduct of a sexual nature that the harassment must have been based on the sex of the employee that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment and a basis for holding the employer liable.
mendoza borden,cir en banc 
belongs to a protected group.the district court correctly rejected as frivolous the county contention that mankewich comments to were not based on her gender.the evidence,when reviewed in the light most favorable to her,demonstrates mankewich statements and conduct were unwelcome.she presented evidence that she told him to stop and that he was sick.mankewich statements that she looked hot,that she should wear tighter clothes,that he wished his wife wore hot clothes,and his vulgar comment about lunch were unmistakenly gender based.it is undisputed that mankewich was supervisor.thus,clearly demonstrated that she satisfied the first,second,third,and fifth elements of her cause of action for hostile environment and sexual harassment.
asserts that the evidence she offered in opposition to appellee motion for summary judgment demonstrates that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute regarding whether mankewich sexual comments were sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of her employment.
w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.
harris forklift,d.
before this court,the county does not dispute that mankewich comments were discriminatory.mankewich made gender related comments on at least a weekly basis,over an period.the record also shows,however,that when told mankewich on april,that his comments made her feel uncomfortable,his discriminatory conduct ceased.furthermore,when she reported to mckinley that mankewich comments were unwelcome,she was immediately and temporarily moved to a different workplace while her complaint was investigated.
after attending two meetings with her supervisors and mankewich,agreed to return to her former workplace under mankewich supervision.her employer was not informed of mankewich reprehensible comment about eating for lunch until her husband informed strange about that behavior on or about may.the day after receiving strange memorandum,director ford met with.director ford told her she could remain in sector i under mankewich supervision or transfer to sector with no change in her salary or work shift.she elected to accept a transfer to sector so that she would not be supervised by mankewich.she also requested that mankewich apologize for his gender based comments in writing.her request was granted.she was transferred to sector and mankewich apologized in writing.
mankewich comments that looked hot,and that she should wear tighter clothing,and women who dye their hair have issues at home were taunting and boorish.they were not,however,physically threatening or humiliating.mankewich never touched her or attempted to do so.for conduct to be severe or pervasive,the work environment must be one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.oncale sundowner offshore,d.
the supreme court has cautioned against expanding title vii into a general civility code.id.at.the court instructed in oncale that 
the statute does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex.the prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace,it forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment.
we are persuaded that a reasonable person would not consider mankewich comments about figure and good looks severely hostile or abusive.has failed to demonstrate that mankewich inappropriate comments about appearance unreasonably interfered with her work performance or the terms and conditions of her employment.
mankewich taunting jest about eating for lunch is more troubling.it was directed at her husband in presence.the record shows,however that she did not report it to mckinley on april,when she complained about mankewich unwelcome comments about her appearance.her husband made a report of the lunch comment on june.furthermore,it is the only comment that could be construed as referring to sexual activity involving.it was rather clearly a disgusting attempt at humor,unaccompanied by any other improper conduct.
the supreme court held in faragher boca raton,d,that offhand comments and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.in gupta,this court noted that 
a ll the sexual hostile work environment cases decided by the supreme court has involved patterns or allegations of extensive,long lasting,unredressed and uninhibited sexual threats or conduct that permeated the plaintiff work environment.
gupta,at quoting indest freeman decorating,cir.in this matter,the record shows that employer took immediate action to redress her grievances by granting her request to be transferred to a different office and required mankewich to apologize for his behavior.
after looking at the totality of the circumstances independently,we agree with the district court that failed to demonstrate that mankewich boorish remarks were severe or pervasive.they did not alter the terms and conditions of her employment.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on sexual harassment claim.
further contends the district court erred in concluding that she failed to demonstrate that she was not transferred to gateway middle school in retaliation for the fact that she complained about mankewich gender related comments.the district court held that she failed to present evidence that the failure to transfer her to a sro position at gateway middle school was causally related to the prior exercise of her statutorily protected rights under title vii to complain about workplace harassment.t o establish a prima facie case of retaliation under a,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in statutorily protected expression she suffered an adverse employment action and the adverse action was causally related to the protected activity.wideman stores,cir.

the record shows that chief hollomon deviated from the transfer board ranking because he was concerned that female officers or small male officers would be subject to violent physical assaults by the many disturbed students at gateway middle school.division chief hollomon was aware that had complained about workplace harassment.no evidence was presented by that chief hollomon testimony that his motivation for deviating from the transfer board ranking of was false or pretextual.instead,she relies on the close temporal connection between the two events to demonstrate the element of causal connection.the supreme court noted in clark county sch.dist.breeden,d,that

here,division chief hollomon decision to pass over in filling the position of sro at gateway middle school came approximately six months after she complained of a hostile work environment because of sexual harassment.the district court did not err in dismissing retaliation claim.failed to meet her burden of presenting evidence of a causal connection between her complaint a
