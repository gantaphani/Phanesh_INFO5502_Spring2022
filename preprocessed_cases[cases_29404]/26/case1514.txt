this case deals with the claims of the relatives of an injured person to recover for their own emotional distress occasioned by an injury that they did not witness and which the victim actively tried to conceal from them.specifically,two parents have sued the anaheim union high school district for emotional distress when they discovered that their daughter,who had just completed the grade,had been engaged in a sexual relationship with one of her teachers since early in the grade and who had touched her sexually before that.
the teacher went to jail.in the civil case against the district,the jury assessed total damages of more than million,of which was apportioned to the parents.
the district has appealed.while this appeal was pending all claims by the student against the district were settled.we deal here only with the parents claims against the district.
the discovery of the sexual relationship occurred in june,when the student mother found a hidden collection of sexually explicit letters from the teacher that had been hidden in the daughter closet.the mother confronted her daughter about the letters and the sexual relationship with the teacher was exposed.the student begged her mother not to go to the police,but to no avail.the teacher was arrested.the student became suicidal and the relationship with her parents deteriorated.
the student herself would later testify that she went to great lengths to conceal her relationship with the teacher,and told no one about it,though she had marked her calendar with a red heart for each sexual incident.her friends testified that it never crossed their minds that the teacher was molesting her,or that she was anything other than a teacher pet to him,or that he was more than a grandfather figure to her.though the record is large,there is no evidence that any other district teacher or supervisory employee actually knew of the sexual relationship there is,however,evidence of the better word would be the part of several of the district teachers as distinct from supervisors,who,had they been inclined to be suspicious about a student who was always hanging around her teacher,might have put two together and surmised that the relationship between the student and the teacher was not platonic 
in john oakland unified school dist.cal d,our supreme court held that a school district can not be held vicariously liable for a teacher sexual misbehavior with a student.there a junior high mathematics teacher pressured a student into sexual acts.the only way a school district may be held liable must be premised on its own direct negligence in hiring and supervising the teacher.id.at,see also ortega pajaro valley unified school dist.th,d john makes it clear that a teacher sexual abuse of a child is not an act for which a school district may be held responsible.the district can be held liable only for its own conduct which causes injury.
there was absolutely no evidence at all in this case that the school district was negligent in hiring the teacher or in continuing to employ him.virginia abc unified school district th,d allowing for liability if employees responsible for hiring or supervising teachers knew of teacher prior sexual misconduct with students.the student here kept the relationship with the teacher secret from even her closest friends.she complained to no one,including her parents or any school officials.nor is there any evidence that the district had knowledge of any prior pedophiliac or other tendency on the teacher part to try to have sex with his students.
this case thus presents a direct contrast to ortega,supra,th,d.in ortega,the miscreant teacher was accused of fondling young girls when he was an intern with the school district and was criminally prosecuted for it,though acquitted.four years later he was the target of complaints that he touched female students inappropriately including touching a girl breast during athletic events,and allowed his attorney to literally walk away with any documentation of those complaints.no wonder that when,years later,the district was being sued for the molestation of two female students,the district made no attempt to argue to the appellate court that findings of negligent supervision and hiring were unwarranted.id.at,fn,d.
ortega,however,can shed no light on two issues which it did address.the first issue is whether the school district can be liable for negligent supervision where it has no knowledge of prior incidents which would prompt it to give greater scrutiny to a particular behavior.there was enough in ortega to give the district warning parental complaints within a few years of an actual prosecution for child molestation that the teacher might pose a potential danger to female students.the ortega opinion,however,does not explore the comparatively harder question of what precisely the school district should have done after the teacher was acquitted for the first incident and was given a stern analogous to a private reprimand in the legal the second.fire him based on the second set of complaints then again,there was no need for the ortega court to do we just noted,the school district chose not to present the issue.
the second issue unaddressed in ortega was whether the parents of a molested student can recover for their own ensuing emotional distress even if there was negligent supervision.that issue was not before the court either.ortega essentially is a long government tort claims estoppel case.almost the entire discussion section of the opinion pages through of the official reporter centers on whether the district was estopped to assert government tort claims defenses on that point the decision was court said the district was estopped as to one student but not the other.the closest is one of the two issues which appear toward the end of the opinion,excessive damages.in the latter we learn that the father of the one student whose claims were allowed to survive was awarded,which turned out to be the cost of the tuition he paid when,in response to the reaction she received when she complained,he took his daughter out of the school and put her in a private school.see ortega,supra,th at,d.there is no indication that he was awarded damages for emotional distress.the other issue was comparative fault.the jury thought the district was percent at fault,and assigned no fault to the teacher.that was obviously untenable and the appellate court so held.
for purposes of this opinion,we will assume,for sake of argument,that the anaheim union high school district negligently supervised the teacher,and the negligent supervision allowed the sexual relationship between the teacher to begin,or at least to continue on.we stress,however,that in no way should this opinion be read for any such proposition.there is much in this record that stands against it.we only make the assumption in order to underscore the inability of the student parents to recover for their own emotional distress when the relationship came to light.
in martin by and through martin united states cir,judge rymer collected and explained the various california authorities bearing on third party emotional distress,beginning with molien kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.the necessity to do so was borne of a case the facts of which were easily more egregious than the one before us.in martin,a girl was enrolled in a day care center run by the federal government,hence the united states in the title of the case.the children at the day care center were taken on an outing to a park,under the supervision of an employee.the girl became separated from the group as a result of the employee negligence.she was abducted and raped.the sister was present at the police station when the six year old was brought in.both the mother and the sister ended up suing the united states for their own emotional distress,negligently inflicted as a result of the six year old injuries.that prompted the ninth circuit to provide a nice summary of california law on the matter.
first,any recovery for the negligent infliction of emotional distress on the part of third party relatives requires that the plaintiff either be a bystander or direct victim.bystander duty,the court noted,is only recognized when the bystander is closely related to the victim,is present at the scene of the injury producing event at the time it occurs and is then aware that it is causing injury to the victim,and suffers emotional distress beyond what would be anticipated in a disinterested witness.martin,supra,at,citing burgess superior court cal th,d,which in turn was quoting thing la chusa cal d.in martin,not even the sister could recover against the negligent day care center as a bystander,because her awareness of her sibling injury only came as a consequence of,not as a concomitant to,the negligent supervision.martin,supra,at.
we need only add at this juncture that by the same rule the parents in the case before us can not recover as bystanders either.as in martin,their emotional distress is only a consequence of the sexual relationship their daughter had,and was not concomitant to it.accord,hoyem manhattan beach city sch.dist.cal d,mother could not recover for loss of comfort and society of student injured in a public intersection when he should have been in school because there was no sensory and contemporaneous observance of accident.
the other basis for recovery is if the relative can be considered a direct victim.martin noted that the supreme court cases which have allowed relatives to recover as direct victims christensen superior court cal d,d,marlene affiliated psychiatric medical clinic,cal d,and molien kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,cal d,each involved negligence which was directed at the relative as well as the injured party.martin,supra,at.in one of the clearest passages one finds in this area of the law,the martin court noted that christensen involved funeral services,whose primary beneficiaries are the living relatives for whose benefit the funeral or related services take place,marlene concerned a psychotherapist who was treating both parent and child for relationship problems,and molien was a case where the negligent doctor acted affirmatively to have a diagnosis of syphilis it turned out it was a a patient spouse.martin,supra,at.
the martin court thus held that the mother of the child could not recover from the day care center.the negligent supervision was not directed at the mother.again,the same thing applies in the case before us now.assuming that there was any negligent supervision of the teacher here as we said,a very tenuous assumption indeed it was at the most directed at not noticing the rather relationship between the student and the teacher,not directed at the parents.martin,in fact,would apply a fortiori in this situation because surely there is more of a direct duty to the parent of a who specifically enrolled her in a day care center to keep her from getting lost on an outing than there is to the parents of a teenager in a public high school to prevent a relationship that the teenager herself was trying to hide.
an alternative model of recovery for emotional distress on the part of relatives has been proffered by our colleagues in division two in this district in bro glaser th,d.if martin provides a brief summary of the law in the area,bro offers an exhaustive one.parts of the opinion read as if they were from an annotation,bro,supra,th at,d describing cases allowing,and not allowing,claims for emotional distress.after a very comprehensive discussion of the authorities,bro offered the simplest of models there must be outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant for the relative to recover.see bro,supra,th at,d.thus in bro,the fact that an obstetrician nicked the cheek of a baby in the process of a caesarean section causing no permanent injury to the baby and thereby marred the presentation of the baby to the parents did not rise to a sufficient level of outrage to support emotional distress recovery.id.at,d.
the result must also be the same here under the bro model the teacher sexual obsession with the student may have been outrageous,but the fact that his fellow teachers were sufficient busybodies to report him to district authorities by no means comes close to outrageousness.teachers are independent professionals who generally work alone maybe school assemblies and playground supervision are exceptions.that fact applies all the more so for high school teachers.they are independent professionals who do their work alone in classrooms.they are not security guards,or morals police.being clueless as to the implications of one student spending too much time in the company of a teacher is not outrageous behavior at all,especially when that student is trying to conceal the sexual nature of the relationship from even her close friends 
the parents rely primarily on one case,phyllis superior court d.phyllis did indeed allow a parent to recover after a daughter was raped by a fellow student.the case is,however,distinguishable from the present one in no less than three major ways.
first,there was warning of propensity on the part of the student who committed the rape.before the rape giving rise to the litigation,he had sexually molested the victim a number of times both on the way to school and on school premises.see phyllis,supra,d at.in the present case,as we have pointed out,it is undisputed that there were no prior incidents giving any warning of any tendency on the part of the teacher to engage in sexual acts with his students.
second,in phyllis there was clear knowledge of the danger on the part of the school,including its management.the victim reported the fact that she was being molested by the to her teacher.phyllis,supra,d at.the teacher in turn consulted with the school psychologist about it.later the school principal learned of the molestations and called the into his office.in the present case,by contrast,there was no unambiguous knowledge of danger on the part of any teacher,much less a district manager such as the school principal.at most a small handful of teachers who might have observed the student and teacher here being too close too often did put two and two together and go to anyone in district management.but then,neither did the student friends or her parents.
third,in phyllis there was a conscious decision to preempt the parents from learning of the possibility of danger once it was known.neither the teacher,the counselor nor the principal informed the parent of the potential danger to her daughter,and in fact the school principal tried to use the threat of notification to his his victim deter the from further molestations.phyllis,supra,d at.thus it made sense for the court,in its concluding paragraphs,to it did so without a great deal of the parent was a direct victim of the school failure to act,and cite generally to molien kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,cal d.
in the present case,of course,there was no preemption or usurpation of the parental prerogative to take measures to protect the child.district officials made no conscious decision not to inform the parents of the relationship between the teacher and the student.
phyllis was decided in,so the court did not have the benefit of the cases from our high court in subsequent years which have considerably explicated the law of relative recovery since molien.it bears noting,though,that phyllis relied on molien primarily for a forseeability test.phyllis,supra,d at.that foreseeability test,however,has since been specifically repudiated by our high court in burgess,which limited molien to its facts.see burgess,supra,cal th at,d.
while phyllis was decided on the simple foreseeability test articulated in molien,the result in the case is still nonetheless explainable in terms of two ideas which have found support in subsequent cases.first,the decision by school officials not to inform the parent of the danger posed by the was clearly a decision directed at the parent,not the student.second,there is a sense of outrageousness in that decision which also makes it explainable under bro model.the school officials in phyllis were deliberately usurping the parental prerogative to protect the child.
neither idea,however,applies in the case before us now.
finally,any decision regarding liability to relatives can be tested using the traditional seven factors bearing on the existence of duty set forth in rowland christian cal d.in romero superior court th,d,for example,the court applied the rowland factors as a kind of test to ascertain the correctness of its earlier determination that parents holding a party for teenagers had no duty to prevent sexual assault by a against a.see also lawson management activities,supra,th at,d eschewing mechanistic inquiry and analyzing emotional distress in light of the seven factors traditionally used by our supreme court to determine the existence of a duty.
factor one foreseeability of harm.in romero,the court noted that there was no evidence the parents holding the party were aware of any facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that the had a long history of misconduct at school.romero,supra,th at,d.here,the district was not aware of any facts which would lead anyone to conclude that the teacher here posed a threat to his students generally.any foreseeability to the district based on the student and teacher seeming too familiar with each other in the eyes of nonsupervisory employees is attenuated to the point of unreasonability.
chaney superior court th,d is dispositive on the point.in chaney,an action for negligent supervision was brought against a woman whose husband sexually assaulted a minor whom the wife invited into the home.the alleged abuse spanned eight years during which time the minor claimed that the husband paid excessive attention to her,and was excessive in his gift giving.id.at,d.the minor theorized that the wife negligence consisted of failing to recognize these signs as indicative of the possibility that her husband was sexually molesting the minor which caused her to fail to investigate the situation.id.at,d,emphasis in original.the minor theory of negligence suggested that the wife had a duty to investigate,to examine every aspect of her husband behavior to determine whether he is exhibiting signs indicating that he is contemplating molesting a minor.id.at,d.the court very simply stated there is no such duty.ibid.to the same effect is uccello laudenslayer d,where the court refused to impose a duty on a landlord to prevent a dog attack without proof that he knew of the dog and its dangerous propensities.
factor two degree of certainty that plaintiff suffered harm.this factor here is weaker than the factor in romero,where the court was only concerned with the injury to the year old.that is because we are dealing here with the proposed liability of the district to the parents.to be sure,the parents clearly suffered emotional distress,but that distress was vicarious and wholly psychological.
factor three closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury.as with factor one,any liability rests on a highly attenuated relationship.consider the intervening steps some teachers observe a student and teacher paying excessive attention to one another in ambiguous circumstances,which are consistent with both a legitimate and a sexual relationship.they fail to tell the district officials.the district therefore never intervenes.meanwhile,the student does not tell her parents,leaving it up to chance for them to discover the relationship,and that only because the student keeps his amorous writings to her,but hides them in the closet.only then does the truth come out which causes the parents emotional distress,which is itself prompted in part by the fact that their daughter had chosen to keep the relationship a secret from them.
factor four moral blame.this factor strongly disfavors any liability here.there is no question that the district has done its part generally to prevent misconduct of the kind that went on here.the district conducts ongoing awareness programs on issues of sexual harassment,abuse and appropriate interaction with students.the yearly training sessions were augmented with updates,handouts and guidelines in the teachers handbook.even the parents brief acknowledges the extensive training of the teachers in that regard,so much so that a minor theme is not the district teacher were,but that they must have all entered into a conspiracy of silence because they knew they were in violation of the district policies.that argument itself is easily disposed of it assumes its premise that teachers were consciously aware of sexual misconduct as distinct from merely not assuming the worst based on ambiguous facts,but it does illustrate the tenuousness between any lack of action by the district and the injury to the parents.neither the district nor its teachers can be morally blameworthy for not assuming the worst about the relationship.in fact,our supreme court in john specifically rejected the unduly pessimistic view of human nature which holds that sexual misconduct is foreseeable any time a minor and an adult are alone in a room together,at least if not constrained by the possibility of being interrupted.john,supra,cal d at,fn.
federico superior court th,d likewise supports our conclusion on this nothing about ambiguous conduct which,in hindsight,confirms evil suspicions is not worthy of moral opprobrium.some people actually think well of their colleagues and will assume the best if the evidence is ambiguous.
in federico,a hairstylist college hired a training supervisor who had a history of illegal homosexual conduct with male minors.federico,supra,th at,d.the college was sued when the supervisor took the son of one of its female students on a sunday outing,during which the son was molested.it later came to light that the supervisor had touched some of the other children of the college students in a manner which in hindsight could have been interpreted as inappropriate or indicative of the supervisor deviant sexual proclivities.id.at,d.the touching,however,was not overtly sexual it consisted of such occurrences as an unusually prolonged handshake,an overly friendly pat on the shoulder,or,on one occasion the supervisor having a younger child sit in his lap.ibid.the court noted that the conduct was ambiguous at worst and did not result in any complaints to the college by the children or the parents.ibid.the federico court thus ultimately upheld a summary judgment.id.at,d.
factor five policy of preventing future harm.baldwin zoradi d.is instructive.there,a student sued a university when she was injured after two fellow students had been drinking and engaged in a speeding contest in which she was injured.the court held that the policy of preventing future harm was not a very strong one under the facts,because the university officials had not collaborated to encourage the drinking,and there was no direct involvement by the university in furnishing alcoholic beverages.id.at.in the case before us there certainly was no collaboration either.
the case before us is not one of those cases where the installation of a part in a car can save a life in a collision.rather,as in ochoa california state university th,d,the cost of implementation of any policy of prevention would be more than the policy was worth.under our facts here,a policy of prevention of this sort of harm would require turning the culture at every high school in the district into a virtual police state,with fellow teachers being required to report mere suspicions of what would no doubt be called inappropriate fraternization.
factor six the burden on the district.as we have just mentioned,the burden on a school district of preventing relationships beyond what it is already doing would be intolerable.it would be a reign of terror.let us elaborate further.teachers would be forced to be spies on their fellow teachers,with pain of discipline if they did.mandatory tattling.camaraderie would not only suffer,but would have to be virtually outlawed.no hugging,ever.no being in the same room alone,ever.no unchaperoned rides in a teacher car,ever.no gifts,ever.policies or guidelines counseling teachers not to give rides to students would be made absolute,without allowance for the possibility of human compassion,sickness,or rain.from the point of view of students and teachers the rule would be assume the worst.any poss
