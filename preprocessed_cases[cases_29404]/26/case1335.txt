in this writ of mandate proceeding,the superior court entered a july,judgment requiring defendant and respondent county of los angeles to include in its calculation of plaintiff and appellant los angeles unified school district lausd property tax allocation base the property tax revenue that lausd actually received from local educational revenue augmentation funds eraf.the resulting increase in lausd property tax allocation base will cause a corresponding increase in lausd allocation of community redevelopment project mitigation or passthrough payments under health and safety code section.
in this appeal from the july,judgment,lausd contends the judgment and orders implementing the judgment do not sufficiently increase its property tax allocation base and,therefore,do not sufficiently increase its passthrough payments.lausd argues that its property tax allocation base must also include its share of the property tax revenue that was diverted from the eraf by the triple flip and vehicle licensing fee swap vlf swap legislation.stats,ch,stats,ch.lausd seeks to revise the judgment and related orders such that its share of the diverted eraf revenue will be added to its property tax allocation base,which will further increase its share of passthrough payments under health and safety code section.
we conclude lausd contention is correct.the relevant property tax allocation statutes and the california supreme court analysis of the triple flip and vlf swap legislation in city of alhambra county of los angeles cal th city of alhambra support lausd contention that its share of the diverted eraf revenue must be included in the calculation of its property tax allocation base,which will result in a corresponding increase in its share of passthrough payments under health and safety code section.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
upon completion of a redevelopment project,the resulting increase in property tax revenue sometimes referred to as the property tax increment is allocated by health and safety code section sometimes referred to as the passthrough legislation among the affected local taxing entities,including schools the passthrough legislation allocates the property tax increment among the affected taxing entities in proportion to the percentage share of property taxes each affected taxing entity receives during the fiscal year the funds are allocated health,subd.a.lausd i,supra,th at.
in,lausd filed the present petition for writ of mandate to compel defendants county of los angeles,city of los angeles,and several community redevelopment and other local agencies collectively,the county to increase its allocation of passthrough payments under health and safety code section.to this end,lausd challenged the omission of eraf revenue from its property tax allocation base.
initially,the superior court entered a judgment denying lausd petition based on its determination that eraf revenue was properly omitted from lausd property tax allocation base and,therefore,no increase in lausd passthrough payments was warranted.however,in lausd appeal from the initial judgment,we reversed the trial court ruling and concluded that eraf revenue should be included in lausd property tax allocation base.lausd i,supra,th.in reaching this conclusion,we relied on subdivision d of sections and of the revenue and taxation code jointly,subdivision d,which incorporates the eraf legislation into the yearly allocation of property taxes under section lausd i,supra,th at.for reasons that will become apparent later in this opinion,we note the allocation statute we relied upon in lausd i,section,is the property tax revenue allocation system principal statute.city of alhambra,supra,cal th at.
subdivision d states in relevant part for purposes of allocations made pursuant to section,the amounts allocated from the educational revenue augmentation fund pursuant to this subdivision,other than amounts deposited in the educational revenue augmentation fund pursuant to the health and safety code,shall be deemed property tax revenue allocated to the educational revenue augmentation fund in the prior fiscal year.
as we stated in lausd i,s ubdivision d plainly and unambiguously states that property tax revenue shifted to eraf under sections and is deemed property tax revenue allocated to the eraf.given that,in the county words,erafs are merely an accounting device,we are compelled to conclude that any property tax revenue deemed allocated to eraf under subdivision d necessarily qualifies as property tax revenue to the school that received it.lausd i,supra,th at.
following our decision in lausd i,the superior court conducted further proceedings that resulted in the present judgment and orders that,in accordance with lausd i,require the county to include the eraf revenue that was actually received by lausd in the calculation of lausd property tax allocation base.however,the judgment and orders rejected lausd contention that its property tax allocation base should also include its share of the property tax revenue that was diverted from the eraf by virtue of the triple flip and vlf swap legislation as eraf revenue.
in this appeal from the judgment and orders implementing the judgment,lausd contends the property tax revenue it would have received from the eraf but for the diversions required by the triple flip and vlf swap legislation must be included in the calculation of its property tax allocation base,which will result in a corresponding increase in its allocation of pass through payments.
discussion 
the resolution of this appeal requires the statutory interpretation of the amendment to health and safety code section,subdivision a.because there are no disputed issues of material fact,the appeal presents a purely legal question.
health and safety code section,subdivision a provides in relevant part that passthrough payments made pursuant to this section to the affected taxing entities shall be allocated among the affected taxing entities in proportion to the percentage share of property taxes each affected taxing entity receives during the fiscal year the funds are allocated,which percentage share shall be determined without regard to any amounts allocated to a city,a city and county,or a county pursuant to sections the triple flip legislation and the vlf swap legislation of the revenue and taxation code,and without regard to any allocation reductions to a city,a city and county,a county,a special district,or a redevelopment agency pursuant to sections,and of the revenue and taxation code and section.
before analyzing this statute,we must first discuss the triple flip and vlf swap legislation.because the supreme court analysis of the triple flip and vlf swap legislation in city of alhambra,supra cal th,provides persuasive if not controlling authority for the disposition of this appeal,we quote at length from that decision below.
i.the triple flip 
the supreme court discussed the triple flip legislation in city of alhambra as follows 
in,the voters approved proposition,the economic recovery bond act,which allowed the state to sell up to billion in bonds to close the state budget deficit.in order to create a dedicated revenue source to guarantee repayment of these bonds without raising taxes,the legislature had already passed section,a temporary revenue measure that shifts revenue in a process known as the triple flip.stats,ch.in the first flip,percent of local sales and use tax revenues are diverted to the state for bond repayment,subd.b.in the second flip,the lost local sales and use tax revenues are replaced by property tax revenue that would have been placed in the county eraf but are instead set aside in a sales and use tax compensation fund established in each county treasury,subds.a,c.in the final flip,any shortfall to schools caused by the reduction of funds to the county eraf is compensated out of the state general fund.this triple flip is slated to end once the recovery act bonds are repaid,subd.b l,subd.b.city of alhambra,supra,cal th at.
