we must decide whether a disabled teacher is a qualified individual with a disability under the americans with disabilities act.
patricia trish johnson,who had a history of depression and bipolar disorder,taught special education in the boundary county school district district in idaho for a decade.in may,johnson entered into a standard teaching contract with the district requiring her to have and maintain the legal qualifications required to teach special education during the school year.in idaho,e very person who is employed to serve in any elementary school or secondary school in the capacity of teacher shall be required to have and to hold a certificate issued under authority of the state board of education.idaho code.the idaho state board of education isbe issued johnson a teaching certificate valid from september,to september.hence,johnson teaching certificate was set to expire around the start of the school year.
to renew her certificate,johnson was required to complete at least six semester hours of professional development training,at least three of which had to be for college credit,during the period that her certificate was valid.idaho admin.code.during this period,johnson completed a number of courses toward renewal of her certificate however,by the summer of,she was still short the required three semester hours of college credit.according to johnson,she had taken much more than just three hours of courses by the start of the summer but had not received any credit because she never paid for the courses.
however,during that summer johnson experienced a major depressive episode that rendered her unable to take any college courses.shortly before classes resumed in the fall,johnson met with the district superintendent,don bartling,and explained that her certificate would soon expire because she had failed to complete the three college credits.superintendent bartling informed johnson that she would need to petition the district board of trustees board to apply for provisional authorization from the isbe to teach without a certificate during the upcoming school year.
school districts in idaho could apply for provisional authorization to hire teachers who lacked the appropriate certification by submitting a letter of request signed by the superintendent and chair of the board of trustees explaining the need for provisional authorization,outlining the good faith effort the district made in attempting to hire someone with appropriate certification,and specifying the teacher qualifications.upon isbe approval,the teacher would be allowed to teach for a nonrenewable term.
johnson appeared before the board on september,and requested that the board apply for provisional authorization for her to teach during the school year.the board voted to deny the request.according to the chairman of the board,melanie staples,the reason for the denial was that johnson had five years to get those three credits and did approach administration until just before school started where her certificate was up.staples testified that the board applied for provisional authorizations only when there was an open position but no certificated teachers available.because there were two certificated special education teachers available to teach in the district,one of them was hired to fill in for johnson.
the board mailed a notice of possible nonrenewal of johnson teaching contract for the school year to johnson on october.two weeks later,the board held a hearing to determine whether johnson had violated the terms of her contract by allowing her teaching certification to lapse.johnson was represented by counsel at the hearing and given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence.johnson testified at length about her history of mental illness,as well as how her depressive episode during the summer of had prevented her from completing the required college credits.at the conclusion of the meeting,the board decided to stand on its previous decision not to seek provisional authorization because of johnson lack of action over the last five years.consequently,johnson was terminated,and the substitute teacher filling in for her was hired on a basis.
on january,johnson filed a complaint against the board in state court alleging statutory and constitutional due process violations,breach of contract,and disability discrimination in violation of the idaho human rights act ihra,idaho code the rehabilitation act of,et and the americans with disabilities act of ada,et.the board removed the action to the district court,which entered summary judgment in the board favor.this timely appeal followed.
the sole claims remaining on appeal are the claims johnson contends that the district court erred in concluding that she was not a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ada.
title i of the ada prohibits discriminat ion against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees.a thus,to prevail on her claims,johnson first must show that she is a qualified individual with a disability.fredenburg contra costa cnty.dep t of health,cir.moreover,she must show that she was qualified at the time of the alleged discrimination see weyer twentieth century fox film,cir.
the ada defines qualified individual as an individual who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,the agency to which congress delegated authority to implement title i of the ada,see id,has promulgated a regulation expanding this definition,see equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities,july.the eeoc regulation provides that a qualified individual with a disability is one who satisfies the requisite skills,experience,education and other requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires,and who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of such position.m emphasis added.we have previously adopted the eeoc inquiry as the test for whether an individual is qualified within the meaning of the ada.see bates united parcel,cir en banc.
the board does not contest that johnson was physically and mentally capable of performing the functions of a special education teacher at the time it denied her request for provisional authorization.the board contends,however,that johnson lack of legal authorization to teach in idaho rendered her unqualified pursuant to the first step of the qualification inquiry.johnson responds that we must consider reasonable accommodation in determining whether she satisfied the job prerequisites.because johnson could have obtained legal authorization to teach had the board granted her request for accommodation,she contends that she met the first step.
initially,we note that the first step of the qualification inquiry,unlike the second step,contains no reference to reasonable accommodation.if the eeoc had intended to require employers to provide reasonable accommodation to ensure that disabled individuals can satisfy the job prerequisites,in addition to the essential job functions,it presumably could have said so in the regulation.that the eeoc declined to include any reference to reasonable accommodation in the first step suggests that such omission was deliberate.see fedorenko united states.
our reading is supported by the eeoc interpretive guidance on title i guidance.in discussing the qualification inquiry,the guidance explains that t he first step is to determine if the individual satisfies the prerequisites for the position,such as possessing the appropriate educational background,employment experience,skills,licenses,pt,app.to m.hence,the first step in determining whether an accountant who is a paraplegic is qualified for a certified public accountant cpa position is to examine the individual credentials to determine whether the individual is a licensed cpa.id.absent from this discussion is any mention of a requirement that the employer consider whether the individual could become a licensed cpa with reasonable accommodation.
according to another section of the guidance,the obligation to make reasonable accommodation is owed only to an individual with a disability who is qualified within the meaning of m in that he or she satisfies all the skill,experience,education and other selection criteria.pt,app.to a.the guidance further provides that a n individual with a disability is otherwise qualified if he or she is qualified for a job,except that,because of the disability,he or she needs a reasonable accommodation to be able to perform the job essential functions.id.such statements make clear that unless a disabled individual independently satisfies the job prerequisites,she is not otherwise qualified,and the employer is not obligated to furnish any reasonable accommodation that would enable her to perform the essential job functions.
the guidance then provides the following example to illustrate when the duty of reasonable accommodation would be triggered 
for example,if a law firm requires that all incoming lawyers have graduated from an accredited law school and have passed the bar examination,the law firm need not provide an accommodation to an individual with a visual impairment who has not met these selection criteria.that individual is not entitled to a reasonable accommodation because the individual is not otherwise qualified for the position.
on the other hand,if the individual has graduated from an accredited law school and passed the bar examination,the individual would be otherwise qualified.the law firm would thus be required to provide a reasonable accommodation,such as a machine that magnifies print,to enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the attorney position,unless the necessary accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the law firm.
id.emphasis added.again,the guidance explicitly disclaims any requirement of providing reasonable accommodation to disabled individuals who fail to meet the job prerequisites on their own 
the eeoc as amicus curiae points out that a different section of the guidance provides that selection criteria that are related to an essential function of the job may not be used to exclude an individual with a disability if that individual could satisfy the criteria with the provision of a reasonable accommodation.pt,app.to emphasis added.thus,the eeoc asserts that reasonable accommodation must be considered under the first step of the qualification inquiry 
the guidance section cited by the eeoc pertains to challenges to qualification standards,employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities.see b.we have previously observed,in the context of a challenge to an employer facially discriminatory qualification standard,that it would make little sense to require an ada plaintiff to show that he meets a qualification standard that he undisputedly can not meet because of his disability and that forms the very basis of his discrimination challenge.bates,at.if the employee succeeds in showing that the qualification standard has the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability,the burden then shifts to the employer to show that the qualification standard is,consistent with business necessity,and that performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation.id.at quoting a.
here,however,johnson does not challenge the board legal authorization requirement as a discriminatory job prerequisite.rather,the basis for johnson discrimination claim is the board failure to accommodate her disability,which is analytically distinct from a claim of disparate treatment or impact under the ada.see mcgary city of portland,cir.because johnson does not allege,let alone show,that the board requirement was discriminatory in effect,the guidance section pertaining to discriminatory qualification standards is inapposite 
in sum,an individual who fails to satisfy the job prerequisites can not be considered qualified within the meaning of the ada unless she shows that the prerequisite is itself discriminatory in effect.otherwise,the default rule remains that the obligation to make reasonable accommodation is owed only to an individual with a disability who satisfies all the skill,experience,education and other selection criteria.pt,app.to a.because johnson does not allege that the board legal authorization requirement was itself discriminatory,her failure to satisfy such requirement rendered her unqualified,and the board was not required to accommodate her disability 
the judgment of the district court is 
i concur in the judgment and in parts i and ii a of the majority opinion.at the time of the alleged discrimination,patricia johnson did not possess the required certification to be employed as a special education teacher by the boundary county school district the district.the accommodation that she sought provisional authorization for the district to hire an uncertified teacher is an accommodation to a local school district wholly within the discretion of the idaho state board of education.the district did not have the authority to grant provisional authorization,and therefore could not grant johnson the accommodation she requested.the district court properly granted summary judgment to the district.
we therefore need not decide whether the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has properly interpreted its own regulation to include a duty of reasonable accommodation in the first step of the inquiry into whether a person is a qualified individual under the americans with disabilities act ada see m interpreting of the ada.the majority,however,proceeds to give its own interpretation of section m and rejects the reasonable position of the eeoc.because the majority does not afford the requisite deference due to the eeoc interpretation of its own regulations,i can not agree with parts ii b,ii c,and iii of judge opinion.
at the heart of this appeal is the idaho state board of education procedure for a school district to obtain provisional authorization to hire an uncertified teacher.the board of education is vested with the authority to issue teaching certificates,which it delegates to the state department of education.idaho admin.code.at the time johnson requested a waiver of certification,the board had created a procedure through which local school districts could obtain provisional authorization to hire uncertified teachers to apply for authorization,a school district is required to submit a letter with a statement explaining the need for the request,detailing the qualifications of the individual the district seeks to hire,and outlining the good faith effort the district made in attempting to hire someone with appropriate certification.the provisional authorization is valid for only one year,is,and the teacher hired must obtain proper certification in order to continue teaching once the authorization expires.
the provisional authorization thus grants authority to a school district to fill a vacancy with an individual who does not possess the required state certification,but only after it has been unable to find a certified teacher,having made a good faith effort to do so.presumably,a capable but uncertified teacher is in many cases better than no teacher at all.the board policy makes clear,however,that provisional authorization to hire an uncertified teacher is an accommodation of last resort to local school districts,not an accommodation to a teacher who does not possess the required certification.see idaho state bd.of educ.summary of alternative to certification,available at t his authorization does not lead to certification,it is an emergency authorization available to school districts.the authorization process is an exception to idaho code,which provides that e very person who is employed to serve in any elementary school or secondary school in the capacity of teacher shall be required to have and to hold a certificate issued under authority of the state board of education.further,the authorization process does not provide a school district with
