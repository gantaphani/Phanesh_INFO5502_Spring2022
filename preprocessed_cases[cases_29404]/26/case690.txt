here we confront the question whether a state breach of contract action provides adequate due process to protect the rights of a school superintendent facing termination,whose hearing fell short of due process requirements.for the reasons to be set forth,we conclude that,in the circumstances presented,it does not.we also hold that the superintendent to be terminated did not waive his procedural due process claim by attending his hearing only to object to its procedures.accordingly,we reverse.
the parties to this conflict are the dual centers of authority that guide public education throughout the country.on the one hand is the school board,representing the people,and on the other hand,the school board selected operating leader of the schools,the superintendent.in,plaintiff kelly baird was hired by the warren county school district board of education to serve as superintendent and principal under a contract that provided he could be dismissed only for cause.employment contract at.the contract broadly defined cause as any conduct,act,or failure to act by the superintendent which is detrimental to the best interests of the school district.id.at.the contract also provided that reasons for discharge were to be given in writing to the superintendent,who would then be entitled to notice and a hearing before the board to discuss the merits.id.
early in the school year,baird found himself under close scrutiny by certain board members,who in conjunction with their observations,began to collect a variety of deprecatory comments about baird and his activities from secretaries,teachers and other district employees.this investigation of the new superintendent continued throughout the school year until april of,when the accumulated tidbits of derogation were distilled into the form of baird annual performance review.pursuant to the contract,on april,the board presented baird with its evaluation of his performance and a letter that notified him of its intent to terminate him for cause for the reasons contained in the evaluation and advised him of a hearing to consider his termination to take place on may.
upon receiving this letter,baird contacted his attorney,who promptly responded to the board by letter requesting a continuance,copies of underlying documents,the names of individuals who had provided information included in the employment evaluation and the recusal of certain biased board members who had led the investigative efforts against baird.the board in its reply denied these requests and stated further that it would not call witnesses,that it would not identify the individuals whose claims had provided the substance of the employment evaluation,that it could not compel any district employees to attend the hearing,that baird was only entitled to notice and the opportunity to be heard and that baird could question board members only as to issues about which those members had spoken.in the final communication between the parties,which took place on the day of the hearing,baird attorney objected to the hearing procedures specified by the board as unfair.that evening,when the board convened to discuss his termination,baird appeared with his attorney to protest what he claimed to be contractual and due process violations,and he then departed.the board proceeded to consider baird termination in his absence,and predictably voted to end what had become an acrimonious employment relationship.thereafter,it forwarded to baird a copy of its resolution of termination.
having been fired without receiving what he considered to be a fair hearing,baird brought an action in state court seeking damages against the board pursuant to,alleging that the board termination procedures violated his right to procedural due process.baird claimed that certain board members were biased against him and could not have served as neutral decision makers.he also asserted a breach of contract claim under illinois law.after the board removed the case to federal court,baird filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to liability on his due process claim alleging an insufficient hearing,and the board and board members filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims.thus,there were on all issues save the issue of biased decision makers.
the district court granted the board motion and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over baird common law breach of contract claim,remanding it back to state court.citing cleveland board of education loudermill,d,the district court stated that,provided there was a full due process hearing after termination,a hearing need only provide notice of the charge,an explanation of the basis of the charge and an opportunity to respond.baird hearing had satisfied these requirements.the district court concluded that here the state suit for breach of contract met due process requirements.in addition,the district court rejected baird allegations of bias,finding that his evidence had not overcome the presumption that board members were acting in the public interest and that their concerns had stemmed from baird job performance and not personal animosity.
the issue here is whether a state breach of contract suit provides due process if the hearing does not.we also turn to the question whether a public employee waives the right to challenge a hearing on due process grounds when he attends the hearing only to object to its procedures.
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we review the district court determination de novo.new burnham prairie homes,vill.of burnham,cir.
we agree with the district court determination that the board members decision to terminate baird was not tainted with bias.while the conduct of certain board members appears to have been petty and maladroit,this seems to have been more a matter of modus operandi and style than of substantial prejudice.we are not persuaded,however,that the board procedures were entirely fair.the truncated hearing afforded to baird could comport with due process only if he received full due process promptly after termination.the error here was in determining under what circumstances a breach of contract suit can afford due process.
there can be no due process without the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d quoting armstrong manzo,d.a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case must precede the deprivation of life,liberty or property.loudermill,at.internal citations omitted.a court considering what process is due in a specific situation must weigh three factors f irst,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.mathews,at.
the supreme court has long recognized that a public employee can have a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment such interests are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law bd.of regents roth,d colburn tr.of indiana,cir property interests exist when an employer discretion is clearly limited so that the employee can not be denied employment unless specific conditions are met.applying the mathews test to determine that terminated school district employees were not entitled to full hearings in loudermill,the supreme court stated that a hearing need only be an initial check against mistaken,a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.loudermill,at.the court holding,however,rested on the fact that the terminated employees were entitled to a hearing before the ohio personnel board,and the court cautioned that the existence of procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of procedures.id.at.
our own seventh circuit precedent likewise establishes that,when there is an opportunity for a full hearing,due process does not require an employer to provide full rights such as the right to present or witnesses at the hearing.staples city of milwaukee,cir.see also head chicago sch.reform bd.of,cir when full procedures are available,public employer must provide a public employee with a protected property interest with notice,explanation of evidence and a chance to tell his side of the story.
the issue in the case before us is whether a lawsuit for breach of contract can remedy the full due process deficiency in the proceedings.lujan g g fire sprinklers,d,is the leading supreme court case addressing this question.with respect to lujan,the question of when a judicial remedy like this provides adequate due process,as the district court found,is elusive.a fine line distinguishes factual scenarios in which a judicial remedy for breach of contract is adequate from those in which it is not.not all injuries are equal,and not all parties can be made whole through a breach of contract action.the somewhat obscure quality that separates one from the other is important and yet eludes precise definition.the supreme court has referred to this mysterious element as a present entitlement,and identifies cases involving this factor as ones in which the claimant was denied a right by virtue of which he was presently entitled either to exercise ownership dominion over real or personal property,or to pursue a gainful occupation.lujan,at.see also deboer pennington,cir quoting lujan definition of present entitlement and canby,concurring distinguishing perry sindermann,d,which involved,like the present case,the due process protection of a personal property interest in employment.
a present entitlement is immediately distinguishable from the contractual interests dealt with in lujan and its progeny.in lujan,the state of california withheld funds from a public works subcontractor and imposed penalties after receiving notice that the subcontractor had violated provisions of the state labor code.the supreme court characterized the subcontractor interest as merely a contractual interest,a deprivation of payment that it contends it is owed under a contract that could be adequately protected through a breach of contract suit.lujan,at.moreover,the supreme court contrasted the subcontractor interest with two illustrative examples of present entitlements in the employment context

id the postdeprivation remedies appropriate to the deprivation of an interest to which there is a present entitlement are characterized by promptness and by the ability to restore the claimant to possession.the underlying concept seems to be that the remedy is available before the loss has become complete and irrevocable.
a state law breach of contract action is not an adequate remedy for a terminated employee who possesses a present entitlement and who has been afforded only a limited hearing.id.while it does provide a species of due process,a lawsuit does not satisfy the requirement of promptness,which is essential if the employee is to pursue remedies such as reinstatement.while there is no specific time frame within which a hearing must be held to qualify as prompt,lack of a speedy resolution to proceedings may result in a denial of due process.loudermill,at.see also devito chicago park,cir holding that a hearing must be prompt and that,under guidelines for determining promptness for hearings enunciated in fdic mallen,d,a year delay in holding a hearing did not deny a terminated public employee due process.similarly,while there is no automatic right to reinstatement,it is normally an integral part of the remedy for a constitutionally impermissible employment action.reeves claiborne county bd.of,cir united food commercial workers local john hofmeister son,cir reinstatement and back pay awards are common remedies in wrongful discharge cases.further,as the sixth circuit has noted,employment,especially in a career such as education,is more than a way to make money it is a profession with significant rewards,and consequently money damages may be a hollow victory.banks burkich,cir citing allen autauga county bd.of,cir.thus,when a public employee terminated for cause has a present entitlement,and when the only available remedy is the opportunity to bring a state breach of contract suit,the hearing to which such an employee is entitled must fully satisfy the due process requirements of confrontation and in addition to the minimal loudermill requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard.
after reviewing the facts of this case,we conclude that baird has established his present entitlement.baird interest is distinguishable from those in lujan and its progeny he was terminated in the first year of a contract,and had a protected property interest in remaining in office under his contract for its full term and in being compensated accordingly see lujan,at.baird present entitlement also meant that he was entitled to pursue reinstatement promptly if his rights had been violated.accordingly,the board was obligated to provide a hearing that fully complied with due process.this it failed to do.
the board takes credit for generous hearing procedures to a degree such that one might envision the proceedings as a veritable cornucopia of due process protections.in reality,however,the board gestures seem to have been just.while baird was ostensibly afforded the opportunity to call and question witnesses,the board effectively emasculated this provision by refusing to furnish him with the names of district employees who had acted as undercover school board informants.baird was also allowed to question board only about matters as to which they had spoken.what the board gave to baird with the left hand,it seemed to take away with the right,leaving baird with a hearing that may have satisfied a loudermill standard,but little else and the board has offered no reason why more generous measures under the mathews criteria might have been difficult or impossible to supply.
we are aware that baird presumably does not now as a practical matter pursue reinstatement as a remedy.however,this does not alter our analysis.the kind of remedies that conform to due process must be available promptly and must generally include the possibility of reinstatement.otherwise they are not adequate to address the loss of a present entitlement.
in reaching this conclusion,we find persuasive the reasoning of mcclure independent school district,cir,in which a principal terminated under a contract was afforded only a minimal hearing in which the district attorney presented live witnesses and sought to introduce accusatory affidavits from identified district employees.the tenth circuit found that the terminated principal was entitled to confront and those individuals whose work deprives a person of his livelihood.mcclure,at.mcclure underscores the importance of here,for the opportunity for confrontation was even more fully denied here where baird was deliberately prevented from ascertaining the identities of his accusers.
moreover,seventh circuit precedent is to the same effect.we have never held that a state breach of contract action provides a terminated public employee with adequate due process when that employee possessed a present entitlement.the present case is immediately distinguishable from other cases cited by the board.the board invocation of strasburger board of education,hardin county community unit school district,cir,is simply not persuasive since strasburger,primarily concerned with substantive due process,essentially held th
