ann mullin sued several administrators at western illinois university,her employer,charging that they retaliated against her for expressing speech protected by the first amendment.a jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts and mullin now challenges the judgment for the second count,claiming errors in jury instructions and in evidentiary rulings.because she failed to prove the necessary causal link between her protected speech and the administrators actions,we affirm the judgment.
mullin worked as an art professor for the college of fine arts and communication college at western illinois university western from august until her march,retirement.in,the college held gatherings called forums at private homes.the forums provided an opportunity for members of western arts community to meet in an informal setting and discuss topics relevant to the arts.although mullin did not attend the forum held on october,an incident at that event eventually led to the filing of this lawsuit.at the forum,senior art student stephanie butts was discussing the work of a visiting artist with her professor and faculty advisor,jan clough.the discussion was somewhat tense,with clough characterizing the visiting artist as a whore in the art world.butts sought to defend the artist by stating that all artists prostituted their work to some degree.there is considerable disagreement about what was said in this conversation but everyone agrees that it ended with clough saying to butts words to the effect that,well,okay.then you a whore.i paid you last week,did i clough,who is female,apparently meant the comments in jest,and was trying to put the conversation to a friendly end.butts took great offense at these remarks,in part because she had previously confided to clough that she had been raped during her freshman year.she left the forum shortly thereafter.at the same event,art professor michael mahoney used language with students who asked the professors present to be more blunt in their assessments of the students work.according to mahoney,the student said,when our work is fucking shit,would you please tell us and mahoney replied,okay,your work is fucking shit.as with the exchange,there are quibbles over the exact wording,sequence and intent of these remarks,but everyone agrees that clough called butts a whore and mahoney characterized a student work as fucking shit.
mullin heard about the forum from other students and heard various renditions of both clough and mahoney remarks.mullin was one of butts teachers that semester and several days after the forum,butts spoke to mullin about the event.butts was upset and crying when she described the evening to mullin,confiding that she felt clough had violated her trust about the rape.butts also told mullin that her parents planned to see a lawyer about what had happened.after this conversation,mullin consulted her brothers who recommended that she notify the university about the incident.approximately three weeks after the forum,mullin sent a letter to edmond gettinger,the chair of the art department at western,with a copy and cover letter to donald spencer,the president of the university.in the november,letter,mullin reported that a student revealed to her that clough had called the student a whore in front of other students and faculty at a forum where alcohol was consumed.mullin also stated that other students had advised her about mahoney remark.she said that still other students told her they had been pulled from class and told by faculty members not to talk to anyone about these matters.mullin emphasized that she was hesitant to report these events because she was not present at the forum and thus did not have personal knowledge of what was said there.she also indicated that she lacked the resources to properly investigate what actually happened and she did not wish to adversely affect the pending tenure applications of either clough or mahoney.she explained that she did not know whether her description of these events was complete or accurate.she noted that these matters might expose the university to liability,that the event had been given extensive notoriety among both students and faculty,and that she thought the university president should be informed.she remarked that gettinger must have heard enough about what had happened to know that he should inform the president and that the university should respond immediately and in a highly visible manner.because gettinger had not yet taken any action,she felt obliged to raise the issue herself.in the cover letter to spencer,she alluded to difficulties with the current leadership of the art department,presumably a reference to gettinger.
after receiving mullin letter,gettinger contacted james butterworth,the dean of the college.butterworth told gettinger that mullin letter had been forwarded to the president and that mullin had questioned gettinger competence to run the art department in a separate letter to the president.gettinger was aware that a group of faculty in the art department was seeking to have him removed as chair.butterworth supported gettinger as chair.in december,butterworth met with butts parents,apologized,and told them there would be an investigation.thereafter,with the approval of president spencer and western provost burton witthuhn,butterworth conducted an evaluation of the art department and an investigation into the forum incident.as a result of the evaluation and investigation,butterworth issued a department report butterworth report on january.the butterworth report did not specifically mention the october,forum,but did allude to allegations of sexual misconduct and drinking at art department events.the butterworth report noted that eight faculty members supported gettinger as chair and seven indicated nonsupport.butterworth recommended to spencer and witthuhn that,among other things,gettinger continue as chair,alcohol was to be eliminated from all future undergraduate forums or gatherings,and the chair was to schedule a meeting to review with all current students the university policy on sexual harassment.moreover,faculty were to receive a copy of the policy for their records and compliance.butts parents saw the butterworth report and wrote a letter to gettinger expressing their dissatisfaction.gettinger responded with a february,letter telling them that the university was continuing to review the matter.
faculty at western typically were assigned the classes they would teach one year before a semester started.by the time the butterworth report was issued,the spring semester was already underway and the fall classes had already been assigned.mullin was on sabbatical for the spring semester.thus,fall was the first semester following mullin letter to gettinger that gettinger had an opportunity to assign mullin class schedule.for that semester,gettinger assigned mullin to teach only entry level courses,contrary to the mix of entry and upper level courses she had previously taught.he also reduced her committee assignments from four to one for the fall semester.according to gettinger,he assigned mullin to these core,entry level classes because there had been significant turnover in the art department faculty and he needed her to cover these classes he noted that he considered mullin to be one of his strongest teachers.other faculty members testified that committee assignments were typically open to anyone who would volunteer for them.on april,mullin filed a grievance complaining about her assignment to entry level classes and the reduction in committee assignments.she met with witthuhn and associate provost eric stiffler to discuss her grievance.at this meeting,stiffler suggested that mullin consider retirement as a resolution to her grievance.mullin,then,replied that she would be happy to retire depending on her benefits.mullin wanted to retire with her maximum eighty percent annuity benefit.
thereafter,mullin requested a report showing her sick leave accrual to date.mullin feared that accounting errors in her sick leave accrual would result in a reduction of her retirement benefits.in may,becky mahr,a human resources office
