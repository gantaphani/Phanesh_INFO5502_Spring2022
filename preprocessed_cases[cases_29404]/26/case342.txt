this case poses the question of whether the standard for a free appropriate public education under the individuals with disabilities education act has changed since board of education rowley,d.we hold that it has not and affirm the judgment of the district court that the fairfax county school board did not violate that standard in this case.
the individuals with disabilities education act idea creates a federal grant program to assist states in educating children with disabilities.see.to receive federal funding,states must provide each student with a disability a free appropriate public education fape.id.a.states,through local educational agencies,achieve this by developing an individualized education program iep for each child who has a disability.id.a.the iep documents the student current level of achievement,sets annual goals,states how to measure progress,and specifies special education services.see id.d a.educators work with the student parents as part of an iep team to develop the iep.id.d b,d a.at least annually,that team must review the iep and revise it as appropriate.id.d.
additionally,the idea establishes procedural safeguards for students and their parents.id.these include the right to an impartial due process hearing if the local educational agency and parents disagree on the appropriate iep.id.b,f.after the hearing officer makes a decision,any unsatisfied party may bring a civil action in federal court.id.i.the court then reviews the record,hears additional evidence if requested by either party,and makes a decision as to the appropriateness of the iep based on the preponderance of the evidence.id.i c.
appellant attended public school in fairfax county for kindergarten and first grade.he has several medical disorders doose syndrome a seizure disorder,atrial septal defect a small hole in his heart,and ankyloglossia a disorder commonly referred to as.those disorders qualify him for special education under the other health impairment category.for kindergarten and first grade,school developed and revised ieps for him with his parents approval.
under his initial kindergarten iep,received special education services during fifteen of the thirty hours in his school week.he received those services in his general education classroom with a special education teacher or instructional assistant working with him on his iep goals.additionally,received two hours each month of occupational therapy in a special education classroom.later that year,the iep team added two hours each month of adapted physical education.after a speech evaluation,it also added four hours of speech and language therapy each month,which later increased to six hours each month.
for first grade,the team revised iep to meet his goals in communication,reading readiness,reading comprehension,writing,writing readiness,mathematics readiness,attending skills,and adapted physical education.continued receiving six hours each month of speech and language therapy and two hours each month of occupational therapy,but his adapted physical education increased to four hours each month.the team gradually shifted hours away from the general education classroom until ten of his fifteen hours were in the special education classroom.
over the course of first grade,missed over thirty full school days,and part of almost twenty additional days.toward the end of that year,a committee designated by fairfax county reviewed psychological,sociocultural,and educational evaluations of to determine if he still qualified for special education.it also reviewed testing results that parents submitted from the kennedy krieger institute,a private institution.the committee included representatives from the fairfax county school board school board,as well as mother and a family friend.it again found eligible for special education under the other health impairment category.
for second grade,the iep team proposed new goals in writing and written language,reading,mathematics,communications,and behavior improvements.in the proposed plan,would continue to receive two hours each month of occupational therapy and six hours each month of speech and language therapy,both in a special education setting.he would also continue to receive fifteen hours of other special education services,but with more of those hours in his general education classroom.this time,however,parents rejected the school proposed iep.the team attempted to address some of their concerns by adding and modifying goals in writing,reading,math,organization,and behavior.but parents also requested a aide,extended school year services,and that fcps assign a nurse to the school.the team did not adopt those requests,and the parents did not agree to the new iep.
instead,parents,on his behalf,requested a due process hearing to determine whether the school board provided him a fape.they challenged the adequacy of his education on six grounds inadequate instruction in reading,math,and writing inadequate occupational therapy and speech and language services lack of extended school year services lack of a aide failure to program for his safety lack of a nurse and failure to develop an appropriate iep for second grade.as evidence that had not progressed,he pointed to results from the woodcock johnson third edition the kaufman test of educational achievement,second edition and the school board sociocultural evaluation.based on those evaluations,argued that he had actually regressed academically.
after conducting a hearing,in which the hearing officer heard from fourteen witnesses and received over exhibits,the officer issued a detailed written opinion.in that opinion,the officer first recognized that the iep team had complied with the idea procedural requirements in developing ieps,and then evaluated the implementation of the ieps.the officer considered ieps and progress reports particularly important exhibits and noted that all of the testifying witnesses were open and honest.
the officer then credited ten witnesses in particular,who were o.teachers and other educational experts.all testified to progress during kindergarten and first grade,and explained why each additional accommodation that his parents requested was unnecessary for second grade.while acknowledging that the idea does not require parents to present expert testimony,the officer noted that,in contrast to the school board showing,parents offer ed virtually no witnesses,other than the parent,to support their position.the hearing officer concluded that the school board had provided a fape.
filed a complaint in federal court challenging the decision.both parties moved for judgment on the administrative record.the district court held that the hearing officer findings were regularly made,and thus entitled to some deference.the court then rejected each of challenges,concluding that the school board did provide a fape and affirming the hearing officer decision.noted this timely appeal.
initially and principally,argues that the district court applied the wrong standard in evaluating whether he received a fape.specifically,he maintains that in the current version of the idea,a fape requires meaningful rather than some educational benefit.our analysis of the statute is a question of law that we review de novo.see wlr foods,tyson foods,cir.
congress first required a fape as part of the education for all handicapped children act of eha.see education for all handicapped children act of,stat.since then,congress has amended the act multiple times.the amendment renamed the eha as the idea.see individuals with disabilities act of,stat.the idea,as amended in,remains in effect today.see individuals with disabilities act of,stat.codified as amended at.both the original eha and the current idea require the states to provide a fape to students with disabilities.they define it in almost identical terms 
in board of education rowley,d,the supreme court provided more content to the fape requirement.in that case,a deaf student challenged her iep because her school refused to provide her an interpreter.id.at.although she performed better than many of her peers,she understood considerably less than she would have without her
