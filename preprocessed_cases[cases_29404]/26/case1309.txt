this case requires us to interpret provisions of the california tort claims act,et requiring public employers to defend and indemnify their employees for third party claims arising out of acts within the scope of employment.these provisions provide that in the usual civil case brought against a public employee,a public entity must provide a defense to the employee et and pay any claim or judgment against him.et where the public entity refuses to defend,the employee can seek a writ of mandate alternatively,he can fund his own defense and then sue for reasonable attorney fees,costs and expenses incurred if the action or proceeding arose out of an act or omission in the scope of his employment as an employee of the public entity,but recovery is barred if the agency establishes the employee acted or failed to act because of actual fraud,corruption or actual malice.stone regents of university of california th,stone.
in this case,an adult student sued the los angeles community college district the district and igor daza,a guidance counselor employed by the district,alleging daza sexually assaulted her when she went to his office for counseling services the main lawsuit.the district refused to defend him,so he paid for his own defense and filed a denying the allegations of sexual assault and seeking indemnity and reimbursement for his defense.after the district settled the main lawsuit without admitting liability and without a factual determination of whether daza was acting within the scope of his employment,the student dismissed all her claims against the district and daza with prejudice.the district then demurred to daza,arguing the student allegations of sexual assault in the main lawsuit fell outside the scope of daza employment as a matter of law.daza opposed,arguing he was not limited to the allegations in the main lawsuit in carrying his burden to prove the acts fell within the scope of his employment.the trial court agreed with the district and refused to look beyond the allegations in the main lawsuit to hold as a matter of law that the alleged acts of sexual assault fell outside the scope of daza employment.
we reverse.we agree with the trial court that the sexual assault alleged in the main lawsuit fell outside the scope of daza employment as a matter of law.but under a proper interpretation of section,the determination of whether an employee acted within the scope of employment is factual and can not be limited to the third party allegations in the underlying lawsuit when the employee denies those allegations,and the employee version of events would demonstrate acts within the scope of employment.
background 
as alleged in her operative first amended complaint fac,plaintiff jazmyne goodwin was an adult student at los angeles southwest college lasc,a school within the district.daza worked as a guidance counselor and advisor for lasc,and at all times was an employee and agent for lasc and the district.his responsibilities included providing educational and emotional counseling for students like goodwin.in that capacity,he was assigned to goodwin as a counselor,which created a special relationship between her and daza and the district.he used his position of authority to sexually harass and molest her.
in the evening of may,she went to daza office to meet with him to discuss the problem with the humanities class she had dropped the fashion classes at trade tech and possible field trips to see various colleges to get her bachelor degree.when she entered his office,he closed the door and took her cell phone from her.he examined the pictures on the phone without her consent,telling her,you take a lot of pictures.i like the one with your nipple ring.i am going to send the picture to myself.surprised and shocked,she told him not to send it.nonetheless,he sent the picture to his cell phone.
upset,goodwin got up to leave.daza grabbed her wrist and pulled her toward him.he said,are you a freak i heard aries are freaks.she pushed him away.he said,if you do want me to touch you,maybe you would like me to lick you.she responded,no.i want to leave.she told him she had a boyfriend and said,it too much for me.she could not leave because he was blocking her path.he touched,caressed,and kissed her neck,placed his left hand in her dress on the upper part of her breast,and asked if he could see her nipple ring.she pushed him away.he was still holding her hair,but finally let her go.she left the office,and he followed her.he said he did not notice her butt was that big and she should really think about going on a date with him.she walked to her car,and he continued to follow her.at this point,she was shocked to see he had sent the photo of her nipple ring to his own cell phone.he did all this for his own sexual gratification.
a criminal investigation of this incident was commenced,and on may,daza resigned his employment with the district.he was paid a severance bonus.
the fac alleged causes of action,including claims against daza for negligence statutory breach,intentional infliction of emotional distress sexual battery,battery assault sexual harassment,gender violence,false imprisonment negligent sexual abuse and sexual harassment,ralph act.the district eventually settled the lawsuit with goodwin without admitting liability,and goodwin dismissed the complaint against both the district and daza with prejudice.
after protracted procedural wrangling not pertinent to this appeal,daza filed a third amended tacc,which alleged three against the district statutory defense,statutory indemnity,and alternatively a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the district to provide a defense and indemnity.daza denied all of goodwin allegations of sexual assault in the main lawsuit and denied he believed his acts were unlawful.he acknowledged his resignation and his severance payment of.he alleged his settlement agreement with the district included a clause stating that he and the district agree that nothing in this agreement reduces,nullifies,or otherwise affects the rights and responsibilities of the parties to defense and indemnification pursuant to the government code,education code and any other provision of law or regulation including,specifically but without limitation,those rights and responsibilities in the government code division,including,without limitation,those provisions in part chapter article,commencing with section,and part commencing with section.he also alleged the district never afforded him an evidentiary or other hearing on the issue of defense and indemnity,and it never made a determination that he was not acting within the scope of his employment or acted with actual fraud,corruption,or actual malice.
the district demurred to the tacc.it argued daza claim for indemnity failed because the district entered a settlement with goodwin that resulted in dismissal of her lawsuit with prejudice,so daza was not required to pay any claim or judgment.it also argued daza claim for reimbursement for his defense and a writ of mandate failed because his alleged conduct fell outside the scope of his employment as a matter of law.although not stated explicitly,this argument presupposed that determination was limited to the allegations in the main lawsuit.
in opposition,daza conceded his indemnity claim was moot in light of goodwin settlement and dismissal of the main lawsuit,but he disagreed his claims for a defense and for a writ of mandate failed.he argued goodwin allegations did not allege conduct that fell outside the scope of his employment as a matter of law and,since he denied the allegations,there has been no factual determination that he committed the acts goodwin alleged.alternatively,daza requested leave to amend to allege additional facts refuting goodwin allegations and to add a declaratory relief claim under his settlement agreement with the district.
the trial court initially overruled the demurrer because there had been no factual determination in the main lawsuit that daza had sexually assaulted goodwin or that he was acting outside the scope of his employment but relying on a newly issued appellate opinion in the insurance context that was subsequently depublished the trial court reversed course and sustained the demurrer and dismissed the with prejudice.it concluded it was limited to reviewing the allegations in goodwin main lawsuit and held those allegations showed as a matter of law that daza was acting outside his scope of employment.

by statute,a public employer generally has the obligation to defend an employee in a civil lawsuit arising from acts the employee has taken within the scope of employment except as otherwise provided in sections and,upon request of an employee or former employee,a public entity shall provide for the defense of any civil action or proceeding brought against him,in his official or individual capacity or both,on account of an act or omission in the scope of his employment as an employee of the public entity.
when the employee requests a defense,the employer may refuse to provide for the defense of a civil action or proceeding brought against an employee or former employee if the public entity determines any of the following the act or omission was not within the scope of his or her employment.he or she acted or failed to act because of actual fraud,corruption,or actual malice.the defense of the action or proceeding by the public entity would create a specific conflict of interest between the public entity and the employee or former employee,subd.a.the employer has days from receiving a written request to inform the employee whether it will or will not provide a defense and the reason for its refusal,subd.b.if the employee is dissatisfied with the employer decision,he or she may pursue a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the employer to provide a defense.in that circumstance,the employee bears the burden to show the acts or omissions fell within the scope of employment stone,supra,th at,but the employer decision will be sustained if it is within the range of reason id.at.
alternatively,if the employer refuses to provide a defense,the employee may pay for his or her own defense and seek reimbursement from the employer if after request a public entity fails or refuses to provide an employee or former employee with a defense against a civil action or proceeding brought against him and the employee retains his own counsel to defend the action or proceeding,he is entitled to recover from the public entity such reasonable attorney fees,costs and expenses as are necessarily incurred by him in defending the action or proceeding if the action or proceeding arose out of an act or omission in the scope of his employment as an employee of the public entity,but he is not entitled to such reimbursement if the public entity establishes that he acted or failed to act because of actual fraud,corruption or actual malice.this remedy does not eliminate an employee right to petition for a writ of mandate to compel the public entity or the governing body or an employee thereof to perform the duties imposed by this part.ibid.as with a request under section,the employee bears the burden under section to prove the action arose from acts or omissions within the scope of employment.farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th,farmers stone,supra,th at,fn.noting the employer determination at the first step that the employee conduct was outside the scope of employment is not the last word,of course.under section,the employee could pay for his own defense and then recover from the employer by establishing that the plaintiffs suit did arise out of actions taken within the scope of his university employment.
before we reach the main question of whether daza was limited to the allegations in the main lawsuit to establish his claim under section,we necessarily reject his contention the allegations themselves showed acts arising from the scope of his employment.an employee willful and malicious intentional torts,including those that might contravene an employer express policies,do not automatically fall outside the scope of employment.farmers,supra,cal th at.but to fall within the scope of employment,the intentional misconduct must be an outgrowth of the employment and the risk of tortious injury must be inherent in the working environment or typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise the employer has undertaken.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th,lisa see john chaparral treatment center,th,john.similarly,the intentional conduct must be foreseeable from the employee duties,which means in the context of the particular enterprise,the conduct was not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer business.lisa,supra,at.
sexual assaults are not per se beyond the scope of employment.lisa,supra,cal th at john,supra,th at.but courts have rarely held an employee sexual assault or sexual harassment of a third party falls within the scope of employment.see,lisa,supra,at technician sexual molestation of patient during ultrasound not within scope of employment farmers,supra,cal th at deputy sheriff sexual harassment of other deputy sheriffs working at county jail outside scope of employment john oakland unified school dist.cal d,teacher sexual molestation of student at teacher apartment during sanctioned extracurricular program not within scope of employment county of riverside th,social worker sexual assault of minor outside of work hours and at social worker apartment not within scope of employment john,supra,at counselor sexual molestation of minor living in residential facility not within scope of employment alma oakland unified school dist.d,school janitor rape of student in janitor office not within scope of employment but see mary city of los angeles cal d,mary unique case of police officer misuse of official authority to rape woman he detained falls within scope of employment.
consistent with the vast weight of authority,we conclude goodwin allegations of sexual assault against daza fell outside his scope of employment as a guidance counselor for the district.his alleged conduct was not an outgrowth of his employment,it was neither inherent in nor typical of the district educational enterprise,and it was not foreseeable from daza duties as a guidance counselor.compare john,supra,th at sexual assault not foreseeable because counselor employment did not predictably create the risk employees will commit intentional torts of the type for which liability is sought.as courts have done in other cases,we reject daza analogy to mary,which imposed vicarious liability based on the unique position of police officers with their ability to arrest and use deadly force,coupled with their substantial degree of authority and the use of that authority over the motorist plaintiff,supra,th at see lisa,supra,cal th at distinguishing mary because it was expressly limited to the unique authority of police officers farmers,supra,cal th at distinguishing mary on same ground.
we also reject daza contention that some of his alleged acts not amounting to sexual assault might have fallen within the scope of his employment,such as taking goodwin cell phone without permission and viewing photographs on it.goodwin did not sue for these acts standing alone she sued for his alleged sexual assault and the allegations of daza nonsexual and sexual conduct were inextricable intertwined.see state farm fire casualty century indemnity th,insurer had no duty to defend teacher against claims of sexual molestation because arguably nonsexual ph
