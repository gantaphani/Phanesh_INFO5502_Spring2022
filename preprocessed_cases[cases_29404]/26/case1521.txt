real party in interest turlock teachers association tta filed an unfair practice charge with respondent public employment relations board perb.tta alleged that petitioner turlock joint elementary school district district violated the educational employment relations act eera by prohibiting teachers from wearing buttons,during instructional times,in support of tta bargaining demands.a perb administrative law judge issued a proposed decision dismissing tta unfair practice charge on the ground the teachers wearing of the buttons during instructional times constituted political activity that could be prohibited by the education code.perb disagreed and reversed the administrative law judge proposed decision,concluding that the district violated the eera by prohibiting teachers from wearing union buttons.the district petitioned for review.
we publish to address whether a teacher wearing of union buttons in the classroom during class time constitutes political activity,which may be restricted by the district under the education code.since we find the wearing of union buttons during instructional time inherently political under the education code,we reverse the decision of perb.
procedural and factual histories 
the facts are not in dispute.the district is comprised of eight elementary schools,instructing in kindergarten through eighth grade.tta is the bargaining representative for teachers in the district.during the school year,the district and tta were negotiating a successor contract.negotiations progressed very slowly.by may,the parties had not yet reached an agreement.
as a result,members of tta devised a strategy to advance their bargaining position,which included a campaign to the school board and newspaper distribution of informational fliers pickets attendance at school board meetings telephone calls to parents and teacher rallies to build solidarity.
another of tta strategies was for teachers to wear buttons in support of their bargaining position,as they had done in the late during a previous bargaining crisis.the circular button,approximately two inches in diameter,had a burnt orange perimeter and a white background with turlock schools across the top arc and the numbers,and on the lower arc.the center of the button contained a black number with a burnt orange slash through it.a smaller handwritten tta was located on the lower left portion of the button.tta recommended the teachers wear these buttons at all times to communicate and publicize their position that they had slipped from number in the county in teacher salaries and benefits to number,number,and finally number.the button was large enough for students to read from anywhere in the classroom.later,new buttons with a similar design were distributed to some teachers.the purpose of the button campaign was to publicize to the community tta demand to build solidarity among the membership and to demonstrate to the administration that the teachers were unified.tta utilized various methods to communicate with its members regarding the contract negotiations,including both written and telephonic communications.it had an automated telephone system and had access to school mailboxes and bulletin boards to distribute and publicize information.
most of the teachers taught in classrooms where only the teacher and students were present.however,some classrooms had parent volunteers or teacher aides.some teachers testified that they wore the buttons in their classrooms to show support for tta position,while others said that they wore the buttons at all times only because it was more convenient than repeatedly putting them on and taking them on throughout the day.numerous teachers testified that wearing the buttons caused no disruption to the educational process and they were not aware of any parent complaints about the buttons.most of the school principals appeared to be aware that the teachers were wearing the buttons on campus.
the district had a policy prohibiting employees from engaging in political activities during working time.by letter dated june,the assistant superintendent of the district advised the president of tta as follows 
it has been brought to my attention that teachers are engaging in political activity during times when they are directly engaging in instructional activities with students.although teachers certainly have the right of free speech,there are restrictions which are recognized by the courts.for example,teachers must refrain from engaging in political advocacy with students during instructional activities.teachers must not wear political buttons,including buttons covering union political activities,during instructional times or during other instructional settings 
as public employees,we all enjoy freedom of speech,but we must not engage in political advocacy when students are present during instructional activities.students are present to learn the adopted curriculum,and not to be subjected to unrelated political activity.
your prompt cooperation in informing your members of these restrictions would be appreciated 
the teachers immediately complied with the district request to remove the buttons during instructional times.on november,tta filed with perb an unfair practice charge against the district.tta alleged that,as a result of the district order directing the teachers to remove the buttons,the district interfered with the teachers rights to participate in the activities of tta.tta also alleged that the district interfered with its rights to communicate with its members,conduct organizing activities designed to demonstrate solidarity,and build support for its bargaining demands.later,perb issued a complaint against the district alleging violation of employee rights under the eera.
on april,a hearing commenced before an administrative law judge of perb.the administrative law judge issued a proposed decision dismissing the complaint against the district on the ground that tta button was political activity the district could restrict during instructional times in accordance with education code section and california teachers governing board th,d.
both the district and tta filed statements of exceptions to the proposed decision.on july,perb issued its decision,reversing the proposed decision of the administrative law judge.perb held that the wearing of tta button was not political activity prohibited by the education code and that the district interfered with employee rights under the eera by prohibiting such activity.
the district petitioned for a writ of extraordinary relief from the decision of perb pursuant to section,subdivisions b and c.we issued a writ of review.
discussion 
the district maintains we should issue an extraordinary writ directing perb to vacate its decision based on two principal grounds sections and,subdivision b,of the eera should be interpreted to cover teachers wearing union buttons during instructional activities when elementary school students are present and teachers wearing of union buttons during instructional activities constitutes political activity,which may be prohibited pursuant to education code section.
standard of review 
a reviewing court relationship to an agency such as perb is generally one of deference.regents of university of california public employment relations bd.cal d.the findings of perb with respect to questions of fact,including ultimate facts,if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,are conclusive,subd.c.in addition,i nterpretation of the eera falls squarely within perb legislatively designated field of expertise.under established principles,perb construction is to be regarded with deference by a court performing the judicial function of statutory construction,and will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous.citations.citation.cumero public employment relations bd.cal d,see also san lorenzo education wilson cal d.
in short,if perb interpretation of the eera is reasonably defensible,we can not reject it merely because we might prefer another view.see oakland unified school dist.public employment relations bd.d.as explained by the california supreme court 
perb has a specialized and focused task to protect both employees and the state employer from violations of the organizational and collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the eera.citation.as such,perb is one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge,whose findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect.citation.banning teachers public employment relations bd.cal d.
however,when issues of law arise outside the eera,and correspondingly outside the area of perb expertise,we need not defer to perb interpretation.see better.supply cir,see also stermer board of dental examiners th,d where evidence only involves issue of law,we apply our independent judgment regarding action of administrative agency.
with these principles in mind,we evaluate the district contentions.
ii.the eera 
the district first maintains that perb erred in concluding that the wearing of union buttons in this case was a protected activity under the eera.the district contends that perb interpreted section and section,subdivision b,of the eera too broadly to cover the wearing of a union button during instructional activities where only the teacher and students are present.
section,subdivision a,states public school employees shall have the right to form,join,and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of relations.section,subdivision b,provides 
employee organizations shall have the right of access at reasonable times to areas in which employees work,the right to use institutional bulletin boards,mailboxes,and other means of communication,subject to reasonable regulation,and the right to use institutional facilities at reasonable times for the purpose of meetings concerned with the exercise of the rights guaranteed by this chapter.
the district argues that nothing in this statutory language suggests it was intended to include communications from teachers directly to students during instructional times where the students are a captive audience and these communications are bargaining advertisements in support of union demands.the district asserts that the phrases reasonable times and reasonable regulation imply a limitation during instructional activities with elementary school students.in light of this,the district implores us to exclude the wearing of union buttons from the description other means of communication,arguing that protected conduct typically involves internal communications between employees or between employees and their employee organization.in this case,the district insists,tta engaged in an array of activities to communicate with its members,and the wearing of the union button should not be a protected other means of communication between employees and their organization when the button is worn in the classroom during instructional times.
although the district makes an interesting point,it ignores the applicable standard of review.we are not free to substitute our view for that of perb.instead,our role is to determine whether perb interpretation of the eera is clearly erroneous.on this record,it is not.
we note at the outset that there is no case authority directly addressing the question of whether teachers wearing of union buttons during instructional times is a protected activity under the eera.in finding the activity protected,perb reasoned 
the wearing of union buttons is a protected right under the eera,absent special circumstances.this position is clearly supported by perb case law and private sector precedent there is no evidence in the record in the instant case to indicate that any special circumstances,such as safety,discipline,effect on the employer,or any disruption,were caused by the union buttons.therefore,the protected right to engage in such protected activity under the eera remains intact.fns.omitted.
perb conclusion is supported by its own precedent and case law interpreting the national labor relations act perb held in state of california department of parks and recreation perb decision s perc t he wearing of union buttons is a protected right,absent special circumstances the right to wear buttons is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable regulation.if special circumstances exist,then the employer may well be within its rights to limit or prohibit the wearing of buttons by employees.perb went on to hold that it is incumbent upon the employer that banned the wearing of all union buttons to demonstrate special circumstances for such a prohibition.see also carlsbad unified school district perb decision in cases of alleged interference,violation will be found when employer conduct results in harm to employee rights under eera and employer is unable to justify conduct by proving operational necessity.perb also noted that although alternative means of communication might be available,this does not make the buttons any less legitimate.whether or not other means of communication are available does not deny a particular form of access.only when a particular type of communication is disruptive will perb look to the existence of other means of communications.state of california department of parks and recreation,supra,perb decision.
case law interpreting the national labor relations act has similarly recognized,as a legitimate form of union activity,the right of employees to wear union buttons in the workplace.see republic aviation board.a bsent special considerations,an employee has a right,protected by the national labor relations act,to wear union buttons and insignia at work.citation.save cir,fn.omitted see also meijer,cir,employees have right to wear union insignia unless employer makes affirmative showing that special circumstance exists to justify restriction luke hospital nlrb,it is that the wearing of union insignia may not be prohibited unless the employer establishes that special circumstances are present which justify the restriction.
examples of special circumstances that have justified a ban on union buttons include situations where employer operations are disrupted,employee safety or discipline is jeopardized,or employee dissension is encouraged.see save,supra,at,incorporated cir,andrews wire corporation nlrb,united aircraft corporation nlrb,meijer,supra,at retailer unable to make showing of special circumstance to justify ban on employees wearing union insignia based on contention of negative impact on its public image asociacion hosp.del maestro,cir,evidence of hospital patient anxiety did not justify ban on union insignia at all places in hospital.general,speculative,isolated or conclusory evidence of disruption does not amount to special circumstances.boise cascade corporation nlrb,see also luke hospital,supra,nlrb at mere possibility of patient complaints about union buttons not sufficient to establish special circumstances.
in this case,there is no evidence of any special considerations or circumstances to justify a ban on teachers wearing the union buttons during instructional times.none of the teachers who testified considered the buttons to be disruptive in the classroom.further,the district presented no evidence to show that wearing union buttons in the classroom disrupted its operations or affected the education of the students.there were no complaints from either students or parents.in short,there is no evidence that the buttons were in any way disruptive to the educational process.this likely explains why the district did not prohibit teachers from wearing union buttons during instructional times on the ground that doing so was disruptive.instead,the district prohibited the conduct based on the rationale that it constituted political activity and could be barred under education code section.
there is no question the eera does not supersede the education code.see this chapter shall not supersede other provisions of the education code and the rules and regulations of public school employers which provide for other methods of administering relations,so long as the rules and regulations or other methods of th
