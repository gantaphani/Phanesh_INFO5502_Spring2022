the happy valley union school district district terminated plaintiff employment as a substitute teacher in the school year when she refused to accept being reclassified as a temporary teacher.she had taught for the district the previous two years as a substitute and temporary teacher,and she wanted a more permanent classification.she petitioned for a writ of mandate compelling the district to reinstate her and provide due process,claiming she was entitled to permanent employment based on statutory grounds.the trial court denied the petition.we affirm the trial court judgment,but we do so on a different basis.
statutory background 
before reciting the facts,we review california civil service system for public school teachers with particular attention to its classifications for teachers and the school districts authority to dismiss them 
the education code classifies california teachers into four different categories permanent tenured,probationary,substitute,and temporary.in the case of permanent and probationary employees,the employer power to terminate employment is restricted by statute.substitute and temporary employees,on the other hand,fill the short range needs of a school district and generally may be summarily released.citation.taylor board of trustees cal d.
permanent teachers are those who a school district has employed for two complete consecutive school years as probationary teachers and who have been reelected retained for the next succeeding school year,subd.b.a school district may terminate a permanent teacher only for misconduct or due to a reduction in the overall number of teachers.
the classification of probationary is the default classification.school districts classify all teachers as probationary who are not otherwise required by the code to be classified as permanent,temporary,or substitute.bakersfield elementary teachers bakersfield city school dist.th,d bakersfield.the probationary plan was provided so that the school board would have an opportunity to determine,before a teacher should be given a lifetime position in teaching children of the district,whether or not that teacher would be thoroughly satisfactory.wood los angeles city school dist.d.
probationary teachers have limited protections against dismissal.school districts may dismiss a probationary employee during the school year only for cause or unsatisfactory performance.however,a school district can terminate a probationary teacher employment effective the end of the teacher yearly contract without cause.california teachers mendocino unified school dist.th,d.
to effectuate this termination,the school district must give the probationary teacher timely notice of its decision not to reemploy the teacher.if the district decides not to reemploy the teacher effective the end of the teacher first year of probationary status,the district may give notice at any time during the first year of employment.grimsley board of trustees d.if the district decides not to reemploy the teacher effective the end of the teacher second year of probationary status,the district must give notice by march of that year,subd.b.if the district fails to give the probationary teacher timely notice,the teacher is deemed to be reemployed for the next succeeding school year and by law becomes a permanent employee.ibid.
a substitute teacher traditionally has been defined as being employed from day to day to serve at the option of the school district in the absence of the regular teacher.wood los angeles city school,supra,d at,see also,subd.d.the education code requires a school district to classify as substitute employees those teachers employed to fill positions of regularly employed persons absent from service.the code also states that a school district may employ such substitute employees of the district as it deems necessary.a school district may dismiss a substitute teacher at any time without cause.
the classification of temporary covers a variety of scenarios.a temporary teacher is,among other definitions,a teacher hired by the district for a semester or a complete school year to replace a regular teacher who has been granted leave for that time or is experiencing illness.a teacher may also be classified as temporary where the teacher is working on categorically funded projects.
temporary teachers have slightly more employment rights than substitute teachers.school districts may dismiss a temporary teacher without cause at any time prior to the teacher serving at least percent of the school year.after that time,the district must notify the temporary teacher before the end of the school year that it has not retained the teacher for the following year.
if the temporary teacher works for at least percent of the school year,and the district rehires the teacher as a probationary employee for the succeeding year,the year of temporary service is reclassified as a year of probationary service for purposes of acquiring permanent status,subd.a.
indeed,such a temporary teacher must be rehired by the district for the following school year as a probationary employee if the district has a vacant position needing to be filled one not held by a permanent or probationary teacher on leave,so long as the district has not first dismissed the temporary teacher pursuant to section,subd.b.
school districts must classify their employees into one of these four classifications at the time of employment.the district must give each new employee a written statement indicating the employee classification no later than the first day of paid service.if the district hires a teacher as a temporary employee,the statement must clearly indicate the temporary nature of the employment and the length of the employment term.if the statement does not indicate the temporary nature of the employment,or if the statement is untimely,the employee is deemed to be a probationary employee.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.
we now turn to the facts.
school year 
plaintiff relationship with the district began on october,when the district hired her as a substitute teacher to teach a reading class for hours per day.her story changed when,by letter dated november,the district employed plaintiff as a temporary teacher on a basis to continue teaching the same class.her compensation was funded by a categorically funded project.the district timely notified her of her classification as a temporary teacher.
the district chose not to retain plaintiff for the following school year.it timely informed her of that decision by written notice,stating she would not be employed by the district during the school year.
school year 
at the beginning of this school year,the district did not employ plaintiff.she was listed on the county substitute teacher call list.as a result of reduction requirements,however,the district needed an additional temporary teacher to teach another class.on october,the district again retained plaintiff as a substitute teacher.
during that academic year,the district had a policy requiring a substitute teacher on or before the teacher first day of employment to sign a substitute verification form,confirming the teacher status as a substitute.on october,plaintiff signed a substitute verification form verifying she had been retained as a substitute teacher and checked the box denoted full day.
the former district superintendent declared the district then hired plaintiff to teach as a substitute on october,and so it could evaluate her suitability to continue the assignment as a temporary teacher for the remainder of the year.in her deposition,plaintiff stated that after working on october,she continued working as a substitute on october,and 
on october,the district reclassified plaintiff and retained her as a temporary employee.plaintiff acknowledged her temporary classification in writing that day,agreeing that she could be dismissed by the district at its pleasure prior to her serving one year.her position was categorically funded.she was to report to work as a temporary teacher on october.
the district again chose not to reelect plaintiff for the following school year.it timely informed plaintiff of its decision by written notice dated february.
school year 
plaintiff was not working for the district at the beginning of the school year.she remained listed on the county substitute teacher call list.
prior to the beginning of this school year,the district responsibility for payroll and employee paperwork was transferred to the shasta county office of education.that office did not utilize the substitute verification form the district had used when it retained a substitute teacher.instead,the county office provided substitute teachers with time cards for them to complete.the teacher was to indicate the days of service and the regular teacher for whom the teacher substituted.the cards were to be used only by substitute teachers.
during the school year,a regular second grade teacher,courtney johnson,took a leave of absence.the district retained a temporary teacher to fill johnson position,but in november that teacher transferred to a regular position at another school.
the district then contacted plaintiff to fill the position as a substitute.plaintiff completed and submitted to the district two time cards for work she performed in november and december.she stated the district gave her each card she kept it in her drawer,completed it,and turned it in to the district at the end of the month.the cards showed she worked days in november and days in december as a substitute for johnson.in her deposition,plaintiff agreed that she had filled out the time cards because she was a sub and that what subs have to do.
plaintiff last day of work noted on the time card was december.on that day,the superintendent presented plaintiff with a letter dated december for her to sign to acknowledge she would be employed as a temporary teacher while johnson was on leave.the superintendent declared that prior to that date,he had learned johnson would be absent indefinitely,but up to the remainder of the academic year.he prepared the letter to notify plaintiff she would be a temporary teacher until johnson returned.in the letter,he wrote,you are currently being employed by the district as a temporary teacher filling courtney johnson position as a grade teacher while johnson is on leave.
plaintiff refused to sign the letter.she did not want to agree to serve as a temporary teacher.as a result of plaintiff refusal to sign,the superintendent terminated her employment effective that day.
plaintiff petition for writ of mandate 
plaintiff petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate.she alleged the district had terminated her employment in violation of her statutory due process rights,and she sought to be reinstated and employed as a permanent employee.plaintiff presented two alternative arguments in support of her claim.as a first argument,plaintiff claimed the district actions and omissions in each of her employment years resulted in her being deemed a probationary teacher for two consecutive and full school years,thereby entitling her to be hired as permanent employee for the school year when the superintendent failed to classify her on her first day of work that year as a temporary employee.
this argument runs as follows 
in october,the district erroneously classified her as a substitute teacher for the first few days of her employment in the school year.the classification was wrong,plaintiff alleges,because she was not hired to fill in for a regular teacher but was instead hired to teach a new class created due to categorically funded reduction rules.because she did not qualify as a substitute teacher,she was allegedly entitled to be classified on her first day of employment as a probationary employee under the default provision of sections and,subdivision b.
also,because the district did not timely notify her of her correct classification as a probationary teacher on the first day of her employment in october,she was deemed a probationary employee for the school year under section 
because she was deemed a probationary employee in the school year,her employment in the school year as a temporary teacher for at least percent of that year was also deemed a completed year of probationary employment under sections and 
the superintendent letter dated december,indicates plaintiff in the school year was considered to be a temporary employee at least by that date,a day plaintiff time card records she worked.however,the district did not give her notice of this classification until december.because the district failed to notify her of her temporary employment classification as of the first day she worked in that classification,and because her prior two years of work were deemed to be two consecutive and complete years of work as a probationary teacher,plaintiff was entitled by law to be deemed a permanent teacher at least by december,under sections and,subdivision b.
accordingly,the district could not legally terminate plaintiff employment in december without cause and had to reinstate her as a permanent employee.
in her second argument,plaintiff claimed that even if the court determined she was lawfully classified as a temporary employee for the school year,she would be entitled to permanent employment for the school year.
this argument proceeds as follows 
assuming plaintiff was a temporary employee for,she would nonetheless be deemed a probationary employee for under section because the district allegedly failed to provide her with notice of her classification as a temporary employee on the first day of paid service that year 
she also would be deemed a probationary employee for because the school year would be deemed one year employment as a probationary employee under sections or 
as a result,she could not be dismissed from her now probationary employment during the school year without cause,and,because the district did not dismiss her by giving her the notice of by march,she is deemed employed as a permanent employee for the school year under sections,subdivision b,and.
the trial court denied plaintiff petition.it reasoned that plaintiff case turned on whether the district could lawfully classify her as a substitute teacher for the first four days of her employment during the school year.the court held the district could.it determined there was no law restricting the district from classifying plaintiff as a substitute for a few days to determine whether to hire her as a temporary teacher to teach the new class mandated by reduction rules for the remainder of the year.the district purpose was not arbitrary or capricious,nor was it an attempt to circumvent plaintiff tenure rights.
this decision also defeated plaintiff alternative argument.plaintiff was properly informed of her employment status in.section s default classification of probationary where the notice of classification is not given timely was thus not triggered.
plaintiff now appeals,claiming the trial court decisions on both of her arguments were incorrect.she repeats the arguments here for our consideration.the district opposes and also raises the defense of laches.

classification for school year 
plaintiff asserts she was entitled to be classified as a permanent employee in the school year,and that the district could not therefore summarily terminate her.the trial court believed that for all of the statutory dominoes to fall in plaintiff favor for this argument,she had to establish first that the district wrongfully classified her as a substitute teacher for the first four days of her employment in the school year when she began teaching a new class created for purposes of reduction rules.
plaintiff argues she could not have been classified as a substitute in because she was not hired to replace a regular teacher who was a
