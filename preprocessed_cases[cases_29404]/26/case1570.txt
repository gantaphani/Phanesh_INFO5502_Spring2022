education code section,subdivision a requires school boards that delegate expulsion hearings to an administrative panel to make a decision whether or not to expel a pupil within schooldays after a recommendation for expulsion is first made.in this case,following an administrative hearing on an appeal by the pupil,the board of education of the sacramento city unified school district school board,convening after a summer recess,voted to expel.
the sacramento county board of education county board overturned the school board decision.the county board ruled that the school board failure to expel the pupil within schooldays deprived the school board of jurisdiction consequently,it reversed the expulsion order.the reversal was upheld by the superior court,which denied the school board petition for writ of mandate.
on this appeal,we will determine that the period under education code section allotted to the school board to make a decision on expelling a pupil is directory,not mandatory in the jurisdictional sense.all further unspecified statutory references are to the education code.we will reverse with directions.
background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.on april,all further calendar references are to that year,the pupil,kenneth,was suspended for possession of a pipe bomb in violation of those sections of the education code that prohibit possession of an explosive or other dangerous objects on school grounds and disruption of school activities,subds.b,k.
after the school board granted a request by the pupil parent for a postponement,an expulsion hearing was held by an administrative panel of the board on june.at the conclusion of the hearing,the panel issued a written decision recommending expulsion of the pupil.the panel findings of fact and recommendations were sent to and received by the pupil on june.on june,the school board adjourned for its summer recess for schooldays.when it returned from summer recess on july,the school board voted to expel the pupil.
the pupil appealed the school board decision to the county board.the county board reversed the expulsion.in a written decision,it held that the school board summer recess did not extend or toll the period for making a decision on expulsion as set forth in section the school board exceeded the period in rendering its decision in the present case the time provisions of section are mandatory and jurisdictional and therefore the school board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the expulsion order.
the school board filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate,seeking to overturn the county board action on the ground that it abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law.code civ,subd.b.relying exclusively on garcia los angeles county board of education d,the court concurred in the county board analysis and denied the writ.
iclarification of issues 
section,subdivision a creates two time lines for a school board final decision on expulsion.where the school board conducts the expulsion hearing itself,the deadline is days from the date the school board conducted the hearing.where the hearing is held by an administrative panel,the decision must be made within days after the incident precipitating the pupil removal.
all parties agree that the lapse of time caused by the parent request for postponement schooldays in this case,should not be counted in computing of the time within which a decision on expulsion needed to be made.since the pupil hearing was conducted by an administrative panel in this case,the deadline is the one that applies.
excluding the period caused by the requested postponement,the school board calculates that the decision on the pupil expulsion was conducted schooldays following his suspension.on the other hand,by the county board computation,the period was schooldays.the difference is that the county board counts schooldays during the summer recess and the school board excludes them.the following table summarizes the discrepancy between the two calculations 
the trial court agreed with the county board position that summer recess schooldays should be counted in computing the period for decision under section.using the county board time line,the trial court ruled that the decision,rendered on the day after the pupil removal,was untimely,and that the untimeliness deprived the school board of jurisdiction over the case.
in light of the twofold aspect to the trial court ruling,the school board frames two issues to be decided on this appeal whether summer recess time should be included in the computation for making a decision on expulsion,and if summer recess time does not toll the deadline,whether the school board delay in rendering a decision deprived it of disciplinary jurisdiction over the pupil removal.
we will decide that,even if the school board decision went beyond the period set forth in section,the delay did not deprive the school board of jurisdiction because the decisionmaking deadline set forth in section is merely directory.thus,it is unnecessary for us to decide the summer recess tolling issue 
the decisionmaking or directory 
section,the construction of which is at the heart of this appeal,provides in pertinent part 
the governing board of each school district shall establish rules and regulations governing procedures for the expulsion of pupils.these procedures shall include,but are not necessarily limited to,all of the following 
a the pupil shall be entitled to a hearing to determine whether the pupil should be expelled.an expulsion hearing shall be held within schooldays after the date the principal or the superintendent of schools determines that the pupil has committed any of the acts enumerated in section,unless the pupil requests,in writing,that the hearing be postponed 
if the hearing is held by a hearing officer or an administrative panel,the governing board shall decide whether to expel the pupil within schooldays after the date of the pupil removal from his or her school of attendance for the incident for which the recommendation for expulsion is made by the principal or the superintendent,unless the pupil requests in writing that the decision be postponed.
upon the commencement of the hearing,all matters shall be pursued and conducted with reasonable diligence and shall be concluded without any unnecessary delay.italics added.
the issue in this case is whether the failure to render a decision within the period provided for in section deprives the school board of jurisdiction to discipline the pupil.the answer turns on whether the phrase shall decide in the above quotation is mandatory or directory.
in morris county of marin cal d,the state supreme court explained the difference between mandatory and directory statutory requirements.t he term mandatory refers to an obligatory duty which a governmental entity is required to perform,as opposed to a permissive power which a governmental entity may exercise or not as it chooses.by contrast,the directory or mandatory designation does not refer to whether a particular statutory requirement is permissive or obligatory,but instead simply denotes whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.id.at.
with respect to statutorily prescribed time limits in particular,the high court has articulated the following principles time limits are usually deemed to be directory unless the legislature clearly expresses a contrary intent.edwards steele cal d.in ascertaining probable intent,california courts have expressed a variety of tests.in some cases focus has been directed at the likely consequences of holding a particular time limitation mandatory,in an attempt to ascertain whether those consequences would defeat or promote the purpose of the enactment.citations.other cases have suggested that a time limitation is deemed merely directory unless a consequence or penalty is provided for failure to do the act within the time commanded.ibid.as morris county of marin,supra,cal d,held,the consequence or penalty must have the effect of invalidating the go
