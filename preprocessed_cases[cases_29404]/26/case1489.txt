rocco versaci petitions this court for a writ of mandate to compel the san diego county superior court to grant his request for an order requiring the palomar community college district the district to disclose under the california public records act the act,et the personal performance goals of its former superintendent,sherrill amador,for the academic year.versaci contends the trial court erred by finding the goals are not incorporated into the employment contract,which would mandate their disclosure as a matter of law under section,and by finding the goals are exempt from disclosure under section,subdivision c,which applies to personnel files.we deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
in may the district hired amador as its superintendent and president,under a contract beginning the following july,at a starting salary of.paragraph of the contract provided amador will receive an annual written evaluation by the governing board the board no later than may of each year.this evaluation will be based on overall performance and mutually agreed upon goals and objectives established each year prior to july and will also include a progress meeting.all evaluations will be held in a closed session.the contract also entitled amador to a percent raise and a contract extension annually subject to a positive evaluation by the board.
in a june closed session amador and the board mutually established her personal performance goals for the academic year.the district included the goals in her personnel file and maintained their confidentiality.between january and may the board held closed sessions to evaluate amador performance.at a may open session the board reported that amador overall evaluation was satisfactory,and in light of budgetary constraints she agreed to forgo of the raise to which she was entitled.the board minutes also stated the board can not ignore the current situation that needs to be addressed by amador,with the support of the board.accordingly,the board directs amador to focus on building relationships and improving morale,with progress to be monitored on an ongoing basis.
at a may,open session the board voted three to two to extend amador contract through june and to increase her compensation by percent.the dissenting trustees unsuccessfully sought to defer the vote pending further evaluation of her performance in closed session.
in june versaci asked the district,under the act,for a copy of the eleven annual job goals of amador for the academic year the district denied the request based on provisions of the act and amador right of privacy under article i,section of the california constitution.it also denied versaci subsequent request.
in november versaci petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate to compel disclosure of the information under the act.versaci argued section mandates disclosure of amador performance goals because they were terms of her employment contract,and alternatively,there is no exemption under the act allowing the district to withhold the information.versaci asked the court to conduct an in camera review of the records of the eleven annual job goals.
in a tentative ruling,the court denied the petition on the grounds the information was not part of the employment contract,and it is exempt from disclosure as a personnel record under section,subdivision c,and disclosure would invade amador constitutional right of privacy.after oral argument,the court confirmed its tentative ruling and entered a final order denying the petition.the court did not address versaci request for an in camera review.
on november,amador announced her retirement from the district,effective july.

the governing statute 
california constitution contains an explicit right of privacy that operates against private and governmental entities.art.i,gilbert city of san jose th,d.constitutional privacy interests are not absolute,however.they must be balanced against other important interests.gilbert city of san jose,at,d.
the act provides for the inspection of public records maintained by state and local agencies,subd.a.the legislature enacted the act in to give the public access to information in possession of public agencies in furtherance of the notion that government should be accountable for its actions and,to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.citation.but recognition of the importance of preserving individual privacy is also evident in the act.the act begins with the phrase in enacting this chapter,the legislature is mindful of the right of individuals to privacy citation.citation.disclosure of public records thus involves two fundamental yet competing interests prevention of secrecy in government and protection of individual privacy.gilbert city of san jose,supra,th at,d.
the act defines public record as any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public business prepared,owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency,subd.e.the definition is broad and intended to cover every conceivable kind of record that is involved in the governmental process.coronado police officers carroll th,d.

the court correctly found amador personal performance goals are not part of the employment contract within the meaning of section 
versaci contends the court erred by finding amador performance goals are not part of the employment contract subject to disclosure as a matter of law under section.his theory is that because paragraph of the employment contract refers to goal setting in conjunction with amador yearly performance evaluations,the written goals are key terms of the contract that must be disclosed.
the act does not define employment contract,and it appears there are only two published opinions discussing government code section,neither of which concerns the issue here.see braun city of taft d.teamsters local priceless,llc th,d.versaci relies on civil code section,which applies to contracts generally,and provides that s everal contracts relating to the same matters,between the same parties,and made as parts of substantially one transaction,are to be taken together.
it is a familiar rule that where several papers covering the same subject matter are executed by the same parties,all are to be considered together,and with the same effect as if all had been incorporated in one document.mcauliff mcfadden,citing.civil code section is most frequently applied to writings executed contemporaneously,but it is likewise applicable to agreements executed by the parties at different times if the later document is in fact a part of the same transaction.flotill products d.the contract need not recite that it incorporates another document,but f or the terms of another document to be incorporated into the document executed by the parties the reference must be clear and unequivocal.shaw regents of university of california th,d.
whether a document is incorporated into the contract depends on the parties intent as it existed at the time of contracting.the parties intent must,in the first instance,be ascertained objectively from the contract language.shaw regents of university of california,supra,th at,d.however,t he use of extrinsic evidence to show whether several written instruments were intended to constitute a single contract does not involve a violation of the parol evidence rule.meier paul smith d.the applicability of civil code section is a question of fact for the trial court,and the appellate court will affirm the court resolution if it is supported by substantial evidence.brookwood bank of america th,d kwikset locks,stewart commissaries d.
versaci contends the annual goals for were mutually enforceable terms of amador employment contract when she and the board agreed on them in june,because i f the board found her performance satisfactory but refused to grant her a pay raise and contract extension,she clearly has a breach of contract claim based on its promise to pay for her performance of the goals.that analysis is faulty,however,because amador evaluations were based on her overall performance in addition to the agreed goals.performance of the goals,standing alone,did not automatically entitle amador to increased contract benefits.
additionally,versaci submits section is applicable because amador personal goals constitute compensation terms typically included in an employment contract,and she can not shield them from public scrutiny by placing them in her personnel file.in support,he cites an attorney general opinion,in which a city manager determined the amounts of executive managers bonuses based on his private evaluation of their performance.the city divulged the number of executives in the program,the salary range for each executive,the total cost of the awards program and the average percentage amount for all the awards,but it withheld the individual amounts of the bonuses and reasons for awarding them.
the city justified its nondisclosure on grounds the executives who received lesser awards may be embarrassed and disclosure may jeopardize the benefits of candid disclosure in the confidential evaluation process,supra,at.the attorney general,without any analysis of section,concluded that e ach bonus constitutes wages and forms part of the employment contract,and any record specifying the amount of the bonus or the exceptional services for which the bonus is paid manifests provisions of the executive employment contract within the scope of section,supra,at.
here,in contrast,there was no secrecy regarding amador compensation.rather,the employment contract set forth the amount of her salary and the method for calculating any future salary increases,and the board announced in open session the result of its evaluations,whether it found her performance satisfactory or granted a pay raise or contract extension.versaci does not contend the act mandates disclosure of the evaluations conducted in closed session.
versaci reliance on another attorney general opinion.is likewise misplaced.in that opinion,the issue was whether a provision of the ralph brown act the brown act,et required a hospital board to report at its next public meeting action taken in executive session to set the compensation of an administrator.the attorney general answered the question in the negative,but went on to say,that compensation,as an integral part of the hospital administrator employment contract,would still be a matter of public record under section,supra,at.again,amador yearly compensation was disclosed.
braun city of taft,supra,d,is also unavailing.in braun,a city councilman braun was investigating purported irregularities in the city appointment of a firefighter polston to transit administrator.after the city manager refused to confirm or deny the appointment,braun reviewed polston personnel file and released to the press copies of two letters concerning the appointment and its rescission and the face sheet of polston salary card,which was modified by whiting out transit administrator and writing firefighter over it.id.at.the face sheet also revealed information not germane to braun investigation,such as polston telephone number,address,social security and credit union numbers and birth date.
polston filed a grievance against braun for invasion of privacy,which the city council refused to consider in a hearing.the council,however,enacted a resolution censuring braun for disclosing the letters and salary card.braun then petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate commanding the city to set aside its censure.the court ruled the records were not within the personnel file exemption and were subject to disclosure under the act.braun city of taft,supra,d at.
the appellate court upheld the ruling.it held the letters were subject to disclosure under section as they manifested polston employment contract.braun city of taft,supra,d at.the court concluded that b ecause the letters regarded business transactions and contained no personal information,the lower court properly ordered disclosure of the letters.ibid.the court rejected the city argument the personnel exemption applied because the letters were part of the personnel file and their disclosure would embarrass him.id.at.
the court expressed concern about personal information on the face sheet of polston salary card,but stated it was reluctant to reverse on that limited ground.braun city of taft,supra,d at.in concluding disclosure did not violate the act personnel records exception,subd.c,the court explained the data listed on the card was not in any way embarrassing.one telephone number and address,although personal,are seldom secret.there is nothing in the record to show that such information was not available through a city directory or telephone book.braun city of taft,supra,d at.the court added that f ew persons would find interest in the employee social security and credit union numbers,or birth date.ibid.
braun does not concern the issue here,whether the employment contract reference to amador goals constituted an incorporation by reference.versaci has submitted no authority for the proposition an employee personal performance goals are ordinarily included in a public employment contract.further,as noted in teamsters local priceless,llc,supra,th,d,braun was decided before the spread of identify theft,and the current widespread and serious concern for the privacy of an individual financial data.identity thieves today would have a great deal of interest in an individual social security number and other identifying financial data.
we conclude amador personal performance goals are not part of the contract,and thus section is inapplicable.the mere reference in paragraph of the employment contract to future goal setting in conjunction with amador evaluation process does not clearly and unequivocally evidence the parties intent to incorporate the yet to be determined goals into the contract.versaci position that essentially any topic a contract mentions is incorporated therein is unsupported by any authority and would lead to absurd results.indeed,paragraph discusses goals and evaluations,the latter of which versaci concedes are exempt from disclosure under the act.he presents no persuasive theory for treating goals and evaluations differently insofar as the incorporation question is concerned.
moreover,the parties intent is shown by paragraph of the contract,which states it may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties,memorialized in writing,and executed by amador and the board.the district produced evidence the parties never amended the contract to include amador personal performan
