plaintiff william lee appeals from the district court award of summary judgment to the york county,virginia,school board,five members of the county board of education,and the county school superintendent collectively,the school board or the board on his free speech claim.see lee york county sch,d the opinion.lee,who teaches high school in york county,initiated this suit in the eastern district of virginia in august,maintaining that the school board had violated his rights under the first amendment free speech clause by removing materials he had posted on the bulletin boards in his classroom.in its february,opinion,the district court rejected lee claim,concluding that his postings were curricular in nature and thus did not constitute speech on a matter of public concern.in substance,lee maintains on appeal that he possesses a first amendment right to post his materials on the classroom bulletin boards.this contention is contrary to the relevant precedent and,as explained below,we affirm.
in,lee began teaching spanish at tabb high school,a public high school operated by the school board in yorktown,virginia prior to his assignment at tabb high,lee had been employed by the school board for about a year,as a teacher at a york county middle school.sometime in october,an employee of the school board received a complaint from a private citizen who expressed concern over certain materials posted on the bulletin boards within lee classroom the crux of the citizen complaint was that some of lee postings were overly religious in nature.after receiving the complaint,the school board asked crispin zanca,the principal of tabb high,to investigate the matter.as principal,it is zanca obligation to ensure that teachers adhere to the board curriculum guidelines and policies.
on october,after speaking with the school board about the complaint regarding lee,zanca proceeded to lee classroom to discuss the matter with him.lee was absent from school that day,however,and zanca examined the materials posted on the bulletin boards in his absence.in so doing,zanca discovered certain items that,in his view,should not have been posted in a compulsory classroom setting.specifically,he testified that he could not find any reason why these items would be posted in a classroom.zanca removed five items collectively,the removed items or the items from lee bulletin boards a national day of prayer poster,featuring george washington kneeling in prayer a may,daily press news article entitled the god gap,outlining religious and philosophical differences between president bush and his challenger john kerry an october,usa today news article entitled white house staffers gather for bible study,describing how then attorney general ashcroft led staffers in voluntary bible study sessions a november,daily press news article,detailing the missionary activities of a former virginia high school student,veronica bowers,who had been killed when her plane was shot down in south america and a june peninsula rescue mission newsletter,highlighting the missionary work of bowers zanca placed the removed items on lee desk in the teachers lounge and left an explanatory note in lee school mailbox.
in his deposition for this case,zanca testified that neither tabb high school nor the school board has any written policies on what a teacher may properly post on classroom walls or bulletin boards.zanca explained,however,that there is an applicable unwritten policy,custom,and practice for york county teachers in that regard,authorizing teachers to place materials on bulletin boards that relate to the curriculum being taught or that are of personal interest to them.for example,some teachers place famous quotes,articles on current events,and pictures of sports figures on the bulletin boards of their classrooms.zanca explained that,as a general matter,he has always relied on the sound judgment of tabb high teachers as to what materials should be posted in their classrooms.
although there is no written policy on the posting or removal of classroom materials,zanca explained that his duties as principal include the monitoring of such postings,as well as the removal of any postings that are inappropriate for the school setting.in determining whether any particular item should be removed,the school board has accorded its principals broad discretion to evaluate and decide which postings are appropriate for a particular classroom setting.zanca testified that the teachers at tabb high have always understood that any postings contradicting the unwritten policy are subject to removal.under the unwritten policy,inappropriate postings include items that violate the first amendment,that are offensive,that use profanity,or that are otherwise unrelated to curricular objectives.in evaluating whether a particular posting is subject to removal,zanca primarily assesses whether it is relevant to the curriculum being taught by the particular teacher he testified that,although certain materials may be inappropriate if posted generally,they could well be appropriate when used in connection with a specific curricular objective.for example,some current events postings may only be appropriate when used in a classroom where history or government courses are taught.
when zanca first viewed the removed items,he saw that certain of the postings prominently included religious terms such as bible or god.although zanca did not read any of the articles in their entirety,he exercised his discretion as principal on the five removed items because he saw them as overly religious and thus violative of the establishment clause of the first amendment aside from his determination that the postings might be legally problematic,zanca believed the removed items to be irrelevant to the spanish curricular objectives that lee was obliged to follow within his classroom.
when lee returned to tabb high three days later,he found the removed items on his desk and zanca note in his mailbox.lee promptly discussed the matter with zanca,who explained that he had received a citizen complaint about postings in lee classroom.zanca informed lee that the removed items were taken down because they were inappropriate in a spanish classroom.lee thereafter retained a lawyer,who wrote to the board superintendent requesting permission for lee to repost the removed items.following an investigation by the board counsel,lee request to repost was denied.
during his deposition,lee agreed that the school board has no written policies concerning what can be appropriately posted on classroom bulletin boards.he acknowledged the existence of an unwritten board policy,practice,and custom,however,that allows teachers to post materials related to curricular objectives,or to post materials of a general and personal nature that are consistent with the educational mission of tabb high.lee denied placing the removed items on the bulletin boards to endorse his own faith,did not believe that the items were related to any particular spanish curricular objective,and had not referred to any of them while teaching.when asked why he had posted the removed items,lee explained that he had posted each of them either because he liked it or because it was uplifting.he also explained that a teacher could post most anything in a classroom and make it relevant to the curriculum being taught.he said that schoolteachers often use creative materials to catch and retain the attention of students.
lee also acknowledged that he had posted the removed items because they were,in his opinion,positive and good for the kids.because of his position as a teacher,lee felt responsible for more than just the academic of his students.he stated,i accountable in that classroom for the students welfare and their attitudes and their feelings,which are sensitive and fluctuate daily,and i find the hope embodied in some images to be beneficial.id.for example,with respect to the poster of george washington,lee testified that it contained a positive figure and good for every classroom in the school.id.at.with respect to the article on attorney general ashcroft,lee explained it might be helpful to a student seeking hope and inspiration.see id.at.finally,with respect to the peninsular rescue mission newsletter,lee said that it was posted to encourage students not to be ashamed of their faith and because it dealt with an eastern virginia high school student who had studied spanish.see id.at.
on august,lee filed his complaint in this case,along with a motion for a preliminary injunction,alleging that the school board had controverted and deprived him of his first amendment right to free speech on september,the district court denied lee request for a preliminary injunction and ordered an expedited discovery schedule.after discovery,both lee and the school board filed motions for summary judgment,agreeing that there were no disputes of material fact.
on february,the court filed its opinion and final order in this matter,granting the board motion for summary judgment and denying lee motion for summary judgment.see opinion relying on our decision in boring buncombe county board of education,cir en banc,the court applied the supreme court analysis and assessed whether lee postings constituted speech protected by the first amendment.see id.at upon so doing,the court concluded that the removed items were,as a matter of law,curricular in nature.see id.at.the court first focused on the broad definition of curriculum applied by our en banc court in boring,noting that curricular speech encompasses a wide range of types of communication.id.at.the court concluded that this definition of curriculum includes teaching methodology,as it is nothing more than an execution of a teacher employment duties.id.citing urofsky gilmore,cir en banc it can not be doubted that in order to pursue its legitimate goals effectively,the state must retain the ability to control the manner in which its employees discharge their duties and to direct its employees to undertake the responsibilities of their positions in a specified way.
applying the boring principles to lee free speech claim,the district court concluded that the postings on lee classroom walls qualify as the type of materials that can constitute curricular speech.opinion.specifically,the court determined that the removed items constituted curricular speech for two reasons lee used the items as part of his teaching methodology,and lee sought to instruct and impart knowledge to his students through use of the items.see id.because the court determined that the removed items were curricular in nature,it also ruled,on the basis of boring,that they were per se not a matter of public concern.see id.at.thus,because lee speech was not a matter of public concern,he possessed no first amendment protection in posting the removed items in his classroom.see id.at.
on march,lee filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
as a general proposition,we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see seabulk offshore,am.home assur,cir.an award of summary judgment may appropriately be made only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.finally,in applying the legal principles to the issues in this appeal,we review de novo the district court ruling that lee postings of the removed items did not constitute speech on a matter of public concern.see urofsky gilmore,cir en banc.
on appeal,lee essentially contends that he possesses a first amendment free speech right to post certain materials on the school board classroom bulletin boards.in addressing this contention,it is important to first acknowledge that schoolteachers do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.nevertheless,certain limitations are placed on the free speech rights of schoolteachers,such as lee,due to the nature of their employment by schools.more specifically,it seems settled that the state,as an employer,undoubtedly possesses greater authority to restrict the speech of its employees than it has as sovereign to restrict the speech of the citizenry as a whole.urofsky gilmore,cir en banc see also pickering bd.of,d t he state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.
in assessing whether a public employee speech is protected by the first amendment,and thus not subject to regulation by a employer,a court is obliged to balance the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.connick myers,d alteration in original quoting pickering,at.in performing this balancing test,a reviewing court must make two inquiries.it examines,first of all,whether the speech at issue was that of a private citizen speaking on a matter of public concern.urofsky,at.if the employee was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern,the court must consider whether the employee interest in first amendment expression outweighs the public employer interest in what the employer has determined to be the appropriate operation of the workplace.id.
as explained below,under the balancing standard lee classroom postings do not constitute speech concerning a public matter,because they were of a curricular nature.thus,lee can not use the first amendment to justify his assertion that he is free to place his postings on the classroom bulletin boards without oversight by the school board.in order to constitute protected speech under the first amendment,the speech at issue must satisfy both prongs of the framework.see urofsky,at.because lee speech fails to satisfy the first of those inquiries,we need not reach the second inquiry and decide whether the interests of the school board as employer outweigh those of lee as.
in applying the framework to this matter,we first inquire whether lee,in posting the removed items in his classroom at tabb high,was speaking as a private citizen on a matter of public concern.lee maintains on appeal that he can post any materials he wishes on the classroom bulletin boards provided that,in so doing,he speaks not as a teacher,but instead as a private citizen only.he thus maintains that the fact he posted the removed items in his classroom is irrelevant to the issue of whether he was acting as a private citizen or as a schoolteacher.see urofsky,at an employee may speak as a citizen on a matter of public concern at the workplace,and may speak as an employee away from the workplace.but see garcetti ceballos,d concluding that when public employee speaks pursuant to his official duties,his speech is not entitled to first amendment protection under the standard lee further contends that each of the removed items constitutes speech concerning a public matter,because each item involves either a political issue or a matter of interest to the community.id.at speech involves a matter of public concern when it involves an issue of social,political,or other interest to a community.he emphasizes that,notwithstanding their religious overtones,the removed items involve political information and issues,the article the god gap,explaining information on presidential candidates the article white house staffers gather for bible study,outlining activities of an attorney general and the national day of prayer poster,advertising a presidential proclamation and matters of general community interest,the articles concerning a local woman killed in a plane crash.
contentions such as these might normally be persuasive,and they could well lead a court to conclude that contested speech was made by a private citizen on a matter of public concern.in this case,however,lee contentions fail to take account of important considerations of precedent.courts have generally recognized that the public schools possess the right to regulate speech that occurs within a compulsory classroom setting,and that a school board ability in this regard exceeds the permissible regulation of speech in other governmental workplaces or forums.see hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d we thus recognize that the determination of what manner of speech in the classroom is inappropriate properly rests with the school board rather than with the federal courts.internal quotation marks and citation omitted edwards cal.of,cir recognizing that a public school teacher in class conduct is not protected by the first amendment internal quotation marks omitted bishop aronov,cir w here the speech of a teacher is concerned,the school has an interest not only in preventing interference with the operation of its classrooms,but also in scrutinizing expressions that the public might reasonably perceive to bear its imprimatur.internal quotation marks omitted bradley pittsburgh bd.of,cir concluding that teacher does not possess first amendment right to choose his own classroom management techniques.
of additional importance,the enhanced right of a school board to regulate the speech of its teachers in classroom settings is supported by the supreme court explicit recognition that first amendment free speech rights in a school environment are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.hazelwood,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the hazelwood court explained,the exercise of such rights must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.put simply,our school systems are responsible for adequately and properly educating our youth.a school board carrying out this vital responsibility is entitled to some enhanced control over expressions within its classrooms,so that it can assure that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity,and that the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school.id.at.see also ward hickey,cir i t is that public schools may limit classroom speech to promote educational goals.thus,a school need not tolerate student or teacher speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in order to take account of the characteristics of a dispute involving speech by a,we have concluded that special considerations should be assessed by a reviewing court on whether the contested speech constitutes a matter of public concern in boring buncombe county board of education,for example,we concluded that a teacher selection of a school play constituted speech that did not implicate a matter of public concern,and thus was not protected by the first amendment,cir en banc.the teacher in that case,margaret boring,had been transferred for,inter alia,her selection of a controversial school play,independence,that was performed by four high school students at a state competition.id.at.boring alleged that her transfer was in retaliation for the selection of the play and therefore violated her first amendment right of free speech.id.at.
in concluding that boring speech was not protected by the first amendment,we analyzed whether the speech at selection of the school curricular in nature,using the term curriculum as it had been defined and applied by the supreme court in hazelwood.id.at there,the supreme court defined curriculum as 
publications,theatrical productions,and other expressive activities that students,parents,and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.these activities may fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum,whether or not they occur in a traditional classroom setting,so long as they are supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences.
at.the en banc boring majority decision,authored by our colleague judge widener,determined the selection of the school play to be curricular from the fact that it was supervised by a faculty member,boring it was performed in interscholastic drama competitions and the theater program at the high school was obviously intended to impart particular skills,such as acting,to student participants.id.at.judge widener opinion concluded that t hese factors demonstrate beyond doubt that students,parents,and members of the public might reasonably perceive the production of the play independence to bear the imprimatur of the school.id.alteration in original quoting hazelwood,at.
the boring court reasoned that,if contested speech is curricular in nature,it does not constitute speech on a matter of public concern.see id.at.in so concluding,judge widener reasoned that disputes over curriculum constitute ordinary employment disputes and do not implicate speech on matters of public concern.see id.at thus,when a first amendment free speech dispute involves a who is speaking within the classroom,the determination of whether her speech involves a matter of public concern is dependent on whether or not the speech is curricular.this the contested speech is curricular in a question of law for the court 
in evaluating whether a schoolteacher speech is curricular in nature,and thus not a matter of public concern,we are obliged to apply the hazelwood definition of curriculum.boring,at.to be curricular under this definition,the contested speech must satisfy both of the definition categories of requirements.the hazelwood definition first explains that,in order for a school board to regulate speech,such speech must constitute expression bearing the imprimatur of the school.at.hazelwood then narrows this broad category by also requiring that,in order to be considered curricular in nature,the speech must also be supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge to the students.id.lee contends on appeal that his classroom postings of the removed items do not fit within the hazelwood definition of curriculum,in that they were neither directly nor indirectly related to the spanish curricular objectives he is obliged to teach.furthermore,lee testified that the removed items were not posted for spanish instructional purposes.according to lee,because the removed items are not related to his instruction of spanish,they are not curricular speech.using this narrow definition of curriculum,lee asserts that he has a first amendment right to post any such materials on the classroom bulletin boards.
in these circumstances,however,applying the pertinent legal principles,lee speech nevertheless was curricular in nature,because his postings of the removed items constituted speech bearing the imprimatur of tabb high school,and they were designed to impart particular knowledge to the students.we assess each of the two categorical requirements of the hazelwood the speech is bearing the imprimatur of the school,and whether the speech is supervised by faculty members and designed to impart knowledge to the turn.
first,on whether lee postings constitute speech bearing the imprimatur of the school,the hazelwood definition of curriculum encompasses more than simply the objectives of a specific course of study taught by a particular teacher.indeed,our sister circuits have interpreted speech bearing the imprimatur of a school to include a variety of expressive activities that occur on school property.see,fleming jefferson county sch.dist,cir concluding that memorial tiles residents to design tiles for school speech bearing imprimatur of school,because it was supervised by school officials and tiles would be placed on school walls ward,at concluding that teacher statement was speech bishop,at concluding that professor classroom statements were expressive activities miles denver pub,cir concluding that teacher discussion of school rumor during class was speech.in order to determine whether challenged teacher speech is and bears the imprimatur of the school,a reviewing court must examine whether it has been so closely connected to the school that it appears that t
