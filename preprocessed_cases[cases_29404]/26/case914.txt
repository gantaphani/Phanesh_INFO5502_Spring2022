with the advent of the internet and in the wake of school shootings at columbine,santee,newtown and many others,school administrators face the daunting task of evaluating potential threats of violence and keeping their students safe without impinging on their constitutional rights.it is a feat like tightrope balancing,where an error in judgment can lead to a tragic result.courts have long dealt with the tension between students first amendment rights and the special characteristics of the school environment.hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d.but the challenge for administrators is made all the more difficult because,outside of the official school environment,students are instant messaging,texting,emailing,twittering,tumblring,and otherwise communicating electronically,sometimes about subjects that threaten the safety of the school environment.at the same time,school officials must take care not to overreact and to take into account the creative juices and often startling writings of the students.
in this case,landon wynar a student at douglas high school,engaged in a string of increasingly violent and threatening instant messages sent from home to his friends bragging about his weapons,threatening to shoot specific classmates,intimating that he would take out other people at a school shooting on a specific date,and invoking the image of the virginia tech massacre.his friends were alarmed and notified school authorities,who temporarily expelled landon based in large part on these instant messages.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the school district.the messages presented a real risk of significant disruption to school activities and interfered with the rights of other students.under the circumstances,the school district did not violate landon rights to freedom of expression or due process.
background 
when the events at issue occurred,landon was a sophomore at douglas high school.he collected weapons and ammunition and reported owning various rifles,including a russian rifle and a caliber rifle.
landon communicated regularly with friends from school by exchanging instant messages through the website myspace.myspace is a social networking website that allows its members to set up online profiles and communicate via email,instant messages,and blogs.layshock hermitage sch,cir en banc.instant messages enable users to engage in dialogue by typing messages to one another that appear almost immediately on the others computer screens.united states meek,cir quoting reno aclu,d.
among other things,landon wrote frequently about weapons,going shooting,and world war ii often mentioning hitler,whom he once referred to as our hero.his messages also expressed social insecurity,stating,for example,my parents also do like me just like everyone at school,and its ignore landon day everyday.some months into his sophomore year,landon myspace messages became increasingly violent and disturbing.they included the following statements,all centered around a school shooting to take place on april the date of hitler birth and the columbine massacre and within days of the anniversary of the virginia tech massacre 
its pretty simple i have a sweet gun my neighbor is giving me rounds dhs is gay i watched these kinds of movies so i know how not to go wrong i just cant decide who will be on my hit list and thats totally deminted and it scares even my self 
i havent decided which i will be doing it on by next year,i might have a better gun to use such as an mi cabine w a rd clip or clips 
and ill probably only kill the people i hate me then a few random to get the record 
in response to a statement that he would kill everyone no,just the blacks and mexicans halfbreeds athiests french gays liberals david 
referring to a classmate no im shooting her boobs off then paul hell take a clip then i reload and take out everybody else on the list hmm paul should be last that way i can get more people before they run away

ya i thought about ripping someones throat out with one.wow these r weird thoughts then raping some chicks dead bodies to no.maybe.idk.
that stupid kid from vtech.he didnt do shit and got a record.i bet i could get people and not one bullet would be wasted.
i wish then i could kill more people but i have to make due with what i got.sks rds shot gun off barrle pistle 
although landon friends apparently joked with him at times about school violence,the tenor of these escalating comments alarmed them,and they corresponded with each other to decide what to do.one boy forwarded landon messages to a friend,who responded,thats f crazy landon and i have and messages like that too he told me he was going to rape redacted then kill her then go on a school shotting maybe we should be worried.after seeing the messages,a third boy wrote,jesus christ dude this is some really serious shit wat do we do i mean that is really really sico shit and this is not something to be taking lightly seriously.the first two boys decided to speak with one of their coaches and ask them how to deal with him like how not to make him tick and go on a rampage.
the boys went to a football coach whom they trusted and then,together with the coach,they talked to the school principal about their concerns.they told the principal that they had information about a possible school shooting.after two police deputies interviewed the boys and saw the myspace printouts,they questioned landon in the principal office.
after the police took landon into custody,school administrators met with him and asked if he wanted his parents to be present for their discussion.landon said that he did not.they asked landon about the myspace messages,which he admitted writing but claimed were a joke.after providing a signed,written statement,landon was suspended for days.
the school board charged landon with violating,among other things,and convened a formal hearing.section a provides that a student will be deemed a habitual discipline problem if there is written evidence that the student threatened or extorted another pupil,teacher,or school employee.under,a student who is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem must be suspended or expelled for at least a semester.at the school board hearing,landon was represented by an attorney.he had the opportunity to call witnesses and present evidence,which he chose not to do,and to the school witnesses.landon testified at the hearing.the board held that he violated and expelled him for days.
landon and his father,acting as guardian,sued the school district,school administrators,and school district officials and trustees collectively,douglas county for violations of landon constitutional rights under,as well as for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress the district court denied landon motion for summary judgment and granted douglas county motion for summary judgment.the material facts are not in dispute.
first amendment claim 
the supreme court has not yet addressed the applicability of its school speech cases to speech originating off campus,such as landon myspace messages,which were written from home.although the court prior cases are instructive,we also look to our circuit precedent and to our sister circuits for guidance.we hold that douglas county did not violate landon first amendment rights.landon messages,which threatened the safety of the school and its students,both interfered with the rights of other students and made it reasonable for school officials to forecast a substantial disruption of school activities.
framework for analysis 
the supreme court school speech jurisprudence echoes a common theme although public school students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d,the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings,bethel sch.dist.fraser,d.the court has decided four lead student speech cases tinker fraser hazelwood sch,d and morse frederick,d.each governs a different area of student speech vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly offensive speech is governed by fraser speech is governed by hazelwood,and speech that falls into neither of these categories is governed by tinker.chandler mcminnville sch,cir.in morse,the court dealt with a fourth,and somewhat unique,category speech promoting illegal drug use.at.all four cases involved speech that took place at school or at a event.beyond those contexts,the court has noted only that t here is some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school speech precedents.morse,at.
in la vine blaine school district,our circuit most analogous precedent,we held that a school did not violate the first amendment rights of a student who was expelled on a temporary,emergency basis because of a poem he wrote at home about a school shooting and suicide and later showed to his english teacher during class,cir.because the poem was neither lewd nor,we applied the tinker test to the school actions.id.at.under tinker,schools may prohibit speech that might reasonably lead school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities or that collides with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.tinker,at.looking to the totality of the circumstances,la vine concluded that the school could have reasonably forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities specifically,that the student was intending to inflict injury upon himself or others.lavine,at.against the backdrop of actual school shootings,we considered that the student was involved in a domestic dispute,had recently broken up with his girlfriend and was reportedly stalking her,and had had disciplinary problems in the past.id.at.m aybe most important was the poem itself.id.at.at its extreme it can be interpreted as a portent of future violence,and e ven in its most mild interpretation,the poem appears to be a cry for help.id.
although we did not explicitly address the poem origination,courts have nevertheless cited la vine as an example of a case applying the tinker test to student speech.see,porter ascension parish sch,cir listing lavine as one of the cases in which courts have r efus ed to differentiate between student speech taking place and speech taking place ex rel.beverly hills unified sch,d,stating that under the majority rule,and the rule established by the ninth circuit in la vine,the geographic origin of the speech is not material.
we do not view la vine as taking the position staked out for it by these other courts.la vine definitely did not say that the geographic origin of speech does matter,nor did it say that an individual free speech rights are diminished simply by virtue of being a student.rather,it dealt with speech created off campus but brought to the school by the speaker.this is not a minor distinction.our case presents another variation communication among students involving a safety threat to the school environment and brought to the school attention by a fellow student,not the speaker.as explained below,the location of the speech can make a difference,but that does not mean that all speech is beyond the reach of school officials.
a number of our sister circuits have wrestled with the question of tinker reach beyond the schoolyard.the second,fourth,and eighth circuits have concluded that tinker applies to certain speech.see,doninger niehoff,cir student disqualified from running for class secretary after posting a vulgar and misleading message about the supposed cancellation of an upcoming school event on a web log blog from home kowalski berkeley county,cir student suspended for creating and posting to a myspace webpage that was largely dedicated to ridiculing a fellow student lee summit r sch,cir students suspended for creating website with offensive and racist comments discussing fights at their school and mocking black students,as well as sexually explicit and degrading comments about particular female classmates.these circuits have imposed some additional threshold test before applying tinker to speech that originates off campus.for example,the fourth circuit requires that the speech have a sufficient nexus to the school,kowalski,at,while the eighth circuit requires that it be reasonably foreseeable that the speech will reach the school community,at.the second circuit has not decided whether it must be shown that it was reasonably foreseeable that the speech would reach the school property or whether the undisputed fact that it did reach the school pretermits any inquiry as to this aspect of reasonable foreseeability.wisniewski bd.of educ.of the weedsport cent.sch,cir.but at least where it is reasonably foreseeable that speech meeting the tinker test will wind up at school,the second circuit has permitted schools to impose discipline based on the speech.doninger,at.
the third and fifth circuits have left open the question whether tinker applies to speech.in ex rel.snyder blue mountain sch,cir en banc,the third circuit assume d,without deciding,that tinker applie d to a student creation of a parody myspace profile mocking the school principal,but held that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the speech would create a substantial disruption in a separate concurrence,five judges expressed their position that tinker does not apply to speech and that the first amendment protects students engaging in speech to the same extent it protects speech by citizens in the community at large.id.at smith,concurring.the fifth circuit similarly left the question open in porter,at noting the difficulties posed by state regulation of student speech that takes place and is later brought.in that case,the student speech was not even directed at the campus.id.at.
one of the difficulties with the student speech cases is an effort to divine and impose a global standard for a myriad of circumstances involving speech.a student parody of a principal is hardly the same as a threat of a school shooting,and we are reluctant to try and craft a fits all approach.we do not need to consider at this time whether tinker applies to all speech such as principal parody profiles or websites dedicated to disparaging or bullying fellow students.these cases present challenges of their own that we will no doubt confront down the road.nor do we need to decide whether to incorporate or adopt the threshold tests from our sister circuits,as any of these tests could be easily satisfied in this circumstance.given the subject and addressees of landon messages,it is hard to imagine how their nexus to the school could have been more direct for the same reasons,it should have been reasonably foreseeable to landon that his messages would reach campus.indeed,the alarming nature of the messages prompted landon friends to do exactly what we would hope any responsible student would do report to school authorities.here we make explicit what was implicit in lavine when faced with an identifiable threat of school violence,schools may take disciplinary action in response to speech that meets the requirements of tinker.
as we wrote in lavine given the knowledge the shootings at columbine,thurston and santee high schools,among others have imparted about the potential for school violence we must take care when evaluating a student first amendment right of free expression against school officials need to provide a safe school environment not to overreact in favor of either.at.the approach we set out strikes the appropriate balance between allowing schools to act to protect their students from credible threats of violence while recognizing and protecting freedom of expression by students.
application to landon my space messages 
confronted with messages that could be interpreted as a plan to attack the school,written by a student with confirmed access to weapons and brought to the school attention by fellow students,douglas county faced a dilemma every school dreads.as the eleventh circuit noted in a similar case,w e can only imagine what would have happened if the school officials,after learning of the writing,did nothing about it and landon did in fact come to school with a gu
