this is an appeal from a judgment granting a petition for writ of mandate.the issue before us is whether a bid on a public agency contract can be declared nonresponsive by the public agency when the bidder has listed an unlicensed subcontractor on the bid forms.we agree with the trial court that such a bid,in the circumstances of the present case,could not be declared nonresponsive.however,the appropriate remedy is for the agency to conduct a due process hearing before awarding the contract to determine whether the bidder is responsible.accordingly,we reverse the judgment,which simply directed the awarding of the contract to the bidder in question.
facts and procedural history 
appellant clovis unified school district the district is building a million educational center.instead of soliciting bids for a single prime contract,the district is using the services of a construction manager and is soliciting bids for multiple prime contracts for various phases of the project.the bids involved in the present case were for the concrete and fencing work at the educational center.
the district solicited bids pursuant to a project manual that contains instructions to bidders,general conditions of bidding,and a mandatory form for listing of subcontractors.bids were due by march.five bidders submitted proposals.the bid submitted by respondent williams construction,williams,was the lowest,at.the bid submitted by appellant emmett excavation,emmett,was next lowest,at.
on its form for designation of subcontractors,williams listed patch master of central california as the subcontractor for concrete,masonry,sleeves.on february,patch master contractor license had expired.the license had not been renewed at the time bids were opened.
the district notified williams on march,that upon checking on the license status of your listed subcontractors,it appears that patch master does not have a current and active license.the notice invited williams to fax your response to this item to the district purchasing manager.the notice did not purport to reject williams bid.
williams provided the district with a copy of an undated letter from patch master refusing the subcontract on this bid package and releasing any claims it may have had as a result of its inclusion in williams bid.williams notified the district it invoked public contract code section,subdivision a,which permits the public agency to allow substitution of a subcontractor when the listed subcontractor fails or refuses to perform his or her subcontract.williams stated that it will therefore be performing this work with its own forces or requesting substitution as allowed.at this time,patch master will not be performing this work.
by fax transmitted on march,the district notified williams that the district governing board would award the bid for concrete work at its meeting the next day and that staff would recommend rejection of williams bid as.at its meeting on march,the governing board accepted emmett bid as the low acceptable bid and awarded emmett the contract.
on april,williams filed its petition for writ of mandate,naming the district as respondent and emmett as real party in interest.the matter was heard on declarations and documentary evidence on october.the court issued a tentative decision to grant the petition on october,and its statement of decision,judgment,and peremptory writ on december.the judgment canceled and rescinded the contract between the district and emmett.the judgment and the writ directed the district to stop all work by emmett,to prepare and award a contract for the remaining work for execution by williams,and to pay emmett for work performed as measured by the provisions of public contract code.
the district filed a timely notice of appeal.emmett filed a separate notice of appeal.this court ordered the appeals consolidated.
by statute,the filing of a notice of appeal stays a writ of mandate unless otherwise ordered by the trial court or this court.see code civ.by minute order,the trial court denied williams motion for relief from the automatic stay.no similar motion was filed in this court.
discussion 
introduction 
we note,initially,that williams has not filed a brief in this appeal.accordingly,we will address the district contentions without setting forth the traditional statement of respondent position on the issues.emmett filed a notice of joinder in the district brief.
the district contends the appropriate standard of review,both for us and for the trial court,is abuse of discretion.thus,we must determine whether,as the trial court found,the district actions were arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or inconsistent with proper procedure.mcm construction,city and county of san francisco th,d see also ocean park associates santa monica rent control bd.th,d.at this stage of the case,the relevant facts are undisputed.the primary issue is whether the district actions were an abuse of discretion because inconsistent with proper procedure 
responsible bidders and responsive bids 
school districts,like most other public agencies,are required by law to award construction contracts with certain narrow exceptions to the lowest responsible bidder.pub.contract code.an agency has discretion to determine whether a low bidder is responsible,that is,whether the bidder has the fitness,quality,and capacity to perform the proposed work satisfactorily.city of county civic center auth.superior court cal d.in making this determination,however,the agency is required to afford a significant level of due process to the bidder,including notice and an opportunity to respond.id.at.
a determination that a bidder is responsible or not is a complex matter dependent,often,on information received outside the bidding process and requiring,in many cases,an application of subtle judgment.not only is the process complex,but the declaration of nonresponsibility may have an adverse impact on the professional or business reputation of the bidder.taylor bus service,san diego bd.of education d.for example,in raymond fresno city unified sch.dist.d,the school district received evidence that problems on the bidder prior construction project were so significant the bidder could not be found a responsible bidder on the present project.
in addition to the determination whether a bidder is responsible,the agency must also determine whether the bid is responsive to the call for bids,that is,whether the bid promises to do what the bidding instructions demand.taylor bus service,san diego bd.of education,supra,d at.for example,in valley crest landscape,city council th,d,the bid documents required that subcontractors perform less than percent of the contemplated construction project.the lowest bid stated that subcontractors would perform over percent of the work.the court held this bid nonresponsive and concluded the city was not permitted to award the contract based on the nonresponsive bid.ibid.
in the usual case,the determination that a bid is nonresponsive is not based on disputed facts,does not involve an exercise of agency discretion,and does not require a hearing for the excluded bidder.taylor bus service,san diego bd.of education,supra,d at.
at the core of the present case is the trial court determination that the district,while purporting to find williams bid nonresponsive,in legal effect found williams was not a responsible bidder.as the trial court found,the district failed to afford williams a due process opportunity to contest that finding and thereby abused its discretion in rejecting williams bid.the trial court ordered the district to award the contract to williams.in this latter respect,however,we disagree as in most due process cases,we believe the remedy must permit the agency to properly consider the issues in a due process hearing,and then to exercise the discretion vested in the agency by statute.kumar national medical enterprises,d.see superior court d.
the subletting and subcontracting fair practices act does not require bidders to list only licensed subcontractors 
the district asserts several grounds for its claim that williams bid was nonresponsive to the call for bids and,as a result,could be summarily rejected.although the district impliedly acknowledges that no portion of the public contract code or the business and professions code,and no portion of its call for bids or bid specifications package,expressly requires that subcontractors be licensed at the time they are listed in a bid,the district argues in various ways that public policy and common sense demand that we imply such a requirement.we will discuss each of the locations in which the district would have us find such a requirement,beginning with the code sections that most directly regulate the role of subcontractors in the award of public works contracts.
the subletting and subcontracting fair practices act the act,public contract code section et,requires,among other provisions,that bidders for public works projects list in their bids the name and the location of the place of business of each subcontractor who will perform work or labor or render service to the prime contractor in or about the construction of the work or improvement,pub.contract code,subd.a.bidders are also required to state the portion of the work that will be done by each subcontractor id.at,subd.b.the prime contractor shall list only one subcontractor for each portion as is defined by the prime contractor in his or her bid.ibid.
the act seeks to protect both the public agency issuing the call for bids and subcontractors who submit subbids to prime contractors.southern cal.acoustics holder,cal d.as to public agencies,the act permits the agency to investigate and approve both initially listed subcontractors and any substitute subcontractors proposed by the prime contractor.see brady,golden th,d.
as to subcontractors,the act seeks to prevent bid shopping and bid peddling.pub.contract code.these practices involve efforts by prime contractors to coerce lower bids from subcontractors after a contract has been awarded to the prime bidder using as leverage prior bids from subcontractors shopping and efforts by other subcontractors to undercut the price of successful subcontractors after the prime contract has been awarded peddling.brady,golden,supra,th at,d.
the district contends that if bidders are allowed to list unlicensed subcontractors to be replaced after the contract award with licensed subcontractors t he public policy and purpose behind the act will be abrogated.this argument,however,erroneously assumes that an agency is without tools to deal with such conduct by a bidder.
if an agency had reason to believe a bidder knowingly listed a subcontractor,whether licensed or not,with the intention of substituting a different subcontractor once the prime contract was awarded,the agency clearly would be entitled to reject the prime bidder as not responsible such action by a bidder would be a violation of the act,which provides that a prime contractor whose bid is accepted may not b permit a subcontract to be performed by anyone other than the original subcontractor listed in the original bid,without the consent of the awarding authority,or its duly authorized officer.pub.contract code.
further,if the agency discovered such action after the contract was awarded,the agency may take remedial action a prime contractor violating any of the provisions of the act violates his or her contract and the awarding authority may exercise the option,in its own discretion,of canceling his or her contract or assessing the prime contractor a penalty pub.contract code.
such a determination by a public agency is a serious matter,however.it is precisely the type of complex determination,requiring exercise of subtle administrative judgment,that has been held to involve a finding of nonresponsibility,not the more straightforward finding of nonresponsiveness.see taylor bus service,san diego bd.of education,supra,d at.thus,by statute,a prime contractor accused of violating the act by intentionally switching out its listed subcontractors would be entitled to a public hearing and to five days notice of the time and place thereof.pub.contract code.
because there are ample remedies available to public agencies when confronted with prime contractors who violate the act by intentionally listing subcontractors with no expectation the subcontractor will actually perform the work,we conclude effective enforcement of the act does not require an implied blanket requirement that all subcontractors be licensed at the time prime bids are submitted.
far from abrogating the effectiveness of the act,our conclusion protects innocent bidders and their listed subcontractors from arbitrary or erroneous disqualification from public works contracting,a purpose fully consistent with the act.in the present case,for example,the bid documents provided that any work not designated in the bid for completion by a subcontractor must be completed by the prime contractor directly.williams,after the licensing issue was discovered by the district,advised the district it was fully ready to perform the concrete work itself if the district declined to permit a substitute subcontractor.unless the district determined that listing the unlicensed subcontractor was intentional or otherwise served to establish williams was not a responsible bidder,no purpose of the public contract code would be served by excluding williams bid the district would receive the same product at the same price stated in the bid,the low bidder and its other listed subcontractors would be awarded the work,and the only entity made poorer would be patch master,which has relinquished all claims 
we emphasize that this holding does not,as the district strenuously contends,require a public agency to accept unlicensed subcontractors and wait until after the contract award for the bidder to apply to substitute them out.instead,what is required is a determination that a prime contractor is not responsible,for example,because it has listed a subcontractor it has no intention of actually using.that determination requires a due process proceeding,which the district failed to offer in this case.see city of county civic center auth.superior court,supra,cal d at.
the contractors state license law does not prohibit inclusion of unlicensed subcontractors 
the contractors state license law,business and professions code section et,regulates participants in the construction industry.business and professions code section includes subcontractors within the definition of contractors.a contractor includes one who undertakes,offers to undertake,or submits a bid for,a building project.the district contends,rather elliptically a contractor is not someone who just enters into a contract or performs construction work.
filling in the blanks,we take the district argument to be that one who bids on or offers to undertake construction is engaged in the business or is acting in the capacity of a contractor within this state,as described in business and professions code section,subdivision a,a code section the district does not cite but upon which it apparently relies.that section further states that such action is a misdemeanor.accordingly,the district appears to argue,a subcontractor who has submitted a subbid to a prime bidder is engaged in the business of contracting and is required to have a contractor license in order to submit a valid subbid.
while there is a certain formal logic to the district,indeed,it might even be correct that submission of a bid by an unlicensed subcontractor is a argument does not lead to the conclusion that williams bid was nonresponsive.as the court stated in mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental metal works,cal th,d,the legislature has demonstrated that it knows how to invalidate the agreements of unlicensed contractors when it wishes to do so.
the example of such legislative action discussed by the mw erectors opinion is business and professions code section,subdivision a,which,with certain exceptions,forbids any person to submit a bid to a public agency in order to engage in the business or act in the capacity of a contractor within this state without having a license therefor.unless an exception is applicable,a bid submitted to a public agency by a contractor who is not licens
