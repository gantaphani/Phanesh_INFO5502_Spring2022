background 
in october,rachel boim rachel was a student at roswell high school rhs in the fulton county school district.during her fifth period art class,rachel gave a notebook of hers to a male student seated next to her.the art class teacher,travis carr carr,observed the student writing in the notebook,which carr did not then know belonged to rachel.carr instructed the student to put the notebook away and resume his class work.about five minutes later,carr noticed the notebook in the student lap again.carr asked the student for the notebook,but instead the student passed the notebook back to rachel.carr asked rachel for the notebook,and she responded,no,and stated that carr first would have to say please.rachel then placed the notebook in her book bag,removed a different notebook,and handed it to carr.carr noticed the switch.he persisted,and eventually rachel gave him the notebook.
later,after class,carr looked through the notebook and read the following entry,which was located behind a divider labeled dream

boim fulton county sch,slip op.at.
shortly after school ended that day,carr spoke with john coen coen about rachel narrative.coen,a school administrative assistant in charge of disciplinary matters,requested that carr bring him the notebook the following morning.the next day,coen reviewed the narrative and became concerned that it was planning in disguise as a dream.tr.of admin.disciplinary hr g at tr.he consulted with the school resource officer,the school police officer.the officer,james young young,also was concerned about the narrative school setting and violent nature.according to his testimony at the administrative hearing,he became especially concerned after discovering that rachel sixth period class was math and her teacher was a man.
early in the day following carr discovery of the writing,after coen and young had discussed their concerns with each other,young removed rachel from her second period class and escorted her to rhs administrative offices.school officials contacted rachel parents,and coen and young met with rachel and her parents to discuss the incident.rachel admitted that the notebook and the relevant writing were hers but dismissed the narrative as merely a piece of creative fiction.her parents supported her and dismissed any notion that rachel narrative evidenced an intent to harm anyone.rhs principal edward spurka spurka also participated in the meeting,though the extent of spurka participation is not clear from the record.at the end of the meeting,the administrators sent rachel home.
concerned primarily about the threatening undertones of rachel narrative in light of the massacre that occurred at columbine high school in colorado,the much more local shooting that occurred at heritage high school in conyers,georgia,and terrorism following the attacks that occurred on september,spurka decided that further investigation was necessary to determine whether rachel had violated any school rules.ultimately,spurka,in collaboration with a team of school administrators and after consulting with rachel sixth period math teacher,who testified that he was shocked by the writing,felt threatened,and was uncomfortable with the idea of having rachel in his class tr.at,determined that rachel had violated three school rules rule jd iii threat of bodily harm rule jd disregard of school rules,directions,or commands and rule jd disrespectful conduct.of greatest relevance to this appeal is rule jd iii,which the parties stipulate states as follows 
a student shall not attempt to cause physical injury,threaten bodily harm,or behave in such a way as could reasonably cause physical injury to a school employee a on the school grounds at any time b off the school grounds at a school sponsored activity,function or event or c en route to and from school or school sponsored activity.
spurka suspended rachel for days beginning october.he also recommended that she be expelled from rhs but deferred that decision to an independent arbiter,who later conducted a disciplinary hearing.after receiving evidence and hearing testimony,the hearing officer agreed with spurka recommendation and expelled rachel.the district superintendent stayed rachel expulsion pending appeal to the fulton county board of education boe,which affirmed the hearing officer decision and rachel suspension but overturned the expulsion.thus,rachel was not expelled from rhs,and she did not appeal the boe decision.
approximately two years later,nancy boim,on rachel behalf,and rachel parents filed the underlying lawsuits,which the defendants later removed from state court to federal district court.the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment and denied the boims motions for partial summary judgment after determining that the defendants actions did not violate rachel rights under the first amendment of the united states constitution.
whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the basis that rachel suspension did not violate her first amendment rights.
whether the district court erred in concluding that rachel was not entitled to any injunctive relief requiring the defendants to expunge her records of negative documentation relating to her suspension.
iii.standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see,fin.sec.assurance,stephens,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
we review a district court denial of injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion,though we review de novo the district court relevant legal conclusions.kidder,peabody,brandt,cir.
