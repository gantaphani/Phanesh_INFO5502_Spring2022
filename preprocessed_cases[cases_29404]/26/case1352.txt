a government contractor agreed under the terms of its contracts to comply with the ralph brown act brown act,et in meetings of its board of directors to the extent that the meetings involved publicly funded programs.we hold that members of the public are the intended beneficiaries of such a contractual provision and can enforce the provision as third party beneficiaries of the contract.the government contractor can not be sued directly under the brown act,however,because it is not a legislative body as defined in the act.

trial court proceedings 
seiu and torres filed a complaint against options in august and filed a first amended complaint in october.they allege in their first amended complaint that options agreed under the terms of its contracts with the department of education to comply with the brown act.they allege that options failed to comply with the brown act at its meeting of june,by failing to post an agenda at least hours before the meeting failing to disclose the items to be discussed in executive session failing to provide members of the public an opportunity to address the board and failing to make available to members of the public reports and other writings distributed to the directors.
seiu and torres allege counts against options for violation of the brown act and breach of contract.they allege in their first count that options agreed to be treated as a legislative body under government code section and that government section,subdivision a provides for injunctive and declaratory relief to stop or prevent a violation of the brown act.they allege that an actual and present controversy exists as to whether options complied with the brown act at its meeting of june,and that they are entitled to a judicial declaration that options violated the brown act in the manners alleged.they also allege that they are entitled to an injunction compelling options and its agents and employees to comply with the brown act.they allege further that they are entitled to recover their attorney fees under government code section.
seiu and torres allege in their second count for breach of contract that they are intended beneficiaries of the contract provisions requiring compliance with the brown act,that they are entitled to enforce those contractual provisions as third party beneficiaries,and that they are entitled to the same remedies alleged in their first count.
seiu and torres moved for summary judgment or alternatively for summary adjudication that they are third party beneficiaries of the contracts between options and the department of education and options violated the brown act at the meeting of its board of directors on june.
options also moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication of each count.it argued that seiu and torres could not prevail on their first count because options was not a legislative body as defined in government code section and therefore was not governed by the brown act.options argued with respect to the second count that seiu and torres could not enforce the contracts as third party beneficiaries because they were merely incidental beneficiaries rather than intended beneficiaries of the contracts.
the trial court stated at the hearing on the motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication that the brown act was inapplicable because options was not a legislative body as defined in the act and that the department of education had no authority to enact a regulation that was inconsistent with the brown act.the court stated that options therefore was entitled to judgment in its favor on the count for violation of the brown act.the court stated regarding the count for breach of contract that seiu and torres were not intended beneficiaries of the contracts because the contracts did not state that the contracting parties would be liable to seiu or torres for damages resulting from seiu failure to perform its contractual obligations,citing martinez socoma companies,cal d martinez.
the trial court therefore granted options motion for summary judgment,denied the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication by seiu and torres,and entered judgment in favor of options seiu and torres timely appealed the judgment.
contentions 
seiu and torres contend the award of summary judgment in favor of options was error and they are entitled to summary judgment in their favor because the undisputed evidence compels the conclusion that they are members of a class of intended beneficiaries of the contractual provisions requiring compliance with the brown act and although options is not a legislative body as defined in the brown act,it agreed under the terms of the contracts to be governed by the brown act and therefore can be sued directly under the brown act.

members of the public are entitled to enforce the contracts as third party beneficiaries 
a third party may enforce a contract made for his or her benefit or made for the benefit of a class of which he or she is a member,hess ford motor cal th,garratt baker cal d.civil code section states,a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.the contract need not expressly state that it is intended to benefit a third party as long as such an intent is apparent through the ordinary means of contract interpretation.hess,supra,at garcia truck ins.exchange cal d.a person need not be the sole or even the primary beneficiary to be a third party beneficiary.prouty gores technology group th.a person whose benefit is only incidental or remote,however,is not an intended beneficiary and therefore can not be a third party beneficiary lucas hamm cal d,spinks,supra,th at.
for purposes of determining whether a third party is an intended beneficiary,the relevant intent is that of the promisee,and it is sufficient if the promisor understood that the promisee had that intent.lucas hamm,supra,cal d at spinks,supra,th at.thus,a third party will qualify as an intended beneficiary where the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.spinks,supra,at,quoting rest d contracts,b.
we interpret a contract so as to give effect to the mutual intention of the contracting parties at the time the contract was formed.we ascertain that intention solely from the written contract if possible,but also consider the circumstances under which the contract was made and the matter to which it relates.we consider the contract as a whole and interpret its language in context so as to give effect to each provision,rather than interpret contractual language in isolation.we interpret words in accordance with their ordinary and popular sense,unless the words are used in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.if contractual language is clear and explicit and does not involve an absurdity,the plain meaning governs.
fourteen of the contracts identified in discovery stated that if options received public funds in connection with the contracts it must comply with the brown act to the extent of the publicly funded program.those contracts stated further that its board meetings must be open to the public,with limited exceptions,and that minutes of the open meetings must be available to the public.the provisions of former california code of regulations,title,section,incorporated in four other contracts were substantially the same.we construe all of these contractual provisions to mean that notwithstanding the facts that options is not a local agency and its board of directors is not a legislative body as defined in the brown act as discussed post,options agreed to comply with the requirements of the brown act in all respects relating to the board discussion or consideration of any publicly funded programs 
we believe that the purpose of the provisions requiring compliance with the brown act was to ensure that meetings of options board of directors relating to publicly funded programs would be open to the public and to extend to the general public the right to be informed regarding the matters to be discussed at such meetings and other brown act protections.we conclude that the intended beneficiary of these contractual provisions was the general public.a member of the public may enforce these provisions as a member of the class for whose benefit the contract was made.the enforcement of such a provision in a government contract should not depend on action by the public agency,which may have little incentive to enforce the provision.zigas superior court d.
