in this first amendment case,alan newsom newsom,a student at jack jouett middle school jouett in albemarle county,virginia,by and through his parent and next friend,fred newsom,appeals from a district court order denying his motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the portion of jouett dress code which prohibits messages on clothing,jewelry,and personal belongings that relate to weapons.according to newsom,the district court should have entered a preliminary injunction because he satisfied the test governing preliminary injunctions with regard to his claims that the challenged portion of jouett dress code is both unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.because we agree that newsom satisfied this test at the preliminary injunction stage of the proceedings,we vacate the district court order denying newsom motion for a preliminary injunction and remand with instructions to enter a preliminary injunction.
students at jouett and their parents are provided each year with a handbook that is updated every summer.during the school year,the handbook prohibited students from wearing,inter alia,messages on clothing,jewelry,and personal belongings that relate to drugs,alcohol,tobacco,sex,vulgarity,or that reflect adversely upon persons because of their race or ethnic group.
on april,during the student lunch period at jouett,elizabeth pitt pitt,an assistant principal at jouett,observed newsom,who at the time was a student in the sixth grade at jouett,sitting at a table on the opposite side of the cafeteria with his back towards her pitt attention was drawn to newsom by his purple,which depicted three black silhouettes of men holding firearms superimposed on the letters nra positioned above the phrase shooting sports camp.although the men appear to be aiming their firearms,the did not indicate what or whom their targets may be.the front of the bore a smaller but identical version of the men superimposed on the initials nra,but no other writing or symbols.
according to pitt,she had the immediate impression that the figures were sharpshooters which reminded her of the shootings at columbine high school in colorado and other incidents of violence.as a consequence of her impression,pitt was immediately concerned over the appropriateness of newsom in a middle school environment.pitt believed that the had the potential to disrupt the instructional process since the graphics on the shirt were so large and bold as to be distracting and she feared that newsom fellow middle school students would also associate the images with the events at columbine high school and other incidents of violence.it was pitt judgment that the images on newsom could also reasonably be interpreted by other middle school students to promote the use of guns.pitt felt that the imagery on the was at odds with her obligation as a school administrator to discourage and prevent violence since the images on newsom conflicted with the message that guns and schools do mix and had the potential to create confusion among middle school students over the appropriate boundaries between firearms and schools.pitt was also aware of at least one prior incident at jouett when a middle school student brought a firearm to a school function.
after observing the images on the,pitt approached newsom and whispered in his ear that he needed to do something about the because it was not appropriate school attire.when pitt suggested that newsom either change the or turn it inside out,newsom told her that he had obtained the at a camp and asked what was wrong with it.pitt advised newsom that his shirt was inappropriate for school because the shirt depicted pictures of men shooting guns.
according to pitt,she further explained the inappropriateness of the to newsom in terms she felt he would understand,that the school did not allow alcohol or drugs in the school and did not permit clothing with references to alcohol or drugs.similarly,the school did not allow weapons in school nor images of such weapons on student clothing.
after newsom asked pitt if she was going to suspend him,pitt advised newsom,whom she had always found to be an obedient and cooperative student,that suspension was not going to happen in this situation because he simply needed to change his.when newsom then asked,what if i refuse,pitt told him that if he refused to comply with her request it would raise an entirely different issue,defiance,in which case an suspension could be a possibility.pitt cautioned newsom,however,that there was no need to take the matter that far since his behavior had never been a problem before and all he had to do was either turn the inside out or change it.newsom appeared to agree with pitt and left the cafeteria to go to the boys bathroom to turn his inside out.
during the summer of,the handbook was revised to prohibit students from wearing,inter alia,messages on clothing,jewelry,and personal belongings that relate to drugs,alcohol,tobacco,weapons,violence,sex,vulgarity,or that reflect adversely upon persons because of their race or ethnic group.
for the school year,newsom was in the seventh grade at jouett.between the beginning of the school year and october,when the district court heard oral argument on newsom motion for a preliminary injunction,pitt observed newsom on at least three occasions wearing a in school that bore the initials nra,an nra logo,or other written messages referencing the nra.according to pitt,none of those contained the objectionable images of gunmen that were on the newsom wore to school on april.school authorities did not speak to newsom nor take any measures to prohibit him from wearing the other nra and he continued to do so through the date of the hearing on the preliminary injunction.
on september,newsom filed suit against the albemarle county school board and a host of other school officials including pitt in the united states district court for the western district of virginia,alleging that his first amendment rights to freedom of speech and association had been infringed in his complaint,newsom alleged,inter alia,that his first amendment rights were violated when he was instructed to change his or turn it inside out in april his due process rights were violated because the dress code did not give him notice that wearing his would subject him to disciplinary action and the jouett dress code both was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.along with his complaint,newsom filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the jouett dress code to the extent that it prohibited the wearing of clothing or jewelry that depicts images of or messages containing weapons or images that are being used contained in a lawful,display of speech,expression,or association.according to newsom,such an injunction would not only allow him to wear the he was banned from wearing,but also allow him to wear other containing messages related to the lawful possession of firearms.
the district court held a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction on october.on december,the district court filed a memorandum opinion in which it concluded that newsom was not entitled to a preliminary injunction,principally because newsom did not demonstrate that he had a likelihood of success on the merits of any of his claims.with regard to the censorship of newsom in april,the district court assumed,without deciding,that the constituted symbolic speech.the district court went on to opine that the censorship of newsom was permissible because jouett only sought to suppress the form of the message graphic description of gunmen and not the message itself.with regard to newsom due process,vagueness,and overbreadth claims,the district court ostensibly found that newsom would not likely succeed on the merits of these claims because a school dress code need not be as detailed as a criminal code and,in view of this relaxed standard,the jouett dress code was not constitutionally infirm because of due process,vagueness,or overbreadth concerns.an order denying newsom motion for a preliminary injunction was entered by the district court and newsom noted a timely appeal.
on appeal,newsom contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a preliminary injunction.more specifically,he contends that he satisfied the test governing preliminary injunctions with regard to his claims that the jouett dress code is both unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.

in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a court must consider the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the preliminary injunction is denied,the likelihood of harm to the defendant if the requested relief is granted,the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits,and the public interest.direx israel,breakthrough med,cir.in this case,the irreparable harm that newsom has alleged is inseparably linked to his claim of a violation of his first amendment rights.determination of irreparable harm thus requires analysis of newsom likelihood of success on the merits,and we turn to this question first.
with regard to newsom likelihood of success on the merits on his overbreadth claim,the principal question here is whether,after examining the record as it has developed through the preliminary injunction stage of the case,the jouett dress code,which prohibits,inter alia,messages on clothing,jewelry,and personal belongings that relate to weapons,is unconstitutionally on its face because it reaches too much expression that is protected by the first amendment.
the first amendment bars the government from abridging the freedom of speech that is,generally,from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear.i ashcroft free speech coalition,d.notwithstanding this edict,courts have long recognized that a public school student first amendment rights are not coextensive to those held by others in other contexts.bethel sch.dist.fraser,d.because most public school students are minors and school administrators have the duty to provide and facilitate education and to maintain order and discipline,the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials,consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards,to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.tinker des moines indep.sch,d.consequently,while a public school student does not shed his constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the gate,id.at,those rights may be limited as long as the limitation is consistent with constitutional safeguards.
in tinker,school officials prevented a group of students from wearing black armbands to express their opposition to our country participation in the vietnam war.id.at.the court upheld the students right to do so because there was no evidence whatever of petitioners interference,actual or nascent,with the schools work or of collision with the rights of other students to be secure and to be left alone.id.at.responding to the school authorities attempt to justify their actions by reason of a concern about the possibility of the armbands creating a disturbance in school,the court held that,in our system,undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.id.by contrast,conduct by the student,in class or out of it,which for any it stems from time,place,or type of disrupts class work or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is,of course,not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.id.at.accordingly,tinker requires a specific and significant fear of disruption,not just some remote apprehension of disturbance.saxe state coll.area sch,cir.in sum,if a school can point to a expectation of one based on past incidents arising out of similar restriction may pass constitutional muster.id.at.
in two subsequent cases,the supreme court further defined the parameters of the freedom of expression in public schools.in fraser,a school disciplined a student for a student government nominating speech filled with sexual metaphor viewed by the school and the court as lewd.at.the court upheld the school authority to do so because of society interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior.id.at.schools are not prevented by the first amendment from encouraging the fundamental values of habits and manners of civility,by insisting that certain modes of expression are inappropriate and subject to sanctions.id.at.and t he determination of what manner of speech is inappropriate properly rests with the school board.id.accordingly,fraser establishes an exception to tinker disruption requirement.under fraser,the banned school speech need not meet tinker disruption requirement rather,speech in school can be banned if it is lewd,vulgar,indecent,or plainly offensive.id.at.see also saxe,at holding that,under fraser,there is no first amendment protection for lewd,vulgar,indecent,and plainly offensive speech in school boroff van wert city bd.of,cir applying fraser to vulgar of a jesus accompanied by the words see no truth.hear no truth.speak no truth,cert.denied,d.when speech in school falls within the lewd,vulgar,and plainly offensive rubric,it can be said that fraser limits the form and manner of speech,but does not address the content of the message.fraser,at.distinguishing tinker on the basis that the lewd,vulgar,and plainly offensive speech was unrelated to any political viewpoint see also hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d brennan,dissenting fraser limited to the appropriateness of the manner in which the message is conveyed,not of the message content.east high alliance bd.of educ.of salt lake city sch,d,fraser speaks to the form and manner of student speech,not its substance.it addresses the mode of expression,not its content or viewpoint.
in hazelwood,the court addressed a public school decision to censor two articles slated for publication in the school newspaper one concerned pregnant students at the school,the other discussed the impact of divorce on students.at.the pregnancy story was rejected because the principal feared that,in spite of the pseudonyms used in the article,the subjects might still be identified by the school community.id.the divorce story was rejected because it contained negative information about school parents and there was insufficient time to permit them to respond to the facts set out in the article.id.the supreme court rejected the newspaper staff members suit on a number of bases the school paper was not a public forum,publishing the paper was a activity that was part of an advanced journalism class,and readers would perceive articles appearing in the school paper as being publications.id.at.in addition,the court recognized the competing privacy interests of the pregnant students and the families going through a divorce.id.the court described when a school has greater authority to regulate student speech in this way 
t he standard articulated in tinker for determining when a school may punish student expression need not also be the standard for determining when a school may refuse to lend its name and resources to the dissemination of student expression.instead,we hold that educators do not offend the first amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.

newsom does not contend that all clothing containing messages related to weapons worn in public schools is protected by the first amendment.rather,he acknowledges that jouett could,even in the absence of a school policy,prohibit the display of violent,threatening,lewd,vulgar,indecent,or plainly offensive images and messages related to weapons under tinker and fraser.newsom also correctly points out that nonviolent and nonthreatening related to weapons would fall squarely under tinker disruption standard.scott sch.bd.of alachua county,cir.uphol
