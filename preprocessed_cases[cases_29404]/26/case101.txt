defendant stephen perry,the principal of capital preparatory magnet school capital prep in hartford,connecticut,appeals from an interlocutory order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,warren eginton,judge,denying perry motion to dismiss,by summary judgment,plaintiff norman johnson claims that his first amendment right of freedom of assembly and his right to be free from the intentional infliction of emotional distress were violated by perry in banning johnson from attending virtually all capital prep events,on or off school property,because of his opposition to perry bullying and harassing efforts to compel johnson daughter to remain a member of the girls varsity basketball team.the district court denied perry summary judgment motion on the ground that his entitlement to qualified immunity can not be determined without the resolution of genuinely disputed questions of material fact as to motivation and reasonableness the court also sua sponte revived a previously dismissed claim that perry actions violated johnson right to due process,and it noted that there exist genuine issues of material fact to be tried with respect to that claim as well.on appeal,perry challenges the court decisions on the first amendment and due process claims,contending that he is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law,even on the basis of the facts as johnson views them.
for the reasons that follow we dismiss the appeal insofar as it pertains to the claimed due process violation see part.below.insofar as the appeal pertains to the first amendment claim,we conclude that perry motion for summary judgment was properly denied insofar as johnson complains of being banned from events beyond school property and from sports contests on school property to which the public is invited,but that perry is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law to the extent that he banned johnson from school property otherwise.
background 
as this is an appeal from the denial of summary judgment,we view the record in the light most favorable to johnson as the party against whom summary judgment was sought.and we describe the events giving rise to this action as johnson contends they occurred,given perry assertion of the right to take this interlocutory appeal on the basis of the plaintiff version of the facts perry brief on appeal at.
johnson daughter withdraws from the varsity basketball team 
in,johnson daughter to whom we refer as jd was a student at capital prep.capital prep required its students to participate in two sports.one of the sports in which jd participated was basketball.in her junior and senior years,she was a member of both the junior varsity jv and varsity teams but on the varsity team she received very little playing time.both johnson and his wife bonnie johnson bonnie urged varsity basketball coach tammy millsaps to allow jd to play more.johnson approached millsaps at numerous practices and games he said he could work with jd and asked what he needed to do to improve her play.millsaps responded simply that she would not guarantee anyone any amount of playing time.see,deposition of norman johnson johnson dep,at.
jd,dissatisfied with her lack of playing time and with millsaps coaching,told her parents she felt she was being treated unfairly.in january,in her senior year,she no longer wanted to be a member of the varsity team and wanted to be only on the jv team,where she actually got an opportunity to play the game.her parents said they would support her decision whatever it was.
after a varsity basketball game on saturday january,johnson attempted once again to speak with millsaps about more playing time for his daughter.when millsaps responded that she did have time and would talk to him some other time,johnson told millsaps that from that moment on,jd would not be a member of the varsity team and would be playing only on the jv team.see johnson dep.id.at i said,that okay.you do have to worry about it.she not playing for you no more.she just play jv.
prior to the end of that game,johnson and bonnie had been discussing their intention to speak to millsaps about more playing time for jd.they were overheard by another capital prep player mother,who chastised them for expecting jd to play in as fast paced a game as this january,email from bonnie to perry or in a high profile game like this johnson dep.johnson told the other mother that he did not appreciate her comment,but he did not get into an argument with her.see id.the parties dispersed without incident but during the evening bonnie received from the other mother threa ten ing instagram messages january,email from bonnie to perry and texts to the effect that jd playing sucked johnson dep.
the johnsons,concerned that jd and the other player,when they next met,might get into a fight see,id.at,asked to meet with millsaps,perry,and the school director of athletics,chris fulton.bonnie and jd thereafter met with millsaps and fulton,but perry did not attend.the discussion centered on jd desire to withdraw from the varsity team.according to bonnie january email to perry,millsaps did not contribute to the discussion at that meeting but after bonnie departed,millsaps met with jd alone,said she could not guarantee jd any playing time,and said she viewed the entire incident as petty.bonnie requested another meeting.
johnson,bonnie,and jd then met with fulton.perry was again invited,but did not attend.the johnsons and fulton amicably discussed jd desire to be only on the jv team,where she could play,and not to be a member of the varsity team.at that meeting,e verything was settled,meaning that jd was going to play jv,and that was it.johnson dep.
nonetheless,perry,who had declined the previous requests to attend meetings with jd and her parents,thereafter proceeded repeatedly to summon jd from her classes to meet with him in his office in the absence of her parents.in a span of five school days,perry called jd to his office four times.with fulton in attendance,perry attempted to bully jd into remaining a member of the varsity team.jd who recorded perry statements reported to her parents that perry told jd that she better suit up and he did want to hear nothing about it no more,that she was going to play varsity basketball.johnson dep.
perry actual opinion,later acknowledged at a meeting attended by perry,johnson,bonnie,jd,and the president of hartford parent teacher organization pto,was that jd basketball skills,while good,were not good enough for play at a varsity championship level johnson answer to perry interrogatory.but perry needed jd to remain on the varsity roster so that the team would be eligible to compete for the state championship see johnson dep.hence,jd was being harassed to stay on the team while being told you will be playing varsity,and i not going to guarantee you any playing time id.at.
on the night of february,the johnsons sent perry an email protesting his conduct,requesting a meeting,and demanding that he end the bullying and harassment of jd 
our names are norman and bonnie johnson parents of jd johnson.it is imperative that you acknowledge this correspondence so that this bullying and harassment discontinue.on these dates you have pulled jd out of class,and to discuss varsity basketball.after we told you that she is no longer a varsity basketball team player,due to her being targeted and harassed by coach tammy millsaps.all of which knew sic or should have known about.instead you refuse to acknowledge the phone conversations,the personal visits and written correspondence made.instead you have taken jd out of class and demand that she play varsity basketball ignoring the fact that we told you she was not to play.jd is on the junior varsity team and earning the second sports credit that is required of her.we are fully aware that jd is being pursued to sit on the bench on the varsity team in order to complete the roster.that is something she nor we desire for her to do.
please consider this as a formal request to meet with all of the above immediately.we do not expect any retaliation mistaken grades being glared at and having to defend herself against adults knowing full well she is unevenly matched.
february,email from johnson and bonnie to perry.
b.the february,meeting 
on thursday february,bonnie called perry to request a meeting.perry then called johnson to say that perry was sick and tired of hearing of bonnie requesting meetings.johnson dep.however,perry yielded when johnson said they were on their way to the school to see perry.at the school,johnson,bonnie,and jd met with perry and pto president millie arcinegas.
bonnie began by complaining of perry bullying of jd with his insistence that she remain on the varsity team and suit up despite her decision to leave the team because she never got to play.perry responded by sa ying that tha t was not bullying.millie told him that yes,it was,to which perry shrugged his shoulders,like,really johnson dep.for most of the rest of the meeting,perry repeatedly talk ed over the other participants,divert ed the conversation when asked questions,and interrupt ed johnson repeatedly.id.at.finally,johnson asked perry to answer just one question 
i asked him if it was true,if he made the following statement to my daughter you better suit up i do want to hear no more about it.you will play.
he looked me dead in my face and said,she a liar and a manipulator.
and he looked at millie and he said,you know who to believe.
i,in turn,slammed my hand and said,no,you are a liar and a manipulator,and you are full of crap.
see also id.at johnson told perry that he was full of shit.johnson testified that as he sat there after making that statement,perry jumped up and went crazy 
i sitting down just like this.it was at a round table.he jumped up and started hollering at me and going crazy and whatnot,and he said that the meeting was over.
were you sitting the whole time during the meeting 
yes,i was.he told me not to talk to him like that.i said,it was okay for you to talk to my daughter like that it was all right for you to manipulate my daughter right in front of us 
q.so how were you feeling at that meeting were you mad,happy what was going through your mind at that meeting 
i was like,i ca believe this.he made a statement,and that probably why he blew

perry bans johnson from capital prep events on or off campus 
on the following sunday,johnson received an email from perry stating that johnson was tres pa ssed from capital prep 
this letter is to inform you that as of february,you are tres pa ssed from the capital preparatory magnet school and its events,including but not limited to sports both on and off campus,with the exception of commencement exercises on may,after which the trespass will be reinstated.disregarding this correspondence by coming to school grounds or to an event in which capital prep is a participant,will result in your immediate removal.
your verbal altercations,physical intimidation and direct threats to staff have created an unsafe environment for staff,students and other parents and will no longer be tolerated.
a copy of this letter is being sent to the hartford board of education and the hartford police department as well as other communities and venues where the capital preparatory magnet school activities may occur.
february,email from perry to johnson the trespass notice emphases added.
the trespass notice did not bar johnson from contacting school staff,nor did it bar him from attending school board meetings.after receiving the trespass notice,johnson contacted several school board officials to attempt to contest it,without success even though the assistant superintendent of hartford schools,jonathan swan,said his information was that no parent had ever before been banned from the school.
as a result of the ban,johnson,when picking up his daughter by car after school,was not allowed to stop in front of the school but was required to wait down the street,even in an emergency.he was not allowed to attend jd final presentation,during her last semester,of her senior social justice project,on which she had worked hard for two years.see johnson answer to perry interrogatory.
johnson was also not allowed to attend the february senior night celebration at capital prep,an event that honored students on the school various teams.jd,no longer on the varsity team but still a member of the jv team,was relegated to the audience,rather than being honored.johnson attempted to attend the event,but before doing so,he consulted the hartford police department hpd.he was informed that it had no knowledge of the trespass notice or any restraining order against him.hpd advised johnson to go to capital prep and speak to a security guard.johnson proceeded to do that,but,while he was speaking with the guard,perry c a me running out of the gym hollering,screaming,acting like a lunatic.johnson dep.johnson attempted to explain that hpd had told him to speak to the security guard,but perry said t hat ai going to happen.i want him out of here.get out.id.johnson left.
in march,the capital prep varsity girls basketball team with jd no longer a in the state championship game,held at mohegan sun casino.johnson attempted to attend the game with his family.before doing so,he spoke to assistant school superintendent swan,who assured him that perry could not bar him from attending.nevertheless,after johnson was seated,fulton arrived and asked him to just get up and leave,telling him that if he did not,capital prep officials would have him taken out of here.johnson dep.johnson remained in place.then,after one basketball game concluded,two mohegan sun staff members instructed johnson to come with them,informing him that perry said that johnson was a threat to the community and had to leave.id.at.those men ushered johnson out of the arena,into a corridor where there were several additional security guards and a police officer with his hand on his gun,and took johnson out of the stadium area.
d.the present action 
in september,johnson brought the present action under in connecticut state court.the complaint briefly described the above events and alleged that perry actions violated johnson first amendment right of assembly,his fourteenth amendment rights to due process and equal protection,and his right to be free from intentional infliction of emotional distress or iied.perry removed the action to federal court and moved under fed.civ.b to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss the due process claim but see part.below and the equal protection claim.the court denied the motion to dismiss the first amendment claim,concluding that the complaint plausibly alleged that perry actions in barring johnson from school events were not reasonable and viewpoint neutral and it denied the motion to dismiss the iied claim,concluding that the complaint plausibly alleged facts from which a jury could find the elements of that claim proven.see johnson perry,wl,johnson i.although the court dismissed the due process and equal protection claims with leave to amend,johnson did not file an amended complaint.
following completion of the pleadings and discovery,perry moved for summary judgment dismissing johnson surviving first amendment and iied claims.to the extent pertinent to this appeal,perry argued that he was entitled to summary judgment dismissing the first amendment claim on the basis of his defense of qualified immunity.perry filed a statement,pursuant to.local rule,of material facts as to which he contended there was no genuine issue to be tried perry rule statement,stating that johnson at the february meeting yelled at perry and told him he was full of shit rule statement and that johnson had previously had confront ations with millsaps and a parent id,and quoting the text of perry trespass notice see id.the rule statement did not,however,contain a factual assertion that johnson ever threatened anyone.perry inquiry at his deposition as to whom the trespass notice claimed he had threatened or intimidated see johnson dep.had gone unanswered see generally perry rule statement.
in johnson perry,d johnson ii,the district court denied perry summary judgment motion,stating in part as follows 
the right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental.de jonge state of oregon.
a school is generally considered a nonpublic forum,as it is a property that is not traditionally open to the public for communication.t he government enjoys greater latitude in restricting speech in a nonpublic forum and may limit access or content based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.byrne rutledge,cir.however,there is no categorical rule that the interests of a school in safety and order always outweigh constitutional rights.while i t is clear a public school has a compelling interest in maintaining order and ensuring safety on its grounds restrictions on the first amendment rights of parents and other members of the public must be reasonable 
here,defendant argues that the ban was reasonable and viewpoint neutral because it was justified by defendant concern that plaintiff posed a danger to the staff and children at the school.however,whether plaintiff posed a danger to staff and children at the school is a disputed fact.equally disputed is whether defendant banned plaintiff from school property based on a disagreement with the message plaintiff was conveying.that plaintiff comments may have caused discomfort on the part of school staff,or may have been the subject of disagreement can not justify governmental restriction or suppression based on those comments.see tinker des moines independent community school,d in order for the state in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion,it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.
defendant argues in the alternative that plaintiff has no first amendment right to attend school events.although the first amendment does not guarantee unfettered access to school grounds,this argument can not trump the requirement that restrictions on assembly and speech be reasonable and viewpoint neutral 
johnson ii,d at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.
the court concluded that if johnson version of the events were credited by the factfinder,his first amendment right was sufficiently clearly established that perry would not be entitled to qualified immunity 
viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,a narrow view of the facts also establishes that plaintiff rights were defined with reasonable specificity under existing law such that a reasonable official would have understood that his acts were unlawful.
indeed,plaintiff first amendment rights would be violated if defendant banned plaintiff from participation in his daughter public school education merely because defendant disagreed with plaintiff viewpoint or because of arbitrary bias this is the story that plaintiff will tell.defendant will contend that,in his opinion,plaintiff intimidating behavior was so threatening that defendant decision to implement such a ban was reasonable and viewpoint neutral as genuinely disputed factual issues material to the qualified immunity defense exist,qualified immunity will be denied.
id.at emphases added.
as discussed in greater detail in part.below,the district court,in addition to ruling on perry summary judgment motion,revisited and rescinded its prior dismissal of johnson due process claim.the court sua sponte reinstated that claim,concluding that a cause of action was stated.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,perry pursues his arguments,made in the district court,that he is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity with respect to johnson first amendment claim.he contends a that banning johnson from capital prep events did not violate johnson first amendment right of assembly,or b that if it did,that right was not clearly established at the time the ban was imposed.in addition,he contends that excluding johnson from school events without any hearing did not violate johnson liberty interest in directing his daughter education and that a parent had no clearly established liberty interest in having access to school property.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that perry challenges to the district court decision to reinstate and entertain johnson due process claim are not properly before us.as to the challenges to johnson first amendment claim,we conclude that perry was not entitled to summary judgment for barring johnson from attending capital prep events held beyond school property or attending sports contests on school property to which the public was invited,but was entitled to qualified immunity for banning johnson from school property otherwise.
a.the issues addressable on the present appeal 
the issues to be addressed in this appeal are cabined by three sets of principles those governing the required contents of the notice of appeal,the required contents of the appellant brief,and the applicability of the final judgment rule,see,to denials of motions for summary judgment.
the due process claim and perry notice of appeal 
the federal rules of appellate procedure frap rules provide that the appellant notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.app.c b.this requirement for specificity in a notice of appeal refers to the relief granted or denied by the district court,mckinley insurance corning,cir,and the contents of the notice of appeal define the scope of the appellate court jurisdiction,see,sheng ank,cir.sheng kovaco cable,cir.kovaco new phone city of new york,cir.kowsh board of elections,cir.kowsh.
in kovaco,the notice of appeal stated that the plaintiff appealed from an order granting summary judgment on his claims of discrimination under three statutes that were listed in the notice.we concluded that we did not have jurisdiction to review the dismissal of a claim the plaintiff had brought under a fourth,unmentioned,statute.see at.in sheng,which involved federal and claims of disability discrimination,the district court,after the close of evidence at trial,had dismissed as a matter of law the claim brought under the new york state human rights law nyshrl.after the jury found in favor of the defendant on the remaining claims,the plaintiff appealed,filing a notice of appeal stating that the appeal was taken from the jury verdict entered in th e action,at emphasis in sheng.we concluded that the appeal did not encompass the court dismissal of the nyshrl claim.see id.in kowsh,the notice of appeal stated that the plaintiffs appealed from the memorandum and judgment of the district court reversing the magistrate judge r ecommendation that an injunction be issued placing julio ramirez on the ballot for the november,general elections.at internal quotation marks omitted.when the plaintiffs sought to argue on appeal not only that the injunction should have been granted,but also that the voter plaintiffs should be allowed to vote in a certain election district and that ramirez claim for damages should not have been dismissed,we concluded that only so much of the district court judgment as denied an injunction placing ramirez name on the ballot wa s properly before us.id.
in the present case,as indicated in part above,johnson complaint asserted four claims violations of his first amendment right of assembly,his fourteenth amendment right to due process,and his fourteenth amendment right to equal protection,and his iied claim.in in johnson i,the district court,pursuant to rule b,dismissed johnson equal protection and due process claims.
perry subsequently moved for summary judgment,noting that since the equal protection and due process claims had been dismissed,his motion for summary judgment is thus directed to the remaining counts of the complaint count one,which alleges first amendment violations peaceful assembly,and count four,which sounds in intentional infliction of emotional distress.defendant memorandum of law in support of motion for summary judgment at perry sj memorandum.in,the district court denied the summary judgment motion.see johnson ii,d at.
in addition,the court reinstated johnson due process claim sua sponte 
the court dismissed plaintiff due process claim without prejudice to amend his complaint to add allegations that attendance at school events is a right protected by law.plaintiff declined to amend,but the court now holds,sua sponte,that plaintiff complaint,which alleges that defendant banned plaintiff from all school events,except commencement,implicated the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of his child.
id.at see id.at although the state has authority to restrict school access to ensure a safe and productive environment,it may not so significantly prohibit an individual parent from normal school access without affording the parent a fundamentally fair opportunity to contest the state asserted reasons for doing so.the court stated that t he parties may submit a revised case management schedule within days to allow for further discovery or additional dispositive motion practice on the due process count.id.at.
perry thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal that stated as follows 
notice is hereby given that stephen perry,the defendant in the case,hereby appeals to the court of appeals for the second circuit from the memorandum of decision denying defendant motion for summary judgment doc.issued by judge warren eginton entered in this action on the day of october.
emphasis added.as this notice neither stated that perry wished to challenge all parts of the district court order nor mentioned the court revival and continuation of johnson due process claim sua sponte,but instead expressly referred to the denial of perry motion for summary judgment,we can not infer that the notice encompassed any ruling by the district court other than that denying his summary judgment motion.
we note that perry subsequently indicated as part of his form c documents in this court that he would ask us to consider the due process claim.we would deem that document to be a further,amended,notice of appeal if it had been filed within the days allowed by fed.app.a a for the filing of a notice of appeal,see generally smith barry,if a document filed within the time specified by rule gives the notice required by rule,it is effective as a notice of appeal.however,perry form c was filed beyond the rule deadline.frap rule establishes mandatory time limits for filing a notice of appeal,gonzalez thaler,and time limits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as jurisdictional in american law for well over a century,bowles russell.
we conclude that the district court treatment of johnson due process claim is not within the scope of perry notice of appeal,and we thus lack jurisdiction to review that decision.
the iied claim and perry brief 
in contrast,perry notice of appeal does encompass the denial of his motion to dismiss johnson claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,since that was one of the two claims as to which perry moved for summary judgment.however,the frap rules provide that with respect to each issue on which appellate relief is sought,the appellant brief on appeal must set out,inter alia,the appellant contentions and his reasons,along with citations to the authorities and the parts of the record on which the appellant relies.see fed.app.a.
in his brief on this appeal,perry presents only arguments with respect to the constitutional claims perry brief on appeal at,and none with respect to the iied claim.thus,even if the denial of perry motion for summary judgment dismissing the iied claim a motion not based on qualified immunity were immediately appealable,any challenge to the district court failure to dismiss that claim has been abandoned,see generally otero bridgeport housing authority,cir.day morgenthau,cir.fed.app.a.
the first amendment claim and the proper scope of review 
ordinarily,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable because such a decision is not a final judgment,see.under the collateral order doctrine,however,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is immediately appealable to the extent that the merits of the defense can be decided as a matter of law,although not to the extent that the defense will depend on the resolution of questions of fact.see,behrens pelletier,johnson jones,mitchell forsyth,ex rel.estate of vargo,cir.martinez simonetti,cir.w here the district court has denied a motion for summary judgment on the ground that there are triable issues as to which party version of the facts is to be accepted,a defendant may pursue an immediate appeal if he adopts the plaintiff version of the facts,contending that the facts asserted by the plaintiff entitle the defendant to the defense of qualified immunity as a matter of law,at quoting salim proulx,cir.
as described in part above,the district court in the present case found that perry entitlement to qualified immunity will depend on which version of the facts the jury accepts.perry pursues this appeal on the premise that he is entitled to qualified immunity even on johnson view of the facts.it is only on that basis,that johnson version of the facts is correct that we have jurisdiction over perry challenge to the denial of summary judgment on johnson first amendment claim.we proceed on that basis.and,as usual,in reviewing the denial of summary judgment,we will resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment was sought,see,anderson liberty lobby.
qualified immunity principles 
the doctrine of q ualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.reichle howards,see,anderson creighton,rogoz city of hartford,cir.rogoz.
w hen a defendant official invokes qualified immunity as a defense in order to support a motion for summary judgment,a court must consider two questions whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,makes out a violation of a statutory or constitutional right,and whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.
tracy freshwater,cir.tracy see,saucier katz,modified by pearson callahan.we are entitled to exercise our sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first.tracy,at quoting pearson,at.
the second prong of the standard means that officials are entitled to qualified immunity when their decision was reasonable,even if mistaken,hunter bryant,which protect s all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,id.quoting malley briggs.against a background of clearly established law,the availability of qualified immunity generally turns on the defendant conduct objective legal reasonableness.anderson creighton,at quoting harlow fitzgerald.
qualified immunity is an affirmative defense on which the defendant has the burden of proof,either at trial or on a motion for summary judgment.see,gomez toledo,rogoz,at.summary judgment on this basis is available if,with the facts taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the alleged constitutional right either was not violated or was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.see,anderson creighton,at rogoz,at tracy,at.
the operation of the clearly established standard depends substantially upon the level of generality at which the relevant legal rule is to be identified.anderson creighton,at.the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.at.however,
t his is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.
t he unconstitutionality of outrageous conduct obviously will be unconstitutional,this being the reason,as judge posner has said,that t he easiest cases do even arise.morgan.but even as to action less than an outrage,officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law in novel factual circumstances.

first amendment principles 
the first amendment prohibits the government from abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press,and guarantees the right of the people peaceably to assemble.const.amend.the right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental.de jonge oregon.o f all constitutional rights,the freedoms of speech and of assembly are the most perishable,yet the most vital to the preservation of american democracy.wolff selective service local board,cir.see,thomas collins,it was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances.all these,though not identical,are inseparable.
g overnment officials may stop or disperse public demonstrations or protests where clear and present danger of riot,disorder,interference with traffic upon the public streets,or other immediate threat to public safety,peace,or order,appears.papineau parmley,cir.papineau quoting cantwell connecticut,emphases ours.however,f ear of serious injury can not alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly.to justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced.united states national treasury employees union,internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.the first and fourteenth amendments do not permit a state to make criminal the exercise of the right of assembly simply because its exercise may be annoying to some people.coates city of cincinnati,internal quotation marks omitted.
nonetheless,n othing in the constitution requires the government freely to grant access to all who wish to exercise their right to free speech on every type of government property without regard to the nature of the property or to the disruption that might be caused by the speaker activities.cornelius naacp legal defense educational fund.where there is no clear and present danger,speech restrictions imposed on persons on property are analyzed under a approach that divides government property into three principal categories the traditional public forum,the designated public forum,and the nonpublic forum,byrne rutledge,cir,along with a subset of the designated public forum,referred to as the limited public forum,id.at internal quotation marks omitted see,peck ex rel.peck baldwinsville central school district,cir.peck,cert.denied,make the road by walking,turner,cir.make the road.t he level of judicial scrutiny that must be applied to state actions inhibiting speech varies with the nature of the forum in which the speech occurs,peck,at,and the same analytical framework applies whether the first amendment right being exercised is speech,as in peck,or other expressive activity such as assembly,see,travis school district,cir.travis.
traditional public forums include areas such as streets and parks which have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly as to a traditional public forum,the state may not enact c restrictions unless they are necessary to serve a compelling state interest.peck,at quoting make the road,at.
a designated public forum is a place that,although not traditionally open for public assembly and debate,the government has taken affirmative steps to open for general public discourse.peck,at internal quotation marks omitted see,cornelius,at the government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.speech in a designated public forum is entitled to the same constitutional protection as that extended to expression in a traditional public forum,so long as the state continues to designate the forum for such use.peck,at.however,the government may decide to close a designated public forum.make the road,at.
a limited public forum is created when the state opens a forum but limits the expressive activity to certain kinds of speakers or to the discussion of certain subjects.peck,at internal quotation marks omitted.in a limited public forum,regulations governing the content of speech are allowed,so long as they are reasonable and.id.
a nonpublic forum is one that is neither traditionally open to public expression nor designated for such expression by the state in such a forum,as in a limited public forum,content regulations are allowed if they are reasonable and.id.internal quotation marks omitted see,lamb chapel center moriches union free school district,c ontrol over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.quoting cornelius,at travis,at government may not suppress expression merely because it opposes the speaker point of view.
johnson first amendment claim 
although johnson complaint alleges deprivation of his first amendment right of peaceable assembly in a single cause of action,his claim has multiple aspects johnson complains that perry barred him from events except may,commencement exercises on school property,from sports events on school property,and from all school events beyond school property.each aspect warrants particularized analysis.
access to school property in general 
while it has long been established that parents have a liberty interest in directing their children education without unreasonable interference by the states,see,meyer nebraska,pierce society of sisters,see also wisconsin yoder,upholding parents right,under the first amendment free exercise clause,to decline to send children to school past eighth grade,precedents as to whether a parent has a first amendment right of access to school property are scarce.if such a right exists and we conclude that in some circumstances it does see part.below it is not limitless.
in the context of the special characteristics of the school environment,the government has the power to prohibit actions which materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.associational activities need not be tolerated where they infringe reasonable campus rules,interrupt classes,or substantially interfere with the opportunity of other students to obtain an education.
