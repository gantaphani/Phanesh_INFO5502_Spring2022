the opinion filed on august,is hereby withdrawn and replaced by this concurrently filed opinion.the petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot.
appellants truth,sarice undis,and julianne stewart collectively,truth appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the kent school district and other appellees collectively,district.truth alleges violations of the equal access act the act,the first amendment rights of free speech and expressive association,the free exercise clause,the establishment clause,and the equal protection clause.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse and remand.
this appeal arises from truth attempt to form a student club at kentridge high school kentridge,which is part of the kent school district.under the relevant policies at kentridge,u nchartered clubs are not permitted to exist.to obtain a charter,students must submit a proposed charter to the associated student body asb council and secure approval.
beginning in the fall semester of,appellants undis,then a junior,and stewart,then a sophomore,attempted to form a bible club at kentridge.undis and stewart submitted a club charter application first charter for official recognition as an asb organization in september.this first charter indicated that the club name was to be truth and that the purpose of the organization was to have a bible study to encourage and help become better people with good morals.under the section membership criteria,the first charter indicated that the group was to be o pen to anyone.the charter also proposed that it would designate a quote of the week for announcement and once a month decorate the school with a theme.
the asb council discussed truth first charter at a september meeting,and several students objected to chartering truth.the asb council decided to consult with the assistant principal,appellee eric anderson.anderson and appellee mike albrecht,principal of kentridge,later told undis that they would speak with the school attorney regarding the legality of granting truth asb recognition.albrecht stated that the problem with the september proposal was that it involved broadcasting a weekly bible quote over the school public address system and monthly decoration of the school in a biblical theme.
no action was taken on the first charter for the remainder of the school year.during that time,undis asked anderson to make a decision on truth application on at least ten occasions,to no avail.sometime in the spring semester of,all asb clubs were instructed to resubmit their charters.the record does not reveal any further activity on truth application during the summer and fall semesters of.
during this period,we decided prince jacoby,which involved a request by a bible club for asb recognition in a different washington school district.cir.on january,an attorney for truth,robert tyler,wrote to albrecht stating that it was constitutionally imperative that kentridge grant appellants proposed bible club treatment and rights equal to all other noncurriculum clubs.the letter also insisted that kentridge immediately adhere to the requirements of the equal access act and the first amendment,and threatened litigation if kentridge did not comply.
on january,tyler sent a second letter to michael harrington,counsel for the kent school district.tyler requested the forms required to establish an asb club,and threatened litigation if truth charter was not approved by february.
on february,as requested by anderson,undis and stewart submitted a new application second charter.the second charter removed the and monthly theme decoration provisions of the first charter.the club stated purpose was now to provid e a club for those students interested in growing in their relationship with jesus christ.although membership would be open to all students,the second charter restricted voting membership to members professing belief in the bible and in jesus christ.officers would also be required to believe in and be committed to biblical principles.
after a third letter to harrington from tyler,the second charter was discussed at an asb council meeting on march.some students expressed disapproval of the club name,suggesting that it implies that every other religion at kentridge is a lie.some council members also expressed concerns that granting the charter would violate c hurch and state and that the voting membership should be open to everyone.additionally,members suggested that students could go to young life,a recognized organization that met on kentridge campus after school hours.the minutes of the march meeting reveal that the question of whether to approve the second charter was discussed for twenty minutes.no vote was taken.
the second charter was next addressed at an asb council meeting on april.after a brief clarification on the role of the advisor for the club,the minutes show that anderson stated that if the asb council voted to approve the charter,he would consult the district attorneys and kentridge would make a final decision on approving the charter.the counsel voted eleven to six against approval of truth second charter.
on april,truth filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of washington,alleging that defendants had violated the act,as well as the first amendment rights of free speech and expressive association,the free exercise clause,the establishment clause,and the equal protection clause.truth sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as nominal damages.
on april,anderson sent stewart a letter informing her of her right to resubmit truth application for asb club recognition as was discussed at the asb meeting on march,by making minor changes to article s i and iii of the proposed constitution for your club,you will address the points raised.article i sets forth the name of the club and article iii contains the voting membership and officer restrictions.anderson advised stewart to be prepared to resubmit by the april asb meeting.under the kentridge asb constitution,a ny rejected charters must be resubmitted within two weeks of rejection with the required changes made or the charter shall be permanently rejected.
stewart and undis submitted the third charter on april.the third charter maintains the proposed name truth.however,it divides the membership into three categories voting members,members,and attendees.meetings are open to everyone.but the privilege of membership is contingent upon the member complying in good faith with christian character,christian speech,christian behavior and christian conduct as generally described in the bible.the charter application also lists a true desire to grow in a relationship with jesus christ under the membership criteria heading.in order to be a voting member or officer,students are required to sign a statement of faith.the statement of faith requires the person to affirm that he or she believes the bible to be the inspired,the only infallible,authoritative word of god.a voting member must also pledge that he or she believes that salvation is an undeserved gift from god,and that only by acceptance of jesus christ as my personal savior,through his death on the cross for my sins,is my faith made real.other than the ability to call oneself a member,there is no difference between the rights of members and attendees.
the third charter was discussed at the april asb council meeting.the asb council again objected to the name,selectivity provisions,and the presence of religion in school.the council voted nineteen to zero to deny approval of the charter,with one member undecided.the minutes give four reasons why the charter was not accepted name,pledge to vote,segregating,religious club in school.
on may,tyler wrote to the kent school district counsel stating that it was his understanding from the asb constitution that this rejection by the asb is the final decision.the letter also provided that tyler was unable to locate any rights to appeal the decision of the asb,but that if there were a right to appeal the decision of the asb,he asked that the letter serve as a formal request for appeal.
anderson advised undis and stewart in a may letter that pursuant to kent school district policy,they had the ability to discuss this matter with albrecht,and mentioned the possibility of discussions with the district superintendent or the ombudservices office.although tyler may letter would appear to have invoked these processes,no further action was taken by the district.policy concerns religious related activities or practices.the policy does not refer to asb recognition,and the asb constitution does not refer to this policy as providing an avenue for an appeal of the district decisions,which are otherwise final.
although undis and stewart have both graduated from kentridge,they have indicated that another student,lindsay thomas,is prepared to assume leadership of the club if the charter is approved.
the kent school district has three policies relevant to this appeal.first,policy provides that t he district will provide equal educational opportunity and treatment for all students in all aspects of the academic and activities program.equal opportunity and treatment is provided without regard to race,creed,color,national origin,sex,marital status,previous arrest,incarceration,or physical,sensory or mental disabilities.the district court held that inclusion of creed indicates that discrimination based upon religion is prohibited.that ruling has not been challenged on appeal.
second,policy provides for,non asb student groups,which groups the principal shall approve provided they meet several additional requirements,such as that they do not disrupt the school environment.while policy groups may meet on school grounds before or after school,these groups do not receive other benefits accorded only to student clubs.most significantly,only groups may receive asb funding and engage in purchasing through the kent school district finance department.each asb club is provided with a faculty advisor or adult advisor designee,who must be present at all club meetings and assists in the planning and handling of the club affairs.asb clubs are also allowed to conduct meetings during noninstructional time,advertise their activities in school,use the public address system,and are recognized in the school yearbook.the district states that truth is free to operate as a private policy group,but argues that truth was properly denied asb recognition.
third,policy regulates religious related activities or practices,and provides guidelines for schools addressing religious holidays,symbols,ceremonies,topics,activities,and beliefs.this policy also provides that s tudents,parents,and employees who are aggrieved by practices or activities conducted in the school or district may seek resolution of their concern first with the building principal,then with the district superintendent or designee,or use ombudservices,which is available through the legal services department.
washington state also has a relevant law,which the district relies on to justify its denial of asb recognition for truth.in,washington revised code west provided that 
it shall be an unfair practice for any person or the person agent or employee to commit an act which directly or indirectly results in any distinction,restriction,or discrimination,or the refusing or withholding from any person the admission,patronage,custom,presence,frequenting,dwelling,staying,or lodging in any place of public resort,accommodation,assemblage,or amusement,except for conditions and limitations established by law and applicable to all persons,regardless of race,creed,color,national origin,sexual orientation,sex,the presence of any sensory,mental,or physical disability,or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a disabled person.
the district has argued that these policies require it to deny asb recognition to truth.
as of april,there were thirty clubs at kentridge.while the record does not contain the charters of all the clubs,it appears that many of them have selective membership criteria.indeed,each charter application contains a section for membership criteria.
the earthcorps,for example,requires members to show interest and dedication toward environmental issues.similarly,the key club requires that members be interested in service,qualified scholastically,of good character,possessing leadership potential and willing to perform at least fifty hours of service.the alliance requires that students must be willing to work towards the goals of the club to be members.these goals include bring ing glbtq gay,lesbian,bisexual,transgendered,and questioning issues into the open,while working to decrease homophobia.other goals include changing stereotypes and fight ing heterosexism and other forms of oppression.the national honor society selects its members based on outstanding scholarship,character,leadership,and service,and requires them to behave in a courteous and respectful manner,refraining from language and actions that might bring discredit upon themselves.it also requires members to refrain from using or possessing alcohol or illegal substances.participation in school sports requires maintaining a certain grade point average and attendance record,not using drugs or alcohol,and complying with the sports code.finally,a men honor club and a girl honor club also operate at kentridge as groups.each club has membership.
the district court entered summary judgment on all of truth claims under monell department of social services,d,with the exception of the act claim.the court held that the requirements of municipal liability under were not satisfied,and therefore entered summary judgment in favor of the district.it also held that the actions against the individual defendants in their official capacities were functionally equivalent to suits directly against the municipality,and therefore truth claims against them failed.
the district court ruled on the merits of the act and some of the first amendment claims,addressing the latter as an alternate holding if its monell ruling were to be reversed.it held that the restrictions on general membership in the third charter constituted a legitimate basis for denying the third charter and that these claims therefore failed.
the district court did not rule on the remaining claims based on its belief that plaintiffs cursory equal protection clause,establishment clause,and free exercise clause arguments are all subsumed within their first amendment argument.the district court also did not address the district argument that granting asb recognition to truth would violate the establishment clause.
on appeal,both sides agree that only the third charter is before us.truth makes this concession even though this action was filed before the third charter and its complaint only addresses the denial of its second charter.
this appeal requires us to review many determinations by the district court.as to each issue,we review de novo.we review a district court summary judgment de novo.see buono norton,cir.in determining whether summary judgment was appropriate,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to truth,the party.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.id.we also review de novo the district court monell rulings,see doe lebbos,cir,its decision regarding the scope of a constitutional right,see united states napier,cir,and its interpretation of the act,see sec mccarthy,cir.
before addressing the merits,we consider our jurisdiction.the district argues that truth lacks standing under city of los angeles lyons,d,because truth has failed to meet the likelihood of recurrence requirement.the district asserts that truth can not say the asb or the district will always deny another club application or even the same application.
in order to establish article iii standing,
a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.although the district has not made any arguments regarding these specific factors,we have an independent obligation to address whether we have jurisdiction.see dittman california,cir.a t the summary judgment stage the plaintiffs need not establish that they in fact have standing,but only that there is a genuine question of material fact as to the standing elements.cent.delta water agency united states,cir.
with respect to injunctive relief,the supreme court has also required that a plaintiff show that he is realistically threatened by a repetition of the violation.lyons,at.the plaintiff need only establish that there is a reasonable expectation that his conduct will recur,triggering the alleged harm he need not show that such recurrence is probable.jones city of los angeles,cir,citing honig doe,d.while we have extended this requirement to declaratory relief,see gest bradbury,cir,it does not apply to monetary damages,see lyons,at.the district standing argument therefore does not implicate truth standing to seek nominal damages.
the district asserts that the establishment clause,state law,and its own policies mandate that it deny asb recognition to truth.if the district believes that three independent and binding legal authorities compel it to deny truth application,we do not see how the district might approve the same or a similar charter request in the future.
the district written policies also support truth standing arguments.we have held that plaintiffs may demonstrate that an injury is likely to recur by showing that the defendant had a written policy,and that the injury stems from that policy.where the harm alleged is directly traceable to a written policy there is an implicit likelihood of its repetition in the immediate future.fortyune am,cir internal quotations and alterations omitted.here,the harm is traceable to the district policies,which the district has argued compel it to deny asb recognition to truth.
additionally,despite tyler request that the district treat his letter as a formal request for appeal,the district took no action.this is evidence that another charter request is likely to meet the same fate as the previous three.finally,the district has provided nothing beyond its own speculation that the outcome might be different if truth submitted a fourth charter.the legal positions it has taken in this litigation strongly suggest that no similar applications will ever be approved.
under these circumstances,we conclude that truth has established at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there is a reasonable expectation that the alleged injury will recur.therefore,truth has standing to seek each of its requested forms of relief.
the district also suggests that this dispute is not ripe for review,and that we thus lack jurisdiction,because truth did not bring the dispute to the kent school district board or superintendent through policy.the district is wrong.the supreme court has explicitly held that exhaustion is not required for claims brought under.see steffel thompson,d.exhaustion can not be dispositive under a ripeness analysis otherwise ripeness doctrine would impose a de facto exhaustion requirement,in violation of steffel.thus,the alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies may be at most only a factor in the ripeness analysis.
nevertheless,it appears that truth did exhaust the formal appeal system.tyler may letter to the district counsel asked that the letter serve as a formal request for appeal.the district has not provided any reason why this notification was not sufficient to trigger its appeals process,and no reason is apparent in the record.the district failure to take any action as a result of this request does not indicate that truth failed to bring the matter to the attention of the district.under these circumstances,there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether truth exhausted the district grievance procedures.
nearly every other factor suggests that this case is ripe for decision.under the kentridge asb constitution,a ny rejected charters must be resubmitted within two weeks of rejection with the required changes made or the charter shall be permanently rejected.the asb constitution neither provides for any additional review,nor suggests that the asb council decision lacked finality.
furthermore,there is no doubt that the effects of the denial of truth charter have been felt in a concrete way by the appellants.truth members have experienced three denials of their applications,as well as protracted delays in obtaining any action from the asb council and district.the harm that truth has complained of does not rest upon contingent future events or ones that may not occur at all.texas united states,d internal quotation omitted.instead,truth complains of discrete events that have already occurred.
finally,in evaluating ripeness,courts assess both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.ass of am.med.colls.united states,cir internal quotation omitted.we conclude the hardship to truth in denying adjudication outweighs the hardship to the district in deciding this appeal.truth application for asb recognition languished for nearly sixteen months without any significant action being taken,and the asb process appears to have stalled until truth obtained counsel and threatened to sue.more than five years have passed since the submission of the first charter,and declining to decide this appeal now would present a significant hardship to appellants.
by contrast,the hardship to the district is significantly less severe.the district has been aware of truth arguments for a long time and has had ample opportunity to take corrective action or change its policies,if it so desired.its legal positions on appeal show that it does not believe any remedial action is appropriate and that it believes the denial of asb recognition was proper.we therefore conclude that this case is ripe for decision.
we must also consider the district court ruling that the requirements of monell are not met.monell permits section actions against municipalities,but requires plaintiffs to show that their injuries resulted from execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.at.monell requirements do not apply where the plaintiffs only seek prospective relief,which is the case here.see chaloux killeen,cir.the district acknowledges the controlling effect of chaloux,but argues that it should be overruled because it rests on shaky grounds.
it is well established in our circuit that while 
a three judge panel normally can not overrule a decision of a prior panel on a controlling question of law,we may overrule prior circuit authority without taking the case en banc when an intervening supreme court decision undermines an existing precedent of the ninth circuit,and both cases are closely on point.
galbraith county of santa clara,cir internal citation and quotations omitted.the district argues that two supreme court cases,board of county commissioners of bryan county brown,d,and mcmillian monroe county,d,show that the supreme court has the importance and vitality of the doctrine that requires a municipal policy as a precondition to a lawsuit under.neither of these cases addresses whether monell applies to actions only seeking prospective relief.we have no authority to overrule chaloux.chaloux applies,and the district court monell ruling is reversed.
relying on its policies,the district points to three aspects of truth third charter that justify its decision to deny the club asb recognition the general membership restrictions,the leadership and voting membership restrictions,and the name truth.the district court granted summary judgment based only on the first justification,and explicitly declined to reach the other two.accordingly,we too limit our analysis to the general membership restrictions.so long as the district had at least one permissible basis for rejecting truth charter,the district court properly granted summary judgment,and we need not address the district remaining justifications.
we begin our analysis by considering whether the district violated the act.if we determine that it did not,we then move on to consider whether the district actions ran afoul of the first amendment.see prince jacoby,cir we consider each of prince access claims separately,first under the act,and then the first amendment,to the extent we find them outside the scope of the act.
states have the constitutional authority to enact legislation prohibiting invidious discrimination.see roberts united states jaycees,d reviewing the history of state laws and observing that a state enjoys broad authority to create rights of public access on behalf of its citizens.truth asserts that it does not discriminate based on religion in violation of the plain language of the district policies,but rather imposes a code of conduct not unlike those of other approved asb clubs.even assuming that would be able to comply with truth view of christian character,christian speech,christian behavior and christian conduct,we hold that the requirement that members possess a true desire to grow in a relationship with jesus christ inherently excludes.
having determined that the third charter violates the district policies,we are led to hold that the district denial of asb recognition on this account would be consistent with the act.the act requires schools that have created a limited open forum to grant religious clubs benefits and privileges afforded to all other clubs.see bd.of educ.of the westside cmty.schs.mergens,d prince,at t he term equal access means what the supreme court said in widmar vincent,d student activities must be allowed under the same terms and conditions as other extracurricular activities.prince held that the rights protected under the act include equal access to some of the benefits associated with asb status,including asb funding and public communication techniques.at.the district does not argue that it is not required under the act to provide equal access to the asb program.
in interpreting the act,we begin with its plain language.where the intent of congress has been expressed in reasonably plain terms,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.where there may be uncertainty,however,we rely on the supreme court direction that the act is to be interpreted broadly,mergens,at,as well as cases deciding analogous issues under the first amendment.hsu roslyn union free sch.dist,cir adopting similar approach.
by its plain terms,the act prevents only denials of access or fair opportunity or discrimination on the basis of the religious,political,philosophical,or other content of the speech at a club meetings.a.therefore,once it is established that the secondary school receives federal funds and has created a limited open forum,the club must demonstrate two additional elements to prevail a denial of equal access,or fair opportunity,or discrimination that is based on the content of the speech at its meetings.
the district denied truth asb status,at least in part,based on its discriminatory membership criteria,not the religious content of the speech.the act does not define content of the speech,but that phrase has a particular meaning in first amendment jurisprudence.we have held that whether a statute is content neutral or content based is something that can be determined on the face of it if the statute describes speech by content then it is content based.menotti city of seattle,cir quotations and citation omitted.similarly,a restriction on expressive activity is if it is based on a reason divorced from the content of the message attempted to be conveyed.id.quotations and citation omitted.
the act,through which congress extended the reasoning of the supreme court decision in widmar vincent to secondary schools,see mergens,at,tracks widmar emphasis on discrimination based on the content of the plaintiff speech.widmar struck down a state university regulation prohibiting the use of university buildings or grounds for purposes of religious worship or religious teaching,d.widmar thus precluded a university discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based on the religious content of a group intended speech,id.at,but not its right to exclude first amendment activities that violate reasonable campus rules.id.at.likewise,the act prevents a school unreasonable limitation on the conduct of a club to the extent the limitation is justified with reference to the expressive content of the regulated conduct.ward rock against racism,d government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech internal quotations and citation omitted.
congress could have written the act to protect religious clubs against a burden on their speech or activities,but did not.for example,when congress passed the religious land use and institutionalized persons act,it not only prohibited discrimination against religious groups as such but also limited governments abilities to impose even neutral,nondiscriminatory policies against them 
no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,including a religious assembly or institution,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,assembly,or institution 
a is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 
b is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
a.thus,congress knows how to draft a statute placing otherwise laws of general applicability that incidentally burden a first amendment activity under the same judicial scrutiny as laws specifically targeting the religious content of a group expression.see guru nanak sikh soc y of yuba city county of sutter,cir.that is not the case here.the act clearly allows exclusions that are not content based.
the act legislative history strengthens our conclusion that it prohibits only restrictions on religious groups.the legislative history focuses on congress intent to end school districts previous practices of treating religious groups inequitably and forbidding them from meeting on campus.see,at,despite widmar,many school administrators across the country are prohibiting voluntary,religious speech as an e xtracurricular activity id.at,at s chool authorities across the country are banishing religious clubs from campus or placing such onerous restrictions on them that meetings become almost impossible.the senate report recognized the possibility that religious groups like truth might claim that policies regulating club membership violate the act,and disclaimed any such intent 
at the same time,the guarantee of equal access does not require special treatment for religious groups.religious groups are accorded only the same rights and privileges as are granted to other student groups.in practice,however,this means that not all student groups would receive exactly the same privileges.there could be many neutral and impartial time,place,and manner restrictions placed on the use of school facilities which might produce situations in which some voluntary groups would not receive precisely the same access received by others the access determination could not be made,however,on the basis that the nature of the activity was religious.
id.at,at.the district policies are not time,place or manner restrictions.but like such restrictions,the policies are.this strongly suggests that congress did not intend the act to apply to policies.
the parties do not dispute that the kent school district receives federal funding,or that kentridge has created a limited open forum for extracurricular student groups.the district contests,however,whether the act guarantee of equal access,fair opportunity,and protects truth freedom to exclude those who do not share christian values from its general membership.on their face,the district policies do not preclude or discriminate against religious speech.truth also has not shown that the district justifies its policies with reference to the content of a message truth discriminatory conduct may attempt to convey.the
