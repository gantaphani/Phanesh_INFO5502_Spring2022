we consider the interplay between the first amendment and the right to be free of workplace harassment on the basis of protected status.
professor walter kehowski sent three emails over a distribution list maintained by the maricopa county community college district,where he teaches math.every district employee with an email address received a copy.plaintiffs,a certified class of the district hispanic employees,sued the district,its governing board and two district administrators the chancellor and the president claiming that their failure to properly respond to kehowski emails created a hostile work environment in violation of title vii and the equal protection clause.
kehowski first email had dia de la raza as its subject line and asked,why is the district endorsing an explicitly racist event citations and emphasis omitted.d a de la raza translates as day of the race and is celebrated by some hispanics instead of columbus day 
kehowski next email,sent almost a week later,began,yes today columbus day it time to acknowledge and celebrate the superiority of western civilization.kehowski then offered excerpts from a variety of articles.one article quoted arthur schlesinger,as saying that democracy,human rights and cultural freedom are european ideas.another promoted a theory that native americans actually committed genocide against the original inhabitants of north america.emphasis omitted.yet another argued that america did not become the mightiest nation on earth without distinct values and discrimination and asserted that o ur survival depends on discrimination.
two days later,kehowski sent a third email that began,ad hominem attacks are the easiest to launch and the most difficult to defend against.kehowski quoted an email calling his messages racist and said to you too racist hardly.realistic is more like it.he quoted an email claiming that m ost thinking people believe that the european,christian victory over the moorish,islamic and african culture in spain is an example of a victory of a backward culture over one that was more civilized.he responded h istory has answered quite convincingly which cultures were backward.and he warned i f we do pull ourselves out of the multicultural stupor,another culture with some pretty unsavory characteristics here,here,and here will dominate here,here,and here and not without a little help from the treasonous scum bill clinton.bracketed words in original.
this third email linked to a website maintained by kehowski on the district web server.the school technology policy encouraged faculty to develop websites for use as a learning tool,although faculty also maintained sites of a personal nature.kehowski site declared that t he only immigration reform imperative is preservation of white majority and urged visitors to r eport illegal aliens to the ins.emphasis omitted.like his emails,kehowski website quoted and linked to articles.one critiqued a shallow and ideology in which r ace must be held meaningless only by whites.another expressed concern that t he persistent inflow of hispanic immigrants threatens to divide the united states into two peoples.
prominent figures in the community condemned kehowski ideas.the president of the college circulated an email 
t he openness of our email system allows individuals to express opinions on almost any subject however,when an hurts people,hurts the college,and is counter to our beliefs about inclusiveness and respect,i can not be silent.in that context,i want everyone in the college community to know that personally and administratively,i support the district values and philosophy about diversity.
the chancellor of the district issued a press release stating that kehowski message is not aligned with the vision of our district but explaining that disciplinary action against kehowski could seriously undermine our ability to promote true academic freedom.although kehowski emails were not sent to any students,many obviously found out about them,and the student body president circulated an email to the faculty declaring that kehowski did not do anything illegal,but none of us believe his actions were ethical or in good taste.contemporary press accounts describe vocal student protests against kehowski.
a number of district employees also complained to the administration that kehowski statements had created a hostile work environment.no disciplinary action was taken against kehowski,and no steps were taken to enforce the district existing policy.
plaintiffs now seek damages and other relief on the ground that defendants failed to take immediate or appropriate steps to prevent kehowski from sending plaintiffs harassing emails and from disseminating harassing speech via his website.complaint at.the district court granted summary judgment to the president and chancellor on plaintiffs title vii claim on the ground that title vii liability does not extend to agents of the employer.but it denied summary judgment to the president and chancellor on plaintiffs constitutional claim,including on the issue of qualified immunity,and to the remaining defendants on both the constitutional and title vii claims.the president and chancellor brought this interlocutory appeal,challenging the district court ruling that they are not entitled to qualified immunity as to the alleged equal protection violation.
jurisdiction 
on an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity,jurisdiction is limited to the purely legal question of immunity.see cunningham gates,cir.w here the district court denies immunity on the basis that material facts are in dispute,we generally lack jurisdiction.id.
the district court characterized the central question of our qualified immunity defendants violated a clearly established right of which a reasonable person would have a factual inquiry,and denied immunity on the grounds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the acts or omissions of defendants were objectively reasonable.plaintiffs claim that we lack jurisdiction to review this determination,and that the question of qualified immunity must therefore go to a jury.but the contours of the right at issue,and the reasonableness of defendants actions,is not a question of a question of law.see,knox southwest airlines,cir.in answering that question,we may not disregard material factual disputes identified by the district,at.but we undoubtedly have jurisdiction to determine whether,taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,defendants would have violated a constitutional right of which a reasonable government official would have been aware.
qualified immunity 
it clearly established in our circuit that public employees are entitled under the equal protection clause to be free of purposeful workplace harassment on the basis of protected status.see alaska eeoc,cir en banc bator hawaii,cir.defendants therefore do not dispute that employers who become aware of workplace harassment are required to take reasonable steps to make it stop.but they claim they are entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because they were required to do no more than they did in the circumstances presented here,and if they were required to do more,such a duty was not clearly established.see pearson callahan.we begin by addressing the precise scope of the district constitutional obligation.
plaintiffs may wish that the district had disciplined or dismissed kehowski,but the district was required to do so.when an employer is made aware of unlawful harassment,employees are entitled to have the employer take reasonable and appropriate steps to investigate and make it stop.andrews city of philadelphia,cir.a warning or other discipline,even dismissal,may be the appropriate action in some circumstances,but the proper object of an employer response is to deter and stop further harassment,not to punish the harasser.see,bator,at.
plaintiffs suggest the district should have applied its existing policy to silence kehowski as soon as the nature of his speech became apparent,either by revoking his access to the district technology resources or by warning him that further speech would lead to disci
