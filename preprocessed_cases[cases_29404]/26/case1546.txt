iii.discussion 
standard of review of an order granting summary judgment on the merits 
in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,the supreme court described the burden of production on summary judgment motions as follows f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.that is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon.citation.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.

plaintiff was not an employee for feha purposes 
plaintiff contends the trial court erroneously found her feha claim was without merit because triable issues of material fact existed as to whether she was a school employee.the feha prohibits employment discrimination on certain enumerated classifications,one of which is on the basis of race.the feha provides limited definitions of the terms employee and employer,subds.c d.section,subdivision c states,employee does not include any individual employed by his or her parents,spouse or child,or any individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop or rehabilitation facility.as can be noted,section,subdivision c only provides a description of what is not an employee.employer is defined as follows employer includes any person regularly employing five or more persons,or any person acting as an agent of an employer,directly or indirectly,the state or any political civil subdivision of the state,and cities,except as follows employer does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit,subd.d.the first paragraph of section,subdivision d does provide some definition of an employer.but the second paragraph of section,subdivision d provides a description of what is not an employer.beyond these limited definitions,the feha does not define an employer,employee,or what constitutes employment.in order to recover under the discrimination in employment provisions of the feha,the aggrieved plaintiff must be an employee.no decisional authority has addressed the specific issue of whether a student athlete who receives an athletic scholarship is a school employee under the feha.
however,persuasive decisional authority in the workers compensation and public entity liability contexts provides guidance as to the meaning of the term employee.labor code section,subdivision k excludes a student athlete receiving an athletic scholarship from the term employee.what is now labor code section,subdivision k,resulted from the court of appeal decision in van horn industrial acc.com.d.van horn,a workers compensation case.in van horn,a student athlete received financial assistance from california polytechnic state university san luis obispo,in exchange for playing football.some of the money paid to the student was in the form of an athletic scholarship,which was funded by a booster club.the student was killed in an airplane crash while returning from an football game against bowling green university.the student heirs applied for workers compensation death benefits on the theory tha
