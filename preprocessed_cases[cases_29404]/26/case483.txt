individual students and parents of students in the forney independent school district,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of forney independent school district,keith bell,kenneth cleaver,clarence doggan,jay calvin,jim jacobs,rick townsend,david walker,and chester clair.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
are students and parents of students who attend schools situated in the forney independent school district forney in forney,texas.sued asserting several constitutional challenges to the mandatory school uniform policy uniform policy or policy adopted by forney.are forney chester clair,general superintendent of forney and keith bell,kenneth cleaver,clarence doggan,jay calvin,jim jacobs,rick townsend,and david walker,members of the forney board of trustees collectively referred to hereinafter as defendants.
in the spring of,forney,acting pursuant to texas education code adopted a mandatory uniform policy applicable to its students.the uniform policy apparently originated as a result of the efforts of general superintendent clair,who observed the successful implementation of uniform policies employed in other texas school districts.in addition to clair,school board members and school officials conferred with their counterparts at other texas public schools and reviewed studies on the efficacy of school uniform policies.as found by the district court,
clair came to the conclusion that the implementation of a school uniform program would,according to his research,have the following beneficial effects on the students and the system as a whole improve student performance,instill,foster,increase attendance,decrease disciplinary referrals,and lower rates.
see littlefield forney indep.sch,d.forney also sought input from parents regarding the proposed policy.in march,a survey was sent home with elementary,middle,and school students in order to elicit parental approval of the proposed uniform policy.the district court found that,of the percent of parents who responded,approximately sixty percent of that group was in favor of mandatory uniforms.forney also conducted two town hall style meetings on the subject.at these meetings,parents were provided the opportunity to comment on the proposed uniform policy.
as a result of this information,the forney school board made factual findings that the school uniforms would improve the learning environment at the schools,and on april,adopted the uniform policy now at issue.the uniform policy applied to all students in each of the schools within the district and was implemented at the beginning of the school year.
the disputed uniform policy requires students to wear solid color shirts with collars,shirts,or blouses with collars in one of four colors white,yellow,red,or navy blue the shirts may be either short or but must be tucked in at all times.students must also wear either blue or khaki colored pants,shorts,skirts,or jumpers.the shorts and skirts must be of appropriate size and length no shorter than three inches above the knee.the policy prohibits the wearing of,inter alia,denim,leather,suede,or vinyl,or any clothing that suggests gang affiliation,could conceal contraband,or could create a distraction.certain other clothing items are also banned,such as sandals,military boots,overalls,athletic pants,spandex,baggy clothing,and sleeveless shirts.the uniform policy also regulates the sizes of manufacturer logos permitted on clothing.prior to the adoption of the policy,forney had a dress code that prohibited certain types of clothing deemed unsafe,immodest,or otherwise inimical to the educational process.
forney asserts that the uniform policy was adopted to promote school spirit and school values,and to promote decorum and thereby the notion that school is a place of order and work,to promote respect for authority,to decrease socioeconomic tensions,to increase attendance,and to reduce drop out rates.forney also asserts that it intended the policy to increase student safety by reducing gang and drug related activity as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons to school undetected and by allowing teachers to more readily distinguish forney students from outsiders.
failure to comply with the uniform policy results in disciplinary action,which could lead to expulsion.as stated in the forney student handbook,if a student attends school in violation of this uniform policy,the following disciplinary steps will be taken in order the student will be placed immediately in isolation on the campus,either until the parent can bring appropriate clothing or for the entire day,whichever comes first the student will be sent to bam behavioral adjustment modification for a minimum of days for the second infraction if the student still refuses to comply,the student will remain in bam for a maximum of two weeks if the student still refuses to comply following the two week bam assignment,the principal will pursue due process for aep alternative education program or expulsion.
in compliance with the requirement of texas education code c,the uniform policy includes an provision whereby parents and students with bona fide religious or philosophical objections to the wearing of a uniform can apply for an exemption to the policy.the provision requires parents to request an application for exemption and fill out a questionnaire designed to gauge the sincerity of the beliefs of those parents who assert objections.this questionnaire asks whether the student has ever participated in any of a number of activities that would have required him or her to wear a uniform families granted exemptions from the uniform policy must reapply each school year.a grievance system was created to address issues arising from the procedure 
the district court found that the parents of students sought exemptions from compliance with the uniform policy,of which twelve exemptions were granted a few of the were within the group of students who were granted exemptions from the policy.most students who had based their objections on philosophical or religious grounds were denied exemptions because they had worn some type of uniform in the past.
several unsuccessfully sought exemption from the uniform policy through established administrative channels.other refused to respond to the questionnaire based on constitutional or personal objections.then brought suit under seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.
relevant to this appeal,bring three separate,substantive constitutional challenges to the uniform policy.first,the subject to the uniform policy assert that the compulsory wearing of uniforms violates the first amendment because the wearing of uniforms is both a form of coerced speech,in that,it compels them to express ideas with which they may not agree,and,at the same time,it is an infringement on free expression,in that it prevents them from freely expressing particular messages they do wish to convey.second,the claim that the compulsory uniform policy violates their fundamental right to control the upbringing and education of their children in violation of the fourteenth amendment.finally,four parents seeking relief on behalf of their children,who sought exemption from the uniform policy on religious grounds,allege that the existing procedures restrict their freedom to exercise their religious beliefs in violation of the free exercise clause of the first amendment because the questionnaire and hearing procedures impermissibly delve into the substance of their religious beliefs.further,these four contend that the procedures favor certain established religions at the expense of other religions and thus violate the establishment clause of the first amendment.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.the district court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,concluding that no constitutional violation occurred in this case.the district court did not reach the qualified immunity issue.
plaintiffs timely appeal the grant of summary judgment.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.see smith brenoettsy,cir see also tolson avondale,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d quoting.c.the moving party bears the burden of showing the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.see id.at.if the moving party fails to meet this initial burden,the motion must be denied,regardless of the nonmovant response.if the movant does,however,meet this burden,the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.tubacex,risan,cir.a dispute over a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.smith,at quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.the substantive law determines which facts are material.see anderson,at.
iii.first amendment expressive conduct claims 
the first amendment protects not only verbal and written expression,but also symbols and conduct that constitute symbolic speech.see tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.as the supreme court explained in texas johnson 
while we have rejected the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled speech whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea,we have acknowledged that conduct may be sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the first and fourteenth amendments.
d citations and internal quotations omitted.in evaluating whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to implicate first amendment protections,courts must ask whether a n intent to convey a particularized message was present,and whether the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.id.alterations in original quoting spence washington,d.
the protection of the first amendment depends not only on whether the conduct is expressive,but also on the context in which that expression takes place.in the public school arena,the free expression rights of students are balanced by the corresponding interest of furthering the educational mission of schools.compare tinker,at.recognizing that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,with hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d a school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission,even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.citations and internal quotations omitted,and bethel sch.dist.fraser,d recognizing that the first amendment rights of public school students are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.public schools,therefore,while responsible for inculcating the values of the first amendment necessary for citizenship,are not themselves unbounded forums for practicing those freedoms.
the referred to in this section as the students raise two separate free expression arguments based on the first amendment the students claim that the uniform policy acts as a form of coerced speech in that it forces the students to convey a message that students do not wish to send see wooley maynard,d west.bd.of educ.barnette,and that the uniform policy acts as a prior restraint by preventing the students from freely expressing any message at all through their attire other than the message see united states,d.
defendants argue that the choice of student clothing is not expressive conduct protected by the first amendment,and thus,any rational of such nonexpressive conduct should survive constitutional scrutiny.defendants also contend that the wearing of school uniforms does not convey a sufficiently particularized message to be considered coerced speech,see spence washington,d,and thus can not be considered a prior restraint on expression prohibited by the first amendment see karr schmidt,cir en banc 
the threshold question,then,is whether the expression at issue is entitled to protection under the first amendment.the district court agreed with defendants and held that the mandatory uniform policy did not implicate expressive conduct protected by the first amendment.see littlefield,d at relying on spence,at,and karr,at,to find student clothing not to be protected expression under the first amendment.however,subsequent to the district court issuance of its opinion,this court,in canady bossier parish school board,explicitly addressed the first amendment implications of a mandatory school uniform policy and cast doubt on the district court reasoning.see,cir disagreeing with the district court in littlefield that the rationale in karr could be applied to students choice of attire.
in canady,this court resolved a first amendment challenge to a mandatory school uniform policy adopted by the bossier parish school board in bossier parish,louisiana.the bossier uniform policy involved a similar requirement of one of several colors of collared shirts and a similar choice between blue or khaki pants.in addressing the threshold question of expression,this court assumed without deciding that an individual choice of attire may be endowed with sufficient levels of intentional expression to elicit first amendment shelter.id.faced with an almost identical first amendment challenge to a uniform policy,this court reasoned 
a person choice of clothing is infused with intentional expression on many levels.in some instances,clothing functions as pure speech.a student may choose to wear shirts or jackets with written messages supporting political candidates or important social issues.words printed on clothing qualify as pure speech and are protected under the first amendment clothing may also symbolize ethnic heritage,religious beliefs,and political and social views.individuals regularly use their clothing to express ideas and opinions the choice to wear clothing as a symbol of an opinion or cause is undoubtedly protected under the first amendment if the message is likely to be understood by those intended to view it finally,students in particular often choose their attire with the intent to signify the social group to which they belong,their participation in different activities,and their general attitudes toward society and the school environment.while the message students intend to communicate about their identity and interests may be of little value to some adults,it has a considerable e ffect,whether positive or negative,on a young person social development.
id.at citations omitted.the canady court then went on to state that while this sort of expression may not convey a particularized message to warrant first amendment protection in every instance,we can not declare that expression of one identity and affiliation to unique social groups through choice of clothing will never amount to protected speech.id.at assuming the first amendment applies to the students choice of expression,the court then applied the first amendment framework of united states,d,relating to restrictions on expressive activities,to hold that the bossier parish mandatory school uniform policy did not violate the first amendment.
for the purposes of this opinion,we follow the reasoning of the canady and again,assume without deciding,that the first amendment applies to the expressive conduct implicated in the mandatory uniform policy.however,applying the test,we hold that the uniform policy does not violate the first amendment.
in,the supreme court created an analytical framework to evaluate restrictions on expressive activities.the court held that when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct,a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on first amendment freedoms.at.applying to the challenged governmental policy at issue,the uniform policy will survive constitutional scrutiny if it is within the constitutional power of the government,it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest,the interest is unrelated to the suppression of student expression,and the incidental restrictions on first amendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate that interest.see id.at.the standard is applicable to both the students coerced speech arguments,see wooley maynard,d,and their prior restraint free expression arguments.see canady,at.
we have little difficulty in concluding that the uniform policy passes constitutional scrutiny under the standard.first,there is no question that,pursuant to state law,defendants have the power to pass a mandatory school uniform policy.see.ann.vernon 
second,improving the educational process is undoubtedly an important and substantial interest of forney and the school board.see canady,at see also kuhlmeier,at.the uniform policy was adopted to improve student performance,instill,foster,increase attendance,decrease disciplinary referrals,and lower rates.see littlefield,d at.such interests in the health,safety,and order of public schools are sufficient government interests under.while the students argue that defendants have failed to produce evidence of any need to further these improvements in forney,we are satisfied that,on this record,defendants have established the requisite connection between the uniform policy and the stated interests in improving forney schools as has been well recognized,federal courts should defer to school boards to decide,within constitutional bounds,what constitutes appropriate behavior and dress in public schools.see canady,at,i t is not the job of federal courts to determine the most effective way to educate our nation youth.see also fraser,at.
third,the students have not established issues of material fact sufficient to demonstrate that the defendants interest in enacting the uniform policy was to suppress expression.see,at.the record demonstrates that the uniform policy was adopted for other legitimate reasons unrelated to the suppression of student expression.for example,forney asserts that the policy was implemented to increase safety by providing a means to differentiate forney students from nonstudents who might enter forney campuses.in addition,the uniform policy was intended to decrease socioeconomic disparities and tensions between students,increase attendance because truants would be easily identified,and reduce gang and activity,as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons to school undetected following canady,we hold that forney purpose in enacting the uniform policy can not be deemed an attempt to suppress or coerce speech.canady,at the school board purpose for enacting the uniform policy is to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems throughout the school system.this purpose is in no way related to the suppression of student speech.
finally,we are satisfied that,because of the limited nature of the restriction,the incidental restrictions on first amendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate forney interest,at.the restrictions pertain only to student attire during school hours and do not affect other means of communication.again,following canady,
although students are restricted from wearing clothing of their choice at school,students remain free to wear what they want after school hours.students may still express their views through other mediums during the school day.the uniform requirement does not bar the important personal intercommunication among students necessary to an effective educational process.
id.at quoting tinker,at.thus,we hold that the uniform policy survives first amendment scrutiny under the test and,because there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding the application of the test,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
iv.parental rights under the fourteenth amendment 
the fourteenth amendment prohibits states from depriving persons of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.see const.amend.xiv.as the supreme court recently reaffirmed we have long recognized that the amendment due process clause,like its fifth amendment counterpart,guarantees more than fair process.the clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.troxel granville,d plurality opinion quoting washington glucksberg,d.
one of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by the court is the interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children.see id.at.i t can not now be doubted that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.see also meyer nebraska.recognizing that the liberty interest protected by due process includes the right of parents to control the education of their own pierce soc y of sisters.recognizing that the liberty of parents and guardians includes the right to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control prince massachusetts.recognizing that there is a constitutional interest in parents directing the custody,care and nurture of the child.
the referred to in this section as the parents argue that their right to control their children education is a fundamental right entitled to heightened constitutional protection.specifically,the parents claim that the mandatory school uniforms interfere with their parental rights to teach their children to be guided by one own conscience in making decisions,to understand the importance of appropriate grooming and attire,to understand the importance of one own individuality,and to respect the individuality of others.the parents argue that the implementation of mandatory uniforms presumes that parents are either incapable or unwilling to act in the best interests of their children.because the parents assert that this right of control has been recognized as fundamental,see troxel,at,the parents contend that a level of analysis must be applied to the uniform policy.
defendants argue,in contrast,that while parents may have a fundamental liberty interest in their children upbringing,this interest can not usurp the state role in determining appropriate behavior at public schools,including the role of determining appropriate dress codes in the district.defendants argue that notwithstanding the supreme court recent reaffirmation of parental rights as fundamental rights in troxel,that decision does not in any way extend parents rights to frustrate basic school rules reasonably required to regulate the educational system.defendants argue,therefore,that a test is the appropriate standard to judge the school uniform policy at issue.
the district court agreed with defendants and applied a test,concluding that forney uniform policy did not infringe the parents fundamental right to control the rearing and education of their children.see littlefield,d at.the district court rejected the parents argument that the supreme court determination in the due process clause protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their be read to cover complaints about a school uniform policy.see id.at the fundamental right of filiation and companionship with one children,which the supreme court examined in troxel,is an entirely different balance of interests from the right of parents to send their children to a public school in clothes of their own choosing.we agree with the impressively reasoned decision of the district court on this issue.
in troxel,the court struck down a washington state statute that allowed any person,including a grandparent,to petition for visitation rights at any time,if it was in the best interests of the child.see at.the court found the statute offensive to the parental rights of the mother in that it unconstitutionally interfered with the mother right to make decisions concerning the upbringing of her child.see id.at.while the supreme court in troxel recognized that there exists a fundamental right of parents to direct their children upbringing,it failed to articulate a standard of judicial scrutiny to be applied see id.at.thomas,concurring the opinions of the plurality,justice kennedy,and justice souter recognize such a right,but curiously none of them articulates the appropriate standard of review.
the dispositive question at issue is whether the sweeping statements of the plurality opinion in troxel regarding the fundamental interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children,see id.at,mandate a strict standard of scrutiny for the parents fourteenth amendment challenge to the uniform policy.we do not read troxel to create a fundamental right for parents to control the clothing their children wear to public schools and,thus,instead follow almost eighty years of precedent analyzing parental rights in the context of public education under a standard.
before the supreme court troxel opinion,the court had addressed the issue of parental rights in public schools in three major opinions.first,in meyer nebraska,the court held unconstitutional a law that forbade schools from teaching foreign languages to students below the eighth grade,applying the equivalent of a review see.we are constrained to conclude that the statute as applied is arbitrary,and without reasonable relation to any end within the competency of the state.emphasis added.the supreme court held that the fourteenth amendment protects the right to marry,establish a home,and bring up children.id.at.
two years later,in pierce society of sisters,the court struck down a state law prohibiting parents from sending their children to private school,again utilizing the equivalent of a test.see.the court invalidated the statute because it unreasonably interfer ed with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.id.at.emphasis added.
finally,in wisconsin yoder,members of the old order amish religion and the conservative amish mennonite church argued that mandatory school attendance beyond the eighth grade violated their rights under the fourteenth amendment and under the first amendment free exercise clause.see,d.the supreme court agreed that,as it applied to the amish,the state law was unconstitutional.see id.at.yoder was decided based on the free exercise clause,but it informs the discussion about the balancing of interests regarding parental rights implicated under the fourteenth amendment.the court acknowledged both the state interest in providing and regulating a state public education system and the parental interest in controlling a child religious upbringing and education.see id.at.as the district court in this case reasoned 
understanding the full import of yoder,which refined the parental rights announced in meyer and pierce,is critical to properly analyze the claims presented in the present case.in yoder,the supreme court,while reaffirming the general notion that parental rights are a protected liberty interest under the due process clause,recognized the high responsibility and regulatory power of the state in matters of public education.furthermore,while fundamental religious practices may excuse parents from complying with educational policies,secular objections to such policies are insufficient to avoid compliance.
littlefield,d at emphasis added.the yoder court went on to state that a way of life,however virtuous and admirable,may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations.yoder,at.emphasis added 
thus,as the district court recognized w hile the court employed more than a rational basis standard with reference to the first amendment free exercise clause,it is clear that the due process interest of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children,standing alone,warranted no more than review.littlefield,d at.as such,the district court concluded that meyer,pierce,and yoder,taken together,support the argument that a review is the appropriate standard in this case.this conclusion is in accord with other circuit courts of appeals that have addressed the issue.see herndon chapel city bd.of,cir immediato rye neck sch,cir.
troxel does not change the above reasoning in the context of parental rights concerning public education.while parents may have a fundamental right in the upbringing and education of their children,this right does not cover the parents objection to a public school uniform policy.it has long been recognized that parental rights are not absolute in the public school context and can be subject to reasonable regulation.see,runyon mccrary,d recognizing no parental right to educate children in private segregated academies kite marshall,cir see also swanson guthrie indep.sch,cir recognizing that cases in this area establish that parents simply do not have a constitutional right to control each and every aspect of their children education and oust the state authority over that subject brown hot,sexy safer,cir fleischfresser dirs.of sch.dist,cir murphy arkansas,cir fellowship baptist church benton,cir.these cases support the determinations in meyer,pierce,and yoder that a test is the appropriate level of scrutiny for parental rights in the public school context.
applying the test,we conclude that the uniform policy is rationally related to the state interest in fostering the education of its children and furthering the legitimate goals of improving student safety,decreasing socioeconomic tensions,increasing attendance,and reducing rates.therefore,we affirm the district court summary judgment determination that the uniform policy does not violate the parents fourteenth amendment rights.
free exercise clause and establishment clause claims 
we find no merit in the referred to in this section as the families claims under the free exercise and the establishment clauses of the first amendment on appeal,the families do not challenge the constitutionality of texas education code c focusing instead on the application of the procedures by the defendants hereinafter referred to as the policy.the district court properly dismissed these first amendment challenges in its opinion.see littlefield,d at.we agree with the district court that the forney policy neither infringes on the families free exercise of religion nor violates the establishment clause.
free exercise 
the free exercise clause of the first amendment,which has been made applicable to the states by incorporation into the fourteenth provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.const.amend.i.in employment division,department of human resources smith,the supreme court held that a neutral,generally applicable governmental regulation will withstand a free exercise challenge when the regulation is reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.see,d church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d in addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion,our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.
on its face,the policy enacted by forney is neutral and of general application,in that it applies to all persons who might wish to attend forney and choose to of the uniform policy.all parties also agree that the policy was not enacted to inhibit religion and,in fact,recognize that the statutory provision was enacted to protect the reasonable state interest of fostering the free exercise of religion.as a threshold matter,then,the policy survives constitutional scrutiny under smith.
the families specific complaint,however,is that in the process of legitimately inquiring about the religious beliefs of families seeking exemption from the uniform policy,defendants have crossed the line between the legitimate inquiry into the sincerity of plaintiffs religious beliefs and prohibited inquiry into the substance of those beliefs.the families argue that,because there was no established school policy for determining who would be granted an exception,defendants have become arbiters of the substance of religions in a manner that infringes the families free exercise of their beliefs 
the difficulty for the families is twofold.first,the families concede that it is permissible for forney to examine the sincerity of their beliefs.second,on this record there exists an established district policy that defendants have followed in a consistent manner.we address these issues together.
section c of the texas education code provides that parents may exempt their children from the uniform policy if they can provide a bona fide religious or philosophical objection to the wearing of the uniform in an effort to provide an objective means of determining the sincerity of the bona fides of a religious belief,forney established a process of requiring written objection,the completion of a questionnaire that requests information regarding whether students had worn uniforms in the past,and personal meetings with the parents this process to determine the sincerity of a religious objection,while fraught with difficulty,is necessary to separate sincere beliefs from fraudulent beliefs.see patrick lefevre,cir sincerity analysis seeks to determine an adherent good faith in the expression of his religious belief.this test provides a rational means of differentiating between those beliefs that are held as a matter of conscience and those that are animated by motives of deception and fraud.citations omitted see also hernandez commissioner,d united states daly,cir although courts may not determine whether a given belief is or is not a religion,the trier of fact may determine whether a belief is truly held without violating the first amendment.citations omitted.
because the procedures are a neutral and rational means to determine sincerity,as a legal matter under smith,they do not interfere with the free exercise of religion.see at.further,in practice,have been granted to parents who have demonstrated a sincere and consistent objection to the wearing of uniforms therefore,we conclude that the families have not created a genuine issue of material fact that the application of forney policy violates their free exercise rights under the first amendment.
establishment clause 
the families establishment clause argument is equally without merit.the families assert that defendants will grant exemption requests only upon proof that the applicant strictly adhered to an organized religion,thus manifesting a preference for only those religions in which adherents could provide written proof of the tenets of their beliefs the families argue that,in granting exemptions only to religions for which a prohibition on uniforms was clearly stated in the tenets of that religion,defendants were establishing some religions as favored over others,in violation of the establishment clause.
to withstand an establishment clause challenge,a statute must have a secular legislative purpose,the statute primary purpose must neither advance nor inhibit religion,and the statute must not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.see lemon kurtzman,d.as the district court found 
t he uniform policy unquestionably has a secular purpose.next,the principal effect neither advances nor inhibits religion.its purpose is to enhance the learning environment in the forney schools,irrespective of the religious faith of a particular student.finally,the policy does not unnecessarily entangle the school board with religion.the uniform policy references religion only in the context of exemptions.there is no evidence to suggest that as a result of the uniform policy,the school board must routinely or even occasionally become involved in religious matters.less than one hundred exemption requests,out of nearly students,were considered by the school board,and the vast majority concerned secular requests.
littlefield,d at.we agree with the district court conclusion.none of the families raising the establishment clause challenge can point to any religious purpose behind the implementation of the policy.nor can these families point to any primary effect of the policy that advances a particular religion or that inhibits a religion.on this record,it appears that those families that could demonstrate sincere and consistent rejection of mandatory uniforms were granted exemptions regardless of the particular tenets of their faith finally,we do not perceive an intolerable risk of excessive government entanglement in the requirement that parents demonstrate their consistency and sincerity by explaining the basis of their religious objections to defendants.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on these claims.
vi.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of defendants.
i concur in the result and in all but part iii.first amendment expressive conduct claims of the majority opinion.
concerning part,our court utilizes assumptions regarding the claims of and restraint on free expression,rather than directly addressing those claims.by doing so,we simply invite,if not encourage,needless,repetitive litigation.
the wearing of the uniform at issue is not expression for first amendment purposes.accordingly,there is no coerced speech.likewise,for the claim,and on this record,the requisite expression has not been demonstrated.
i regret we have not confronted the issue our court avoided in canady bossier parish sch,cir whether the wearing of a school uniform devoid of any logo,symbol,or motto is expression for first amendment purposes.the answer to that question would resolve directly the claim at issue.obviously,if that which is coerced is not speech,then speech has not been coerced.
the majority correctly acknowledges,as did our court in canady,that the test from spence washington,d,is the correct analysis for discerning whether as the wearing of a school sufficiently expressive to merit first amendment protection.canady explains the application of that test 
in deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the first amendment into play,we must ask whether a n intent to convey a particularized message was present,and whether the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.when assessing the appellants claim,we look to the particular activity,combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken.
at quoting texas johnson,d alteration in original citations omitted.unfortunately,the majority,as did the canady court,fails to adequately apply spence to determine whether a school uniform specifically,as opposed to clothing generally,can constitute expression.instead,as was done in canady,the majority assumes for purposes of this appeal that the wearing of the uniform at issue constitutes expressive conduct.
appellants collectively,students assert that,for cases of coerced speech,the spence test was abrogated by hurley.gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,d holding massachusetts public accommodation law unconstitutional as applied to require private organizers of patrick day parade to include gay,lesbian,and bisexual group as its own parade unit.they rely on the court statement that a narrow,succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection,which if confined to expressions conveying a particularized message,would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of jackson pollock,music of arnold schoenberg,or jabberwocky verse of lewis carroll.id.at.citation omitted.
of course,where speech is pure,a particularized message has never been required pure speech is entitled to comprehensive protection under the first amendment.tinker des moines indep.com.sch,d.the spence test,on the other hand,was established to address speech that is less than pure namely,expression of an idea through activity.spence,at.
that wearing a school uniform is not pure speech is supported by tinker,which involved students being suspended for wearing black armbands to school to protest the conflict in vietnam.in distinguishing the from other regulations,the court explained the problem posed by the present case does not relate to regulation of the length of skirts or the type of clothing,to hair style,or deportment our problem involves direct,primary first amendment rights akin to pure speech.tinker,at.accordingly,for determining content there is in wearing the school uniform at issue,we must follow canady instruction and engage in the spence analysis.
while the students have proffered some evidence that the forney independent school district fisd intended to convey a message in adopting the uniform,pride in and respect for the values of fisd and its question whether such a message is sufficiently particularized as to satisfy spence.but,even if fisd did intend that message,i doubt there is any likelihood whatsoever,no less the great likelihood required by spence,that such a message would be understood by anyone who happens to see students blue or khaki trousers or skirt and shirt.when worn in the factual context and environment in which students are required to wear the is,uniform conveys at most the following message that the wearer is a student.
accordingly i would hold that,as a matter of law,the wearing of a school uniform devoid of any logo,symbol,or the wearing of long hair that was at issue in this court en banc decision in karr schmidt,cir en banc,cert.denied,d does not involve sufficient communicative content to qualify as expression for first amendment purposes.consequently,the requirement to wear such a uniform can not constitute coerced speech.as the supreme court implied in hurley,where the disfavored message is difficult to identify,there is no risk that the allegedly coerced party is forced to propound a particular point of view.hurley,at.
of course,deciding that the wearing of such a school uniform is not expressive conduct alleviates the need to examine the coercion claim under the test regarding restrictions on expressive conduct.see united states,d.indeed,i question whether applies to school uniform cases.see,phoenix elementary sch.dist.green,school uniform policy is a regulation of the medium,not the message accordingly,nonpublic forum analysis is the appropriate test see also canady,at noting the similarity of to traditional time,place,manner analysis.but that question is best left for another day.because coercion to wear the uniform at issue is not coercion to speak,there is no need to apply any degree of heightened scrutiny.
my conclusion that the wearing of the school uniform at issue is not expressive does not,of course,dictate a result with regard to the students other first amendment claim restraint on free expression.for even if the uniform is not imbued with expressive value,the uniform policy still precludes the students from wearing clothing of their choice that may be expressive.
in addressing this second claim,the majority again follows the lead of the canady court in assuming that the uniform policy implicates expressive clothing choices.accordingly,the majority proceeds with the analysis.
although certain choices of clothing may have sufficient communicative content to qualify as first amendment activity,canady,at,the present record contains only vague depictions of messages the students supposedly intend to convey through clothing choice.the deposition testimony of one student is typical 
i mean,i do like them school uniforms.i do like that we have to wear the same thing every day.it a routine that i do like to be in.i do like to be told what to wear.i would rather wear something that expresses who i am.
arguably,the various messages proffered by students in their depositions may be loosely grouped around the concept of individuality.but,i can not will i such a message satisfies the spence test for discerning expressive conduct.because the students have failed to articulate a particularized message likely to be understood by anyone,i would not examine their free expression challenge under the test as the majority does.nor would i apply any degree of heightened scrutiny.instead,i would ask simply whether the regulation is reasonably intended to accomplish a constitutionally permissible state objective.karr,at.i conclude it is.
t he supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials,consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards,to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.tinker,at.emphasis added.in accordance with state law,and in response to a perceived need,fisd has prescribed and controlled the wearing of uniforms in its schools through a uniform policy that is consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards.we should address this issue.

section of the texas education code provides in relevant part a the board of trustees of an independent school district may adopt rules that require students at a school in the district to wear school uniforms if the board determines that the requirement would improve the learning environment at the school.b the rules the board of trustees adopts must designate a source of funding that shall be used in providing uniforms for students at the school who are educationally disadvantaged.c a parent or guardian of a student assigned to attend a school at which students are required to wear school uniforms may choose for the student to be exempted from the requirement or to transfer to a school at which students are not required to wear uniforms and at which space is available if the parent or guardian provides a written statement that,as determined by the board of trustees,states a bona fide religious or philosophical objection to the.ann.vernon.
there are slight differences between the mandatory uniform policies covering the primary and intermediate schools and the policy covering the secondary schools.these differences,however,are not relevant to the disposition of this appeal.
for example,the questionnaire asks if a student has ever worn a uniform to participate in activities such as girl scouts,boy scouts,organized sports teams,sports teams,band,choir,drill team or whether a student has ever worn a uniform to work at a business,at church,or at a activity.in addition,the questionnaire asks whether the parents have ever participated in activities that might require a uniform.
parents requesting an exemption from the policy for their children are required to meet with a designated administrator to discuss the policy and the nature of the objection.these level i hearings are conducted by the campus principal or an assistant principal.level i hearings may be appealed to a level ii hearing at the district level.level ii hearings are to be conducted by defendant clair or a deputy administrator designated by him.a final level iii hearing is available before the school board trustees.
several of these exemptions were granted for medical reasons.
the district court found that the had established the requisite article iii injury to challenge the uniform policy.the district court stated t he forney student uniform policy specifically provides that if a student persists in his refusal to comply with the uniform policy,his ultimate sanction is the alternative education program or expulsion.thus,it is apparent that the penalty of expulsion from school may be imposed on those students who,for whatever reason,refus
