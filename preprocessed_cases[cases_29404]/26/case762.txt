al mccullough brought claims pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act,et,and the arkansas civil rights act acra,ann.et,alleging that his employer,the university of arkansas for medical sciences uams,and individuals jim raczynski and hosea long,discriminated against him on the basis of sex and retaliated against him for participation in a protected activity.he also brought claims alleging retaliation for the exercise of his free speech rights under the first amendment and the arkansas constitution.const.art.ii,pursuant to and.ann,respectively.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims.mccullough of for med,wl.we affirm.
because we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we describe the facts in the light most favorable to mccullough.mccullough worked as a computer project program director for uams in the college of public health coph.during mccullough employment,james raczynski served as dean of the coph,and hosea long served as vice chancellor for human services.
on june,elaine wooten,a female employee at the coph,submitted a formal complaint to long stating that mccullough had sexually harassed her.on july,another female employee at the coph,jodiane tritt,filed a sexual harassment complaint against mccullough.pursuant to uams sexual harassment policy,long appointed judy sims and ken easter,two members of a group called the resource panel,to investigate the complaints.according to uams policy,the resource panel is a panel composed of individuals nominated by the heads of each uams division,who are trained in issues relating to sexual harassment,as well as in the proper manner of investigating complaints.in the case of a formal complaint such as wooten or tritt,two members from the independent resource panel are appointed to investigate the allegations of the complaint.
on july,raczynski,long,and audrey bradley,an employee relations manager,notified mccullough that two complaints had been filed against him,and that two resource investigators had been assigned to investigate them.mccullough responded by sending an message to long,with copies to his supervisor,raczynski,and andrea roy,a human resources officer.he attached a sexual harassment complaint against elaine same employee who had accused him of sexual harassment.on july,mccullough met with resource investigators easter and sims to discuss the allegations against him.at that meeting,easter and sims asked him to submit a written response.about a week later,mccullough submitted a copy of the same complaint against wooten that he had sent to long,as well as a new sexual harassment complaint against other employee who had accused him of sexual harassment.he addressed his complaint against tritt to long,raczynski,roy,and bradley.
during the next few weeks,investigators sims and easter interviewed mccullough,wooten,tritt,and eight other people listed in mccullough complaints as potential witnesses.mccullough interview lasted roughly two hours,and the investigators noted that mccullough spent the majority of the time attacking the character of wooten and tritt,rather then responding directly to the allegations against him.after completing their investigation,easter and sims submitted their findings to long.they found the claims against mccullough more believable than his response in defense of those claims,and added that if all the witnesses interviewed were telling the truth,and there was no reason not to believe them,mccullough was untruthful and used his response to cloud the real issues of the investigation.
after reviewing the findings,long asked the investigators for more information.the investigators submitted an addendum with specific notes from all of the witness interviews they had conducted.on september,after reviewing the investigators report and addendum,long submitted his recommendation to raczynski,who as dean of the coph had final authority on the matter.long stated that t here is a preponderance of evidence to indicate that mccullough has in fact exhibited inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature toward his.he added that mccullough conduct occurred on more than one occasion,making it serious to the point of warranting disciplinary actions.finally,long recommended that mccullough receive a warning for inappropriate sexual behavior with immediate termination upon any further offenses,and that he attend both a sexual harassment workshop and counseling on interactions.
after reviewing long recommendation,raczynski asked to review all three complaints before making a decision.he also spoke with long in person and over the phone to discuss the matter.on october,raczynski terminated mccullough employment,effective immediately.in his termination letter,raczynski began by repeating long statement that there was a preponderance of evidence to indicate that mccullough exhibited inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature toward his,and that he did so on multiple occasions,making these incidents serious.he also stated,based on the investigators report,that mccullough had spent most of his interview attacking wooten and tritt rather than responding to their allegations that no evidence was found indicating that wooten or tritt had lied about him and that,by contrast,there was evidence to believe that he had been untruthful to the investigators in his responses about the two complainants.raczynski further stated that t he believed untruthfulness of mccullough responses and the claims he made about the two complainants have the appearance of being vindictive in nature and in response to the claims of sexual harassment by the two women.in his conclusion,raczynski noted that f or the reasons stated above,he had no option but to terminate mccullough employment.
mccullough filed a grievance with the office of employee relations.charles white,assistant vice chancellor for employee relations,concluded that mccullough termination was proper and in accordance with uams policy.on february,mccullough filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc claiming that he was sexually harassed by a single,fired on the basis of sex,and retaliated against for filing sexual harassment complaints of his own.on march,mccullough filed a complaint in the district court,asserting violations of his right to free speech under the first amendment and the arkansas constitution,the prohibitions on sex discrimination and retaliation in the arkansas civil rights act acra,and the family and medical leave act.on june,the eeoc concluded that his claim of sex discrimination was untimely,and that the evidence showed that he was not discharged because of his sex,or in retaliation for complaining about sexual harassment,but rather fired for sexually harassing his.
after receiving a right to sue letter from the eeoc,mccullough filed an amended complaint,in which he added retaliation and sex discrimination claims under title vii.specifically,he claimed that he was terminated for filing sexual harassment complaints,and that he was treated differently from the two women,tritt and wooten,because he was fired and they were not.mccullough abandoned the fmla claim,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all remaining claims 
we consider first the district court grant of summary judgment on the title vii and acra claims,which are governed by the same standards.see clegg.dep t of,cir.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to mccullough,the nonmoving party.id.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
title vii and the acra prohibit employers from discriminating based on sex with respect to compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.a.ann.in this circuit,under both statutes,an employee may survive an employer motion for summary judgment in one of two ways.mcginnis union pac,cir.the employee may produce direct evidence of discrimination,which is evidence showing a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision,sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.russell city of kansas city,cir.if the employee lacks direct evidence of discrimination,he can survive summary judgment by showing a genuine dispute for trial under the framework established in mcdonnell douglas corporation green,d.under mcdonnell douglas,the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case of discrimination.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,then the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for discharging the employee.if the employer meets this burden,then the employee must show that the employer proffered reason for firing him is a pretext for unlawful discrimination.at the summary judgment stage,under the amendments to title vii,the issue is whether the plaintiff has sufficient evidence that unlawful discrimination was a motivating factor in the defendant adverse employment action.roberts park nicollet health,cir quoting griffith city of des moines,cir.if so,then the presence of additional legitimate motives will not entitle the defendant to summary judgment.id.
mccullough purports to have direct proof that he was discriminated against on the basis of sex,but none of it constitutes direct evidence.he claims that because his allegations were corroborated,while those made by wooten and tritt largely were not,and because the final decisionmaker,raczynski,could not identify during his deposition what evidence supported mccullough termination,t he evidence of disparate treatment is so strong as to constitute direct evidence.
disagreement with a decisionmaker conclusion on the credibility of an employee story,however,does not constitute direct evidence of unlawful discrimination.neither does a decisionmaker alleged inability to pinpoint during a deposition why he decided to discharge an employee.direct evidence provides a strong causal link between the alleged discriminatory bias and the adverse employment decision.mcginnis,at griffith,at.it most often comprises remarks by decisionmakers that reflect,without inference,a discriminatory bias.see duckworth louis metro.police dep t,cir beshears asbill,cir.
none of mccullough proof establishes a direct link between his discharge and any bias against him because he is a man.the case on which he principally relies,russell,does not support the claim.in that case,a white female employee was demoted after an investigation determined that she made racial and slurs and jokes against other employees.during her appeal to the personnel board,the alleged victims of her remarks testified either that they never heard her make such comments,or that even if they had,they were never offended because she was always,and banter of that sort was commonplace.one alleged victim even opined that the white female employee had been singled out for discipline on account of her race.id.at.in determining whether such evidence constituted direct evidence,this court suggested that when two who are the alleged victims of misconduct deny that misconduct occurred and assert that the plaintiff is herself the victim of discrimination by the employer,that may well be direct evidence of discrimination.id.at.nothing in this record,however,indicates that wooten or tritt ever denied being sexually harassed by mccullough or ever stated that they were not offended by his actions.wooten and tritt never retreated from their complaints or suggested that they were not injured by mccullough behavior.accordingly,mccullough reliance on russell is misplaced.
because mccullough does not present direct evidence of sex discrimination,we analyze his claim under the framework of mcdonnell douglas.because the record was fully developed in connection with the motion for summary judgment,we address directly whether mccullough has presented a genuine issue for trial on the ultimate question of sex discrimination vel non.see riser target,cir johnson ready mixed concrete,cir.
the critical inquiry in discrimination cases like this one is not whether the employee actually engaged in the conduct for which he was terminated,but whether the employer in good faith believed that the employee was guilty of the conduct justifying discharge.hitt harsco,cir scroggins of,cir.a plaintiff seeking to survive an employer motion for summary judgment must therefore show a genuine issue for trial about whether the employer acted based on an intent to discriminate rather than on a belief that the employee committed misconduct justifying termination.johnson,at.mccullough has failed to do so here.the employer legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for termination in this case was that mccullough engaged in sexual harassment and then filed untruthful complaints against the female complainants.mccullough has not presented sufficient evidence to create an issue for trial on the question whether the final decisionmaker,raczynski,and the principal recommender,long,genuinely believed that he had engaged in such conduct.
mccullough responds that summary judgment was inappropriate because the evidence would support a finding that the employer explanation for his termination was a pretext for unlawful discrimination.mccullough cites the employer irrational decision to believe the female complainants over him,alleged inconsistencies in the reasons given for his termination,a failure to follow uams policy by not interviewing all of the witnesses listed in his complaints,the inability of long and raczynski to specify what facts supported his termination,and improper speaking objections during depositions,which allegedly amounted to spoliation of evidence.we conclude that mccullough evidence does not raise a reasonable inference that unlawful sex discrimination motivated his termination.
mccullough argues that because the only objective evidence regarding the interactions between mccullough,tritt,and wooten favored mccullough,the decision to terminate him must have been based on subjective,irrational factors.we disagree.the record in support of the employer conclusion is not so sparse,or the employer conclusion so implausible,that mccullough challenge to the merits of the decision can create a genuine issue about whether the employer motivation was impermissible.long testified that he looked at the totality of what was presented to him during the investigation,including the complaints,the investigators findings,and the notes from the witness interviews,and concluded that none of the witnesses supported mccullough allegations.he further testified that he made a judgment call that was sound based on the evidence before him.this evidence included an explanation by the independent resource investigators as to why there was no reason to disbelieve the female complainants,and how some of mccullough were contradicted by neutral witnesses.mccullough points to nothing in the record suggesting that long did not honestly believe that mccullough had committed sexual harassment on multiple occasions.
his arguments about raczynski suffer from the same weakness.in the termination letter to mccullough,raczynski stated that t he consensus of the investigators and long is that there is a preponderance of evidence to indicate that you exhibited inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature toward your,and that you did so on multiple occasions.when asked during his deposition what facts supported mccullough guilt,raczynski read from the investigators report and the attached addendum,and concluded that it was the entire picture that supported mccullough guilt.raczynski decided in favor of termination over lesser discipline,but nothing in the record indicates that he did not in good faith believe that mccullough committed sexual harassment and was untruthful to the investigators.
mccullough next claims that raczynski and long gave shifting and false explanations for their decisions.pretext may be shown with evidence that the employer reason for the terminat
