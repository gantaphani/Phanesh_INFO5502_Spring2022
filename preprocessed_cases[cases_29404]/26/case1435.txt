ruling on an unfair labor practice charge brought by the california faculty association cfa,the public employment relations board perb concluded that government code section,subdivision b,and education code section,subdivision a,preclude the trustees of the california state university the university from insisting that a memorandum of understanding contain limits on the authority of an arbitrator to overturn a campus president decision on faculty appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion.because during negotiations on a new memorandum of understanding the university had insisted to impasse a proposal containing such restrictions,perb found that the university had engaged in an unfair labor practice.
on this petition for review by the university,cal.rules of court,rule,we hold that perb interpretation of the statutes is clearly erroneous.see cumero public employment relations bd.cal d,cumero.neither the plain language of the statutes,nor the relevant legislative history,supports perb interpretation.to the contrary,the statutes impose no prohibition against limiting the powers of an arbitrator hearing a faculty grievance to reverse a campus president decision on appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion.we therefore issue a writ of mandate ordering perb to reverse its decision sustaining cfa allegation of unfair labor practice,and to enter a new decision denying it.
background 
education code section 
effective,the legislature enacted education code section,which was later renumbered section.stats,ch,stats,ch.throughout our opinion,we refer to the statute by the latter number,section,without code designation 
in terms substantively unchanged since enactment in,section requires the university to establish grievance and disciplinary action procedures for academic employees,subd.a.among these is that g rievances shall be heard by a faculty hearing committee,which shall make a recommendation to the president of the state university subd.a,and that i f there is disagreement between the faculty hearing committee decision and the state university president decision,the matter shall go before an arbitrator whose decision shall be final subd.a.the term grievance is defined in relevant part as an allegation by an employee that he was directly wronged in connection with the rights accruing to his appointment,reappointment,tenure,promotion,reassignment,or the like.stats,ch,see,subd.b.
executive order 
before passage of section,university grievance procedures were governed by executive order,which the university adopted in.that order,for the first time,introduced arbitration as a step in a grievance procedure the arbitrator power of review,however,was deferential to the president decision,and substantive limits were placed on the ability of the arbitrator to overrule the president.thus,the arbitrator scope of review was limited to whether the president rejection of the faculty grievance committee recommendation was arbitrary,whether a substantially unfair departure from prescribed procedures had occurred that affected the president decision,or whether the president ignored substantial evidence favorable to the grievant.
as we explain in more detail below,the legislature was well aware of executive order when it enacted section.indeed,the definition of grievance in section,subdivision b,was drawn from executive order.further,the requirement of section,subdivision a,that the arbitrator decision shall be final echoed the language of executive order,which provided that the arbitrator decision shall be final and binding upon the campus and the grievant.
executive orders and 
in,following the passage of section,the university enacted executive order,and later followed it in with executive order.the grievance procedures under both orders were substantially the same and contained limits on the authority of the arbitrator to set aside the campus president decision when it disagreed with the recommendation of the faculty grievance committee consistent with section,executive orders and provided that the arbitrator decision,insofar as consonant with the law and university rules and policies,shall be final.
enactment of heera 
effective july,the legislature enacted the higher education employer employee relations act heera,contained in government code section,et.among other things,heera granted the right of collective bargaining to university employees.
as enacted,heera provided in government code section,subdivision a,that if the provisions of section are in conflict with a memorandum of understanding,the memorandum of understanding shall be controlling.thus,grievance procedures negotiated in a memorandum of understanding would supersede the procedures of section,and the university and cfa were free to,and did,negotiate over such terms in reaching their first memorandum of understanding under heera.
the first memorandum of understanding under heera 
in,the university and cfa reached a first memorandum of understanding under heera procedures.this and all successive agreements contained the option of arbitration to resolve a faculty member grievance concerning the campus president decision on appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion.however,the agreements substantially restricted the authority of the arbitrator to set aside the campus president decision 
the memorandum of understanding 
in,cfa and the university agreed to a memorandum of understanding retroactive to and extending to june.before obtaining an agreement,however,the parties reached impasse in their negotiations.because no memorandum of understanding was then in effect,the grievance procedures of education code section became effective during the impasse.the university implemented executive order,which contained interim grievance procedures similar to those prescribed by the prior agreements,but with certain changes to comport with section,such as the inclusion of a faculty hearing committee,required by the statute but missing from prior agreements.executive order was in effect for approximately three months until the parties agreed on the memorandum of understanding.
enactment of senate bill code section,subdivision b 
the memorandum of understanding expired on june.during negotiations on a successor agreement,the legislature enacted and the governor signed senate bill,sponsored by cfa and opposed by the university.the bill added subdivision b to government code section,effective october,hereafter section,subdivision b.section,subdivision b,provides that for any memorandum of understanding reached after january,education code section provides a minimum level of benefits or rights,and is superseded by a memorandum of understanding only if the relevant terms of the memorandum of understanding provide more than the minimum level of benefits or rights set forth in that section.
negotiations over a successor memorandum of understanding 
in negotiations over an agreement to succeed the memorandum of understanding,cfa and the university disagreed on the effect of section,subdivision b.cfa argued that section,subdivision a,confers unlimited power on an arbitrator to render a final decision reversing a campus president decision in grievance proceedings involving appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion.further,according to cfa,section,subdivision b,precludes placing any limits on that power through a memorandum of understanding.the university,on the other hand,argued that the statutes do not prohibit the parties from limiting the scope of the arbitrator authority through collective bargaining.the university insisted that any new grievance procedure must maintain the existing contractual limits on the arbitrator authority to set aside campus decisions on faculty grievances concerning appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion.those limits were a campus president decision could be overturned for procedural error only if the error was proved by clear and convincing evidence and was prejudicial the normal remedy for such procedural error was a remand for reevaluation,with the arbitrator having authority to retain jurisdiction and the arbitrator could not grant appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion except in extreme cases where the campus decision was not based on reasoned judgment,where it was certain that appointment,reappointment,promotion,or tenure would have been granted but for the error,and where no other alternative was practicable.
perb proceedings 
cfa filed with perb a request for a determination that an impasse existed.perb declared an impasse,and the parties participated in statutory impasse proceedings,but were unable to resolve their differences regarding the arbitration issue.
cfa filed an unfair labor practice charge against the university.perb concluded that by insisting to impasse a proposal that would preserve existing contractual limits on the authority of an arbitrator to decide grievances regarding appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion,the university violated its duty to bargain in good faith.perb reasoned,in substance,that section,subdivision b,guarantees a minimum right to an arbitration that will result in a final decision as provided in section,subdivision a,and that limiting the scope of the arbitrator power in the manner of prior agreements would dilute that right.perb relied primarily on the language of the statutes,and on the legislative history of section,subdivision b.perb rejected the university contention that the legislative history of section was more relevant than that of section,subdivision b.
the university petitioned for review,cal.rules of court,rule.we granted review,and now reverse perb decision.
discussion 
the university contends that neither the plain meaning of the statutory language,nor the relevant legislative history,supports perb statutory interpretation.cfa and perb disagree,echoing the reasoning of perb decision.we conclude that the university is correct.the plain meaning of the statutory language does not prohibit a memorandum of understanding from defining the powers of the arbitrator to review a campus president decision on appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion.moreover,consideration of the relevant legislative of section,not that of section,subdivision b leads to the same conclusion.
plain meaning 
statutory interpretation begins with the plain meaning of the language used.when construing a statute,we must ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.we begin by examining the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.the words,however,must be read in context,considering the nature and purpose of the statutory enactment.citation.in this regard,sentences are not to be viewed in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme.citation torres automobile club of california cal th,d.
perb interpretation of a statute within its area of expertise is to be regarded with deference by a court performing the judicial function of statutory construction,and will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous.citations.it is,however,the duty of this court,when a question of law is properly presented,to state the true meaning of the statute even though this requires the overthrow of an earlier administrative construction.citation.citation.cumero,supra,cal d at.
in the instant case,the plain meaning of sections,subdivision b,and section,subdivision a,does not support perb interpretation.according to perb,the plain meaning of these statutes is that an employee,at minimum,has the right to a final decision by an arbitrator on the merits of the particular grievance.presumably,the legislature was fully aware of the grievance procedures in the various mous and executive orders when it passed senate bill no.if the legislature intended to incorporate specific aspects of these grievance procedures as part of the statutory floor,it could have done so.instead,the legislature in senate bill no.established a statutory minimum right to a final decision by an arbitrator unless a greater benefit is negotiated and it must be presumed that the legislature intended as much.a proposal to limit the arbitrator authority would create a lesser,not a greater,benefit or right than the right to a final decision by an arbitrator.to conclude otherwise would reduce the adoption of the minimum rights concept in senate bill no.to an idle act,changing nothing in the area of grievance and arbitration rights.
this analysis is fatally flawed.section,subdivision b,provides in relevant part that section establishes a minimum level of benefits or rights,and is superseded by a memorandum of understanding only if the relevant terms of the memorandum of understanding provide more than the minimum level of benefits or rights set forth in that section.by its plain meaning,this language simply establishes the benefits or rights of section as a minimum level,and makes the terms of a memorandum of understanding ineffective to the extent they provide lesser benefits or rights.this language does not declare what these minimum benefits or rights are.indeed,because t he words of a statute are to be interpreted in the sense in which they would have been understood at the time of the enactment people cruz cal th,d,it would be anomalous if the enactment of section,subdivision b,purported to define the terms of section,subdivision a,enacted years earlier in.
even if section,subdivision b,were relevant to discern the meaning of section,perb reasoning would nonetheless be flawed.perb concluded that the legislature was aware of the grievance proceedings of prior executive orders and memoranda of understanding.because the legislature did not incorporate those procedures into section,subdivision b,perb inferred that the legislature intended to preclude them.perb inference,however,is contrary to settled standards of statutory construction.when the legislature is aware of prior practice,but fails to change it in a later statutory enactment,courts infer not that the enactment expresses legislative disapproval,but rather that it expresses legislative acknowledgment that the practice is consistent with legislative intent.elk county water dist.department of forestry fire protection th,d horn swoap d.thus,the legislature failure to mention prior grievance procedures in section,subdivision b,to the extent it is relevant at all,suggests implied approval of those procedures.
according to perb,the conclusion that the parties may restrict the power of the arbitrator would reduce the adoption of the minimum rights in section,subd.b to an idle act because it would change nothing in the area of grievance and arbitration rights.perb is incorrect.before section,subdivision b,the university had the power to negotiate away the core grievance procedures of section.those procedures include the right of all academic employees,including all temporary employees who have been employed for more than one semester or quarter to the following a public hearing before a faculty hearing committee subds.a the right to representation and to a complete record of the hearing subd.a the right to arbitration of any disagreement between the decision of the faculty committee and the decision of the campus president subd.a the right to have the university bear the costs of arbitration subd.a and the right to a procedure for selection of a neutral arbitrator subd.a.
the change worked by section,subdivision b,was to deprive the university of the ability to eliminate these rights through collective bargaining.that change certainly was not an idle act.and in any event,it is an act that says nothing about the scope of the rights enshrined in section inquiry that depends on the language of that section.
section requires the university to establish grievance and disciplinary action procedures for academic employees that include certain listed requirements.among these,as we have noted,is the requirement that grievances shall be heard by a faculty hearing committee,which shall make a recommendation to the president of the state university,subd.a,and that i f there is a disagreement between the faculty hearing committee decision and the state university president decision,the matter shall go before an arbitrator whose decision shall be final,subd.a,italics added.the requirement that a dispute be submitted to an arbitrator for a final decision does not preclude limits on the scope of review leading to the decision,or on the remedies that may be implemented by the decision.
historically in california,the concept of a final arbitral decision means that the arbitrator resolution of a claim will be binding on the parties,and will settle the dispute presented without judicial intervention,save for the limited judicial review provided by code of civil procedure section,et.see moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,agreement to arbitrate presumes that the arbitration award will be conclusive as to the parties,with minimal judicial intervention moncharsh renaissance hotel associates th,d to constitute an arbitration,a proceeding must require,inter alia,a final and binding decision trollope jeffries d.arbitral decision entitled to res judicata effect because it is conclusive as to parties rights in the dispute they have presented to the arbitrator,subject to limited power of the court to confirm,correct,or vacate see also thibodeau crum th,d same code civ,arbitrators award shall include a determination of all the questions submitted to the arbitrators the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy.although in this sense an arbitrator decision is final,the parties are free to negotiate contract terms that define the arbitrator powers and limit the available remedies.mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d,see also moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.nothing in the language of section suggests that by providing for a final decision by an arbitrator,the legislature meant to depart from the common understanding of arbitral finality,and meant to refer only to a decision reached after unfettered review by the arbitrator.perb assumption that a final arbitral decision requires unlimited review and unlimited remedies is simply unsupported by the statutory language.
the plain meaning of the statutory language is unambiguous as applied to the instant case,and controls the result.see jones construction superior court th,d.the present dispute arose because the university proposes to define the powers of the arbitrator to review a campus president decision on matters of faculty appointment,reappointment,promotion or tenure the proposed limits would permit the arbitrator to overturn the decision for procedural error only if the error was proved by clear and convincing evidence and was prejudicial would provide that the normal remedy for such procedural error is a remand for reevaluation,with the arbitrator having authority to retain jurisdiction and would restrict the arbitrator power to grant appointment,reappointment,promotion or tenure to only extreme cases where the campus decision was not based on reasoned judgment,where it was certain that appointment,reappointment,promotion,or tenure would have been granted but for the error,and where no other alternative is practicable.
none of these proposed limits affects the finality of the arbitrator decision within the meaning of section,subdivision a the arbitrator decision would be binding on the parties,would settle the dispute presented,and would be reached without judicial intervention save limited judicial review.hence none of these provisions,if incorporated into a memorandum of understanding,would provide a lesser level of rights or benefits than those of section.
cfa asserts that by limiting the normal remedy for procedural error to a remand for reconsideration,the university proposal would not ensure a decision by the arbitrator shall be final,subd.a,italics added.according to cfa,a remand would require further proceedings,and possibly renewed arbitration.perhaps so,but that does not violate the requirement of a final arbitral decision.as here relevant,a grievance is an allegation by an employee that the employee was directly wronged in connection with the rights accruing to his or her appointment,reappointment,tenure,promotion,reassignment,or the like,subd.b.if the allegation were that the employee was directly wronged by a procedural error that led to the president disagreement with the faculty committee recommendation,an arbitral resolution finding procedural error but remanding for reconsideration is a binding resolution of the particular claim made.it is thus final as the term is generally understood in the arbitration context.moreover,that an additional arbitration proceeding may occur does not mean that no final arbitral decision will be reached consistent with section,subdivision a.the principle of arbitral finality does not preclude the arbitrator from making a final disposition of a submitted matter in more than one award.hightower superior court th,d.
cfa erroneously contends that the university proposal would permit review only of procedural errors,not the substance of the president decision.thus,according to cfa,the proposal fails to meet the mandate of section,subdivision a,that the matter in cfa view,meaning the procedure and the merits of the president submitted to arbitration.however,the university proposal contemplates review of both procedure and substance.under the university proposal,the arbitrator award must be based solely upon the evidence and arguments appropriately presented by the parties in the hearing and upon any briefs.see fn,ante.
besides the provision governing procedural error,the proposal states that the arbitrator may grant appointment,reappointment,promotion or tenure,when the president decision was not based on reasoned judgment but for that failure of reasoned judgment,it can be stated with certainty that appointment,reappointment,promotion,or tenure would have been granted and no other alternative except that remedy has been demonstrated by the evidence as a practicable remedy available to resolve the issue.
by requiring that the arbitrator decision be based on the evidence and arguments,and by permitting the arbitrator to determine whether the president decision was supported by reasoned judgment,the university proposal necessarily contemplates that the arbitrator would be empowered to examine the substance of the president decision,albeit under a deferential standard of review.further,if the arbitrator concluded that the president judgment was not reasoned,the arbitrator would be able to set aside the president decision under the limited conditions that appointment,reappointment,tenure,or promotion would otherwise have been granted and the impracticality of any other remedy.thus,cfa is incorrect in asserting that the university proposal would prevent the arbitrator from examining the merits of the president decision.
in short,we find nothing in the plain meaning of the statutory language to support perb decision.on that basis alone,perb statutory interpretation is clearly erroneous.nonetheless,because perb reached the issue,we also consider the relevant legislative history.that,too,fails to support perb construction.
legislative history 
perb looked exclusively to the legislative history of senate bill,which as enacted became section,subdivision b.perb concluded that t he dominant thread that runs throughout the legislative history is that sb was intended to establish that the law relative to grievance and disciplinary actions was a statutory floor,and that these rights in particular,education code section,which mandates that the arbitrator decision shall be final can not be eliminated or reduced through collective bargaining.
although perb accurately describes the legislative history of senate bill,that history has nothing to do with defining the rights set forth in section.in passing senate bill,legislature did not purport to characterize the meaning of a final arbitral decision,subd.a.even it had,the validity of such a retroactive characterization would be questionable at best.see peralta community college dist.fair employment housing com.cal d,the declaration of a later legislature is of little weight in determining the relevant intent of the legislature that enacted the law.in short,the legislative history of senate bill shows that the legislature intended to establish the grievance procedures of section as minimum it shows nothing m
