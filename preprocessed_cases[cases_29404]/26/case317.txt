opinion of the court 
former punxsutawney area high school student melissa donovan appeals from an adverse decision concluding that the equal access act did not entitle her to convene a bible club during her school morning activity period a time during which other noncurriculum related student groups met.specifically,she appeals from the district court denial of her motion for a preliminary injunction and the court simultaneous determination that the activity period did not qualify as noninstructional time under the equal access act,et,such that the eaa limited open forum mandates were not triggered.she also contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that the first amendment establishment clause prohibits the bible club from meeting during the activity period.
because donovan has graduated pending this review we conclude that her request for injunctive and declaratory relief is moot,but that her claims for damages and attorney fees remain viable.accordingly,as part of deciding whether the eaa requires that punxsutawney area high school allow the bible club to meet during the activity period,we must determine,in particular,whether noninstructional time encompasses the activity period at issue so as to trigger the eaa.we conclude that it does.we also conclude that pahs has engaged in impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the first amendment and that speculative establishment clause concerns do not justify pahs preventing the bible club from meeting during the activity period.
punxsutawney area high school pahs is a punxsutawney area school district public secondary school that receives federal financial assistance.following a homeroom period each day from to,pahs holds an activity period from until.during the activity period,students have free reign in a closed universe.they may go to club meetings,study hall or student government gatherings.they may take tests,hang out in the gymnasium or library,or attend tutoring programs and college test prep clinics.alternatively,they may remain in homeroom.students may not,however,leave the campus.the first classroom period begins immediately after this activity period.
through an informal permission process,pahs grants official recognition to the clubs that meet during the activity period.with official recognition,a club may post signs about upcoming meetings and gain access to the public address system.each club must have a faculty sponsor who is not required to participate actively meetings.among the voluntary,noncurriculum related groups that meet during the activity period are the ski club,an and club called students against destructive decisions,and the future health services club.
appellant melissa donovan is a pahs senior who leads a bible club known as fish.the focuses on community services and other issues of concern to students of pahs from a christian and ends every meeting with a prayer.although donovan never asked permission for fish to meet as a club during the activity period because she knew that the answer would be no,appellees punxsutawney area school board,district superintendent thomas frantz,former pahs principal allen towns and current pahs principal david london have stipulated that fish may not meet during the activity period due to the club religious ties.fish is not recognized as an official school club,but the school board has permitted the club to meet at pahs before mandatory attendance from until time during which no other club meets.
on january,her suit under the first amendment,the fourteenth amendment,and the equal access act,et.in her initial complaint,she sought a temporary restraining order,a preliminary injunction,and a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from denying her access to school facilities for the bible club during the activity period nominal damages,presumed damages,compensatory damages punitive damages and all compensable costs and attorney fees.app.ii at.she contended that pahs and the school board improperly infringed on her first amendment right to free speech by denying fish access to school facilities solely on the basis of the club religious nature.donovan moved for a preliminary injunction to force pahs and the school board to permit fish to meet during the activity period pending a final decision.after a hearing,the district court denied the motion in its findings of fact,conclusions of law and order of september,concluding that donovan was not likely to succeed on the merits of her claims.the district court held that the eaa did not apply to the activity period because the activity period did not qualify as noninstructional time as that term is defined in the statute.it also held that the school refusal to allow the club to meet during the activity period did not violate the first amendment because school officials had a compelling interest in not violating the establishment donovan first amendment interests.
on october,upon the agreement of the parties that the district court denial of the preliminary injunction resolved all the issues,the district court entered a final order closing the case and denying all relief.on october,donovan filed a timely notice of appeal.

we begin with the first prong of the test.although we quite reasonably concluded in brody that the challenge to religious speech in a graduation ceremony by students who had not yet graduated was not moot because the length of the senior year was clearly too short to complete litigation and appellate review of a case of this complexity,brody,at citing bd.of educ.rowley,d,the exception can not rescue donovan appeal from the perils of mootness.a case challenging pahs ban of the bible club from the activity period will not always evade review.a pahs sophomore,for example,who challenges the ban would enjoy a window in which to litigate the issue to completion.donovan graduated on june,and she no longer has a reasonable expectation of being subjected to the policy.
as to the second prong,there is no reasonable expectation that donovan will be subjected to the same action again she has graduated and will never again return to pahs as a student.this court may not grant her injunctive relief,as such relief would have no impact on her whatsoever.
accordingly,donovan claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is moot

because donovan claims for declaratory and injunctive relief became moot through happenstance,and for the reasons that follow,we exercise our power to vacate the district court judgment to the extent that it denied such relief.

more than years ago in widmar vincent,d,the supreme court held that a state college that sponsored a limited public forum violated the first amendment when the college denied a religious student organization equal access to its facilities.as a corollary,the court also held that permitting equal access would not contravene the first amendment establishment clause.id.at.
although the court squarely addressed the parameters of the limited public forum in the public university context,it left unresolved the question of whether the case holding extended to public secondary schools.indeed,the court distinguished younger students from their less impressionable college counterparts,who should understand that a policy of equal access for religious groups does not imply impermissible state endorsement of religion.id.at.pope brunswick bd.of,cir.
it was against this backdrop that we decided bender williamsport area sch,cir,vacated on other grounds,d a case in which we held that equal access for religious groups in public secondary schools violated the establishment clause by focusing on the differences between high school and college environments although we took account of the axioms that students do not shed their rights to freedom of speech at the schoolhouse gate,tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d,and that religious worship and discussion are forms of speech and association protected by the first amendment,widmar,at,we began by only tentatively concluding that the secondary school had created a limited public forum when it excluded a student prayer group from meeting during a regularly scheduled student activity period nearly identical to the one at pahs.bender,at.in subsequently applying the second prong of the talismanic lemon kurtzmann test to determine whether permitting the group to meet would have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and thus would violate the first amendment establishment clause,we noted that high school students stand in a very different position than university students in terms of maturity and impressionability,as they would be less able to appreciate the fact that permission for the prayer group to meet would be granted out of a spirit of neutrality toward religion and not advancement.id.at.in light of this maturity difference and the additional fact that state law mandates compulsory attendance,we held that permitting the prayer group to meet would contravene the establishment clause because the danger of communicating state approval of religion would outweigh free speech concerns.id.at.
congress,however,spoke very loudly in the days following bender by enacting the equal access act in to answer the very question left open by the majority in,whether permitting equal access to religious groups in the public secondary school setting would violate the establishment clause.equal access act,pub,stat.codified at.congress believed that it would not.
with the eaa,congress specifically made it unlawful for any public secondary school which receives federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum to deny equal access to student groups based on the religious or other nature of the speech at their proposed meetings.a.congress passed the statute to address perceived widespread discrimination against religious speech in public schools,at,at.in particular,committee reports show that the eaa was enacted partly in response to two federal appellate court decisions holding that student religious groups could not,consistent with the establishment clause,meet on school premises during noninstructional time,at discussing lubbock civil liberties union lubbock indep.sch,cir,cert.denied,d,and brandon guilderland bd.of,cir,cert.denied,d,at same.
although not mentioned by members of the house or senate,bender is precisely the sort of decision that motivated congress to pass the eaa.the district court saw bender as controlling,but we disagree,for important congressional activity and judicial interpretations of that activity took place after we issued that decision.bender came down on july,the eaa went into effect on august.in bd.of educ.of westside cmty.schs.mergens,the supreme court held that the eaa did not,at least on the facts presented there,contravene the establishment clause,d.and for the reasons set forth therein,we conclude that the same determination is mandated under the facts in the case at bar.
there is no doubt that the eaa and its jurisprudential progeny control our interpretation of the case before us today.see mergens,at.relating the legislative purposes behind the eaa pope,at noting the transition from bender to the eaa and applying the eaa in an equal access scenario.moreover,the supreme court vacated on different grounds in,rendering completely hollow the case on which the district court pinned its discussion.bender williamsport area sch,d,vacating on other grounds,bender williamsport area sch,cir.
it is now opportune to discuss the eaa and the experience of the judiciary in interpreting it.
the eaa provides that it is unlawful for any public secondary school which receives federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum to deny equal access to any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious content of the speech at such meetings.a.different from the term of art of the limited public forum established by the supreme court in its free speech cases,mergens,at,congress determined that a limited open forum is created whenever such school grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time.b.meeting is defined to include those activities of student groups which are permitted under a school limited open forum and are not directly related to the school curriculum.noninstructional time is defined to mean time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after actual classroom instruction ends.thus,even if a public secondary school allows only one noncurriculum related student group to meet,the act obligations are triggered and the school may not deny other clubs,on the basis of the content of their speech,equal access to meet on school premises during noninstructional time.mergens,at.
in mergens,the supreme court defined the term noncurriculum related student group as one that has more than just a tangential or attenuated relationship to courses offered by the school it follows,then that a student group that is curriculum related must have a more direct relationship to the curriculum than a religious or political club would have.at.the court then remarked that the term noncurriculum related student group is best interpreted broadly to mean any student group that does not directly relate to the body of courses offered by the school.id.at.
three years after mergens,we distilled the supreme court description into a test for determining when a student group directly relates to the school curriculum 
the group subject matter is or soon will be taught in a regularly offered course 
the group subject matter concerns the body of courses as a whole 
participation in the group is required in a particular course or 
academic credit is given for participation in the group.
pope brunswick bd.of,cir.explicating this test,we emphasized that the subject matter of the student group must be taught in a class.thus,a chess club does not become merely because its subject matter relates to mathematics and science by building the ability to engage in critical thought processes unless chess is actually taught,the club is a noncurriculum related student group.id.at.
applying its own test,the supreme court deemed a scuba diving club the subsurfers and the peer service group that worked with special education classes noncurriculum related groups because they did not directly relate to the curriculum as a whole or to any courses offered by the school and were not required by any courses offered by the school.mergens,at.in pope,we placed the key community service group that assists and enhances the students in developing their civic responsibilities to the community into the category of noncurriculum related student groups.pope,at.notwithstanding the board of education characterization of the key club as a service organization that draw s upon all curricula areas,we embraced the supreme court position in mergens that school systems may not evade the act requirements by strategically describing existing student groups.id.at quoting mergens,at.
the case before us presents no such complex problem on this front.pahs allows a ski club and an and alcohol club students against destructive decisions,among others,to meet during the school activity period.these clubs are even less tangentially related to the curriculum than was the key club in pope.accordingly,the door to the limited open forum designation is ajar,but not yet wide open.
the issue then comes whether the activity period during which at least one noncurriculum related group meets constitutes noninstructional time under the eaa.the eaa defines noninstructional time as time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after actual classroom instruction ends.
because neither this court nor the supreme court has yet to expound on the meanings of noninstructional time or actual classroom instruction,we begin with the plain meaning of the statute.united states hodge,cir see also smith fid.consumer disc,cir the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.where the intent of congress has been expressed in reasonably plain terms,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.griffin oceanic contractors,d.recourse to the legislative history is unnecessary in light of the plain meaning of the statutory text.zubi,cir quoting darby cisneros,d.
the plain meaning of noninstructional time,as defined in,is time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after actual classroom instruction ends.the very phrases noninstructional time and actual classroom instruction demonstrate that there may very well be times in the school day during which students would not be receiving actual classroom instruction.
under this reading that is both plain and coherent,the pahs activity period falls into the category of noninstructional time.at pahs,actual classroom instruction for all students does not begin until after the conclusion of the activity period at.during the activity period,at least one noncurriculum related group meets.other students may take tests or attend tutoring programs and college test prep activities more closely related to actual classroom instruction.
that some students,however,may seek to engage in classroom instruction during the activity period does not render the entire period instructional time much as having a carton of spoiled milk in the refrigerator does not mean that the apples,tomatoes and butter are rotten and rancid too.simply because the period may fall within the more general parameters of the school day does not indicate that all time within those parameters necessarily constitutes actual classroom instruction.
nevertheless,the district court reasoning appeared to mirror that of a particular case from the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,prince jacoby,cir a decision that stands for the proposition that mere mandatory attendance marks the beginning of actual classroom instruction.after citing ceniceros bd.of trustees of the san diego unified sch,cir for the proposition that w e have already held that the plain meaning of noninstructional time is defined unambiguously in the statute as the time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after classroom instruction ends,the prince panel picked apart the plain and coherent meaning of actual classroom instruction.id.looking to legislative history,the panel reasoned that mandatory attendance combined with the availability of some classroom instruction gave rise to actual classroom instruction and thus transformed the time into instructional time.id.accordingly,it concluded that spanaway lake high school time did not qualify as noninstructional time because spanaway lake the ceniceros required to be in attendance during the period.id.the district court,too,hung its hat on this mandatory attendance rationale.donovan punxsutawney area sch,at.
focusing on the temporal aspect of the eaa,the ninth circuit in ceniceros held that a lunch period in the heart of the school which several noncurriculum related student groups met and during which no actual classroom instruction was as noninstructional time because it was time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after classroom instruction ends.ceniceros,at.it reasoned that a direct reading of the eaa dovetails perfectly with the purpose of the legislation and with the mergens court principles for construing it.id.at.recalling that the supreme court repeatedly noted that the eaa must be given a broad reading to fulfill the eaa broad purpose,the ceniceros panel concluded that o nly by interpreting noninstructional time to include lunch periods can we adhere to the supreme court instruction and have our interpretation be consistent with congress intent to provide a low threshold for triggering the act requirements.id.quoting mergens,at.
to be sure,decisions of a sister court of appeals never have the strong bite of precedent in this court.jurisprudentially speaking,they are considered persuasive argument only,and we are free to accept or reject any of their decisions.we accept ceniceros and reject prince because we believe that these two cases can not be reconciled.we are persuaded that the ceniceros panel followed precisely the same analytical roadmap that we followed in interpreting noninstructional time.we are similarly persuaded that the prince panel ignored both the teachings of ceniceros and the definition of noninstructional time set forth in the eaa.
as stated before,the eaa defines noninstructional time as time set aside by the school before actual classroom instruction begins or after actual classroom instruction ends.the prince panel conceded that time at spanaway high is a scheduled class where attendance is taken,and where no formal classroom instruction takes place,except on a voluntary,individual basis.during this time,a student may work on homework,receive tutoring with a teacher,attend school assemblies,or,with prior arrangement and scheduling,participate in a student club meeting.students are not permitted to leave campus,and attendance is taken.at emphasis added.having conceded that no formal classroom instruction takes place,the prince panel should have followed the mandatory logical rules of the categorical deductive syllogism to conclude that the activity period fell before or after actual classroom instruction,thus qualifying under the statute.the time in prince fell in the middle of the instructional school day,sandwiched between definite periods of actual classroom instruction a temporal framework identical to the lunchtime scenario in ceniceros.
to conclude that mandatory attendance means that any school period is actual classroom instruction is to undercut both the specific the language and the statutory purpose of the eaa.in mergens,a supreme court plurality found this time limitation significant because it cleverly avoids the problem of mandatory attendance requirements during sessions,which the court had previously struck down.mergens,at.citing edwards aguillard,d a case invalidating a state law requiring the teaching of creationism to students during science classes for which attendance was mandatory.see also santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d equating a policy of mandatory prayer before public school football games with school sponsorship of religion and noting that some students must attend the games due to seasonal commitments.
although pahs students must stay at the school during the activity period,they need not attend the fish bible club any meeting,for that matter.it is not mandatory attendance at the school,but mandatory attendance at the group meeting that raises establishment clause concerns.
in drafting the eaa,congress could have said before or after the school day or before or after classes,but it did not.instead,it used the concept of actual classroom instruction,which we take to mean classroom instruction in discrete areas.
it is beyond dispute that the pahs activity period kicks off before actual classroom instruction begins,as it comes after a homeroom period during which no classroom instruction occurs.once again,just as schools may not evade the act requirements by strategically describing existing student groups,pope,at quoting mergens,at,they may not do so by strategically describing an activity period.just as putting a horse sign around a cow neck does not make a bovine equine,a school decision that a activity period constitutes actual classroom instructional time does not make it so.
the district court was also to rely on the circumstance that the school district and the state school board count the activity period toward the state minimum number of hours of instruction time as a rationale for neglecting to classify the activity period as noninstructional time.donovan punxsutawney area sch,at.contrary to the district court implication,we conclude that the state interpretation of the broad phrase instructional time by definition is much more inclusive than the eaa restrictive measurement of actual classroom instruction.therefore,it is not controlling.the supremacy clause establishes that,for the purposes of eaa application,state law can not be used to frustrate application of federal law.const.art.vi,cl.
once again,in mergens,the supreme court stated that allowing school systems to define terms in a way that permits schools to evade the act would render the act merely hortatory.at.school systems can not be permitted to evade application of the eaa by stating that a period that is otherwise a limited open forum does not constitute noninstructional time under the eaa simply because the school system chooses to count that time toward the state minimum number of hours of instruction time.
having concluded that pahs violated the eaa,we now turn to donovan first amendment claim under.the district court concluded that the pahs activity period was a limited public forum for which the bible club restriction was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state,avoiding a possible transgression of the first amendment establishment clause.donovan punxsutawney area sch,at.we disagree.
in evaluating the claim that donovan first amendment rights have been violated,we have a constitutional duty to conduct an independent evaluation of the record as a whole,without deference to the trial court.christ bride ministries septa,cir citation omitted.
the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or the right of the people to peacefully assemble.const.amend religious worship and discussion are forms of speech and association protected by the first amendment.widmar vincent,d.
generally,the government may limit speech that takes place on its own property without running afoul of the first amendment.lamb chapel center moriches union free sch,d christ bride,at.where,however,the property at issue is a traditional public forum or a forum designed as public by the government,the first amendment hinders the government ability to restrict speech.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d christ bride,at.a limited public subcategory of the designated public forum is created when the government opens a nonpublic forum but limits the expressive activity to certain kinds of speakers or to the discussion of certain kinds of subjects.kreimer bureau of police,cir citation omitted.donovan and appellees agree that the pahs activity period is a limited public forum,and we will treat the period as such.
although the government may indeed restrict the limited public forum to certain subjects and certain speakers,the government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint,and the restriction must be reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.good news club milford cent,d.with regard to viewpoint restrictions,speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects can not be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint.id.at.see also rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d holding that a university engaged in improper viewpoint discrimination when it denied student activities funds to a stud
