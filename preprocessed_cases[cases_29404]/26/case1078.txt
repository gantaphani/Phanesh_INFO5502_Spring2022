statutory and regulatory background.
in,finding that more than half of the nation eight million children with disabilities were not receiving appropriate educational services,congress appropriated federal funds for state special education programs and made them available on the condition that states implement policies assuring a free appropriate public education,sometimes referred to as a fape,for all children with disabilities.a establishing right to a free appropriate public education id.c congressional findings.known then as the education of all handicapped children act eha,and today named the individuals with disabilities education act or idea,the law confers upon disabled students an enforceable substantive right to public education in participating states,and conditions federal financial assistance upon a state compliance with the substantive and procedural goals of the act.honig doe,d citation and footnote omitted see also bd.of educ.rowley,d holding that the eha established right to public education for students with disabilities that consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child,supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.
among the most important of the idea goals is the protection of parents right to be involved in the development of their child educational plan.amanda clark county sch,cir.toward this end,participating states are required to establish procedures giving parents an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.b.after making their complaint,parents are entitled to an impartial due process hearing.id.f.a decision of the due process hearing shall be final,id.i a,except that a ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section,which action may be brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the united states.id.i a.these procedures,including the available appeal,must be explained to parents in writing upon the filing of an administrative complaint.id.d.
california adopted legislation to comply with idea due process hearing requirements.cal.under state law,a parent may initiate a due process hearing regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education for a child and that hearing will be conducted at the state level.id.at a,b the decision of the hearing officer shall be the final administrative determination and binding on all parties unless a party exercis es the right to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction within days of receipt of the hearing decision.id.g,i.
distinct from the idea due process requirements,the department of education promulgated regulations pursuant to its general rulemaking authority requiring each recipient of federal funds,including funds provided through the idea,to put in place a complaint resolution procedure crp.citing as authority for rules lucht molalla river sch,cir the regulations require each state education agency to adopt written procedures for r esolving any complaint regarding the education of a child with a disability.a.the regulations permit a complaint to be filed with both the crp and the idea due process hearing system,in which case the crp must await the due process hearing resolution of overlapping issues,which is then binding in the crp.id.c.the regulations state further that the crp must resolve a complaint alleging a public agency failure to implement a due process decision.id.c.the regulations do not,however,state that a parent must exhaust the crp to enforce a due process decision in court.
to comply with the department regulations regarding the establishment of a crp,california established a uniform system of complaint processing for specified programs or activities which receive state or federal funding.regs.tit,a.these regulations authorize the state superintendent of public instruction to investigate and attempt to resolve any complaint alleging a violation of the idea,including a complaint that alleges that the local educational agency fails or refuses to comply with the idea due process procedures or has failed or refused to implement a due process hearing order.id.a viii b.in such circumstances,the superintendent shall offer to mediate the dispute and must resolve any remaining issues within days of the receipt of the complaint,absent exceptional circumstances.id.upon determination that a local agency is in violation of federal or state law,including violation of a due process hearing order,the superintendent shall notify the local agency of the action he or she will take to effect compliance,and may use any means authorized by law to effect compliance,including withholding fiscal support and proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction for an appropriate order compelling compliance.id.california regulations do not state that the crp process must be exhausted prior to suit under the idea and the crp is not listed in the description of idea due process procedures that california provides to parents upon the filing of an administrative complaint.
factual and procedural background.
dashiel porter is an autistic child,born in.he was found eligible for special education when he was three years old.on june,responding to a complaint filed by his parents,deborah and john porter,california special education hearing office seho found that dashiel had significant educational deficiencies resulting from the failure of the manhattan beach unified school district mbusd to provide dashiel a free appropriate public education.based on this finding,the seho ordered the mbusd and its board of trustees together,local defendants to provide dashiel with compensatory education during the school year.
during the course of the school year,mbusd officials held a series of meetings with the porters,but mbusd never implemented a full compensatory education program.instead,the porters hired a private tutor for dashiel at their own expense.on august,the porters filed the complaint initiating this action,listing as defendants the local defendants gerald davis,superintendent of the mbusd,and linda jones,director of pupil personnel services for the mbusd together,individual defendants and the board of education of the state of california,the california department of education and delaine eastin,superintendent of public instruction collectively,state defendants.the porters sought relief,including an injunction and monetary damages,for violations of the idea and california law related to the failure of the local and individual defendants to comply with the june seho order 
the district court dismissed the porters complaint,without prejudice,for lack of jurisdiction because they had not sought to enforce the seho order through california crp before filing suit.based on eleventh amendment immunity,the court dismissed the claim with prejudice as to the state and local defendants sued in their official capacities.the court determined that,with the dismissal of the idea and claims,there remained no jurisdictional basis to hear the porters state law claims.
the porters timely filed this appeal,challenging the dismissal of their idea and claims with respect to their allegations that the defendants failed to comply with the june seho order.thus,they frame the primary issue in this appeal as whether they were required to exhaust california crp before filing an action under the idea and to enforce a seho order that they allege was not fully implemented by the school district they also challenge the dismissal of their claims against the defendants based on eleventh amendment immunity to the extent that they seek injunctive relief.
we turn first to whether the porters met the idea administrative exhaustion requirements before filing this suit,answering this question in two parts.first,we examine whether the porters exhausted california due process procedures enacted to comply with of the idea.cal.next,we examine whether the porters were required to exhaust california crp process in addition to exhausting its due process procedures.the application of the idea statutory exhaustion requirement is predominantly a question of law that we review de novo.hoeft tucson unified sch,cir.
the idea creates a right,enforceable in federal court,to the free appropriate public education required by the statute.smith robinson,d,superseded by statute on other grounds by,stat.accord honig,at.describing the right to a free appropriate public education as an enforceable substantive right.before bringing a suit based on a violation of this right,a complainant must normally exhaust the due process hearing procedures required by the idea exhaustion requirement applies to suits under other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities seeking relief that is also available under the idea.l.the exhaustion requirement is not,however,a rigid one.hoeft,at.courts universally recognize that parents need not exhaust the procedures set forth in where resort to the administrative process would be either futile or inadequate.id.at see also honig,at.kerr ctr.parents ass charles,cir.
here,the porters exhausted california due process procedure regarding their initial complaint,receiving a seho order in their favor neither they nor the mbusd appealed that order to a court of competent jurisdiction.accordingly,the order was final and binding under the idea and state law.i a cal.g,i.
there is no dispute that the idea required the implementation of the final decision of the seho.see robinson pinderhughes,cir holding that idea procedural requirements can only be fairly construed to contemplate that once a final favorable administrative decision has been gained by a plaintiff,the state will carry out that decision although it may have opposed the position of the plaintiff in the administrative proceedings see also jeremy mount lebanon sch,cir i t would be curious for congress to have established section detailed procedural apparatus solely in order to generate advisory opinions.it is also clear that it would be futile to bring a complaint to the seho alleging the failure to implement a due process hearing order given our decision in wyner manhattan beach unified sch,cir,that the seho lacks jurisdiction to enforce its own orders.thus,we conclude that the porters complaint alleges a violation of the idea for which further exhaustion of the procedures set forth in would be futile or inadequate,allowing them to bring their claim directly to court.
defendants argue that the futility of california due process procedure for resolving the porters complaint does not end the porters exhaustion requirements,because the state crp is available to enforce the seho order.thus,the defendants argue,the porters must exhaust that process before bringing a court action.
the district court accepted the defendants argument,requiring the exhaustion of california crp without finding that congress intended such exhaustion.mccarthy madigan,d where congress specifically mandates,exhaustion is required.it noted our decision in wyner that the seho does not have jurisdiction to enforce its own orders but that california crp provides an avenue to enforce those decisions.the district court assumed technically correct,however,the porters argument that wyner did not make resort to the crp obligatory but rather held only that issues of with an seho order may be brought before the crp.porter,d at emphasis in original.the district court nonetheless found that exhaustion of the crp is preferable in light of policies that generally favor exhaustion.id.
although there is some merit in encouraging resort to the crp to allow california to correct problems before litigation and to further develop administrative records for judicial review,we conclude that the district court erred in basing its exhaustion determination on a policy analysis independent of the idea requirements.if a statute does not provide for exhaustion of administrative remedies,a district court may require exhaustion in the exercise of its discretion.hoeft,at.the idea,however,does provide administrative appeal procedures to be pursued before seeking judicial review.see.where congress has provided for the exhaustion of administrative procedures,congress intent is of paramount importance because congress is vested with the power to prescribe the basic procedural scheme under which claims may be heard in federal courts.patsy bd.of regents,d.accordingly,our inquiry is not whether general policies favor requiring the exhaustion of california crp,but whether requiring such exhaustion would be consistent with idea procedural scheme.
our starting point is the text of the idea.when congress provides a detailed exhaustion scheme,courts generally lack discretion to add additional exhaustion requirements to the scheme.patsy,at.holding that detailed exhaustion scheme of the civil rights of institutionalized persons act cripa is inconsistent with discretion to impose,on an ad hoc basis,a judicially developed exhaustion rule in other cases see also darby cisneros,d holding that it would be inconsistent with congress intent to require exhaustion of optional appeals through state procedures after an aggrieved party has exhausted all administrative remedies expressly prescribed by congress in the administrative procedures act apa.
the exhaustion scheme provided in of the idea establishes elaborate and highly specific procedural safeguards,evidencing that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.rowley,at.like that under the apa or the cripa,the idea exhaustion scheme was carefully designed to balance the individual complainant interest in retaining prompt access to a judicial forum and the countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion.see hoeft,at discussing policies served by the idea exhaustion requirement mccarthy,at.describing the balance of interests applicable in exhaustion determinations.courts therefore may not,consistent with the intent of congress,impose exhaustion requirements that merely add additional steps not contemplated in the scheme of the act.antkowiak ambach,cir holding that state could not conduct sua sponte review of unappealed due process hearing order diamond mckenzie,holding that state may not subject children and their parents to an additional step not required by the eha.
requiring exhaustion of california crp to file suit based on a failure to implement an unappealed administrative order would add an additional step of administrative exhaustion not contemplated by the idea.once a due process hearing issues an order that is not appealed by either party,the idea requires that the order be treated as final.i a.no other administrative procedures are required to be exhausted.this clear congressional demarcation of an end point to the due process procedures weighs heavily in our conclusion that congress did not intend to allow states to add additional exhaustion requirements not identified in the statute.
we are not aware of any court that has held that the idea requires exhaustion of a state crp in addition
