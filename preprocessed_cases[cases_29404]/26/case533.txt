on november,the people of michigan approved a statewide ballot amended the michigan constitution to prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment based on race or gender in the operation of public employment,public education or public contracting in the state.under the michigan constitution,the proposal was scheduled to go into effect on december.at stake today is whether the federal courts should permit this state initiative to go into effect or whether we should preliminarily enjoin it in the part,that is,that applies to public universities and to all applicants to those universities.while the michigan state courts remain free to suspend enforcement of proposal under state law for all manner of reasons,including those urged upon us about the meaning of the law,uncertainty about the law impact on current admissions policies and uncertainty about changing admissions policies in the middle of the current enrollment are unable to identify any tenable basis under federal law for suspending the law enforcement.the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,to be sure,permit states to use racial and gender preferences under narrowly defined circumstances.but they do not mandate them,and accordingly they do not prohibit a state from eliminating them.in the absence of any likelihood of prevailing in invalidating this state initiative on federal grounds,we have no choice but to permit its enforcement in accordance with the framework that gave it birth.
legal and policy debates about admissions preferences in the university setting are not new to the people of michigan.in,the supreme court invalidated the university of michigan admissions preferences in gratz bollinger,d,and it upheld the university of michigan school of law admissions preferences in grutter bollinger,d.in apparent response to those decisions,the michigan civil rights initiative,the executive director of which is jennifer gratz,the lead plaintiff in gratz bollinger,began a campaign to place a proposal on the state ballot that would amend the michigan constitution to prohibit preferences in public employment,education and contracting.see the michigan civil rights initiative,last visited.
on january,gratz announced that her organization had obtained enough signatures under michigan law to place its named proposal but commonly referred to as proposal the statewide ballot.see last visited.the michigan board of state canvassers eventually approved the ballot language for proposal,which would amend article i,of the michigan constitution if approved.
on november,the people of michigan voted in favor of proposal.percent of the voters supported it,and opposed it.see michigan department of state,official michigan general election results,last visited.
the constitutional amendment contains several pertinent provisions.first the university of michigan,michigan state university,wayne state university and any other public college or university,community college,or school district shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.const.art.i.
second the state shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.id.
third this section namely the amendment does not prohibit action that must be taken to establish or maintain eligibility for any federal program,if ineligibility would result in a loss of federal funds to the state.id.
fourth the remedies available for violations of this section shall be the same as are otherwise available for violations of michigan law.see.const.art.viii.comp.laws et the civil rights act.
fifth this section shall be.if any part or parts of this section are found to be in conflict with the united states constitution or federal law,the section shall be implemented to the maximum extent that the united states constitution and federal law permit.any provision held invalid shall be severable from the remaining portions of this section.const.art.i.
sixth this section does not invalidate any court order or consent decree that is in force as of the effective date of this section.id.
seventh in accordance with the michigan constitution,the amendment was scheduled to go into effect days after the election,which is to say december.see.const.art.xii.
on november,one day after the election,the coalition to defend affirmative action,integration and immigrant rights,and fight for equality by any means necessary,along with other organizations and individuals opposed to proposal collectively,the plaintiffs,filed a lawsuit against jennifer granholm,the governor of michigan,and the regents of the university of michigan,the board of trustees of michigan state university and the board of governors of wayne state university collectively,the universities,seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendment was invalid and a permanent injunction against its enforcement.they filed the lawsuit in the southern division of the eastern district of michigan.in their amended complaint,plaintiffs contended that proposal violates two federal constitutional provisions the first and fourteenth amendments,three federal civil rights statutes title vi,title vii and title ix and one presidential order executive order.to date,plaintiffs have not independently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order against enforcement of proposal.
on december,the universities filed a against governor granholm,seeking a declaratory judgment that under federal law the universities may continue to use their existing admissions and financial aid policies through the end of the current enrollment cycle and a preliminary injunction that allows the universities to continue to use their existing admissions and financial aid policies through the end of the current cycle.in support of their requests,the universities noted that s erious controversies exist regarding the validity,meaning,impact,and application of the amendment t he governor has requested an interpretation of the amendment from the state civil rights commission in days,but they can not await the commission decision given the effective date december of the law t he amendment becomes effective in the midst of the universities current admission and financial aid cycle,which generally run s from the early fall through the spring and f orcing the universities to abandon their existing admissions and financial aid policies in the midst of this cycle would require them to apply different policies to applicants within the same cycle and different policies than they have announced to the public.
in further support of their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief,the universities argued that t he amendment implicates federal law.it incorporates,they noted,whole bodies of federal law by reference,including federal programs,federal law,and the united states constitution.the universities,they added,put their admissions and financial aid policies in place in reliance on the supreme court reaffirmation in grutter bollinger,d,that they have an academic freedom right,based in the first amendment to the constitution of the united states,to select their students and that they may,in the course of doing so,give some consideration to such factors as race.on the same day,they filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,seeking the same enjoin the enforcement of proposal through the end of the current admissions cycle.
on december,three days after the universities filed their,the michigan attorney general,michael cox,filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit.see.the district court granted the attorney general motion to intervene that same day.
on december,the three sets of parties to the governor,the attorney general,the the plaintiffs in the underlying action filed a stipulation with the district court,which reads in part 
it is hereby stipulated,by and between the parties that this court may order as follows 
that the application of const,art.i,to the current admissions and financial aid policies of the university parties is enjoined through the end of the current admissions and financial aid cycles and no later than on july,at which time this stipulated injunction will expire 
that,pursuant to.a and c,the universities shall be and hereby is dismissed in its entirety,with prejudice only as to the specific injunctive relief requested in the 
stipulation at.
that same day,matters grew more complicated when an individual and an interest group sought to intervene in the case.the individual was eric russell,a white male who has applied to the university of michigan school of law for admission in the fall of,affidavit of eric russell,at the organization was toward a fair michigan tafm,a entity whose mission is to further understanding of equal opportunity issues involved in guaranteeing civil rights for all citizens,affidavit of william allen,at.
on december,the district court issued what it labeled a temporary injunction.consistent with the stipulation entered into by the governor,the attorney general,the universities and the plaintiffs,the court enjoined application of proposal to the universities admissions and policies until july,and dismissed the universities.dist.order at.in essence,then,the dismissed their claim for an ordinary preliminary injunction in exchange for the stipulated injunction.however the injunction is labeled,it remains a preliminary injunction,albeit one of finite duration.
that same day,russell and tafm filed a motion urging the district court to rule on their motion to intervene by december and requesting a stay of the order enjoining enforcement of proposal before its effective.
on december,having heard nothing from the district court on their intervention or stay motions,russell and tafm filed a notice of appeal to this court.the next day,they filed in this court an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal of the district court preliminary injunction and a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to grant their motion to intervene and to vacate its preliminary injunction.
on december,we issued an order giving the parties to the the governor,the attorney general,the universities as well as the plaintiffs in the underlying action an opportunity to file responses to the motions by december.the order also gave russell and tafm an opportunity to file a reply brief by december.the city of lansing,the american civil rights foundation and the michigan civil rights initiative committee each moved this court for leave to respond to russell motion and attached briefs to their motions.because the district court has now denied their motions to intervene,and the denials have not been resolved on appeal,these entities are not parties to this action.nonetheless,we have considered their filings as we would the filings of amici curiae.
on december,the district court ruled on the motions to intervene.it granted russell motion and denied tafm motion both as of right and by permission.at the same time,it denied motions to intervene filed by the city of lansing michigan,the american civil rights foundation and the michigan civil rights initiative committee.the district court has not ruled on russell motion for a stay pending appeal.
on december,russell and tafm filed an amended notice of appeal with respect to the preliminary injunction issued by the district court on december.tafm also appealed the denial of its motion to intervene,as did the american civil rights foundation and the michigan civil rights initiative committee and the city of lansing.
let us be clear that the merits of the appeal of the order granting the preliminary injunction and the appeals of the orders denying the motions to intervene are not before this panel.in addition to the petition for a writ of mandamus,the only matter presently before this panel is the motion filed by eric russell under his previously filed appeal,titled emergency motion for a stay pending appeal,asking us to stay the district court preliminary other words,to allow article i,section of the michigan constitution to take immediate such time as russell appeal can be decided on the merits.
as an initial matter,russell plainly may challenge the validity of the preliminary injunction.he has standing to participate in the case because he has applied for admission to the university of michigan school of law for matriculation in and accordingly has a direct interest in whether proposal applies to the law school admissions decisions this year.and he may intervene as of right in the case for one of two reasons.either the district court failure to address his meritorious intervention motion before the effective date of proposal on december amounted to an effective denial of the motion,which we may correct on appeal and indeed have done so before in a similar setting,see americans united for separation of church state city of grand rapids,cir,and which we may review on an interlocutory basis,see sales marshall,cir.or the district court order granting the intervention motion on december permitted russell to file a new notice of appeal,which he did on december and which allowed him to seek immediate review of the preliminary injunction.either way,russell is now a party in the case he has filed a notice of appeal with respect to the preliminary injunction we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from a preliminary injunction,a he has filed a motion for an emergency stay pending appeal and we may review the stay motion in connection with our authority over the appeal of the preliminary injunction.
our standard for reviewing a motion for a stay pending appeal is a familiar one.much like the standard for determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,baker adams valley sch,cir per curiam,we consider the likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the merits of the appeal the likelihood that the moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay the prospect that others will be harmed if the court grants the stay and the public interest in granting the stay.coal.of radioactive material users,griepentrog,cir.all four factors are not prerequisites but are interconnected considerations that must be balanced together.id.
there are several ways to look at the likelihood that the district court preliminary injunction order will be upheld on appeal,and each of them holds little promise that we will be able to uphold the order.first,the order itself does not contain a sufficient ground for prohibiting proposal from going into effect.by its terms,the order rests on two grounds a stipulation from all parties to the case which at that time included the plaintiffs in the underlying action,the universities,the governor and the attorney general consenting to the preliminary injunction sought by the universities,and the court conclusion that the interests of all parties and the public are represented adequately by these parties.order at.the order does not contain any discussion of the grounds for granting an injunction.it does not contain any evidentiary findings concerning the need for immediate relief.and it does not address the four factors for granting a preliminary injunction the universities likelihood of success on the merits of their the risk of irreparable injury to affected parties with or without the preliminary injunction and the public interest.see six clinics holding.ii cafcomp,cir requir ing a district court to make specific findings concerning each of the four factors united states sch.dist.of ferndale,cir vacating district court ruling because among other reasons the district court failed to make an express finding as to probability of success on the merits.
whether stipulated injunctions concerning the federal constitutionality of a state a state constitutional a good idea,bad idea or even a permissible idea need not detain us in gauging the merits of this stay motion.see evans city of chicago,cir en banc plurality opinion t he court must ensure that there is a substantial federal claim,not only when the decree is entered but also when it is enforced,and that the obligations imposed by the decree rest on this rule of federal law rather than the bare consent of the office holder.league of united latin american citizens clements,cir en banc courts must be especially cautious when state officials seek to achieve by consent decree what they can not achieve by their own authority.williams vukovich,cir judicial approval may not be obtained for an agreement which is contrary to the public interest.the fact remains that this stipulated injunction was flawed on its own terms.from the day it was entered december,it could not be said that the injunction furthered the interests of all parties and the public.by december,it was clear that at least one member of the public eric russell did not support the suspension of proposal because by then he and others had filed a motion to intervene as of right in the lawsuit precisely because he and others disagreed with the parties stipulated his case because it would jeopardize his efforts to gain admission to the law school in the class.
subsequent events confirm that the stipulated injunction did not account for the concerns of all interested,the district court december order granting russell intervention as of right.intervention order at see.a requiring intervention as of right when the individual has an interest in the case and is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.in permitting russell to intervene as a party in the case,the trial court concluded that his individual interest may not be taken into account by the present parties.intervention order at emphasis added.that seems to be an understatement.the parties knew of russell opposition to the stipulated injunction,to say nothing of the opposition to the injunction by other interested groups seeking to intervene in the case including the proponent of proposal,and nonetheless proceeded to seek its entry.even now,the closest they have come to accounting for his interests in the case is to say that he is free to reapply if the law school denies him admission this year.universities br.at.in the final analysis,the only articulated basis provided for the it furthered the interests of all parties and the public is not true and thus does not suffice to sustain the injunction.
second,even if we look behind the court december order to the universities and motion for a preliminary injunction,these filings do not supply a basis for enjoining the law on the ground that it violates federal constitutional or statutory law.most of these pleadings deal with and arguments the difficulty of changing admissions and policies in the midst of an enrollment cycle,uncertainty over the meaning of the amendment under state law and the delay that will occur before the michigan civil rights commission acts on the governor request to interpret the amendment within reasons for seeking delay,to be sure,but none of them pertinent to establishing a federal ground for suspending the law.as to that point,the universities request for a preliminary injunction says just one they have a first amendment right to continue using race and preferences.more on that argument later.the salient point,however,is that the request for a stipulated injunction was not premised on any agreement,or even suggestion,that proposal violated any federal or otherwise.that of course is because the attorney general has taken the position that proposal is perfectly constitutional and the governor has not yet taken any position on the issue.
also unhelpful is the universities position that the federal courts should determin e their rights and responsibilities under the amendment and delay the effective date of the law until that task has been completed.at.this suggestion looks at the problem through the wrong end of the lens.state courts and state agencies such as the michigan civil rights commission generally get the first and ultimately the last crack at interpreting a state is why uncertainty over the meaning of a state law often counsels in favor of a federal court staying its hand until the state courts have had a chance to construe the law.see comm of pullman.we know of no authority and none has been supplied to us saying that uncertainty over the meaning of a state law by itself supplies a basis for a federal court to suspend the law effective date.
that the meaning of the amendment could be affected by the meaning of certain federal statutes,as the universities also complained,does not change matters.at.the universities never explained what those federal laws were or exactly how they would affect the meaning of the amendment.but even if the universities had suggested,say,that title vi of the civil rights act of might conflict with proposal under certain constructions of the amendment and certain constructions of title vi,that would not give a federal court license to suspend the amendment.one would first want to know how the state was implementing the amendment before undertaking the task of determining whether that interpretation conflicted with some construction of title vi.
all of this is prelude to the most unusual feature of the stipulated injunction the premise for granting it no longer exists.the universities filed a against the governor and effectively the attorney general once he had intervened seeking a declaration of their rights and responsibilities under proposal and a preliminary injunction until that had been done.but in return for the attorney general and governor stipulating to a preliminary injunction,the universities agreed to dismiss the request for declaratory relief.so while the district court has suspended the effective date of the law,it no longer has the universities request or any other request before it for declaring the universities rights and responsibilities under the for that matter any other explanation for enjoining the law,save for the fact that some interested parties want it stayed.
in view of this point,it puzzles us that the attorney general,who stipulated to the entry of the preliminary injunction,now contends that we lack jurisdiction to entertain a motion to stay it.why because,he says,the universities underlying has now been dismissed and because the district court did not permit russell to become a party to the case until after that dismissal.but of course russell was allowed to intervene in the action.a,not a,and that action is alive and well.the attorney general,moreover,seems to ignore what would seem to be a corollary to his proposed interpretation of this sequence of that if the had already been dismissed,there would no longer be any basis for a preliminary injunction,see supra,and the district court could not have undertaken the necessary inquiry into the parties likelihood of success on the,much less found that any such probability of success existed.
third,the responses to the stay motion filed in our court by the four sets of parties to the stipulated governor,the attorney general,the universities and the plaintiffs in the underlying do not support the injunction.while all four of them argue extensively about the hardships of complying with the law in the middle of the admissions cycle,they do not offer tenable explanations for suspending proposal on the basis of federal law.
far from raising doubts about the validity of the amendment under federal law,the attorney general thoroughly explains why it does not violate the federal constitution or any federal statutes.while the governor does not expressly defend the validity of the amendment in her appellate papers,neither does she say that it violates any federal law.
the first amendment.in their response to the stay motion,the universities argue that the amendment violates the first amendment,specifically the universities right to select a diverse student body in the name of academic freedom.but it is one thing to defer to a state university judgment in deciding who may attend that to defer in the process to the university academic freedom that long has been viewed as a special concern of the first amendment,regents of the of cal.bakke,d opinion of powell,in determining whether the university has run the gauntlet of defending presumptively unconstitutional racial classifications.it is quite another to say that the first amendment in general and academic freedom in particular prohibit a state from eliminating racial preferences.were it otherwise,as russell points out,state laws requiring colleges to give preferences to state residents or to admit those in the top of their high school classes would routinely violate the first amendment.stay motion at.
the universities mistake interests grounded in the first their interests in selecting student first amendment rights.it is not clear,for example,how the universities,as subordinate organs of the state,have first amendment rights against the state or its voters.see,trs.of dartmouth coll.woodward,wheat.one does not generally think of the first amendment as protecting the state from the people but the other way the amendment protecting individuals from the state.after all,bakke,grutter and lead cases upon which the universities rely in claiming that proposal violates the first constitutional challenges by individuals against states or at least state officials.even then,the states invocation of the first amendment in those cases hardly shows that the first amendment trumps the fourteenth.in bakke and gratz,the court invalidated the racial preferences contained in the schools admissions programs under the equal protection clause.and while grutter upheld the school of law use of racial classifications in making its admissions decisions,that was not because the first amendment compelled it to do so.grutter addresses academic freedom in the context of asking whether the law school use of race is justified by a compelling state interest,at,a question it answers by saying that its decision is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university academic decisions,within constitutionally prescribed limits.id.at.emphasis added see bakke,at.opinion of powell,stating that the attainment of a diverse student body is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.one of those constitutionally prescribed limits,however,is the separate requirement of narrow inquiry that no one maintains may be satisfied simply by invoking a university legitimate,but hardly dispositive,interest in academic freedom.
in discussing the requirement,moreover,grutter urged universities to look to states that had eliminated the use of race in making admissions decisions to determine whether ways of furthering the universities interests in a diverse student body existed.see at.universities in california,florida,and washington state,where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law,are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.universities in other states can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these alternatives as they develop.if,as the universities maintain,the first amendment prohibits states from eliminating racial preferences in admissions,one would not expect the court to urge universities to consider the efficacy of state laws doing just that.no less strange,grutter ends by explaining that affirmative action programs may not exist in perpetuity.noting that it has been years since bakke,it remarked that w e expect that years from now,the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.id.at.the first amendment,by contrast,has no termination point,whether in,or years,making it improbable that the same court that decided grutter would hold that state universities have a first amendment right to maintain racial preferences.
the equal protection clause.the plaintiffs in the underlying action offer a host of other arguments for sustaining the preliminary injunction.in addition to invoking the first amendment,they claim that the amendment likely violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.we do not agree.
in contending that the equal protection clause compels what it presumptively prohibits,plaintiffs face a steep climb.the clause prevents official conduct discriminating on the basis of race,washington davis,d,and on the basis of sex,united states virginia,d,not official conduct that bans discriminat ion against or preferential treatment to individuals on the basis of race or proposal does.
if d istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,hirabayashi united states,and if racial distinctions threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility,shaw reno,d citations omitted,a state constitutional amendment designed to eliminate such distinctions in state government would seem to be an virtue,not an vice.after all,the goal of the equal protection clause,plessy ferguson.harlan,dissenting,is to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race,palmore sidoti,d citation and footnote omitted,making it difficult to understand how the same constitutional provision could prohibit a state from doing away with race and classifications sooner rather than later.see crawford bd.of educ.of the city of los angeles,d t he equal protection clause is not violated by the mere repeal of legislation or policies that were not required by the federal constitution in the first place.
grutter,it is true,says that states still may use racial classifications as a factor in school admissions when they can establish a compelling interest for doing so and when they can satisfy the demanding requirements of narrow tailoring.but grutter never said,or even hinted,that state universities must do what they narrowly may do.otherwise the court would not have directed state universities to look to u niversities in california,florida,and washington state,where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law,to draw on the most promising aspects of these alternatives as they develop,at.it would not have quoted in the next line of the opinion justice kennedy concurrence in united states lopez,d,to the effect that the states may perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best solution is far from clear such as looking for methods of seeking diverse student bodies,grutter,at.and it would not have said that w e expect that years from now,the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,id.surely a state may offer more equal protection than the fourteenth amendment requires,see oregon hass,d a state is free as a matter of its own law to impose greater restrictions than those this court holds to be necessary upon federal constitutional standards,and surely a state may end racial preferences some years before they must do so.in the end,a law eliminating presumptively invalid racial classifications is not itself a presumptively invalid racial classification.
much the same is true of classifications based on gender.without equating gender classifications,for all purposes,to classifications based on race or national origin,the court has carefully inspected official action that closes a door or denies opportunity to women or to men.united states virginia,d internal footnote and citation omitted see alabama ex rel,d o ur nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination,a history which warrants the heightened scrutiny we afford all classifications today.internal quotation marks omitted.if the equal protection clause gives heightened scrutiny to such distinctions,a state acts well within the letter and spirit of the clause when it eliminates the risk of any such scrutiny by removing gender classifications altogether in its admissions programs.
in taking this path,we do not walk alone.in,the ninth circuit rejected an equal protection challenge to a similar proposition passed by the people of california.see coal.for econ.equity
