since,the madison county school district mcsd in mississippi has been under a federal court order to desegregate its schools.on june,the mcsd filed a motion for full unitary status,claiming it had complied with the district court orders and had to the extent practicable,eliminated the vestiges of racial discrimination resulting from the former racially dual system.the united states government and a group of private citizens private plaintiffs or appellants opposed the motion and argued that the mcsd was not entitled to full unitary status.after discovery and a hearing,the district court granted the mcsd motion on april,ending more than three decades of federal court supervision over the school district.only the private plaintiffs have appealed.
the mcsd is one of many school districts in mississippi that at one time practiced de jure segregation.pursuant to the supreme court directive in alexander holmes county board of education,d,we mandated that those school districts could no longer operate a dual school system based on race or color and that each district is to operate as a unitary school system within which no person is effectively excluded from any school because of race or color.united states hinds county sch,cir quoting alexander,at.the district court for the southern district of mississippi,finding that the mcsd operated a de jure segregated school system,issued its original desegregation order in,requiring the mcsd to divide the school district into three attendance zones,implement a transportation scheme that is and,and select locations for school construction and school consolidation in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school structure once this desegregation plan is implemented.
since the issuance of the order,the district court has supervised the mcsd desegregation efforts and enforced compliance through a series of consent orders.the most recent consent order,approved by the district court on april,addressed a number of issues including school construction,transportation,transfers,staff recruitment,hiring,assignment and compensation,and the creation of a advisory committee.
on june,the mcsd filed a motion for declaration of full unitary status.following discovery,the government and private plaintiffs stipulated in a pretrial order that they did not object to a finding of unitary status with regard to eleven operational areas student assignment,except as it related to the magnet program at velma jackson high school vjhs,enforcement of student attendance zones and student transfers,transportation,extracurricular activities,transfers,special education programs,gifted programs,student discipline,the advisory committee,a title i initiative program,and the mcsd reporting obligations.
however,both the government and private plaintiffs objected to a finding of unitary status with respect to the magnet program and facilities at vjhs,and facilities at other schools.the private plaintiffs further objected to a finding of unitary status regarding faculty assignment,employment procedures,the use of sixteenth section and contributions from private groups,and an alternative school.the private plaintiffs also argued that the motion should be denied because the mcsd did not act in good faith to comply with the court orders to remedy problems in these areas.
in february,the district court held a public hearing on the mcsd motion and both sides presented witness testimony.members of the public were also invited to comment on the motion.on april,the district court issued a thorough and memorandum opinion and order concluding that the mcsd was entitled to full unitary status.based on that conclusion,the court granted the mcsd motion and dissolved all existing desegregation and consent orders.the private plaintiffs timely appealed.
a basic description of the mcsd geography is helpful in understanding the present dispute over whether the district court erred in finding that the mcsd is entitled to full unitary status.the mcsd serves all of madison county,except for an area served by the canton public school district.in the mcsd served approximately students,of whom were.by contrast,in the fall of,the mcsd served almost students,approximately of whom were and were white.pursuant to the desegregation order,the mcsd is divided into three zones.zone i,located in the northeast part of madison county,covers a geographically large but rural and sparsely populated area.student enrollment at zone i schools is more than.zone ii accounts for of the mcsd total enrollment,and encompasses the cities of ridgeland and madison in the southern part of madison county.zone iii covers a rural area and only serves about of the mcsd students.
standards of review 
the district court finding that the mcsd is unitary is a factual finding that we review for clear error.see flax potts,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer city,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,if the district court factual findings are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we must accept them,even though we might have weighed the evidence differently if we had been sitting as a trier of fact.price austin indep.sch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have also recognized that,given the unique factual circumstances present in school desegregation cases,the district court factual findings are entitled to great deference.flax,at.this is particularly true when,as here,the district judge has supervised the case for many years.id.we review de novo whether an issue is ripe for judicial review.see groome,parish of jefferson,cir.
as an initial matter,appellants argue that several issues decided by the district court were not ripe for review.in determining whether a matter is ripe for judicial review we consider the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.orix credit alliance,wolfe,cir internal quotation marks omitted see united transp.union foster,cir ripeness separates those matters that are premature because the injury is speculative and may never occur from those that are appropriate for judicial review.generally,issues are not ripe if further factual development is required.wolfe,at.
first,appellants point out that in the parties agreed to a create a committee to evaluate and recommend changes to the magnet program at vjhs.it is undisputed that the committee had not completed its evaluation by the time the district court granted the mcsd motion.appellants argue that the district court should have postponed its ruling until the committee completed its evaluation.second,appellants contend that the district court did not wait long enough following renovations and repairs at vjhs in to be able to adequately judge whether the magnet program could attain its goal of attracting white students.lastly,appellants argue that because of the mcsd poor track record in honoring construction commitments,the court erred by ruling on the mcsd motion while construction projects remained pending throughout the district.
we find these arguments unavailing.the factual record in this case has been extensively developed over more than thirty years of district court supervision.further,prior to ruling on the mcsd motion,the court conducted a lengthy public hearing where both sides presented evidence.appellants cite no authority,and we have found none,requiring district courts to consider motions for unitary status only upon the completion of all school district construction projects and committee evaluations.given the unique nature of desegregation litigation,such a requirement would be impractical,and as the mcsd points out,would likely result in the mcsd remaining forever under federal court supervision.also,the current magnet program at vjhs had been in full operation since the school year,long enough to allow the district court to make informed findings concerning its appellants argument that the renovations could possibly have some future effect that was not observable to the court in.thus,we find that no further factual development was required,and the issues decided by the district court were ripe for review.
motion for unitary status 
the district court granted the mcsd motion for declaration of unitary status.the ultimate inquiry in determining whether a school district is unitary is whether the school district has complied in good faith with desegregation orders for a reasonable amount of time and the school district has eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.see hull quitman county bd.of,cir see also freman,at.
good faith compliance with the district court orders 
a school district seeking the termination of federal court supervision must first show that it has consistently complied with a court decree in good faith.hull,at see also freeman,at.a history of compliance is evidence that any current racial imbalance is not the product of a new de jure violation.to meet this obligation,f or at least three years,the school board must report to the district court.monteilh landry parish sch,cir.further,the district in question must have for several years operated as a unitary system.lemon bossier parish sch,cir.
appellants make two related arguments concerning this prong.first,appellants assert that the mcsd has not complied in good faith with the district court orders,as evidenced by the mcsd alleged failure to,inter alia,adequately support the magnet program and facilities at vjhs,construct an adequate music facility at northeast madison middle school nmms,and to monitor minority hiring throughout the district.second,appellants argue that the district court erred in finding the mcsd unitary without first finding that it had been in compliance with desegregation orders for at least three years.according to appellants,at the time the district court issued its order,the mcsd had not yet completed several facilities projects,and had only recently completed others,indicating that the mcsd had not been in compliance for a reasonable amount of time.
appellants correctly observe that the district court did not expressly state that the mcsd had been in compliance with its desegregation orders for at least three years.however,following its thorough review of the evidence,the district court found that the mcsd worked in good faith to comply with the consent order since its adoption in april.the district court finding that the mcsd has complied in good faith with the consent decree is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.see price,at internal quotation marks omitted.for example,the mcsd good faith compliance is illustrated by the fact it has devoted a considerable amount of resources to renovating vjhs and implementing a new magnet program there.it has also implemented procedures to recruit minority teachers,established a advisory committee,and fulfilled its reporting obligation to the district court.further,the mcsd compliance with the consent order since its adoption constitutes compliance for a reasonable amount of time.see lemon,at.thus,we find no error in the district court analysis of the first prong.
elimination of the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable 
regarding the requirement that a school district eliminate the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable,every reasonable effort must be made to eradicate segregation and its insidious residue,although complete racial balance is not required.ross houston indep.sch,cir.rather,the emphasis is on whether the school district has done all that it could to remedy the segregation caused by official action.price,at see also united states fordice,d w e have consistently asked whether existing racial identifiability is attributable to the state.to guide courts in determining whether the vestiges of de jure segregation have been eliminated as far as practicable,the supreme court has identified several aspects of school operations that must be considered,commonly referred to as the green factors student assignment,faculty,staff,transportation,extracurricular activities,and facilities see bd.of educ.of.city pub.sch.dowell,d discussing green county sch.bd.of new kent county,d.
student assignment 
student assignment within a school district is relevant to determining whether a school district has remedied,to the extent possible,the vestiges of prior de jure segregation.dowell,at.while racial imbalance in a particular school is relevant for that purpose,racial imbalance,without more,does not violate the constitution.cavalier ex rel.cavalier caddo parish sch,cir.once the racial imbalance in student assignment due to the de jure violation has been remedied,the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.freeman,at.price,at i mmutable geographic factors and demographic changes that prevent the homogenation of all student bodies do not bar judicial recognition that the school system is unitary.quoting ross,at.
we note that the only objection appellants appear to assert on appeal regarding student assignment is that the mcsd has allegedly failed to comply with court orders regarding the magnet program at vjhs and,as a result,the magnet program has failed to attract white students whose attendance would diversify that school and further eliminate the vestiges of prior segregation 
vjhs,located in zone i,traditionally has been a school,and had a student population in.to encourage white students living in different zones to attend vjhs,and to enhance vjhs educational curriculum,the parties agreed in to implement a magnet program at the school.in the school year,the mcsd implemented a new magnet program at vjhs,called.despite the mcsd efforts to develop and promote the magnet program,the parties agree that the program failed to draw a significant number of white students to vjhs.the government and private plaintiffs argued below that the failure to attract white students to the magnet program at vjhs is attributable to the mcsd lack of a good faith commitment to the magnet program.thus,they argued,the mcsd was not entitled to a finding of unitary status on this aspect of student assignment.the district court disagreed and held that the mcsd complied in good faith with the consent order and that the program failed to attract white students primarily because of demographic and cultural factors.
on appeal,appellants disagree with that conclusion and challenge the district court findings that the implementation of the magnet program strengthened the curriculum at vjhs,the magnet program had been adequately funded,teacher inexperience at vjhs was not indicative of the mcsd lack of good faith and did not affect the magnet program success in attracting white students,restructuring the administration at vjhs did not affect the magnet success in attracting white students,the mcsd did not disregard known facilities deficiencies,and no magnet program could attract white students to vjhs.in sum,appellants claim that the district court erred by holding that the magnet program inability to attract white students was attributable to demographic and cultural factors,as opposed to the deficiencies they alleged exist in the magnet program itself.
the evidence supports the district court conclusion that location and demographic factors outside the mcsd control,as opposed to the alleged inadequacies cited by appellants,were responsible for the magnet program failure to attract white students.with that in mind,we briefly review the appellants arguments regarding the magnet program.
first,appellants argue that the magnet program weakened the curriculum at vjhs,contrary to the district court assertion.appellants cite nothing in the record,and we have found nothing,to support their contention.the magnet program at vjhs has received good reviews and the fact that vjhs may be rated lower than other schools,without more,simply does not lead to the conclusion that the magnet program has weakened the curriculum additionally,evidence in the record supports the finding that,given vjhs location,even an improved curriculum would not have made it successful in attracting white students.
second,appellants argue that the magnet program was inadequately funded,in large part because the mcsd sought no outside funds after receiving a federal grant in.the record shows that the new magnet program was initially funded by a federal grant of over million and that the mcsd spent an additional million from,not counting general operational funding or funding for instructional supplies.appellants fail to explain why the mcsd was required to seek further outside funding,and have presented no evidence that additional funds would have made a significant difference in the number of white students enrolling in the magnet program.
appellants next argue that the inexperience of the teachers at vjhs demonstrates the mcsd lack of good faith commitment to the magnet program and contributed to its failure to attract white students.the district court held that the mcsd made reasonable efforts to attract more experienced teachers to vjhs,and that it did not act in bad faith by refusing to exercise its authority to force more experienced teachers from other schools in the district to transfer to vjhs,because such a measure would have been counterproductive.appellants have not shown that the mcsd decision to not implement forced transfers was motivated by anything other than practical concerns about losing teachers to other districts.further,appellants have not shown that more experienced teachers at vjhs would have attracted more white students,and given the geographic challenges facing the magnet program,such a proposition would be doubtful at best.thus,we find no clear error on this point.
relatedly,appellants assert that the mcsd restructuring of the administrative staff at vjhs affected the magnet program success,contrary to the district court finding.the restructuring at issue involved elimination of an administrative position located at the mcsd central office and assigning control of the entire magnet program to vjhs principal.the district court held that the restructuring reasonably consolidated several functions in one position,and that this action did not affect the magnet program success.again,we find no clear error in this conclusion 
appellants next argue that an important factor contributing to the magnet program failure to attract white students was the poor condition its facilities,at least prior to renovations in the government expert,gordon,reported that in january the physical facilities at vjhs were and in a state of general disrepair.gordon conceded,however,that by the time of the district court hearing on the mcsd motion,the mcsd had fixed many of the problems he previously noted and that vjhs classrooms were comparable to those at other high schools in the district.appellants do not appear to object to the current state of vjhs classrooms.instead,they argue that the mcsd disregarded known deficiencies in facilities prior to because it did not begin renovations until after gordon issued his report in january.they also contend that the athletic facilities at vjhs are substandard.
the district court acknowledged that,if the evidence showed that the mcsd disregarded known facilities deficiencies,it likely would have failed in its duty to act in good faith to establish and maintain the magnet program.however,the court found that the evidence indicated that the facility was generally in good repair,and that no evidence supported the claim that the mcsd was aware or should have been aware of the problems cited by gordon in his report.further,the district court found that the alleged state of disrepair of the athletic facilities at vjhs did not play a significant role in the failure of the magnet program.we find that the evidence relied upon by the district court supports this conclusion.
lastly,and most fundamentally,appellants take issue with the district court ultimate conclusion that no matter the quality of the program,the facilities,the teachers,and regardless of how much money is spent,no magnet program is going to draw white students to vjhs,at least not in numbers sufficient to affect the racial imbalance of the school.the district court thoroughly documented the mcsd efforts to develop a successful magnet program,and based on its review,found that the failure of the program to attract white students was not attributable to the mcsd actions or lack of good faith.instead,the court found that the magnet program goal of attracting white students was doomed because of location and cultural factors that were not attributable to the mcsd.
we find no error in these findings.the evidence confirms that the mcsd devoted considerable time and resources in a good faith effort to establish the magnet program.moreover,the record also supports the conclusion that the magnet program inability to attract white students resulted from vjhs very inconvenient location testimony confirmed that vjhs is geographically distant from the large number of students in zone ii,as well as from businesses and cultural opportunities.for example,the mcsd superintendent testified that it is approximately forty miles between the schools in the south end of the mcsd and vjhs.rossell,an expert for the mcsd,opined that while the magnet program may have succeeded at a different location,i do think there any magnet program that could be designed that would overcome those issues,location,distance,and the difference in socioeconomic status.
in sum,the district court did not err in finding that the mcsd acted in good faith and that its efforts to implement a successful magnet at vjhs were reasonable.moreover,any evidence that additional resources might have improved the alleged deficiencies in the magnet program must yield to the reality that the school location presented an apparently insurmountable challenge to attracting white students.given the evidence documenting this challenge and the evidence confirming the mcsd substantial efforts to implement a successful magnet program,the district court findings concerning the magnet program and student assignment are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety and are not clearly erroneous.see price,at internal quotation marks omitted.
facilities 
another consideration in determining whether a school district has eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable is whether school facilities are adequate.green,at.appellants argue that facilities at vjhs were substandard prior to,that the baseball field and football stadium at vjhs do not compare favorably with others in the district,and it is unacceptable that the music program at one primarily middle school,northeast madison middle school nmms,is housed in a portable building 
the district court held that the challenged school facilities are adequate.the court noted that,of the four schools in zone i,where vjhs is located,two are new and two have been renovated.regarding athletic facilities,the district court noted that the mcsd was making improvements to vjhs football stadium,and that while the vjhs baseball field was not as nice as others in the district,there was less interest in baseball at vjhs compared to other sports.regarding the music program at nmms,the district court pointed out that the school has a music room in the main building,but due to excessive noise,the principal moved the music program to portable buildings away from classrooms in order to avoid disturbance.the court acknowledged that the school design may have been flawed,but pointed out that the mcsd relied upon assurances from the architect that the same configuration had been used successfully at other schools.the court held that i ndisputably,the alleged inadequacy of the music facility at nmms is not a vestige of former segregation practices,nor a result of the district inattention to the needs of the students at the school,and certainly not the product of intentional discrimination.
the court concluded the proof unequivocally shows that the mcsd has undertaken to address known relevant deficiencies at all its schools,and to provide adequate and proper educational facilities f
