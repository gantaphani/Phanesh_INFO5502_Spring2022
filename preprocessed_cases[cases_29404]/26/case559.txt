sheila bell appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants in their individual capacities on bell claims,brought under and,that during her enrollment in,and ultimately her dismissal from,the ohio state university college of medicine,the defendants denied her due process and equal protection and discriminated against her because of her race and gender.the district court held that those claims which arose prior to july,were barred by the statute of limitations that bell had failed to present any evidence to support either a substantive or procedural due process claim that bell had neither stated an equal protection claim nor provided evidence to support such a claim and that bell had failed to make out a prima facie case of a violation of section,and,alternatively,that she had wholly failed to counter the defendants evidence that she was dismissed from the college of medicine for purely academic reasons.we affirm the judgment of the district court,although with different reasoning as to some of the claims.
factual background 
sheila bell is an woman,who was admitted to the ohio state university college of medicine the medical school in the fall of.although the parties are not in complete agreement about bell performance with regard to completing the requirements of the first two years of medical school,the essential facts are not genuinely in dispute.bell started out in the independent study program isp,where she had considerable academic difficulty and was warned that she was in danger of failing med coll,which she was required to pass in order to advance to the second year of medical school.she was advised to transfer into the more traditional lecture and discussion program ldp,but she refused to do so and was permitted to continue in the isp.bell failed med coll and was permitted to repeat that course work in the ldp program she then successfully completed her first year and moved on to her second year in the ldp program.bell continued to have academic difficulty,and ultimately she was required to retake her second year.in june of,after successfully completing her second year course work,she retook part of the national medical licensing examination the boards,which she had taken but had not passed during her first year of medical school she did not,however,have her scores from part sent to the medical school.in august,the medical school instituted a new requirement that students pass parts and of the boards before advancing to the third year curriculum,but because that requirement had not been in place when she entered medical school,bell asked for and was granted permission to proceed to her third year of study without passing parts and of the boards.
bell problems continued through her third year of medical school,and again,the material facts are not genuinely disputed.in july and august of,bell took an internal medicine rotation at the cleveland clinic.bell did not appear for her final written and clinical examinations in the internal medicine program on august.although bell claimed at the time and continues to claim that she was too ill to take the exams,she does not dispute that she did not seek medical attention,or that she was not excused from appearing for the exams,either by anyone in the medical school in columbus or at the cleveland clinic.bell was not permitted to take the exams at a later date,but was told that she must repeat the rotation before she would be allowed to take either the final written exam or the clinical exam and she received an unsatisfactory grade for the rotation,in part because she failed to take the exams.she appealed her unsatisfactory grade to the internal medicine evaluation committee,which denied the appeal and required as remediation for the missed exams that bell repeat one than internal medicine rotation and take the clinical and written exams.bell appealed this decision in turn to the internal medicine appeals committee,the med committee and the student progress committee,each of which recommended that the appeal be denied.
while these appeals were pending,bell was advised that she had received an incomplete for a rotation in clinical pediatrics in september and october of,and that she would have six months to rewrite and resubmit her paper for that course.also during this time period,bell requested and received permission from the administrative assistant to the med committee to schedule a internal medicine rotation at carmel hospital.she did not,however,advise the assistant that she intended this rotation to fulfill the remediation requirement for internal medicine.after she had completed the rotation in april bell learned that because the medical school required that the remediation rotation be a core rotation at an ohio state university hospital,rather than an elective rotation at another hospital,the carmel rotation did not satisfy the remediation requirement.
on may,the clinical academic standing committee sent bell a letter advising her that she would not be permitted to graduate in june.that letter further advised 
the following issues must be resolved before you can be reconsidered for certification for graduation 
successful passage and release of scores for usmle,step.
release of scores for usmle,step.
successful remediation of the core internal medicine rotation and exams as outlined by the department.
successful resolution of anesthesia elective or completion of another clinical rotation awaiting grade.
the earliest date you would be eligible to graduate would be at the end of autumn quarter.
at some point during may,in response to bell inquiry,the administrative assistant to the med committee told bell that although she would not be eligible to participate in the june graduation ceremony,she would be permitted to participate in the convocation ceremony.bell was not,however,permitted to participate in the convocation,although she apparently did not receive the letter from the medical school advising her of that until after the ceremony.
during the summer of,bell complained to various officials at the ohio state university,including the university provost,that the college had not properly handled her appeals with regard to the internal medicine rotation requirement.on september,the provost issued his report,stating first that his office did not have the authority to review the appeals,but nonetheless advising bell that his review of her case resulted in his conclusion that the review process within the medical college had been fair and forthright.he further noted that her complaint had been reviewed by faculty committees at several levels and the outcome has always been the same.bell did not pursue any further attempt to complete the requirements for graduation during the summer of,and from september until june,she was in africa doing missionary work.during that period,she learned that she had been withdrawn from the medical school,but that she could apply for reinstatement.she did so,and on may,the medical school sent her a letter advising that her petition for reinstatement had been granted and further advising that 
your readmission is subject to the following conditions 
you must meet the current cognitive and standards of the college of medicine,including passage of step and step of the usmle.
you must meet all curricular requirements established by the clinical academic standing committee.
you will be granted an exemption from the college rule until.
you must meet all the above requirements by july,or be subject to final dismissal from the college of medicine.
this letter also instructed bell to contact the associate dean for student affairs in order to resume her studies.bell contacted the associate dean,but was unhappy with his instruction that she would need to complete at least one month of an internal medicine rotation.bell expressed her dissatisfaction in a letter to the dean of the medical college,dated june,complaining that she had been denied due process during the appeals process,that she had satisfied the internal medicine rotation requirement,that but for the lack of due process,general unfairness and harassment,she would have received her medical degree long since,and that unless the medical school corrected the problem,she would have no choice but to file a lawsuit.
bell threat of litigation did not have the desired effect,and the clinical academic standing committee advised her on september,that,if she wanted to continue her studies,she would be required to do one month of internal medicine at the ohio state university medical center and to take and pass the clinical exam and the written final exam by june.bell complied with neither of these requirements,and the med student review subcommittee recommended to the clinical academic standing committee that bell be dismissed from the medical school.on october,a meeting which in which bell clinical academic standing committee recommended that she be dismissed for failure to complete the conditions to which her reinstatement was subject,including her failure to complete the internal medicine rotation and to take the exams.bell was notified of the committee recommendation by letter dated october.the committee recommendation was reviewed by the academic review board at a meeting which bell attended and in which she was given the opportunity to present information.the academic review board found that both the student review subcommittee and the clinical academic standing committee had conducted their proceedings in accordance with the policies and procedures of the medical college,and that the results of the board review and the recommendations of the committees would be forwarded to the dean.after review of all of the proceedings,the dean notified bell by letter dated december,that she had been dismissed from the medical college and that she was not eligible for future reinstatement.
bell filed suit against the defendants on july,in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.that action was dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on december,bell filed this action against ohio state university,its board of trustees,the ohio state university college of medicine,and numerous officials and administrators of the university and the college of medicine in both their official and their individual capacities.the complaint claimed that the plaintiff has both a property interest and a liberty interest in her continued enrollment in the medical college,and that the defendants had deprived her of those interests without due process and had denied her equal protection of the law,in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and the ohio constitution had deprived her and conspired to deprive her of her rights on the basis of her race and gender in violation of,and and had intentionally inflicted emotional distress and damaged her reputation and had intentionally breached their contractual agreement to provide plaintiff with a doctor of medicine degree,in violation of ohio law.the complaint sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss bell state law claims and her claims brought under and.the district court then granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the claims brought under and,holding that all the official capacity claims were barred by the eleventh amendment and that the claims against the defendants in their official capacities were either barred by the statute of limitations,unsupported by any evidence or wholly without merit.bell now appeals from those portions of the district court orders that granted summary judgment to the individual defendants on the section and claims.she does not appeal the dismissal of the state law claims or the section and claims,or the judgment dismissing the official capacity claims on the basis of the eleventh amendment.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,using the same standard under rule c used by the district court.williams mehra,cir en banc.we must view the evidence,all facts,and any inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.to withstand summary judgment,the must show sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.klepper first am.bank,cir.a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the.anderson liberty lobby,d.entry of summary judgment is appropriate against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.
statute of limitations 
bell contends that the district court erred in holding that to the extent that her section and claims are based on events that occurred more than two years before she filed her first lawsuit,they are barred by the statute of limitations.bell does not argue that the court applied an erroneous statute of limitations,but rather that the court erred in holding that the continuing violations theory is inapplicable to this case.
the date on which the statute of limitations begins to run in a action is a question of federal law.sevier turner,cir.ordinarily,the limitations period starts to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.id.at.in determining when the cause of action accrues in section actions,we have looked to what event should have alerted the typical lay person to protect his or her rights.dixon anderson,cir.
kuhnle,county of geauga,cir.the exceptions to that rule are two where the plaintiff can show prior discriminatory activity that continues into the present,as opposed to prior discriminatory activity whose effects continue into the present,see tolbert state of ohio of,cir and where the plaintiff can show a longstanding and demonstrable policy of discrimination.dixon,at.bell contends that she has presented evidence sufficient to require the application of both of these continuing violation exceptions.
in passenger morgan,d,a title vii action,the court addressed the first of the two types of continuing violation,namely,the prior discriminatory activity that continued into the present.the court held that while the continuing violation doctrine applies in hostile environment title vii discrimination actions,it does not permit recovery for discrete acts of discrimination that occurred outside the statutory period.id.at.that reasoning,this court recently held,applies to claims brought under section.sharpe cureton,cir we can find no principled basis upon which to restrict morgan to title vii claims,and we therefore conclude that the supreme court reasoning must be applied to the firefighters claims.we noted in sharpe that morgan does not implicate the second continuing violation exception,involving a longstanding policy of discrimination.id.at.
here,we conclude that all of the allegedly unconstitutional and discriminatory actions that took place prior to july,are discrete acts of which bell was immediately aware when they occurred,and bell has presented no evidence of a longstanding policy of discrimination.we hold,therefore,that all of the section claims based on events prior to july,are.
this circuit has not addressed the question of whether the reasoning of morgan and sharpe extends to discrimination claims brought under section.and,although bell does not distinguish between her section and claims with regard to the statute of limitations,this circuit has recently held that the presumptive statute of limitations of applies to section actions premised upon alleged discriminatory actions occurring after the formation of the employment relationship.anthony btr auto.sealing,cir.this latter issue,we note,is currently before the supreme court in jones donnelley sons,cir,cert.granted,d may.we conclude,however,that it is unnecessary to decide whether the continuing violations exception applies to bell section claim,because,as we will more fully explain below,bell has wholly failed to provide any evidence to support her section claim,regardless of when it accrued.
the remaining section claims 
in order to state a claim under section,a plaintiff must allege the deprivation of a constitutional right caused by a person acting under color of state law.black barberton citizens,cir.in order to survive a motion for summary judgment,a plaintiff must present evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact material to her claim.klepper,at.bell claims that she has both a property interest and a liberty interest in her continued enrollment at the medical school,and that the defendants conduct unconstitutionally deprived her of both.
the undisputed facts establish that on may,bell was involuntarily withdrawn from the medical school that on may,her petition for reinstatement was granted subject to very specific conditions and that on june,bell objected to the terms of her reinstatement and threatened litigation.bell did not comply with any of the required conditions of her reinstatement,and on december,after medical school academic committees at several levels reviewed her failure to comply with those requirements,the medical school dismissed bell because of that failure.the issue before us is whether bell has presented evidence sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that after july,in performing that review and in ultimately dismissing her,any or all of the defendants discriminated against her because of her race or gender,or deprived her of due process,either procedural or substantive,or denied her the equal protection of the law.we hold that she has not.
procedural due process 
because property interests are creatures of state law,plaintiff would have been required to show at trial that her seat at the medical school was a property interest recognized by state law.bd.of curators of of horowitz,d citations omitted.bell gives us little to go on here.she points us generally to the student handbook and the student handbook supplement for support for her belief that she had a property interest in her continued medical education at the medical school,but she cites to no particular provision of those handbooks.as further support for this proposition,she cites the deposition testimony of kantor,an associate dean of the medical college during some of the period when bell was a student there and it has always been the policy of the college,that once you in,we try everything we can to help you pass and succeed.
assuming,however,for the purposes of this summary judgment motion,that bell does have such an interest,we hold that bell has not presented any evidence that the defendants denied her procedural due process in reviewing her failure to comply with the conditions of her reinstatement or in dismissing her because of that failure.to the contrary,all of the evidence in this case demonstrates that,like the plaintiff in horowitz where the supreme court assumed without deciding that the plaintiff had a property interest in her medical school enrollment,bell received at least as much due process as the fourteenth amendment requires.id.at.as was the case in horowitz,the administration of the medical school advised bell fully of her failures,explained the consequences,and the ultimate decision to dismiss plaintiff was careful and deliberate.id.indeed,in bell case,medical school committees on at least three levels reviewed her failure to comply with the requirements upon which her readmission was explicitly conditioned,and she was given the opportunity to participate in at least two of those committees reviews.the fourteenth amendment requires nothing more.
substantive due process 
bell contends that she has a both a property interest and a liberty interest in continued enrollment in the medical college that those interests are subject to the protections of substantive due process and that the actions of the defendants deprived her of those interests and denied her that protection.as we understand the argument she presents in her brief,bell principal contention is that she was arbitrarily and unfairly dealt with in with regard to both the medical school insistence that she fulfill a remediation requirement after receiving an unsatisfactory grade for her internal medicine rotation,and the school refusal to permit her to graduate because she had not fulfilled the remediation requirement.these matters are,as we have already held,outside the period of the statute of limitations.to the extent that bell complains of any actions of the defendants that occurred after july,which is not clear either in her complaint or in her brief on appeal,she appears to contend that her ultimate dismissal from the medical college was the result of her failure to complete the internal medicine rotation in,and that the defendants requiring her to take an additional month of an internal medicine rotation once she was dismissing her when she refused to racially discriminatory and,therefore,arbitrary,capricious,and unfair.we find no merit to these arguments.
the interests protected by substantive due process are of course much narrower than those protected by procedural due process.most property interests warranting the protection of procedural due process,for instance,may be substantively modified or abolished by the legislature.see,atkins parker,d.interests protected by substantive due process,which the legislature may not infringe unless supported by sufficiently important state interests,include those protected by specific constitutional guarantees,such as the equal protection clause,freedom from government actions that shock the conscience,see braley pontiac,cir,and certain interests that the supreme court has found so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be fundamental.see,youngberg romeo,d right to reasonable care and safety while in government custody johnson cincinnati,cir right to travel locally through public spaces and roadways but see deshaney winnebago county dep t of social,d no substantive due process right to government protection from an abusive domestic situation.as the supreme court reasoned in denying a substantive due process right to commit suicide 
we have always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and.by extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest,we,to a great extent,place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.we must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,lest the liberty protected by the due process clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this court.
our established method of analysis has two primary features first,we have regularly observed that the due process clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are,objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.second,we have required in cases a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.our nation history,legal traditions,and practices thus provide the crucial guideposts for responsible decisionmaking,that direct and restrain our exposition of the due process clause.
washington glucksberg,d citations and quotations omitted.where,as we explain below,there is no equal protection violation,we can see no basis for finding that a medical student interest in continuing her medical school education is protected by substantive due process.gutzwiller fenik,cir stressing,in the public university context,the similarity of equal protection and substantive due process certainly the contention that the medical college actions were arbitrary or capricious can not be sufficient otherwise judicial review for compliance with substantive due process would become the equivalent of a typical state or federal admin
