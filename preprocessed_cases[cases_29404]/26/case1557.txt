donald bruce crawford sued the huntington beach union high school district and the california department of education collectively the district unless the context indicates otherwise,contending the racial and ethnic balancing component of the district policy violates proposition cal,art.i.he appeals the judgment entered after the trial court denied his motion for summary judgment and granted the district.we agree with his contention on the policy violates proposition.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
the transfer policy 
the district has an open transfer policy for all its high schools.the policy has a racial and ethnic balance component as required by section of the state education code.this statute dictates that school districts shall retain the authority to maintain appropriate racial and ethnic balances among their respective schools at the school districts discretion or as specified in applicable or voluntary desegregation plans.
there are six high schools in the district,but the only high school affected by the same race exchange policy,that is,has been declared ethnically isolated,is westminster high school.the district has employed a private firm,davis demographics,to do demographic studies for it.this private firm uses,in the language of the firm owner,gregory davis,in a declaration in the record,district data from student records of names,addresses,schools of attendance,and ethnicity,which has been stored in a computer program which can be utilized to generate statistical information based on race relative to each high school and its established geographic attendance area.
the actual tables supplied by davis demographics for westminster high school put every student into one of the following categories american indian or alaska native the asian of a japanese,b korean,c chinese,d vietnamese,e laotian and f other asian islander filipino mexican american chicano span.surn.black negroid afro american and total white students.
to prevent an inappropriate racial and ethnic balance,the district restricts transfers to and from westminster high school.if you are white and you live inside the high school attendance area,you can not transfer out unless another white student is willing to transfer in and take your place.if you are and you live outside the high school attendance area,you can not transfer in unless another student is willing to transfer out and you take that student place.
demographic studies calculated that,for the academic year,the school was roughly vietnamese percent,total asian is percent,mexican american chicano spanish surname percent,and white percent.
crawford,a taxpayer in the district,brought this action in september to challenge the constitutionality of the same race exchange policy under proposition.crawford and the district both brought motions for summary judgment.the district motion largely relied on several cases decided under the state equal protection clause.
in,the trial court granted the district motion and denied crawford.in a brief,it ruled that the district transfer policy was not prohibited under proposition and promotes a public education.the formal order granting the district motion stated that the court had considered the supreme court recent opinion in wire works,city of san jose cal th,d,and that the case had no application to the pending dispute.
california law 
crawford contends the trial court erred in granting the district summary judgment motion.he contends the racial balancing component of the district open enrollment program violates proposition.we agree.
the voters adopted proposition in the november general election.the initiative measure added section to article i of the california constitution,which states in relevant part a the state shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.
in,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court applied a common and plain meaning approach to the words discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to as used in proposition.as of this writing,the only other published decision to substantively consider a challenge to a government program under proposition is connerly state personnel board th,d.connerly involved challenges to several state government affirmative action programs,all of which were held to contravene proposition.
in,all seven members of our state high court held that san jose contractor outreach program on behalf of women and minority business enterprises was unconstitutional under article i,section of the state constitution.hi voltage,supra,cal th at,d,we remain persuaded the city program violates section id.at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,despite the legitimacy and even necessity of its end,the means that the city program employs offend section id.at,d,conc.opn.of kennard,applying common meaning of preferential,i agree that the challenged program of the city of san jose grants preferential treatment on the basis of race and sex in the operation of public contracting id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of george,we must conclude that an outreach program directed to an audience on the basis of its members race or gender constitutes a program that grants preferential treatment for purposes of article i,section.
the program considered by the high court in gave prospective bidders on city contracts a choice.they could,but were not required,to use a certain percentage of subcontractors who were women or members of ethnic minorities.alternatively,they merely had to document their efforts to reach out to women and minority business enterprises to give them the opportunity to obtain a subcontract on the program.that meant simply giving notice to at least four businesses owned by women or members of a minority ethnic group.the teeth in the second choice was that if a prospective bidder rejected a low bid from a subcontractor owned by a woman or a member of a minority ethnic group,he had to give written reasons for the rejection,supra,cal th at,d.the program had been prompted by a study that had shown a historical pattern of discrimination by prime contractors against and subcontractors with regard to public contracts awarded by the city.id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of george.
in,the city argued that its outreach program did not involve any overt discrimination,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the procedures were merely a device to screen for discrimination.id.at,d.the city claimed that,operationally,the program merely expanded the pool of candidates to obtain subcontract jobs,but did not afford preferential treatment on the basis of race or gender in the actual selection process itself.see id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of george.
even so,the court determined that the program contravened proposition.the key constitutional language of the provision is in the words discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to.the court looked to the ordinary plain meaning of the key words.discriminate means distinctions in treatment.a preference means the giving of priority or advantage to one person over others.hi voltage,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d,conc.opn.of kennard.
using the plain ordinary meaning of the words discriminate and preference,it was clear that,while the city outreach program might not have involved,as the city claimed,any overt discrimination,it was still discriminatory and preferential.the program required prospective bidders to give personal attention to potential subcontractors owned by women and members of minority ethnic groups that was not required to be given to other businesses,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of george,agreeing that documentation component granted preferential treatment within the meaning of proposition.requiring prospective bidders to give special assistance and information based on race or sex was enough to contravene proposition.id.at,d.
moreover,as the chief justice pointed out,the program was also discriminatory in the incentives that it created.a prime contractor was given a strong incentive to grant preferential treatment to at least some prospective su
