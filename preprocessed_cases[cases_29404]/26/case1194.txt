parents appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint filed pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.after review and oral argument,we affirm the district court dismissal but remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to modify its order of dismissal.
background 
disability 
was born on november,with profound bilateral sensorial hearing loss.the diagnosing audiologist asked parents whether they wanted to learn to communicate orally through spoken language or manually using sign language.parents indicated that they wanted to be an oral communicator.
the audiologist recommended that be fitted with hearing aids and begin therapy avt after doing considerable research,parents determined that avt was the best methodology for their child.
accordingly,parents fitted with hearing aids and took her to see kathy bricker,an audiologist with the university of miami ear institute,for an hour of avt each week.was nine months old at the time.
after about six months,it was clear that was not getting enough sound from the hearing aids she was wearing,even though they were the most powerful on the market.after consulting with experts,parents decided that should receive a cochlear implant 
on april,thomas balkany,the head of the health services department of otolaryngology at the university of miami,successfully performed cochlear implant surgery.the device was activated three to four weeks after the surgery.the date of activation of a cochlear implant is considered day one of hearing for an implant recipient,who has to learn all the pragmatics of hearing,just like a newborn has to learn them.
cochlear,which sells the devices,recommends that children who are implanted with a cochlear device receive an educational program that maximizes exposure to meaningful sounds particularly exposure to spoken language every day.however,cochlear does not recommend any particular program.
although cochlear does not recommend any particular program,balkany does.according to balkany,avt is the best form of therapy for the implanted child.consequently,continued to receive avt for one hour each week.
in the summer of,parents enrolled her in a summer program at their local synagogue.parents then elected to enroll in the synagogue preschool program for children from six weeks to five years of age.although the synagogue accepts disabled students like,it does not provide them with special education classes,such as avt.
until turned three in november,the avt she received was paid for through the county early intervention program early intervention program.after age three,the early intervention program no longer pays for avt.in addition,until age of three,received oral motor therapy and other special education services under the authority of a public agency.
efforts to provide an individual education plan 
in late,the school board received written materials from the early intervention program in order to determine whether was a candidate for receiving special education services from the school board.in,school board staff members and parents met to discuss eligibility for special education services.
at the outset of the meeting,parents inquired about avt,as was still receiving avt one hour per week.the school board stated that before any decisions were made,they would have to go through the early intervention program materials.the evaluations were finished on november.
on january,the school board and parents met again and the results of the evaluations were discussed.the school board and parents agreed that was eligible for special education services.
parents indicated that they were satisfied with current private preschool placement at the synagogue and that they wanted to continue to receive avt but have the school board pay for it the school board explained to parents that the board did not provide avt but that it did have other programs to recommend.
the school board utilizes the verbotonal vt approach,rather than avt,to develop the oral communication skills of students who communicate orally vt is a recognized and means by which to teach children to speak.vt has evolved since cochlear implants and has become a flexible methodology that can be adapted to meet the individual needs of an implanted child.like avt,vt focuses on sharpening listening skills and strengthening the auditory pathway.visual and tactile clues,vibratory stimulation,and body movements are used,but only if needed.vt may be provided on either a group or individual basis.unlike avt,vt does not rely on parental participation for successful results.
as to academic classes,the board advised parents at the january meeting that there was no,mainstream public school placement option available in county that the school board could offer.however,the board did recommend placement in a special education class taught by darci lester at one of the public schools.
specifically,lester is a teacher for the deaf and hearing impaired who received vt training from the board.lester taught a class of three,four,and,children at arcola lakes elementary school.there were seven students in her class,one of whom had a cochlear implant.two of the older students had cognitive impairments.the olds were very high functioning.the children in the class were grouped according to their abilities.
the board also offered a varying exceptionalities,reverse mainstream class with mildly handicapped students and two students serving as models for the disabled children at highland oaks elementary school,and a,class,taught by a certified teacher for the deaf at myrtle grove elementary school.
after the board made its recommendations during the january meeting,parents informed the board that they were not interested in any of them.parents repeated their desire for to remain in the synagogue preschool,but have the board pay for avt.
the school board refused to pay for avt.instead,the school board offered minutes of small teacher sic instruction and specialized instruction in expressive and receptive language skills on a basis at highland oaks elementary school.the board offer included vt techniques only.parents wanted only minutes not so they would not have to pull out of the synagogue preschool three times a week.
the board prepared an individual education plan iep for for the period january,to january.according to the iep,would receive minutes of small teacher sic instruction and specialized instruction in expressive and receptive language skills from a pathologist on a basis at highland oaks elementary school.the board offer included vt techniques,not avt.
although parents signed the january iep,they wrote the following in the comment section agree to but disagree w placement options.is in need of services avt to fully access her education.the school district says they are not able to provide this why 
after speaking with the pathologist who would be providing services to,parents concluded that the board offer would be wrong for on january,parents filed a due process hearing request on behalf of,challenging the school board refusal to provide with avt.
on may,the school board and parents entered into a mediation agreement,which provided 
county guidelines for specific learning disabilities and ot occupational therapy criteria will be mailed to the parents as soon as possible.
an iep meeting will be held to write appropriate goals and objectives to address ot,oral motor therapy,speech and language services,learning disabilities guidelines specific to,auditory development goals,lre least restrictive environment and cost of mapping.the meeting will be held within one month after parents contact edna waxman of the school board.
dennis hoffman of the school board will provide to parents prior to iep meeting documentation of progress made of students attending or who have attended county schools who received vt and had cochlear implants.
edna waxman will mail to parents prior to iep meeting count y guidelines for oral motor services.
parents agree for to be evaluated by ot and speech lang uage pathologist speci a lizing in oral motor development.
the school board sent an occupational therapist to school for observation.however,parents contacted waxman and informed her that they did not want to have another iep meeting and that they preferred to go ahead with the due process hearing.at the time the january iep expired on january,due process hearing request was still pending.
efforts to develop a successor iep 
on january,the school board and parents with their attorney and avt instructor met in order to develop a successor iep.parents felt that the meeting was a waste of time because the school board was not going to agree to avt.nevertheless,parents participated in developing a successor iep.
a successor iep was drafted to cover the period from january,to january.the successor iep indicated that should be placed in a regular education class of four and olds at greynolds park elementary school.the class used the high scope curriculum,which is very language based and promotes constant communication in the classroom.was also to receive various supporting services including minutes per week of specialized assistance from a teacher using vt techniques an extra minutes per week of language skills training minutes per week of oral motor skills training and occupational therapy.the school board representatives agreed that classroom should be acoustically sound and that should be given preferential seating.
parents disagreed with the successor iep because it provided for the use of vt techniques instead of avt.therefore,parents kept her in private school and in private avt.
d.the state administrative hearing 
the due process hearing before an administrative law judge alj,that parents requested on january,was held february through,and march through,at the hearing,all the above information was introduced.
the alj issued a opinion.essentially,the alj made two independent,alternative conclusions relevant to the idea when denying the parents challenge to the ieps.
first,the alj determined sua sponte that it was without the authority,and thus jurisdiction,to provide parents with retroactive relief of reimbursement for avt under the iep or the successor iep.specifically,the alj stated 
even if he agreed with the parents that the january and ieps were fatally flawed,the undersigned would not have the authority to order the reimbursement requested by the parents because such reimbursement is not of the limited type a hearing law judge in florida is authorized to award in a due process proceeding accordingly,the parents request for reimbursement of avt expenses is denied.
the alj based its conclusion on the belief that it was only authorized to reimburse for the cost of the private school enrollment of an exceptional student who has been unilaterally moved by his parents from public school to private school under the circumstances described in section a c and section.punctuation omitted.according to the alj,the fact that had never been enrolled in public school,let alone unilaterally removed from public school,rendered it without jurisdiction to award any reimbursement for avt.
second,and alternatively,the alj assumed that even if it had jurisdiction to award parents reimbursement for avt,parents had not shown that the school board failure to offer avt constituted the denial of a free and appropriate public education fape.specifically,the alj concluded that the issue raised by the parents in their due process hearing request as to whether avt is a supportive service is entitled to receive from the school board because such service is indispensable to enabling to access her education remains one over which the parties still disagree.in resolving this dispute,the alj noted that a s a child with a properly functioning cochlear implant who communicates through spoken language,needs expressive and receptive language therapy to help her develop her oral communication skills.
the alj determined that w hile there can be no question that has benefit t ed significantly from the avt she has received from bricker,avt is not the only accepted and proven therapeutic methodology that can help become a better oral communicator and thereby access her education.the alj concluded that vt is an accepted and proven therapy and that i t is the school board prerogative,not the parents,to choose which of these accepted and proven methodologies will be provided at public expense.
ultimately,the alj concluded that even assuming that,despite voluntary enrollment in a private preschool,the parents are entitled to have their complaint regarding the school board failure to provide with avt heard in a due process hearing,the parents position that such failure on the school board part constitutes a denial of a fape in the least restrictive environment appropriate must be rejected.
parents then filed their complaint in district court.their complaint sought reimbursement from the school board for private avt,transportation to and from avt,mapping programming for cochlear implant,and batteries for implant.
e.the district court 
in the district court,parents raised two claims the school board violated the idea by refusing to provide with a fape in and,and the ada by refusing to accommodate 
according to the district court,it did,of course,have authority to review the alj decision as to whether the and ieps provided cm with a fape.however,the district court determined that it was without jurisdiction to order the school board to reimburse cm for training and related expenses.although summary in form,it appears that the district court based its conclusion on either the court agreement with the alj that relief under the idea is precluded when the child is never enrolled in public school or that current enrollment in private school somehow limited the relief available to her under the idea.what is clear,however,is that the district court dismissed the parents idea claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
parents appeal.
ii.discussion 
before addressing the parents appeal,we first discuss the idea and the procedures that should be followed in the state administrative hearing and federal district court.
a.the idea 
free and appropriate public education 
the idea,as the successor to the education of the handicapped act,represents an ambitious federal effort to promote the education of handicapped children.bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley,d.all children with disabilities,such as hearing impairment,who,by reason thereof,need special education and related services fall within the idea scope.a b.special education means specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,and includes instruction in the classroom,home,physical education,and other settings.a b.related services include transportation,and such developmental,corrective,and other supportive services including pathology and audiology services as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education a internal parentheses omitted.
the idea achieves its goals by guaranteeing students with disabilities a free and appropriate public education fape.loren atlanta independent sch,cir sch.bd.of collier county,cir see d a stating that a principal purpose of the idea is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.in turn,a fape is defined as special education services that 
a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge 
b meet the standards of the state educational agency 
c include an appropriate preschool,elementary school,or secondary school education in the state involved and 
d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section d 
furthermore,t he services and placement needed by each child with a disability to receive a fape must be based on the child unique needs and not on the child disability.a ii.
individualized education plan 
to provide a child with a fape,the school board formulates an iep during a meeting between the student parents and school officials.loren,at citing d a b and knox county,cir.
more specifically,a parent is required to notify a school board or other public agency that it wishes to place a child in special education services the parent then consents to have the child evaluated to determine whether the child is a child with a disability under the idea.see.
once a child is evaluated and determined to be a child with a disability under the idea,an iep team is formed.see a.the iep team normally includes the parents,a regular education teacher,at least one special education teacher,a school board representative,other individuals with relevant expertise,and the child if appropriate.id.at a.
once the iep team is formed,meetings are held and an iep is developed.see d a i describing the necessary contents of an iep.during the process,parental involvement is critical indeed,full parental involvement is the purpose of many of the idea procedural requirements.see doe alabama state dep t of,cir see also weber cranston sch,cir outlining parental involvement in the iep process.
once an iep is developed,the school board must determine whether it will provide the special education needs of the child.see sch.comm.of town of burlington dep t of,d the act contemplates that such education will be provided where possible in regular public schools,with the child participating as much as possible in the same activities as nonhandicapped children,but the act also provides for placement in private schools at public expense where this is not possible.citations omitted loren,at although the idea reflects a structural preference in favor of providing special education in public schools,it recognizes that certain public schools are unable or unwilling to provide appropriate special education services.if the school board elects not to provide the programs outlined in the iep,it refers the child to a private school or program at no cost to the parents.see a b i.
if,however,the school board elects to provide the services outlined in the iep,one of three things will happen.first,the parents can enroll their child in public school and the school is required to provide for the services outlined in the iep.see outlining when ieps must be in effect.
second,the parents can acknowledge that the iep is sufficiently adequate to provide a fape but decide that their child educational needs are better met by voluntarily enrolling their child in a private school or program.if the parents elect this option,the school board is not required to reimburse the parents for any cost associated with the child voluntary enrollment in private school.see a c i a.
third,the parents can notify the school that they are rejecting the iep and then challenge the iep via a due process hearing.see a a a o b.should the parents successfully challenge the iep and if it is determined that the placement in private school was proper,a court or a hearing officer may require the school board to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment a c ii see c a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that private school enrollment if the agency had not made fape available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment and the private placement is appropriate.
we now discuss the alj and district court roles under the idea.
should parents elect to challenge an iep,they are entitled to a due process hearing before an alj.see a a a o b.the supreme court has established a test to determine whether a student has been denied a fape.rowley,at.at 
under the rowley test,the alj must first determine whether the school board complied with the procedures set forth in the idea.id.at.at.if the school board complied with the procedural requirements of the idea,it properly formed an iep team and gave the parents sufficient involvement in the iep formation,then the alj must determine whether the iep was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.id.at.at.
if the alj determines that the school board complied with the idea procedural requirements and the proposed iep provided the child with the necessary services,then the state will have provided the child with a fape.id.if,however,the alj determines that the school board failed to comply with the idea procedural requirements or proposed an inadequate iep,the alj may order the board to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment.a c ii see c.furthermore,the alj may order the parents to be reimbursed for any year in which the school board failed to provide the child with a fape.see burlington,at.at.
having outlined the alj proper role,we next discuss the district court role under the idea.
c.the district court 
the idea authorizes an aggrieved party to bring an action in federal court challenging the alj final decision.i a although the federal action is an independent civil action and not merely a review of a state administrative decision,the supreme court has determined that federal courts must still give due weight to the alj determinations.see rowley,at.at loren,at.to that end,administrative factfindings are considered to be prima facie correct,and if a reviewing court fails to adhere to them,it is obliged to explain why.loren,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
the district court answers the same inquiry as outlined above namely,whether the school board followed the idea procedural requirement and whether the proposed iep was sufficient to provide the child with a fape.rowley,at.at,d loren,at.a yes answer to both questions ends judicial review.loren at see rowley,at.at if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.
however,should the district court determine either that the school board failed to follow the idea procedural requirements or that the iep was not reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive education benefits,it shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.a see also a c ii a court or a hearing officer may require the school board to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment.c a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that private school enrollment if the agency had not made fape available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment and the private placement is appropriate.the reviewing court has broad discretion in determining what is appropriate based on the circumstances of each case.see burlington,at.at.
having outlined the relevant idea provisions and the proper roles of the alj and district court,we now turn to the issues presented in this appeal.
reimbursement for private school and related services 
the first issue presented in this appeal is whether parents are entitled to any form of reimbursement given that is currently enrolled in private school and was never enrolled in public school.for the following reasons,we conclude that would be eligible for reimbursement for tuition and related services if the school board had denied her a fape.
section a c ii states 
if the parents of a child with a disability,who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency,enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency,a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.
a c ii emphasis added see c specifying that private preschool enrollment can be reimbursed.the school board and alj in this case relied on the phrase who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency to conclude that parents are not entitled to reimbursement because was never enrolled in public school.furthermore,the district court clearly indicated that current enrollment in private school factored into the determination that it was without jurisdiction to award relief.there are,however,two fatal flaws with this line of reasoning.
first,actually received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency as provided under a c ii.as stated above,previously received avt until the age of three through the county early intervention program.in addition,until the age of three,received oral motor therapy and other special education services under the authority of a public agency.consequently,if the school board failed to offer a fape,she satisfies the precondition in a c ii for reimbursement.
second,sole reliance on the fact that never attended public school is legally insufficient to deny reimbursement under a c ii.in burlington,the united states supreme court recognized the difficult decisions facing parents of children with disabilities.as the supreme court recognized,
a final judicial decision on the merits of an iep will in most instances come a year or more after the school term covered by that iep has passed.in the meantime,the parents who disagree with the proposed iep are faced with a choice go along with the iep to the detriment of their child if it turns out to be inappropriate or pay for what they consider to be the appropriate placement.if they choose the latter course,which conscientious parents who have adequate means and who are reasonably confident of their assessment normally would,it would be an empty victory to have a court tell them several years later that they were right but that these expenditures could not in a proper case be reimbursed by the school officials.if that were the case,the child right to a free appropriate public education,the parents right to participate fully in developing a proper iep,and all of the procedural safeguards would be less than complete.
burlington,at.at see florence county sch.dist.four carter by and through carter,d acknowledging the right of unilateral withdrawal recognized in burlington and stating that i n this case,as in all burlington reimbursement cases,the parents rejection of the school district proposed iep is the very reason for the parents decision to put their child in a private school moreover,idea was intended to ensure that children with disabilities receive an education that is both appropriate and free.to read the provisions of the idea to bar reimbursement in the circumstances of this case would defeat this statutory purpose.internal citations omitted.
relying,in part,on the burlington line of cases,courts have concluded that even when a child has never enrolled in a public school,reimbursement is proper if the school board failed to offer a sufficient iep and,in turn,a fape.see sch.bd.of,d,justin bd.of educ.of montgomery county,d,suzawith green bay area sch,d,hoffman east troy community school,d,but see baltimore city bd.of sch.comm rs.taylorch,d.we find the rationale contained in justin to be particularly pellucid.
in justin,the school board argued that a c ii barred reimbursement because justin was never enrolled in the public school system.justin,d at.we agree with the justin court that such a construction of the idea would produce the absurd result of barring children from receiving a fape because their disabilities were detected before they reached school age.id.furthermore,the school board disturbing interpretation would also place parents of such children in the untenable position of acquiescing to an inappropriate placement in order to preserve their right to reimbursement.id.
we agree that forcing parents into accepting inadequate ieps in order to preserve their right to reimbursement runs contrary to the rights recognized in the burlington line of cases.therefore,we conclude that parents are not required in all cases to first enroll their child in public school pursuant to an inadequate iep in order to preserve their right to reimbursement.see id.the supreme court has expressly rejected saddling parents of disabled children with such a pyrrhic victory.citing burlington,at.at but see baltimore city,d at requiring that,in order to preserve the right to reimbursement,parents may place their child in a public school for as short a period as one day,give ten business days written notice to the school that they are withdrawing the child,and then do so citing a c iii i bb.
having determined that parents would be eligible for reimbursement if had been denied a fape,we next turn to the issue of what expenses parents are potentially entitled to have reimbursed under the idea.
forms of reimbursement 
there seems to be some dispute among the parties as to what type of expenses parents could be reimbursed for under the idea.in particular,could parents be reimbursed for only tuition or also for related services,such as avt 
in burlington,the united states supreme court concluded that retroactive reimbursement for private school tuition and related services was authorized under the idea.burlington,at.at jenkins state of,cir noting that the burlington court concluded that the statute includes reimbursement of private school tuition and related expenses see shore regional high sch.bd.of educ,cir affirming the alj order that the school board reimburse for the tuition and related costs susquenita sch.dist.raelee,cir stating that the burlington court concluded that the idea authorizes reimbursement to parents for private school tuition and related expenses internal quotation marks and citations omitted babb knox county sch,cir the supreme court found that such reimbursement to parents for private school tuition and related expenses was appropriate.citing burlington,at.at tice botetourt county sch,cir if the tices can prove these placements in private school were proper,then they are entitled to reimbursement of all special education and related services expenses.bd.of educ.of cabell county dienelt,cir affirming a judgment that ordered the board to reimburse the dienelts for in tuition and related expenses of placing paul in a private school.
what constitutes private school tuition is.furthermore,the idea expansively defines related services as meaning 
transportation,and such developmental,corrective,and other supportive services including pathology and audiology services,interpreting services,psychological services,physical and occupational therapy,recreation,including therapeutic recreation,social work services,school nurse services designed to enable a child with a disability to receive a free appropriate public education as described in the individualized education program of the child,counseling services,including rehabilitation counseling,orientation and mobility services,and medical services,except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education,and includes the early identification and assessment of disabling conditions in children.
thus,if the board failed to offer a fape,the parents would be entitled to reimbursement for private school tuition to the extent the parents actually paid any and related services.related services,for the purposes of this case,would include private avt,transportation to and from avt,mapping programming for cochlear implant,and batteries for implant.in the scenario where parents request a fape for their child and the board fails to offer a fape,the parents placement of their child in private school is not considered voluntary.
however,if the school board offered a fape,then the parents are not entitled to reimbursement under the idea for either private school tuition or related services.see rowley,at.at if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.essentially,once the board offers a fape,the parents decision to place their child in private school is viewed as being voluntary,and the school board,under the idea,is not required to reimburse the parents for any cost associated with the child voluntary enrollment in private school.see a c i a.furthermore,once voluntarily placed in a private school,the child does not have a right under the idea to receive the same level of special education and related services
