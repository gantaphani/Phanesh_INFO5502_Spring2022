in this action,we address whether an employee of the regents of the university of california the regents must exhaust university internal administrative remedies before filing suit in superior court for retaliatory termination under either government code section,subdivision c,or labor code section,sometimes called the whistleblower statutes.we conclude the exhaustion rule requires university employees to exhaust university administrative remedies before proceeding to suit.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual background 
appellant janet campbell worked for the regents as a senior architect in the architectural design and engineering unit of the facilities management department fmd at the university of california,san francisco ucsf.the regents,a state government entity,administer the university of california,including ucsf.see california medical regents of university of california th,fn,d.campbell job duties included reviewing architectural plans and specifications for all campus construction projects costing less than,to ensure that the projects complied with competitive bidding laws.campbell claims that in,her supervisor at the fmd,acting on the regents behalf,directed her to prepare or help prepare bid documents that limited competition by using restrictive specifications.campbell protested to the regents on several occasions that using these documents to limit the bidding violated state competitive bidding laws.see pub.contract code,prohibiting state agencies from limiting contract bidding to any one specific concern.she later reported the alleged violations to the federal bureau of investigation fbi.
in,the fbi questioned ucsf officials about the alleged violations.the regents then changed campbell job duties,assigning her to what she perceived to be menial,less challenging projects.campbell soon went on extended disability leave.shortly after she returned to work,in january,she was discharged.the regents blamed her discharge on downsizing.campbell claimed that less senior and less qualified coworkers were retained,however.
on march,campbell,through her attorney,filed an internal complaint against ucsf and her supervisors.the complaint,filed under the grievance procedures set forth in ucsf personnel policies for staff members ppsm,alleged,among other things,that campbell was discharged in retaliation for being a.
on april,a ucsf staff member responded to the complaint in a letter to campbell attorney the letter.the letter stated that the ppsm complaint resolution process excluded allegations of retaliation for whistleblowing.the letter observed that such complaints were properly filed under ucsf policy and procedures for reporting improper governmental activities and protection against retaliation for reporting improper activities policy and procedures.the letter also stated,alleged violations of state and federal laws will be excluded from the ppsm complaint resolution process.a copy of the applicable policy and procedures was enclosed with the letter.campbell did not refile her complaint under the policy and procedures,as the letter directed.
section ix a of the policy and procedures sent to campbell states that any uc employee may file a written complaint against a university employee alleging threatened or actual interference or retaliation resulting from the reporting of improper activities retaliation is defined as the use of official authority or influence by a uc employee for the purpose of interfering with the right of a person to file a report as described in section v above,or the right to file such a report with the university auditor or with the auditor general of the state of california,or with other public officials designated to receive reports of improper activity.use of official authority to influence includes promising to confer,or conferring,any benefit effecting or threatening to effect any reprisal or taking,or directing others to take,or recommending,processing or approving any personnel action,including but not limited to appointment,promotion,transfer assignment,performance evaluation,suspension,or other disciplinary action.
the balance of section ix a contains provisions governing the complaint contents.immediately following that section is a paragraph titled,use of existing mechanisms.this paragraph states in pertinent part a complaint of must be filed under existing university grievance or complaint resolution procedures if acceptable under those procedures.if the complaint is not within the scope of any complaint resolution procedure available to the complainant under the appeals mechanism described in the previous paragraph,or if the complainant is an applicant for employment or does not have a complaint resolution procedure available for some other reason,the complaint may be filed under this policy.
the letter therefore informed campbell that the typical personnel manual grievance procedure did not apply to her grievance because she alleged state law violations.it also told her that she was required to file her grievance under the policy and procedures.
on june,campbell filed a whistleblower complaint against the regents in san francisco superior court,seeking damages for retaliatory termination under government code section and labor code section.she alleged that she had either exhausted all administrative remedies or was not required to exhaust them.the regents demurred to the complaint on the ground that campbell refusal to file a grievance under the policy and procedures,as the letter directed,amounted to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the trial court sustained the demurrer.it granted campbell leave to amend her complaint to allege either that she had fulfilled the exhaustion requirement,or that an exception to the requirement excused her from its application.
campbell first amended complaint alleged that she had filed an internal grievance complaint under the ppsm that government code section and labor code section did not require her to exhaust ucsf administrative remedies and that the letter informed her that the ppsm excluded her whistleblowing allegations.she also claimed that the letter did not advise her that if she failed initially to pursue the proper administrative remedies for the whistleblowing claim,she would be precluded from taking legal action.the regents again demurred to the amended complaint on the ground that campbell failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.
the trial court sustained the regents demurrer to the first amended complaint.it gave campbell leave to amend in order to plead that the futility doctrine excused her failure to exhaust,and that the regents did not notify her of the relevant grievance procedures.
campbell filed a second amended complaint,alleging that the principles of estoppel excused her from complying with exhaustion requirements because the regents had failed to inform her of the necessity to file a grievance under the policy.the regents demurred to that complaint on the grounds that campbell failed to allege that exhaustion would have been futile,and that she was properly advised of the applicable grievance procedures.the trial court sustained the regents demurrer to the second amended complaint without leave to amend and entered judgment in the regents favor.
campbell appealed.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.we granted campbell petition for review.
ii.discussion 
procedural background 
when reviewing a judgment dismissing a complaint after a successful demurrer,we assume the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations are true,and we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it in context.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,schifando.we also consider judicially noticeable matters.ibid.if we see a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff could cure the defect by amendment,then we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend.if we determine otherwise,then we conclude it did not.ibid.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.ibid.
b.the regents constitutional authority 
because the present action involves the rights of a ucsf employee,we should note the regents constitutional status.the california constitution establishes the regents as a public trust with full powers of organization and government.cal,art.ix,subd.a.we have observed that article ix,section,grants the r egents broad powers to organize and govern the university and limits the legislature power to regulate either the university or the r egents.this contrasts with the comprehensive power of regulation the legislature possesses over other state agencies.san francisco labor council regents of university of california cal d,labor council the regents are not bound by education code section when setting wage levels.this grant of constitutional power to the university includes the grant of powers,a view that is generally accepted in our jurisprudence.ishimatsu regents of university of california d.see also apte regents of university of california d.
the regents may also exercise powers,subject to legislative regulation.indeed,p olicies established by the regents as matters of internal regulation may enjoy a status equivalent to that of state statutes.regents of university of california city of santa monica d,citing hamilton regents.the authority granted the regents includes full powers of organization and government,subject only to such legislative control as may be necessary to insure compliance with the terms of the endowment of the university and the security of its funds.goldberg regents of university of california d.thus,t he regents have been characterized as a branch of the state itself citation or a statewide administrative agency citation regents of university of california city of santa monica,supra,d at,and i t is apparent that the regents as a constitutionally created arm of the state have virtual autonomy in ibid.therefore,t he regents have the general or power in regard to the university citation,and are with exceptions not material here fully empowered with respect to the organization and government of the university.goldberg,supra,d at.the regents may create a policy for handling whistleblower claims under their power to organize and govern the university.such a policy is treated as a statute in order to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies.
the regents are not entirely autonomous.the legislature may regulate the regents actions in three areas the regents can not compel appropriations for university salaries,because the legislature is vested with the power of appropriation statutes that express the state general police power,such as workers compensation laws,apply to the regents and when legislation regulating public agency activity addresses matters of statewide concern not involving internal university affairs,the legislation may be made applicable to the regents.labor council,supra,cal d at.
c.the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies 
as the court of appeal observed,the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies is well established in california jurisprudence,and should apply to campbell action.in brief,the rule is that where an administrative remedy is provided by statute,relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira.the rule is not a matter of judicial discretion,but is a fundamental rule of procedure binding upon all courts.id.at.we have emphasized that exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.citation.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d.the gist of westlake,rojo,and moreno is a respect for internal grievance procedures and the exhaustion requirement where the legislature has not specifically mandated its own administrative review process schifando,supra,cal th at,d.the exhaustion rule extends to employees seeking judicial review of an employer administrative findings.johnson city of loma linda,supra,cal th at,d.
the rule has important benefits it serves the salutary function of mitigating damages it recognizes the tribunal expertise and it promotes judicial economy by unearthing the relevant evidence and by providing a record should there be a review of the case.westlake,supra,cal d at.
as the court of appeal noted,the administrative remedies exhaustion rule has several exceptions,including,but not limited to,those campbell raises when the administrative agency can not provide an adequate remedy,and when the subject of controversy lies outside the agency jurisdiction.edgren regents of university of california d.edgren.these exceptions remain flexible and are by no means limited to those discussed here.ogo associates city of torrance d.
campbell contentions 
general principles 
campbell initially asserts that the exhaustion rule does not apply here because the regents provide inadequate administrative remedies and because her remedies lie outside the regents jurisdiction.she also claims that two antiretaliation statutes the legislature has enacted have superseded the exhaustion rule.as to the latter assertion,campbell points to no specific provision in either statute.rather,she asks this court to infer an exemption from the legislature statutory language allegedly authorizing direct access to the courts,in this and arguably related contexts.we address her claims separately 
alleged inadequate remedy 
campbell initially asserts that she should have direct access to the courts because she seeks not only reinstatement and back wages,but also money damages.campbell does not as a general matter dispute the adequacy of the regent remedial procedures.rather,she claims the exhaustion rule should not apply to her because the administrative remedy will always be inadequate compared to the damages remedy made expressly available to an aggrieved employee by the legislature under either government code section c or labor code section.not so.the regents policy and procedures allow the regents to provide the complainant with any appropriate relief and to impose any sanctions on the offending employees in accordance with existing disciplinary policies or contract provisions.
in addition,even though campbell complaint seeks money damages in addition to reinstatement,our cases hold that the policy considerations which support the imposition of a general exhaustion requirement remain compelling westlake,supra,cal d at.the logic holds even when no internal damage remedy is available,or a plaintiff seeks only money damages,so that resort to the courts is inevitable.as edgren explains,courts have found the rule inapplicable only when the agency lacks authority to hear the complaint,not when the administrative procedures arguably limit the remedy the agency may award.edgren,supra,d at.see also glendale city employees,city of glendale cal d,exhaustion rule does not apply when resolution of controversy falls outside scope of grievance procedures.we believe that the administrative proceeding will still promote judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence and by providing a record which the court may review.westlake,supra,cal d at.
we also disagree that campbell is exempt because the regents lack jurisdiction.tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,provides an example of the exception an agency lack of jurisdiction creates.in tiernan,a temporary academic employee term was not renewed.in her grievance she alleged that the law required her employer to adopt regulations governing notice of nonreappointment.the court found that the plaintiff claim fell within the jurisdictional exception because it required the grievance committee to determine whether the university had to adopt regulations or interpret established regulations.in such a case,the grievance committee could deny a claim on purely procedural grounds.id.at.by contrast,campbell action does not require the regents internal review board to decide the legality of current employer policies before considering the legality of the employer actions.
abelleira,supra,cal d,is also instructive.in abelleira,a group of unemployed san francisco dock workers petitioned for a writ of prohibition to restrain the court of appeal from enforcing a writ of mandate that it had issued against the california employment commission and in favor of their employer.the court of appeal determined that the commission acted beyond its statutory powers in requiring the workers to first satisfy the commission administrative procedures.thus,the commission had no jurisdiction to determine whether the dock workers were entitled to unemployment benefits.id.at.in reversing the court of appeal judgment,we held that the commission did have jurisdiction to make this determination,and that the dock workers correctly sought administrative review before filing their claim for benefits.id.at.in so doing,we observed that the unemployment insurance act provided for an administrative procedure.ibid.the claim therefore fell under the exhaustion of administrative remedies rule.id.at.
the present action involves a policy the regents established to handle complaints of retaliatory dismissal for whistleblowing in an orderly manner.because we may treat such a policy as equivalent to a statute in this action,and because that policy required campbell to resort initially to internal grievance practices and procedures,campbell had an administrative remedy within the meaning of abelleira and its progeny.
construction of government code section,subdivision c,and labor code section 
campbell next contends that neither government code section,subdivision c,nor labor code section requires her to exhaust her administrative remedies,and that the legislature therefore intended to abrogate the exhaustion requirement for actions such as hers.because campbell argument requires us to construe two statutes,we must ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of each law.citations.we begin by examining the language of each statute separately,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.the words,however,must be read in context,considering the nature and purpose of the statutory enactment s.citation.in this regard,sentences are not to be viewed in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme.citation.torres automobile club of california cal th,d,torres.
government code section,subdivision c 
government code section is part of the false claims act,the act.the act protects public funds by authorizing employee informants who discover fraudulent claims made against state and local governmental entities to file qui tam suits on behalf of those entities,city of hawthorne ex rel.wohlner h c disposal th,fn,d defining qui tam as part of a latin phrase meaning one who brings the action for the king as well as for himself.qui tam plaintiffs sue as informers under a statute on behalf of themselves and the state of california.qui tam plaintiffs may recover damages and penalties on behalf of public entities for themselves and the entities.id.at,d 
section addresses employer interference with employee disclosures of false claims.section,subdivision b,provides in pertinent part that no employer may discharge an employee because that employee has acted lawfully in disclosing false claims to law enforcement agencies.section,subdivision c,states that an employer who violates subdivision b shall be liable to pay all the employee costs and damages,including litigation costs and attorney fees.the last sentence of subdivision c provides,an employee may bring an action in the appropriate superior court of the state for the relief provided in this subdivision.campbell contends that by operation of the rules of statutory construction,this sentence relieved her of any requirement to exhaust administrative remedies.her contention fails,however,because it ignores the sentence context.
as the court of appeal observed,campbell presents no direct authority supporting her position.instead,she compares section,subdivision c,with sections,subdivision d,and,in order to argue that the legislature intended to abrogate the exhaustion requirement in her action.to analyze her argument,therefore,we first study section relevant content.
section sets forth procedures for the attorney general to follow in suing persons who have knowingly made a false claim for payment against the government and performed other acts that violate section.the attorney general must serve notice on the prosecuting authority of a political subdivision if the false claim involved that entity funds as well as state funds,subd.a.the prosecuting authority may intervene in the suit,subd.a.a prosecuting authority that initiates a civil action for violation of section must notify the attorney general,who may take primary responsibility for maintaining the action,subd.b.a person may bring a civil action for a percentage of the proceeds for a violation of this article as a qui tam plaintiff,subd.c.once filed,the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court ibid.qui tam plaintiffs shall file their complaints in superior court in camera.the statute gives the attorney general and any involved political subdivision days to decide whether to proceed with the action.if the attorney general office or the government agency does so,it takes primary responsibility for prosecuting the action.it may then dismiss or settle the action without the qui tam plaintiff consent,subds.c,e.
section,subdivision d,explicitly provides,no court shall have jurisdiction over a qui tam action based upon information discovered by a present or former employee of the government during the course of his or her employment,unless that employee first in good faith,exhausted existing internal procedures for reporting and seeking recovery of the falsely claimed sums through official channels and unless the government failed to act on the information provided within a reasonable period of time.italics added.as the regents observe,this disclosure requirement for qui tam plaintiffs is designed to prevent unjust enrichment of public employees who may have access to information concerning false claims and who may be uniquely situated to detect fraud.therefore,before employees may reap the financial rewards that are available to qui tam plaintiffs,they must first apprise their public employer of the false claims and allow it to investigate and seek to recover any falsely claimed sums.employees may proceed as qui tam plaintiffs against a defrauding party only if they have advised their public employer of the alleged fraud and it has failed to act,subd.d.
campbell characterizes the disclosure requirement for qui tam plaintiffs as a statutory requirement to exhaust administrative remedies.but she misunderstands the statute.although it contains the words exhausted and internal procedures,the statute does not address employees grievances in cases where employees must seek administrative remedies.the qui tam plaintiff disclosure requirements are unique to the qui tam setting.they ensure that public employers will have the opportunity to investigate and pursue fraud claims against third parties before the employees can initiate any qui tam action against those parties.in other words,section,subdivision d,concerns administrative procedures that employees must follow when they report false claims that third parties have made against the government and recover funds they have lost.by contrast,the cases from westlake to schifando concern administrative remedies that an employer provides when an employee has a grievance against it.because section,subdivision d,does not address an employee remedy for an alleged grievance,it is irrelevant to our interpretation of section,subdivision c,regarding application of the exhaustion rule.
campbell reliance on the specific exhaustion requirements in section,subdivision c,of the california whistleblower protection act is equally unavailing.that statute provides that any person who intentionally retaliates against a university of california employee for having made a protected disclosure shall be liable for damages in an action the injured employee may bring.ibid.section defines the term protected disclosure as any good faith communication that discloses or demonstrates an intention to disclose information about improper governmental activity or any condition that threatens public or employee health or safety,subd.d.this definition does not exclude communications to governmental or law enforcement agencies 
as the regents observe,the statute permits aggrieved university employees to file a damages action provided they have followed the administrative procedures and filed an administrative complaint before filing their lawsuit,subd.a.of note here,the employee may not proceed with a court action against the university unless that institution has failed to reach an administrative decision on the action within specified time limits,subd.c.in such a case,the employee may file a lawsuit for damages even though the administrative complaint is pending.if,by contrast,the university has reached a decision on the administrative action,the statute does not authorize any statutory damages action.
campbell contends that because section,subdivision c,includes an explicit exhaustion requirement,section,subdivision c silence on the issue must be deliberate.she claims we are thus required to find that the latter statute does not require her to have exhausted her administrative remedies before filing the present action.we disagree.by enacting section,the legislature created a specific exception to the administrative remedy rule.this exemption was intended to augment other internal administrative procedures available to university employees.as the court of appeal observed,the express mention in one statute of a fundamental precondition of filing suit against an administrative agency does not abrogate that requirement in every statute that is silent on the matter.flores los angeles turf club cal d,legislative silence on the exhaustion requirement does not manifest a legislative intent to eliminate it see also teichert son,state of cal.d,disapproved on another ground by morrill state of california cal d.the legislature language in the context of section says nothing about its intent under section,subdivision c.indeed,the legislature silence in the latter statute makes the common law exhaustion rule applicable here and requires employees to exhaust their internal administrative remedies prior to filing a lawsuit.
campbell also mistakenly relies on hentzel singer d.hentzel,contending it holds that courts will not impose an administrative remedies exhaustion requirement unless the statute specifically mandates one.in hentzel,the employee plaintiff sued for wrongful discharge,alleging four common law causes of action.id.at.the court of appeal addressed the tort cause of action for wrongful discharge in retaliation for the plaintiff attempt to obtain a reasonably work environment.the employee allegation brought him within the scope of labor code section,which is part of the california occupational safety and health act legislation.labor code section provides an administrative remedy for an employee who is discharged in violation of labor code section,upon complaint,division of labor standards enforcement shall investigate if a violation of labor code,section is found,it shall bring an action on behalf of employee for back wages and injunctive relief.the defendant employer claimed the plaintiff failure to satisfy exhaustion requirements barred the lawsuit.hentzel,supra,d at.
the hentzel court found that the suit was not barred.it held that w here a statute creates a right that did not exist at common law,and provides a comprehensive system of administrative enforcement,a requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted may be implied.citation.but,generally,where a statutory remedy is provided for the enforcement of a right,the newer statutory remedy will be considered only cumulative.hentzel,supra,d at.
campbell did not plead a wrongful discharge common law tort.her amended complaint sought damages under section and labor code section,statutes that create a right that did not exist at common law.similarly,ucsf policies and procedures,which are equivalent to a statute,also create a right that did not exist at common law and provide a comprehensive system of administrative enforcement.under hentzel rationale,we may infer a requirement that campbell exhaust administrative remedies.see also grant superior court d.finding exhaustion doctrine applies under public resources code section even though statute is silent on doctrine and legislature provides no express exemption from it.
labor code section 
campbell also seeks relief under labor code section subdivision b of that section provides that no employer may retaliate against an employee for disclosing to a government or law enforcement agency information about violations of law or failure to comply with regulations.for purposes of labor code sections to,labor code section defines employee as including employees of the university of california.
labor code section states,nothing in this chapter shall prevent the injured employee from recovering damages from his employer for injury suffered through a violation of this chapter.campbell contends that this provision,together with the chapter silence on administrative remedies,the effect of which we discuss ante,d at pages,at pages,means that employees need not satisfy any exhaustion requirement before they may file a lawsuit under labor code section.
but this contention also ignores the provision context.labor code section provides misdemeanor criminal penalties for a violation of the chapter.labor code section makes the employer responsible for the acts of all managers,agents,and employees i n all prosecutions under this chapter.the placement of labor code section immediately after the provisions for criminal prosecution of violations of the chapter seems intended to preserve employees rights to file civil complaints for such violations.the context of labor code section,as well as the past years of california law on administrative remedies,argues against its abrogating the exhaustion requirement.
in addition,labor code section silence on the exhaustion requirement does not change our interpretation.as discussed ante,d at page,at pages,and as torres recognized,courts should not presume the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow principles of law unless that intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.torres,supra,cal th at,d.
campbell also asserts that the legislative history of assembly bill reg.sess,later codified as labor code section,shows that the legislature intended labor code section to except university of california employees from the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies.as noted above,statutory construction begins with the statute language.torres,supra,cal th at,d.in,when campbell filed her superior court suit,labor code section stated in part for purposes of sections,and,employee includes,but is not limited to,any individual employed by the university of california.the statute plain language also does not support campbell contention.the addition of section to the labor code was intended to extend the rights available to private employees to include public employees,and nothing more.
campbell argues otherwise.she emphasizes that the assembly committee on labor and employment,chaired by the bill author,did report on april,that the bill would give public employees the right to file a private action without having to exhaust administrative remedies.the assembly ways and means committee repeated this analysis on may.assem.com.on ways and means,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.
but when the bill reached the senate,the analysis no longer mentioned the exhaustion of administrative remedies.the senate committee on industrial relations explained that,while existing law prohibited employers from retaliating against employees who disclosed to governmental or law enforcement agencies information relating to violations of state or federal law,these provisions are silent as to their applicability to public employees.generally,however,provisions of the labor code apply only to employees in the private sector unless they are specifically made applicable to public emp
