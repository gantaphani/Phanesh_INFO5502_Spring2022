introduction 
this is the second lawsuit filed by plaintiff vicki pollock,against her former employer,the university of southern california.the earlier lawsuit pollock i was filed during the termination process.the instant lawsuit pollock ii was filed after pollock was finally discharged from employment,but while her appeal in pollock i was pending before this court.in both actions pollock challenged the method by which she was terminated from her tenured position.in pollock i,we held all of pollock contentions were without merit and her sole remedy for alleged defects in the process by which the university revoked her tenure and discharged her from service is by administrative mandamus.
in this appeal,we review the judgment entered after the trial court sustained the demurrer filed by the university and defendant william tierney,together,defendants are referred to as the university and denied pollock leave to amend.the contentions raised in pollock ii are nearly identical to those raised in pollock i and again we conclude they are meritless.moreover,as the same issues were decided in pollock i,much of pollock complaint here is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
we issued an order to show cause why we should not impose sanctions for a frivolous appeal.cal.rules of court,rule e.concluding pollock appeal is meritless,we hold her appeal is frivolous in re marriage of flaherty cal d,and impose sanctions.
factual and procedural background 
predicate facts.
for review purposes,we assume the truth of the allegations in pollock complaint.gulf ins.tig ins.th,d.since,pollock was a tenured member of the university department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences faculty.in,pollock was assigned to a clinical position as a psychologist with the department of psychiatry ingleside hospital.the university also required her to obtain funding to conduct research independently through outside grants.pollock protested her assignment by agreeing to teach only on tuesdays and thursdays.after two years during which pollock reported to ingleside hospital only two out of the five assigned days per week,the university charged her with serious neglect of duty.
the university commenced dismissal proceedings.pollock unsuccessfully attempted to enjoin the proceedings and then sued the university.the gravamen of the complaint in pollock i was that the university secretly modified the faculty handbook by changing the bases and procedures for dismissal in an effort to facilitate dismissal of tenured faculty,and created a dismissal machinery with which it could remove tenured faculty virtually at will.pollock university of southern california november,wl nonpub.opn.pollock further alleged in that action that the university falsified charges against her and forced her out of her research position into clinical work.in our earlier opinion,we affirmed the sustaining of the demurrer to pollock complaint on the ground that because the dismissal process had not been completed and no decision about pollock continued employment had been made,no cognizable adverse employment action had yet been taken against pollock.
more relevant to this appeal,we held in pollock i that pollock challenges to the procedure by which the university revokes her tenure and discharges her from employment as distinguished from her claims for retaliation and discrimination were barred by the rule of pomona college superior court th,d hereinafter,pomona college.in pomona college,a professor sued the college after being denied tenure.division two of this district court of appeal held in pomona college that judicial review of tenure decisions,as opposed to discrimination claims,in both public and private universities in california is limited to evaluating the fairness of the administrative hearing in an administrative mandamus action.id.at,d.the pomona college court explained that academic peers are uniquely positioned to evaluate a tenure candidate teaching,research,and contributions to particular field of study.id.at,d.the pomona college court recognized,courts must be vigilant not to intrude into that determination,and should not substitute their judgment for that of the college with respect to the qualifications of faculty members for promotion and tenure.id.at,d.as they are not positioned to consider the substantive merits of the tenure decision,absent discrimination,courts are left only with reviewing the fairness of the hearing in an administrative mandamus action.id.at,d.the pomona college court held,california law provides to those who feel wronged by procedural defects in the tenure opposed to those who disagree with substantive remedy.that remedy is administrative mandamus.id.at,d.
applying pomona college,we held in pollock i t he gravamen of pollock complaint is that the university utilized questionable and unauthorized methods and procedures to force her to resign or to revoke her tenure.the complaint repeatedly attacks the dismissal machinery or the process by which a tenured faculty member is dismissed from service with the university.it is therefore manifest that pomona college finally disposes of pollock claims other than those for discrimination and retaliation.pollock i,supra,wl.
also in pollock i,wl we reject ed pollock repeated arguments that the university dismissal process is replete with procedural and due process deficiencies and that it would be futile to pursue her administrative remedies because they are rife with flaws and are part of the scheme to force her to resign.pollock i,supra,wl.we said that pollock could not avoid mandamus review by seeking damages for the procedural unfairness in the university dismissal process.that is exactly the purpose behind administrative mandamus evaluate the fairness of the administrative hearing.citation.such purpose extend s to the questions of whether the defendant has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.citation.pollock i,supra,wl quoting code civ,subd.b.in pollock i,we held pollock was required to file a petition for writ of administrative mandamus to pursue her claims.
while the appeal in pollock i was pending,the university completed its dismissal process in august.pollock had been given a hearing before a faculty panel.the university hearing panel found adequate cause to dismiss pollock.pollock was formally discharged from her position in september.
on june,while the appeal in pollock i was before this court,pollock commenced pollock ii,her second lawsuit seeking damages from the university arising from the revocation of her tenure and her termination from employment.
pollock ii.
cast as seven causes of action,the complaint against the university seeks damages for perjury fraud and deceit wrongful termination in violation of public policy breach of contract retaliation in violation of california fair employment and housing act,et,the feha sex discrimination in violation of the feha and age discrimination in violation of the feha.
in her complaint,just as in pollock i,pollock describes in the first pages how the university created its dismissal machine by surreptitiously and without notice to the tenured faculty,altering key terms of the tenure contract defining the bases for dismissal,and falsely asserting the changes were approved by the faculty representative body,the academic senate.specifically,pollock alleges,just as she did in her first lawsuit,that the university substituted a semicolon for a comma after the word misconduct in the section defining adequate cause,changed the size and selection method for grievance and dismissal panels,and rigged sham panel s.continuing,she alleges the university used this dismissal machine to implement a scheme to terminate tenured professors,including pollock,virtually at will.
in her first cause of action entitled perjury,pollock alleges the university made false assertions about the punctuation in the faculty handbook definition of adequate cause.these false assertions were allegedly made in a declaration signed by tierney and filed in pollock tierney was the then president of the university faculty and of the academic senate.in his declaration,tierney stated he had conducted an investigation into pollock allegation that the university administration had fraudulently altered the usc faculty handbook and concluded that the changes were proposed by the academic senate.attached to his declaration were the communications tierney had sent to the faculty reporting this finding.pollock complaint alleges that tierney declaration is false.
in the second cause of action for damages for fraud,pollock alleges the university falsely misrepresented to her the faculty authority to alter the tenure contract and create the dismissal machine.had she known of the falsity of the representations at any time before termination proceedings were begun,pollock alleges she would have sought a position at another university.
with respect to the fourth cause of action asserting breach of her employment contract,pollock alleges that her failure to submit to the assignment at ingleside hospital was not adequate cause for dismissal,with the result her dismissal and its procedure breached the implied covenant to adhere to due process and fundamental fairness.
the university demurred to pollock first,second,and fourth causes of action,all claims except the statutory discrimination and public policy claims.the university also moved to strike some of the asserted public policy bases of the third cause of action for wrongful termination against public policy,and moved for sanctions against pollock and her counsel for failing to seek review by administrative mandamus.
the trial court sustained the university demurrer without leave to amend and granted,in part,the university motion to strike.at pollock suggestion,the trial court dismissed the public policy cause of action without prejudice,but dismissed with prejudice the discrimination claims.pollock timely appeal followed entry of judgment dismissing the entire action.
contention 
pollock contends the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend 
discussion 
standard of review.
we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citations.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.citation.carden getzoff d,quoting blank kirwan cal d.
pollock can not state claims for fraud or breach of contract.
pollock fraud and breach of contract claims are nothing more than a duplication of her first lawsuit.as before,the gravamen of pollock complaint is an attack on the legitimacy of the dismissal process.she claims the university used clandestine and fraudulent methods to modify the grounds for discipline and the procedures for review so as to revoke her tenure and then to discharge her from her position at the university.
existing case law resolves the second and fourth causes of action.
pomona college remains dispositive.pursuant to pomona college,an administrative mandamus action code civ,provides the exclusive remedy to a professor in a private university for any procedural defects which he or she believes existed in the tenure review or in the grievance process.pomona college,supra,th at,d.any challenge pollock seeks to make to the process and procedure by which the university used dismissal machinery,revoked her tenure,dismissed her from service,or determined that pollock refusal to work at ingleside hospital constituted serious neglect of duty or misconduct by academic norms,should have been raised by way of an administrative mandamus action.that is,apart from the discrimination and perjury claims,pollock may only raise her claims by way of a petition for writ of administrative mandamus.given that she failed to file such a writ petition,no amount of amendment to the complaint can render these claims viable.thus,the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer and denying leave to amend.
pollock argues we should disregard pomona college,supra,th,as unsound.we decline to disregard pomona college because it is well reasoned.also,we already rejected pollock same request in pollock i,and instead based our decision on pomona college.furthermore,subsequent to our opinion in pollock i,pomona college was relied on by division two of this district court of appeal in gutkin university of southern california th,d,which mirrors pollock case.gutkin,a faculty member who,like pollock,lost his tenure and was discharged from employment,also sued the university challenging the dismissal machinery.id.at,d.the gutkin court reached the same result based on pomona college as we did in pollock i and have here,namely,that the university demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend because gutkin failed to challenge the university tenure and grievance procedure by way of administrative mandamus.gutkin,at,d.gutkin parallels this case and,along with pomona college,disposes of pollock second and fourth causes of action.
pollock contends reliance on pomona college deprives her of the right to a jury trial.pomona college set forth a very cogent rationale for limiting the scope of judicial review of decisions academic peers are the only individuals capable of evaluating a scholar credentials and contributions.this is because peers are alone equipped to assess aspects of arcane scholarship,to make subjective determinations about teaching ability,research scholarship,and professional stature,and to judge whether a colleague work reflects favorably on the institution.pomona college,supra,th at,d.universities should be free to establish priorities and set levels of academic achievement.ibid.lay jurors are simply not qualified to make the necessary assessments.as the pomona college court explained,courts and juries should not intrude on the tenure decision and should not substitute their judgment for that of academics about the qualifications of faculty members for promotion and tenure.id.at,d.
pollock same the pomona college rule thwarts the right to jury also rejected in gutkin university of southern california,supra,th at page,d in his attempt to distinguish pomona college,gutkin appears to contend that once the initial decision to grant or deny tenure has been made,the judgment of the professor academic peers falls by the wayside,and a lay jury may then step in to determine whether he or she remains entitled to full membership in the academic community.but such a determination still requires an assessment of whether the professor conduct is consistent with or contrary to academic norms,which only academic peers,not lay jurors,are qualified to determine.gutkin is persuasive.pollock argument that an administrative proceeding will deny a professor a trial by jury has been twice rejected by published opinions.
pollock also argues,with respect to her fraud claim,that it is actionable under lazar superior court cal th,d.she argues the university deceit induced pollock into sic remaining at the university when,had she known about the university intentions,she would have made a lateral move to a tenured slot at another university.underlining in original.
this same argument was also discarded by the gutkin court when it stated,lazar involved fraudulent inducement to enter into an employment contract the employer fraudulently induced the plaintiff to move from the east coast to california not a fraudulent inducement to remain at the university as gutkin would have it.lazar thus has no application to the facts of this case.as the supreme court stated in hunter,cal th,d,i t is difficult to conceive of a wrongful termination case in which a misrepresentation made by the employer to effect termination could ever rise to the level of a separately actionable fraud.in essence,such misrepresentations are merely the means to the end desired by the employer,termination of employment.they can not serve as a predicate for tort damages otherwise unavailable under foley interactive data cal d.gutkin university of southern california,supra,th at,d,italics added.
we followed pomona college in pollock i and find gutkin reiteration of pomona college to be persuasive.thus,other than her discrimination,perjury,and based claims,pomona college and gutkin finally dispose of pollock challenges to the manner and method by which the university took disciplinary action against her.
b.the doctrine of res judicata bars the second and fourth causes of action.
quite apart from the pomona college and gutkin decisions,the doctrine of res judicata precludes pollock from relitigating the second and fourth causes of action.pollock i is a final decision on the merits that administrative mandamus is pollock exclusive remedy for her claim of procedural defects in the proceeding to revoke her tenure and dismiss her from service.
the doctrine of res judicata rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift th,d.the doctrine of res claim when the issues decided in the prior adjudication are identical with those presented in the later action there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action and the party against whom the plea is raised was a party or was in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.lyons security pacific nat.bank th,d.
the issues in pollock two complaints are the same,regardless of the theory and title pollock attaches to the various causes of actions.the primary right pollock seeks to vindicate branson growers th,d in both pollock i and in pollock ii is the injury to her right to fairness in the procedures used to revoke her tenure and discharge her from employment.in fact,much of her complaint here is simply a duplicate of the complaint in pollock 
our opinion in pollock i is a final judgment on the merits,as the supreme court has denied review.the fact that the appeal in pollock i resulted from the sustaining of a general demurrer does not preclude application of the res judicata doctrine.ojavan investors,california coastal com.th,d.a judgment on a general demurrer will have the effect of a bar in a new action in which the complaint states the same facts which were held not to constitute a cause of action on the former demurrer or,notwithstanding differences in the facts alleged,when the ground on which the demurrer in the former action was sustained is equally applicable to the second one.citations.mckinney county of santa clara d.the complaints in both actions allege the same facts concerning the creation of a dismissal procedure designed to thwart tenure,and seek vindication of the same primary right to fairness in the tenure and grievance process.also,the grounds upon which the demurrers in both pollock i and pollock ii were sustained are the identical,purely legal analysis under pomona college.the only difference between pollock i and pollock ii is that the university has now completed the dismissal procedure.still,pollock second action seeks damages for the perceived unfairness of the procedure by which the university brought and disposed of the charges against her.therefore,these claims were fully and finally adjudicated in pollock i and are thus barred.ibid.the second and fourth causes of action are finally disposed of by our opinion in pollock 
pollock appeal from the dismissal of her third cause of action is not reviewable.
the trial court granted in part the university motion to strike certain of the public policy grounds pollock alleged in her third cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.thereafter,pollock voluntarily dismissed that cause of action.pollock challenges the ruling on the motion to strike certain of the policies listed in the third cause of action.
however,the validity of the court order striking allegations is not reviewable.yancey fink d.a wilful dismissal terminates the action for all time and affords the appellate court no jurisdiction to review rulings on motions made prior to the dismissal.indeed,gutkin tried this maneuver to the same effect.there,the appellate court stated,because gutkin dismissed his remaining claims in this case without prejudice,the voluntary dismissal could not have the legal effect of a final judgment,and could not serve to expedite an appeal.by voluntarily dismissing the action without prejudice gutkin lost his ability to challenge the trial court interim orders.accordingly,no appeal lies from earlier discovery orders.gutkin university of southern california,supra,th at,d.similarly,no appeal lies here from the grant of the university motion to strike some of the public policies listed in the third cause of action.
pollock can not allege a cause of action for perjury,abuse of process,or malicious prosecution of civil proceedings.
pollock first cause of action for damages for perjury is based on tierney declaration,filed in pollock i,in which he explained his conclusion that the changes in punctuation made to the definition of adequate cause in the faculty handbook were not surreptitious or fraudulent,but approved by the academic senate.in her complaint at issue here,pollock alleges tierney declaration is perjurious.this is the only part of this appeal that has not otherwise been disposed of by pollock i,pomona college,or gutkin.the contention is nonetheless unavailing.
there is no civil cause of action for perjury.taylor bidwell cal,kappel bartlett d.see temple community hospital superior court cal th,d.perjury is a criminal wrong.
on appeal,as she did below,pollock argues that her perjury claim is really a cause of action for malicious prosecution or for abuse of process and she seeks leave to amend to allege one of these theories.
the tort of malicious prosecution of a civil proceeding requires the institution of a civil action by the defendant and the action favorable termination for the plaintiff.adams superior court th,d bertero national general cal d.the facts alleged by pollock can not support a claim for malicious prosecution of a civil proceeding because neither the university nor tierney instituted the earlier proceeding,pollock i,pollock did and the earlier proceeding was not terminated in pollock favor.although the university filed tierney declaration in connection with its motion for sanctions during pollock i,a malicious prosecution claim can not be based on subsidiary procedural actions taken within the litigation adams superior court,supra,at,d,such as a motion for sanctions.therefore,pollock can not amend her complaint to allege this cause of action.
the tort of abuse of process is barred by the litigation privilege,which protects a publication or broadcast b in any judicial proceeding,subd.b,italics added.section,subdivision b is a defense to an abuse of process action.abraham lancaster community hospital d.carden getzoff,supra,d at.the privilege is broadly applied to protect most publications within lawsuits provided there is some connection between the lawsuit and the publication.citation.adams superior court,supra,th at,d silberg anderson cal d.doubts about the privilege applicability are resolved in favor of its use.ibid.
this court held the civil code section,subdivision b privilege applied to bar a claim for abuse of process for the filing of an allegedly false document valuing a husband medical practice in a dissolution action.in carden getzoff,supra,d at page,we stated,while courts have argued about the scope of the privilege citation,it is clear that the privilege has been applied to publicati
