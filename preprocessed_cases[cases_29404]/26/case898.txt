at all times relevant to this suit,neil was a student at california state university fresno fresno state,where he was an outspoken political conservative and critic of the university.in may,confronted and videotaped two professors in their offices,questioning them about a poem that had been published in a supplement to the student newspaper.after disciplinary proceedings,the university found that had violated the student conduct code prohibition on harassment and intimidation that poses a threat to others.the university imposed sanctions.brought suit in district court against several faculty members and administrators,alleging violations of his constitutional rights including those protected by the first amendment.the district court dismissed the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.
we hold that california code of regulations,tit,b,which authorizes branches of california state university to discipline students for conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person including intimidation or harassment,is not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague.we hold,further,that the regulation supported imposing discipline for conduct.however,we also hold that complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a plausible first amendment retaliation claim against some of the defendants.we therefore reverse in part and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
factual allegations 
the following narrative is based on allegations in first amended complaint fac.for present purposes,we assume that the allegations of fact and reasonably drawn inferences are true.
plaintiff neil enrolled as a junior at fresno state in the fall semester of to pursue a degree in recreation,who describes himself as a constitutional conservative,quickly involved himself in political advocacy on campus.he formed the fresno chapter of the student organization young americans for liberty he organized events for the central valley tea party and he frequently attended student government meetings.
soon became an outspoken critic of the fresno state faculty and administration.he particularly objected to the university support for the student body president,an undocumented immigrant,and to the administrators endorsement of the dream act.began a website on which he posted information he had discovered about the student body president on the internet and through irs records searches.he also posted criticism of fresno state separate graduation ceremony for latino students.he filed public records requests to obtain information on administrator salaries and other issues,and he spoke up at student government meetings.he learned that his records requests were reported all the way up to president john welty.
in response to the activities just described,university officials monitored and interfered with activities.during first year at fresno state,carolyn coon,assistant dean of student affairs,requested that students and other faculty members gather information and complaints to use against him.the director of alumni relations sent emails to other administrators,including the university communications director,requesting that they do something about and his website.in the fall of,university officials deleted some of posts from facebook pages that were operated and managed by university officials and permanently block ed him from posting about certain issues on the pages while,at the same time,allowing the posts of view points in support of the student body president and other leftist posts to remain.
videotaping incident 
in early may,read a poem in la voz de aztlan,a supplement to the fresno state student newspaper published by the chicano and latin american studies cls department.objected to the ways in which the poem characterized the united states including america the land robbed by the white savage,the land of the biggest genocide,the place of greed and slavery,the rapist of the earth,and the land of the brute,the bully,the land of glorified killers,the eater of souls.on may,went to the second floor of the social sciences building to confront victor torres,the faculty advisor for la voz and a professor in the cls department.while waiting in the hallway outside torres office,overheard maria lopes,another cls professor,comment to torres that was stalking the hallway.torres said to lopes that the faculty should post wanted signs with pictures of face on them to mock him and to serve as a warning to other students and faculty as to what he looked like and warn of his potential presence.after overhearing these comments,decided to approach not only torres but also lopes.
approached torres open office door,turned on his video camera,and asked torres if he had approved of the publication of the poem.torres refused to speak to him.calmly insisted on speaking to torres about the poem.torres then picked up the phone and called campus police.next went to the open door of lopes office,with his video camera turned on,and asked her the same questions.she,too,refused to answer,stating that she did not want to talk to him.when insisted,she closed her office door and called campus police.torres and lopes subsequently filed complaints with the fresno state campus police.luz gonzalez,dean of the social sciences department of which the cls department is a part,also filed a complaint with the campus police,even though she had not been present during the videotaping incident.provided to the campus police a copy of the videotape he had made while confronting torres and lopes.
when torres and lopes later read the campus police report of the may incident,they learned that the campus police investigator had determined that was not threatening and intimidating.defendants torres,lopes and gonzalez requested the campus police to rewrite the report to show that was threatening and intimidating.the fac does not specify whether the report was rewritten as requested,but we infer from other allegations in the fac that it was not.at the request of unspecified defendants,the campus police report ed the matter to the fresno county district attorney,but the district attorney declined to prosecute.
the fac alleges that on may t he campus police department,now having reviewed the actual video tape of the incident contacted defendants torres and lopes again to confront them about what they claimed did and said,the length of time he was in each of their offices,and to let both torres and lopes know that the video tape of the incident showed that their previous claims were not accurate.both refused to correct their false claims.
also on may,dean coon mailed a letter to informing him that he was facing disciplinary action.the letter stated that his actions on may constituted conduct that threatens or endangers the health,or safety including physical abuse,threats,intimidation,harassment the letter required him to attend a judicial conference or face a possible disciplinary hold on his record.
disciplinary proceedings 
in response,emailed dean coon,copying president welty and campus police,stating that torres and lopes accusations were completely false,and stating that campus police had not contacted to request a statement.asked coon to provide him with copies of reports made by all students,staff,and administrators about.coon initially agreed to provide such reports but later refused to do so.requested that he be allowed to bring an attorney to the judicial conference,and that he be allowed to videotape and otherwise record the proceedings.
paul oliaro,vice president for the division of student affairs and dean of students,replied to,stating that president welty had asked him to respond.oliaro wrote that pursuant to a policy of president welty,attorneys were not permitted to participate in judicial proceedings,but that could bring a advisor.oliaro also wrote that would not be allowed to record or videotape the judicial conference.
the judicial conference took place on june.brought an attorney,but the attorney was not allowed to participate in the conference.brought no other advisor.at the conference,dean coon offered a settlement under which would admit the allegations against him and would agree to sanctions restricting him from coming within feet of cls faculty,staff,and offices.refused to sign the proposed settlement.
on august,dean coon sent a letter stating that disciplinary charges had been filed.the letter charged him with violation of california code of regulations,tit.b student conduct code,which authorizes disciplinary sanctions for student conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person including physical abuse,threats,intimidation,harassment,or sexual misconduct.the letter detailed the procedures of a judicial hearing at which could contest the charges.the letter stated that could bring a advisor,but not an attorney,to the hearing.
the judicial hearing was held on september.attorney was not permitted in the hearing room.the hearing officer was marcus freeman,who held unspecified positions in the arts and humanities department and in the human resources department.again asked permission to record the proceedings,and was again refused.he asked to be provided a copy of the recording that was being made by the university,but was refused on the ground that the recording was university property.dean coon was identified as the investigator at the hearing.torres,lopes,dean gonzalez and all testified.
asked freeman,the hearing officer,to look at the videotape he had made during the may incident,but freeman refused to do so.then sought to have campus police detective manucharyan,who had seen the video,testify about what it contained.attorney had interviewed manucharyan,who had told the attorney that torres and lopes had not been truthful when they reported the may incident to the campus police,and when they spoke to manucharyan during his investigation.attorney was sitting with manucharyan in the lobby,out of earshot of the hearing room.dean coon left the hearing room to call campus police.when she returned,she reported that an unidentified person at the police station had informed her that manucharyan was not available,and that since the matter was an ongoing investigation,none of the officers or detectives would be able to come testify or comment on it.the fac alleges that manucharyan was prepared to testify,but no one from fresno state advised defendant coon or freeman of that fact.the fac is silent on the question why did not inform freeman that manucharyan was outside the hearing room and was prepared to testify.
on september,after having received a report from freeman recommending disciplinary sanctions against,vice president oliaro rendered a final,decision finding that had violated the student conduct code.oliaro concluded that torres and lopes could reasonably have found behavior to be intimidating and harassing and were concerned for their safety.oliaro had not provided a copy of freeman report and recommendation to prior to reaching his decision.according to the fac,freeman report was replete with inaccuracies and blatant manipulation of the evidence.
vice president oliaro imposed two sanctions first,was prohibited from coming within feet of cls faculty,staff,offices,or classrooms,or from coming onto the second floor of the social sciences building,unless he had prescheduled business,a class,or an appointment.second,was placed on disciplinary probation through the spring semester.freeman had not recommended this second sanction.as a consequence of the probationary status imposed by oliaro,was prohibited by university rule from being president or treasurer of the campus chapter of young americans for liberty,and from holding any position in student government.
further incidents 
was involved in two further incidents involving the fresno state faculty and campus police.first,on december and,after the sanction had been imposed,returned to the social sciences building to evaluate the building for compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada,as part of a class assignment.he was confronted on both days by dean gonzalez and other faculty members.
on the first day,dean gonzalez confronted and told him that he was not allowed in the building.told gonzalez that he had a class assignment and that he was therefore permitted to be in the building.gonzalez called the campus police.after the police arrived,they followed for about to minutes as he worked on the assignment.because of the delays occasioned by dean gonzalez calling the campus police,was unable to complete the assignment.
on the second day,came back to complete the assignment,this time bringing his video camera with him.dean gonzalez again loudly confronted,scolding him that he was not permitted to be there.another faculty member in the sociology department,matthew jendian,loudly confronted and then confronted and pursued as he was videotaping.the confrontation intensified nearly to the point of physical violence.according to the fac,continuously backed away from jendian as he was attempting to videotape the encounter.gonzalez again requested campus police.jendian reported to the police that had been the aggressor in the confrontation.as a result of gonzalez claim that was not allowed in the building,campus police detained until his attorney arrived at the police station.after campus police saw a copy of the order and an email from professor describing his assignment and authorizing his presence in the building,they released.vice president oliaro afterwards informed that his presence in the building to work on his class assignment had not violated his probation.however,to avoid confusion in the future,oliaro told that going forward he expect ed him to notify dean gonzalez office at least hours before entering the building.
second,in spring semester enrolled in two courses that met on the second floor of the social sciences building.attorney contacted the campus police ahead of time to inform them that would be attending classes in the building.on the first day of the semester,arrived early for class and sat down to eat lunch at a table at the end of the hallway,near the cls department offices,where students often ate and chatted before class.as he sat down,a cls professor told him that he was not allowed in that hallway.the professor informed dean gonzalez and the campus police.several days later vice president oliaro contacted by email to reiterate that he was not to be within feet of cls offices or faculty unless he was attending class or on other authorized business.
district court proceedings 
filed suit in state court alleging violations of his constitutional rights,naming as defendants president welty,vice president oliaro,dean coon,dean gonzalez,torres,lopes,jendian,and other unknown faculty and campus law enforcement officers collectively defendants.defendants removed to federal court.filed the operative fac in federal court,alleging violations of specific constitutional rights by specific defendants under,and a conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights under.in particular,he alleged that defendants imposed discipline under an unconstitutionally overbroad and vague regulation,that they imposed discipline for having engaged in speech and conduct protected by the first amendment,that they retaliated against him for having engaged in protected speech and conduct,and that they violated his right to equal protection,procedural due process,freedom from unreasonable search and seizure,free association,right to travel,and right to petition for grievances.the videotape made by on may was not attached to the fac or otherwise made part of the record.
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.relying on the public forum doctrine,the district court held that the social sciences building was a forum,and that fresno state could therefore enforce a regulation on speech.the court held that confrontation of torres and lopes in their offices on may could reasonably have been perceived to be harassment and intimidation within the meaning of the regulation.the district court further held that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to show that the professors complaints,the disciplinary hearing,or the later emails clarifying the sanctions were motivated by retaliation for the content of speech rather than violation of the regulation.the court rejected other constitutional claims.finally,the court held that because there had been no constitutional violation,defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.
on appeal,contests the district court dismissal of his first amendment claims.is joined by amici,who argue that california code of regulations,tit,b is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad both facially and as applied to.
we reject facial and first amendment challenges to the regulation.however,we hold that has alleged sufficient facts showing retaliation for protected speech to survive a motion to dismiss.other constitutional claims are waived for failure to argue them sufficiently on appeal.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.outdoor media,city of beaumont,cir.
iii.harassment and intimidation 
we begin by considering first amendment challenge to fresno state decision that he violated the student conduct code,as codified in state regulations.section b of title of the california code of regulations authorizes branches of the california state university to impose discipline for c onduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person within or related to the university community,including physical abuse,threats,intimidation,harassment,or sexual misconduct.vice president oliaro found,on behalf of fresno state,that violated this regulation when he confronted torres and lopes in their offices with his video camera.challenges this decision on two grounds.first,he contends that the regulation on its face violates the first amendment because it is overbroad and vague.second,he contends that the university application of the regulation punished him for engaging in speech and conduct protected by the first amendment.
overbreadth and vagueness 
under the substantial overbreadth doctrine,a statute or regulation may be facially invalid under the first amendment if there is a realistic danger that it will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court.bd.of airport comm rs jews for jesus,d internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,a regulation imposing lawful limits on some expressive activities may nevertheless be invalid if at the same time it reaches too much expression that is protected by the constitution.dejohn temple,cir.
a regulation may also violate the first amendment if it is unconstitutionally vague.to pass muster,a regulation must allow persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.foti city of menlo park,cir quoting grayned city of rockford,d.three rationales underlie the doctrine individuals should not be punished for behavior they could not have known was illegal vague laws allow arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and vague laws may have a chilling effect on free speech.see grayned,at foti,at.
challenges b on the ground that it is both overbroad and vague.he argues that the terms intimidation and harassment involve subjective determinations that turn on whether a particular individual finds the conduct to be intimidating or harassing.thus,he argues,conduct that is offensive but protected under the first amendment is covered by the regulation.further,amici point out that harassment is defined differently in various california laws and california state university policies.they argue that these varying definitions give administrators wide latitude to enforce the regulation arbitrarily or to use enforcement proceedings to silence disfavored speech.
we rejected similar arguments in united states osinger,cir.in osinger,we held that because the federal stalking statute,proscribes harassing and intimidating conduct,the statute is not facially invalid under the first amendment.at.we noted that harass is not an esoteric or complicated term devoid of common understanding.id.at see also united states shrader,cir harass and intimidate are not obscure words,cert.denied,d.the fact that the terms may in some cases entail interpretation is not enough to sustain an overbreadth or vagueness challenge.osinger,at.
in the challenged regulation before us,the terms harassment and intimidation do not stand on their own.section b prohibits only harassment or intimidation that threatens or endangers the health or safety of another in the university community,tit,b see college republicans reed,d.this regulation is therefore narrower and more precise than the statute that was sustained in osinger,as well as much narrower and more precise than university harassment policies that have been held overbroad by our sister circuits.see dejohn,at policy prohibited conduct which had the purpose or effect of creating an offensive environment dambrot central,cir policy defined harassment as behavior that subjected another to an intimidating,hostile,or offensive environment.further,this circuit has recognized the needs of educational institutions to protect their employees and students from potentially harmful conduct.see harper poway unified sch,cir upholding discipline of student who wore homophobic because it injure d and intimidate d others,vacated on other grounds as moot,d.we therefore conclude that b is neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor vague.rather,it permissibly authorizes california state university branches to discipline students who engage in harassment or intimidation that threatens or endangers the health or safety of another person in the university community.
protected conduct 
a regulation that is not facially overbroad or vague may nonetheless be unconstitutional as applied,in an individual case,to constitutionally protected speech.however,we conclude that the application of b to confrontation of torres and lopes on may did not violate the first amendment.we agree with the district court that has not alleged facts sufficient to show that the second floor hallway and offices of the social sciences building were public fora.see souders lucero,cir holding that the outdoor space of a university was not a public forum see also helms zubaty,cir finding that policy did not make county offices public fora.therefore,the university could regulate speech and expressive conduct as long as the regulation was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.it is clear from the text of b that it is a viewpoint neutral regulation.it is also clear that b authorization of discipline for conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of others in the university community is reasonable,as it is consistent with the university interest in preserving the property for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated,ensuring a safe context for learning and teaching.see perry,at.
assuming the allegations in the fac to be true,we also conclude that fresno state application of b to conduct was reasonable.according to the fac,on may,without an appointment,
a pproached defendant torres office door which was open.with video camera on,plaintiff asked torres if he had approved of the america white savage poem published in that la voz student newspaper.defendant torres refused to speak to plaintiff.nevertheless,plaintiff calmly insisted on speaking to torres about that poem.defendant torres reaction was to pick up his telephone and call the fresno state campus police.plaintiff then left defendant torres office plaintiff then approached the open office door of defendant lopes and asked her the same series of questions,with his video camera running.she refused to answer the questions,and when plaintiff asked again,lopes stated that she did not want to talk to him.she went to the door,closed it,and then called campus police.
the fac alleges that torres and lopes both filed complaints with the fresno state campus police stating that was threatening,was attempting to instigate a physical altercation,and that they felt threatened.we may infer from the fac that there was conflict in the testimony before the hearing officer,with torres and lopes,on the one hand,and,on the other,differently characterizing their interactions on may.after hearing the testimony,freeman,the hearing officer,prepared a report finding that had violated b and recommending discipline.sustaining the hearing officer findings,vice president oliaro concluded that torres and lopes reasonably could find behavior to be intimidating and harassing and were concerned for their safety.in so concluding,oliaro construed b as forbidding conduct that could reasonably be understood as threatening,irrespective of the subjective intent on the part of.compare elonis united states,d virginia black,d.
taking the allegations in the fac as true,we conclude that freeman and oliaro reached a permissible conclusion.professors at work in their personal offices do not generally expect to be confronted without warning by a student asking hostile questions and videotaping.if the uninvited student refuses to cease hostile questioning and refuses to leave a professor personal office after being requested to do so,as admits occurred here,the professor may reasonably become concerned for his or her safety.behavior as described in the fac could be considered harassment or intimidation and threatening under an objective reasonableness standard.it was thus permissible for fresno state to impose discipline on for this conduct under its reasonable and regulation.
iv.retaliation 
although we have determined that could lawfully be subject to discipline for his actions,that does not end our inquiry.otherwise lawful government action may nonetheless be unlawful if motivated by retaliation for having engaged in activity protected under the first amendment.for example,in skoog county of clackamas,cir,we held that a plaintiff need not establish the absence of probable cause for a police officer seizure of the plaintiff personal property to make out a first amendment retaliation claim.therefore,though was appropriately subject to discipline for his confrontation of torres and lopes,he may state a claim under if his allegations,taken as true,could plausibly show that the defendants actions in disciplining him were substantially motivated by his protected speech or expressive conduct.
there are three elements to a first amendment retaliation claim,as we explained in pinard clatskanie sch.dist,cir 
a plaintiff must show that he was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity,the defendant actions would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity and the protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendant conduct.
id.at citing mendocino envt l cntr.mendocino,cir.once a plaintiff has made such a showing,the burden shifts to the government to show that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d establishing this framework in the public employee speech context.
we note here that the case before us does not implicate the supreme court student speech doctrine as applied in the high school setting in hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,d,which requires considering first amendment rights in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as we recently explained in oyama university of,wl,at cir,we have not extended this doctrine to the university setting.while pinard arose in the context of public school student speech,the framework it uses for evaluating retaliation claims is neither drawn from nor limited to public school student speech cases,and is applicable here.
applying the pinard framework,the district court held that the fac failed to state a plausible claim for retaliation under the first amendment.we disagree.
in ruling on a motion to dismiss under rule b,we determine whether the complaint contain s sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.judged under this standard,we hold that fac plausibly supports a first amendment retaliation claim.
first,has alleged facts showing that he engaged in speech and conduct protected by the first amendment in the months leading up to his may confrontation with torres and lopes.for example,beginning in fall,posted on a website his opposition to the student government president and the school administration.he also made several public records requests to fresno state.we agree with the district court that expression of his views,as described in his complaint,qualifies as constitutionally protected activity under the first amendment.see,obsidian fin,llc cox,cir finding that the first amendment protects blog posts equally to traditional journalism for purposes of defamation suits.
second,defendants actions in disciplining would chill a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in these protected activities.pinard,at.the test is generic and objective.whether himself was,or would have been,chilled is not the test.see mendocino envt l,at.in pinard,we held that suspension from activities would lead ordinary student s in the plaintiffs position to refrain from protected speech.pinard,at.torres,lopes,dean gonzalez,and jendian each made complaints to campus police regarding.dean coon charged with violating the student conduct code and initiated disciplinary proceedings.after a hearing,vice president oliaro imposed sanctions,including disciplinary probation,that restricted access to parts of the campus and limited his involvement in student groups and student government.it is entirely plausible that a jury could find these actions reasonably likely to deter an ordinary person from engaging in protected speech and conduct.see coszalter city of salem,cir.
finally,the factual allegations in the fac are sufficient to support a reasonable inference that defendants actions were substantially motivated by protected speech prior to the may videotaping incident.we disagree with the district court conclusion that only rank speculation supported contention that the disciplinary proceedings and sanctions were retaliatory.
the fac alleges that prior to may,as a result of political activities and his criticism of university faculty and administration,dean coon requested that students and other faculty members gather information and complaints to use against him.at least one student provided complaints and other documents to coon pursuant to this request.some of the defendants,as well as other faculty members,sent emails to president welty,vice president oliaro,and dean coon,demanding that they do something about.the fac is not clear as to the timing of these requests,but one may reasonably infer that they were made prior to may.in addition,at about the same time,the director of alumni relations sent emails to other administrators,including the university communications director,requesting that they do something about and his website.on may itself,before sought to videotape torres and lopes in their offices,overheard lopes saying that was stalking the hallway,and torres saying that the faculty should post wanted signs with pictures of face on them to mock him and to serve as a warning to other students and faculty as to what he looked like and warn of his potential presence.
the fac also alleges that at the disciplinary hearing on september,was not given a full and fair opportunity to present his side of the story.the hearing officer refused to look at,or to allow to show,the videotape of his encounters with torres and lopes even though represented that the videotape would contradict torres and lopes accounts of what happened on may.dean coon made,at most,a attempt to locate detective manucharyan,who was sitting in the lobby prepared to testify,and who would have testified about the contents of the videotape.and the university refused to allow to record the proceedings,or to obtain a
