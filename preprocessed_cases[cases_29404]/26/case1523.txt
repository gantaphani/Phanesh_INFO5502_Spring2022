introduction 
the coachella valley mosquito and vector control district district appeals from a judgment denying its petition for a writ of prohibition or mandate directing the public employment relations board perb to dismiss a complaint the perb issued on behalf of the california school employees association csea and against the district for unfair practices in violation of the act mmba.we affirm.
the principal issue on this appeal is whether a or limitations period applies to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july,the effective date of senate bill reg.sess.senate bill transferred initial exclusive jurisdiction over mmba unfair practices claims from the courts to the perb,effective july,subd.b,but did not expressly address what limitations period applies to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july.
the district contends that the limitations period of section of the educational employment relations act eera applies to all mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on or after july.on this basis,the district argues that the perb is without jurisdiction to issue a complaint or take any action on unfair practices charges occurring before july,because senate bill was not intended to apply retroactively.
the csea and the perb contend that a limitations period applies,and that the perb therefore had jurisdiction to adjudicate the csea present unfair practices charges against the district.the parties agree that a period applied when mmba unfair practices charges were adjudicated in the courts.code civ,subd.a see giffin united transportation union d.giffin.the csea and the perb argue that senate bill merely changed the forum for adjudicating mmba unfair practices charges,and was not intended to change the limitations period for filing such charges.
we conclude that the limitations period of section applies to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july.this shortened limitations period is not to be retroactively applied,however.charges based on unfair practices occurring before july,are timely if filed with the perb on or before december,provided the charges were not barred by the prior limitations period on the date filed.additionally,the perb issuance of a complaint based on unfair practices occurring before july,is not a retroactive application of senate bill.
the district and the csea agree that this appeal is moot because they have settled the csea unfair practices charges,and the perb complaint against the district has been dismissed.nevertheless,the parties urge us to consider the merits of this appeal,because it presents questions of statewide import that are likely to recur.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we explain why we exercise our inherent discretion to consider the merits of this appeal.in sum,we agree that this appeal presents issues of broad public concern that are likely to recur and that tend to evade review.
the perb contends that this appeal must be dismissed,because the district failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before it filed its writ petition in the trial court.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that the district is excused from exhausting its administrative remedies with the perb,under the futility exception to the exhaustion doctrine.
the amici curiae 
by leave of court,two organizations have filed amicus curiae briefs supporting the district position on this appeal.cal.rules of court,rule c.these are the mosquito vector control of.mvcac amicus and certain california cities,special districts,and agencies cities amicus.cities amicus is comprised of the cities of anaheim,carlsbad,indian wells,monterey,redlands,san buenaventura,san luis obispo,san pablo,santa paula,and walnut creek,and the california association of sanitation agencies,the orange county vector control district,and the sunline transit agency.
requests for judicial notice 
all parties and amici curiae have requested that this court take judicial notice of various documents comprising portions of the legislative history of senate bill,the mmba,the eera,and the perb,and records of courts of this state.these requests are hereby granted.
facts and procedural history 
the mmba governs employment relations between cities,counties,and special districts,their employees,and employee organizations.the district is a public agency and special district subject to the mmba.the csea is an exclusively recognized employee organization which represents a bargaining unit of the district employees.
on june,the csea filed an unfair practices charge with the perb alleging that the district had engaged in unfair practices in violation of the mmba.the charge was withdrawn on july,refiled on july,and amended on august.the original charge alleged that the district unlawfully discriminated against several of the district union employees based on the employees protected activity.the original charge was based on events occurring as early as.the amended charge added an allegation that the district committed an unfair practice by recommending the dismissal of district employee ramon gonzalez on july.the amended charge was filed two days before the district governing board upheld gonzalez termination.
on october,the perb issued a complaint based on the csea charges,alleging that the district engaged in unfair practices in violation of the mmba.the district moved to dismiss the complaint.it argued that the perb lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate mmba unfair practices charges based on events occurring before july,and that senate bill reduced the limitations period on charges filed after july,to six months.the district also argued that the perb should defer to the parties grievance resolution process as set forth in their memorandum of understanding.the perb board agent denied the district motion to dismiss.
on december,the district appealed the board agent order denying its motion to dismiss to the full perb board,and requested that the board agent join in the appeal,pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section in a written order,the board agent refused to join the district appeal.the board agent reasoned that an immediate appeal would not materially advance the resolution of the case.
on january,before further administrative proceedings were conducted,the district filed a petition for a writ of prohibition or mandate in the trial court,asking the court to direct the perb to dismiss its complaint against the district.the perb and the csea opposed the petition.on february,the trial court entered judgment on the petition in favor of the perb.
in a statement of decision,the trial court concluded that the district was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies before challenging the perb jurisdiction in the trial court.it also ruled that the perb had jurisdiction to adjudicate alleged violations of the mmba occurring before july.it reasoned that senate bill merely changed the forum for the enforcement of existing statutory rights and responsibilities under the mmba,and that a limitations period applied to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july.
on april,the district appealed from the trial court judgment.in may,the parties settled the csea unfair practices charges,and the pending litigation was dismissed with prejudice.

c.the limitations period and retroactivity issues 
standard of review 
the issues presented turn on questions of legislative intent and statutory interpretation.these are questions of law,subject to independent review.murray oceanside unified school dist.th,d.
principles of statutory construction 
the goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.citation.ordinarily,the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.when the statutory language is ambiguous,we may examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d.
in such circumstances,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.day city of fontana cal th,d.we may consider the objects to be achieved,the legislative history,and the wider historical circumstances of the statute enactment.pacific gas electric county of stanislaus,supra,cal th at,d.we may also consider public policy and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.golden state homebuilding associates city of modesto th,d accord,people woodhead cal d.

the legislative history of the mmba,eera,dills act,and heera 
california has followed a piecemeal approach to regulating public sector labor relations.the earliest legislative enactments,adopted in the,were limited to prescribed groups of employees.zerger et,cal.public sector labor relations historical development,zerger.
in,the legislature adopted the mmba.the mmba governs employee relations between california cities,counties,and special districts,and their employees and employee organizations.when the mmba was adopted,no administrative agency was charged with its administration or enforcement.zerger,supra,at.
when the mmba was adopted,employee relations within the university of california and california state university systems were governed by the george brown act,adopted in.employee relations within school districts and community colleges were governed by the winston act,adopted in.zerger,supra,at.
in the early,california public sector labor relations laws were described as a statutory melange produc ing curious results,with amendment superimposed upon amendment without apparent attention either to careful drafting or to the development of a coherent philosophy.zerger,supra,at.nevertheless,bills designed to place all california public employers and employees under a single regulatory system were defeated in the legislature.ibid.
then,in,the legislature adopted the educational employee relations act eera.et the eera governs relations within the public school system and community colleges,and established the educational employment relations board the eerb,the precursor to the perb.the eerb was an expert,administrative agency modeled after the national labor relations board with authority to adjudicate unfair labor practices charges arising under the eera.zerger,supra,at.
in section of the eera,the legislature declared its intention that any legislation enacted by the legislature governing relations of other public employees shall be incorporated into this chapter to the extent possible.italics added.section further declares an advantageous and desirable state policy to expand the jurisdiction of the eerb to cover other public employers and their employees,in the event that this legislation is enacted the name of the eerb shall be changed to the perb.see zerger,supra,at.
in,the state relations act the dills act et.was enacted to govern labor relations between the state of california,certain state employees,and employee organizations.the dills act changed the name of the eerb to the public employment relations board or perb,subd.h,and expanded the perb jurisdiction to encompass unfair practices charges arising under the dills act.zerger,supra,at.
section of the eera describes the powers and duties of the perb.these include the power i to investigate unfair practice charges or alleged violations of this chapter,and take any action and make any determinations in respect of these charges or alleged violations as the board deems necessary to effectuate the policies of this chapter.section of the eera provides that the perb shall not issue a complaint based on an alleged unfair practice occurring more than six months before the filing of the charge,subd.a.
section,subdivision h of the dills act provides that t he powers and duties of the perb described in section of the eera shall also apply,as appropriate,to this chapter.section of the dills act provides that the perb shall not issue a complaint based on any unfair practices charges occurring more than six months before the filing of a charge,subd.b.thus,section of the dills act is substantially similar to section of the eera.
the higher education relations act heera et was adopted in,and the perb jurisdiction was then expanded to encompass unfair practices charges arising under the heera.the heera governs labor relations within the university of california,hastings college of law,and the california state university.zerger,supra,at.
section of the heera describes the rights,powers,duties and responsibilities of the perb in administering the heera,and is substantially similar to section of the eera.unlike the dills act,the heera does not incorporate the powers and duties of the perb described in section,subd.h.but section of the heera,like section of the dills act and section of the eera,prescribes a limitations period on unfair practices complaints issued by the perb.
the mmba,eera,dills act,and heera are designed to address the specific needs and problems of the public employment sectors they cover.pacific legal foundation brown cal d.as discussed above,the statutes were enacted at different times and regulate different public employment sectors.they were written by different legislators,responding to the pressures of differing constituencies.zerger,supra,overview of statutes.
but the basic purpose of the mmba,eera,dills act,and heera is the same.it is to promote improved labor relations by providing a uniform basis for recognizing the right of employees of various public agencies to join organizations of their own choice and to be represented by those organizations in employment relationships.zerger,supra,employee rights,see mmba,dills act,eera,and,subd.e heera.
the mmba does not enumerate specific unfair practices similar to those listed in the eera,dills act,or heera.see,eera,dills act.however,perb regulations provide that the same unfair practices listed in the eera,dills act,and heera are similarly prohibited under the mmba,tit.
senate bill 
on september,the legislature enacted senate bill which amended various provisions of the mmba.section of the mmba was amended to provide,in part,that a it is the purpose of this chapter to promote full communication between public employers and their employees by providing a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment between public employers and public employee organizations.italics added.
senate bill introduced the term board to the mmba,and defined it as the public employment relations board established pursuant to section,subd.f.section was amended to read,in pertinent part,that a the powers and duties of the board described in section of the eera shall also apply,as appropriate,to this chapter b a complaint alleging any violation of this chapter or of any rules and regulations adopted by a public agency pursuant to section shall be processed as an unfair practice charge by the board.the initial determination as to whether the charge of unfair practice is justified and,if so,the appropriate remedy necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,shall be a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.the board shall apply and interpret unfair labor practices consistent with existing judicial interpretations of this chapter.the section amendments became effective on july,subd.g.
the limitations period of section applies to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july,
the district contends that the limitations period of section of the eera is effectively incorporated into section of the mmba.it argues that section is a necessary continuation of section,and a limitation on the powers and duties of the perb set forth in section.it relies on the language of the statutes,and on the legislative history of the mmba,eera,dills act,heera,and senate bill.
cities amicus argues it was not necessary for the legislature to expressly incorporate section into the mmba,because this limitation on the perb jurisdiction to issue unfair practices complaints was in place for years before senate bill expanded the perb jurisdiction to encompass mmba unfair practices charges.in other words,the perb jurisdiction to issue mmba unfair practices complaints is no greater under the mmba than it ever has been or was when senate bill was enacted.cities amicus also notes that the language of sections and is not limited to public school employers and employers subject to the eera,but encompass all public employment sectors.
the csea and the perb argue that the limitations period of code of civil procedure section applies,because mmba unfair practices charges are statutory liabilities.they note that section expressly incorporates section,but not section.they also rely on giffin,supra,d at page,and the third sentence of section,subdivision b,which directs the perb to apply and interpret unfair labor practices consistent with existing judicial interpretations of the mmba.italics added.
we agree with the district and cities amicus that the limitations period of section applies to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july.our conclusion is based on the plain language of the statutes,and the legislative history,wider historical circumstances,and public policies reflected in senate bill,the mmba,eera,dills act,and heera.
as noted above,section was initially enacted in as part of the mmba.senate bill,subdivision f was added,to state board means the public employment relations board established pursuant to section.section is part of the eera.as part of the same senate bill,section,subdivision a was enacted.it provides that t he powers and duties of the perb described in section shall also apply,as appropriate,to this chapter section describes what powers and duties the perb has in administering and enforcing the eera.these include the power and duty t o investigate unfair practice charges or alleged violations and take any action and make any determinations in respect of these charges or alleged violations,subd.i,italics added.without question,the power to investigate,take action,and make determinations regarding unfair practices charges is appropriately incorporated into the mmba.
section,subdivision b provides that a complaint alleging any violation of this chapter shall be processed as an unfair practice charge by the board.the power to process an unfair practices charge necessarily includes the power to investigate,take action,and make determinations regarding the charge.section describes how the perb powers and duties shall and shall not be exercised.it sets forth the process by which an unfair practice is to be investigated,heard,and decided by the perb.section states,the initial determination as to whether the charges of unfair practices are justified,and,if so,what remedy is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,shall be a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.procedures for investigating,hearing,and deciding these cases shall be devised and promulgated by the board and shall include all of the following a any employee,employee organization,or employer shall have the right to file an unfair practice charge,except that the board shall not do the following issue a complaint in respect of any charge based upon an alleged unfair practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge.italics added.
section expressly limits the perb power to issue unfair practices complaints to those based on unfair practices occurring within six months of the filing of a charge,subd.a.and,as cities amicus notes,the perb powers and duties have always been subject to section limitations period,and remained so limited when the perb jurisdiction was expanded to encompass mmba unfair practices charges through senate bill.
additionally,section authorizes the perb to promulgate procedures for investigating,hearing,and deciding unfair practices charges.these shall include procedures for filing unfair practices charges with the perb.no procedures for filing or processing unfair practices charges are listed in section nor anywhere else in the mmba.the perb power and duty to investigate,hear,and determine mmba unfair practices charges would be meaningless if the perb did not have authority to promulgate procedures for filing and processing the charges.
accordingly,we conclude that the limitations period of section applies to mmba unfair practices charges filed with the perb on and after july,the effective date of section,subd.g.
our conclusion promotes rather than defeats the common purposes of the mmba,eera,dills act,and heera.without question,the statutes are in pari materia,and should be interpreted consistently with each other to the extent possible.the perb has always enjoyed substantially the same powers,duties,and authority to promulgate procedures in enforcing unfair practices charges under the eera,dills act,and heera,subd.h.and,the perb jurisdiction to issue unfair practices complaints under each of these statutes has always been subject to a limitations period.
these common features reflect the legislature long standing policy of promptly resolving public employment labor disputes by limiting the perb jurisdiction to issue unfair practices complaints to a limitations period.nothing in senate bill indicates that the legislature intended to abandon this policy when it expanded the perb jurisdiction to encompass mmba unfair practices charges.
indeed,since,the legislature stated intention has been to incorporate into the eera,to the extent possible,legislation concerning public employment labor relations.senate bill indicates that the legislature intended to model the mmba on the eera,in the same manner as the dills act and heera were modeled on the eera.
the legislative history of senate bill also shows that the legislature intended that the perb would administer and enforce the mmba in the same manner as the eera,dills act,and heera.we have taken judicial notice of m aterial from the legislative bill file of the office of senate floor analyses on senate bill no.these materials state that senate bill no.transfers jurisdiction for enforcement of the mmba and resolution of unfair labor practice allegations to the perb.under current law,an aggrieved party must file a writ of mandate with the superior court for resolution of a dispute.perb would become the enforcing administrative agency for local government labor relations in the same manner as ex
