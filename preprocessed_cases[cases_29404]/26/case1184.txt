background 
taking the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,these events are the facts as they occurred.plaintiff worked in the office of financial aid and veterans affairs ofa at fort valley state university fvsu between and.in spring quarter,while working as a work study supervisor and veterans affairs counselor,plaintiff began to observe and document what she believed were fraudulent practices in the federal work study program.plaintiff took notes and made copies of suspicious documents,which she stored in a box at home.in january,the ofa was reorganized and plaintiff position changed to financial aid counselor.as part of plaintiff employment duties,she was required to verify the completion and accuracy of student files as well as report any perceived fraudulent activity.some student files previously handled by plaintiff supervisor,ofa director jeanette huff huff,were transferred to plaintiff.in examining these files,plaintiff discovered improprieties pointing to what she believed was huff fraudulent mishandling and mismanagement of federal financial aid funds.
plaintiff first confronted huff about these improprieties in,but huff was dismissive and made no corrections.in late,overwhelmed by the evidence of fraud,plaintiff met with fvsu president oscar prater prater and told him that huff was falsifying information,awarding financial aid to ineligible recipients,making excessive awards,and forging documents.prater said nothing in response to plaintiff accusations and took no remedial steps.plaintiff confronted huff on other occasions with folders plaintiff believed contained improprieties,but huff made no corrections.
in march,plaintiff received a rating of exceeds expectations the second highest available her annual performance evaluation.the evaluation,however,also contained criticisms of plaintiff performance all of plaintiff prior evaluations had rated her performance as exceeds requirements or outstanding.despite the high score,plaintiff was not pleased with her evaluation 
plaintiff arranged a meeting with huff direct supervisor,fvsu of student affairs cynthia sellers sellers,during which plaintiff complained that her performance review was unfairly low.sellers advised plaintiff that,based on the score,plaintiff evaluation was not bad and that she would likely receive a raise.during the same meeting,plaintiff told sellers that huff was doing stuff that was going to get our institution in trouble and awarding students aid for which they were ineligible.plaintiff warned sellers that she was going to tell unless changes were made.sellers responded,do what you have to do.plaintiff then scheduled a second meeting with president prater to discuss her performance evaluation and to reiterate the improprieties of which she had already informed him in prior years.during the meetings with prater and sellers,plaintiff did not identify specific student files that had been mishandled or provide documentary plaintiff began collecting in support her allegations of fraud.
on may,plaintiff received a letter indicating the contract for her position as financial aid counselor would not be renewed effective june.the letter indicated plaintiff had been approved for transfer to a position in a different fvsu department,but plaintiff was later informed that no position was available.plaintiff appealed the of her contract through fvsu and the board of regents of the university system of georgia,alleging her contract was not renewed because of her attempts to expose huff fraud.a grievance committee investigated,conducted an evidentiary hearing,and upheld the decision not to renew.
plaintiff never spoke to anyone outside of fvsu about huff fraudulent activity until after she received notice that her contract would not be renewed.a month after receiving notice,plaintiff met with the department of education doe and provided pages of documents showing potential fraud and a page analysis of student files.
from june to february,the georgia department of audits conducted an independent annual audit of fvsu that revealed serious noncompliance with federal regulations and risk factors for fraud.the auditors formed no opinion on whether the noncompliance was intentional.subsequent audits also revealed similar problems.huff transferred out of the ofa in july and resigned in may.in april,fvsu reached a settlement with the doe to settle questioned costs identified by the state auditors in audits from and in lieu of further file review.
in june,plaintiff filed suit in the district court,alleging she was discharged in violation of the first amendment for reporting her concerns about fraud,and huff,sellers,and prater knowingly submitted false or fraudulent claims to the united states in violation of the false claims act fca,et the district court concluded that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff first amendment claim because the motivation for plaintiff speech was unclear and preexisting case law did not give defendants fair warning that plaintiff speech must be treated as a matter of public concern under the circumstances.the district court also concluded that plaintiff fca claims were barred by e a because they relied on publicly disclosed information for which plaintiff was not an original source.the district court granted summary judgment on both claims.plaintiff originally appealed the grant of summary judgment against huff,prater,and sellers but later dismissed the appeal of claims against sellers.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.cofield goldkist,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,and affidavits submitted by the parties show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
first amendment retaliation claim 
for a public employee to sustain a claim of retaliation for protected speech under the first amendment,the employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence these things 
the employee speech is on a matter of public concern the employee first amendment interest in engaging in the speech outweighs the employer interest in prohibiting the speech to promote the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees and the employee speech played a substantial part in the employer decision to demote or discharge the employee.once the employee succeeds in showing the preceding factors,the burden then shifts to the employer to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.
