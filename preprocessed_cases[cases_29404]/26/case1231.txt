riders to appropriations acts the congress enacts for the district of columbia district limit the amount of attorney fees a party may collect from the district after prevailing in a suit under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.the appellees brought suit against the district under to enforce the idea guarantee of a free appropriate public education.in three separate orders,the district court awarded them attorney fees above the limits the rider imposed.the district appeals all three orders.because the district court did not properly certify as final two of the orders,we lack jurisdiction over those two.regarding the third order,we agree with the district argument that an action brought pursuant to to enforce idea rights is a suit under the idea and thus subject to the rider.accordingly,we reverse the district court as to that order and remand.
in response to the growth in legal expenses and litigation associated with special education in the district of columbia and the usurping of resources from education to pay attorney fees,at,the congress attached a rider,section,to the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of,limiting the amount of fees the district could pay to prevailing parties in idea cases,see omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act,stat.section.specifically,section prohibited any funds appropriated in the appropriations act from being used by the district to pay fees to any attorney prevailing against the dcps in an action under the idea above the amount specified therein id.the congress attached virtually identical riders to subsequent appropriations acts for,and see transportation,treasury,housing and urban development,the judiciary,the district of columbia,and independent agencies appropriations act,stat,district of columbia appropriations act,stat,consolidated appropriations act,stat,consolidated appropriations resolution,stat,district of columbia appropriations act,stat,consolidated appropriations resolution,stat,
in calloway district of columbia,we first interpreted the section language in that case,the district argued that section prohibited the court from awarding fees above the cap.id.at.we rejected the argument,finding that the rider only prohibited the district from paying attorney fees greater than the prescribed amount but had no effect on the district court authority to award higher fees.under our calloway holding,if the congress should someday lift the fees cap provision,a prevailing party could then seek the unpaid fees above the cap nunc pro tunc.id.at.following calloway,the congress changed the statutory language in the district of columbia appropriations act,section a of which provides 
notwithstanding,or any other law,none of the funds appropriated under this act,or in appropriations acts for subsequent fiscal years,may be made available to pay attorneys fees accrued prior to the effective date of this act that exceeds sic a cap imposed on attorneys fees by prior appropriations acts that were in effect during the fiscal year when the work was performed,or when payment was requested for work previously performed,in an action or proceeding brought against the district of columbia public schools under the individuals with disabilities education act et.
district of columbia appropriations act,a,stat,section a.
the appellees instituted four separate section actions against the district,blackman district of columbia,chavez district of columbia,watkins vance,and rice vance,which the district court consolidated with other pending section class actions the district court consolidated two of the actions,which were class actions,blackman district of columbia,and jones district of columbia,to form one class with two subclasses,only one of which,the jones subclass,is applicable here 
a ll children,now and in the future,who are entitled to have dcps provide them with a free appropriate public education fape and who have been denied same because dcps either a has failed to fully and timely implement the determinations of hearing officers,or b failed to fully and timely implement agreements concerning a child identification,evaluation,educational placement,or provision of fape that dcps has negotiated with the child parent or educational advocate.
blackman district of columbia,d,second alteration in original.the court consolidated chavez with blackman and jones on march,see chavez district of columbia,march,watkins on february,see watkins vance,and rice on february,see rice vance,all appellees are members of the jones subclass.
on june,the district court granted partial summary judgment to the appellees on the liability issue.the court nonetheless declined to grant preliminary injunctive relief,believing that where irreparable injury was threatened absent some action by the district,the district would not ignore its obligation to take such action to remedy violations even absent resolution of the claims of the class as a whole.blackman district of columbia,internal quotation marks omitted.by,however,the district court was dissatisfied with the district lack of response and therefore appointed a special master to assist it in handling individual preliminary injunction motions.
the appellees then moved for attorney fees under section b.section b provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee in a section action.b.before moving for attorney fees,the chavez and watkins appellees had sought and obtained preliminary injunctive relief.the district court awarded fees to the chavez and watkins appellees based on the relief they obtained.see chavez district of columbia,march.the blackman appellees,by contrast,did not obtain preliminary injunctive relief but instead had earlier reached private agreements with the dcps,which the dcps then failed to honor.after the district court appointed the special master,the blackman appellees sought a preliminary injunction to require the dcps to comply with the respective agreements.before the special master acted,the blackman appellees reached new agreements with the dcps,whereby the latter agreed to implement the original agreements.the special master therefore recommended to the court that their motions for preliminary injunctions be denied and the district court agreed.see blackman,d at.the blackman appellees then sought attorney fees under b.the district argued that the blackman appellees were not prevailing parties within the meaning of section b because they had neither obtained a favorable ruling at the administrative level nor obtained injunctive relief from the district court,citing the supreme court decision in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d.the district court disagreed,concluding that the blackman appellees sought and achieved a remedy for defendants ongoing violations of the idea.such an effort to secure a remedy through procedures must intertwined with the court conclusion that the violation existed in the first instance.blackman,d at.
the district argued in all four actions chavez,watkins,rice and blackman that section or section a capped the attorney fees the district could pay them but the district court rejected its argument.with regard to section,the court held that the language under the idea did not apply to the appellees suits which were brought under section,not the idea.the district court similarly interpreted section a,finding that b y its plain meaning,the restrictions of section a apply only to cases brought under the idea itself.to interpret this provision to preclude awards in connection with substantive section claims would render the language in the final portion of the sentence incomplete because there is no reference to actions brought under section.watkins,d at see blackman,d at chavez,d at.the court also rejected the district argument that the court interpretation would render section a opening proviso notwithstanding,or any other law emphasis added superfluous.see blackman,d at chavez,d at watkins,d at.the court gave two reasons for its construction.first,the provision still prevents parties from using other statutes,including section,to collect the idea attorneys fees awarded for counsel efforts by courts under calloway but that remain unpaid because of the statutory cap.watkins,d at.and second,it prevents plaintiffs from filing a separate section action seeking payment for such past attorneys fees awarded under the idea in the event the statutory cap is ever dissolved.id.
the district appeals all three orders,arguing that section and section a limit the amount of attorney fees the appellees can recover because a section action to enforce the fape right provided by the idea amounts to an action under the idea.it appeals the blackman order on the additional ground that the blackman appellees are not prevailing parties.
in this consolidated appeal,the district raises three merits issues whether section limits the attorney fees the district may pay to all appellees whether section a limits the attorney fees the district may pay to all of the appellees and whether the blackman appellees are prevailing part ies within the meaning of b.our review of these issues of statutory construction is de novo.see,calloway,at citing united states.
although neither side contests our jurisdiction,it is well established that a court of appeals must first satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction,sua sponte if necessary,before proceeding to the merits.citizens for abatement of aircraft noise,metro.airports,aff,d.our jurisdiction,if it exists,arises under,which generally extends only to final district court orders,outlaw airtech air conditioning heating,citing dsmc convera,emphasis added that is,orders that dispose of an entire case both as to parties and issues.see haynesworth miller.nevertheless,if the case involves more than one claim for relief or multiple parties,the district court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties the court may do so,however,only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.b.
all three,watkins,and nonfinal because they do not dispose of all of the claims of all of the parties in the consolidated class action our jurisdiction,accordingly,turns on whether the district court properly certified these orders for appeal under federal rule of civil procedure b.we review each order to assure that the district court made an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for the entry of judgment.id.emphasis added.the blackman order states only minute order granting defendants renewed motion for expedited certification of order under federal rule b.blackman,slip op.at.the watkins order provides that this order constitutes a final appealable order.watkins,d at.we believe that both the blackman and watkins orders are facially deficient.
in building industry association of superior california babbitt,we held that the express direction and determination is a requirement that prohibits us from imply ing a rule b determination.the mandate of rule b is plain and without exception.everett airways group,a bsent an express direction for entry of judgment,an order that disposes of less than all the matter with what firmness and apparent not appealable internal quotations omitted.while the blackman and watkins orders can be construed to contain an express direction,see blackman,at,order granting defendants renewed motion under federal rule b watkins,d at t his order constitutes a final appealable order,neither contains an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and under our precedent we can not imply one.see.indus.ass of super,at see also granack continental cas,cir order described as final appealable judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b insufficient auriemma city of chicago,cir order purporting to be final and appealable insufficient.
despite the clarity of rule b and our precedent,at oral argument the parties argued that so long as it is apparent or discernible from the record that there is no just reason for delay,the building industry holding does not require that the order contain an express determination.not so.we held in building industry that the district court need not express its reasoning behind an express declaration so long as the reasoning is apparent or discernible from the record.indus.ass of superior,at where the district court reasoning is apparent to us,or discernible from other parts of the record,we would perhaps find literal compliance with the rule quite sufficient.emphasis added.on the other hand,even if the record indicates no just reason for delay,an order is not final under rule b unless it contains the express determination thereof.see granack,at a court intention to enter an express determination is irrelevant absent an express determination.internal quotation omitted.neither the blackman order nor the watkins order meets rule b requirement and we are therefore without jurisdiction to review them.
in contrast,the chavez order provides in part order finally deciding the attorney fees claims by these plaintiffs and there being no just reason for delaying an appeal,it is ordered,that the order constitutes a final,appealable judgment under.b.chavez district of columbia,emphasis added.it therefore contains the requisite express direction and express determination.moreover,we can discern the court rationale for its express determination from the record.see mem.in supp.of defs.mot.for expedited certification of order under federal rule b see also chavez.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over the chavez appeal.
the sole merits issue before us,then,is whether section a limits the amount of attorney fees the district can pay to the chavez appellees this issue is one of statutory construction and,as noted,our review is de novo.we start with the plain meaning of the text,looking to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.united states barnes,quoting robinson shell oil,d.if the language has a plain and unambiguous meaning,our inquiry ends so long as the resulting statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.id.quoting united states wilson,quoting robinson,at.internal quotations omitted.we agree with the district that the plain meaning of the phrase an action or proceeding under the idea,in the context of section a as a whole,includes not only an action alleging the idea as its statutory basis but also a section action brought to enforce the fape right granted by the idea.
as the supreme court has noted,the word under has many dictionary definitions and we draw its meaning from the context of the statute before us.ardestani ins,d.both the high court and this court have interpreted a provision analogous to the one before us.in ardestani,the court interpreted the attorney fees provision of the equal access to justice act eaja.the eaja requires a court to award fees to a party prevailing in an adjudication under section of the apa.see a,b c i.the court decided that the most natural reading of the eaja applicability to adjudications under section is that those proceedings must be subject to or governed by.ardestani,at.the court also approvingly cited this court decision interpreting the same phrase.id.our decision in louis fuel supply ferc,held that the term under,as used in the eaja attorney fees provision,means subject or pursuant to or by reason of the authority of.id.at alteration in original see also hosp.ass district of columbia,under is defined as required by,in accordance with,or bound by.quoting webster third new international dictionary alteration in original.
the appellees maintain that the district court correctly determined that section a applicability to actions under the idea means that attorney fees are subject to the cap only if the idea is the explicit statutory basis of the plaintiff cause of action.appellees br.even with the addition of the notwithstanding clause to section,section does not cap the plaintiffs attorneys fees any more than section caps those fees both sections cap
