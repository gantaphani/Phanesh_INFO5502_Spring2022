trista stanley appeals from a judgment on the pleadings based upon statute of limitations and state sovereign immunity grounds.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,and we affirm.
stanley was intermittently a student at california state university,sacramento university from to.stanley alleges that richard savino,her classical guitar professor and faculty advisor,sexually harassed her beginning in and that the harassment caused her to withdraw her enrollment at the end of the spring semester in.stanley returned for the fall semester in and alleges that she was again subjected to sexual harassment.stanley reported the harassment to various university offices and again withdrew her enrollment after they did not respond to her complaints.she returned to the university a final time in the spring of.she alleges she was again forced to withdraw after learning that other students and faculty knew about her experience with savino,which created an uncomfortable environment.the last alleged incident of sexual harassment occurred in may.
in september,stanley submitted a formal complaint of sexual harassment to the university.the alleged sexual harassment consisted of unwanted advances,physical contact,and comments.the university conducted an investigation and on january,peter lau,director of the equal action office,sent stanley a letter stating after receiving the investigation report i have concluded that professor savino violated university policy.the university will take appropriate action.stanley is not aware of any disciplinary action taken as a result of the letter.
on april,stanley filed a claim with the california state board of control seeking compensation for savino sexual harassment and for the university failure to act on her complaints.stanley did not receive a response.
stanley filed her original action in federal court on may.the complaint set forth seven claims a title ix claim,a claim,and five state law claims.stanley has asserted both quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment claims.the only remaining defendants are the trustees of the california state university trustees.the district court held that all claims but the title ix claim were barred by state sovereign immunity and the title ix claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
we turn first to what the district court referred to as the trustee eleventh amendment immunity.courts have often referred to the states immunity from suit as eleventh amendment immunity.the phrase is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer,for the sovereign immunity of the states neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the eleventh amendment.alden maine,d.
we review judgment on the pleadings de novo.owens kaiser found.health plan,cir.judgment on the pleadings is proper when,taking all allegations in the pleading as true,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.we review a district court rulings on state sovereign immunity de novo.see carey.gaming control,cir.
we have previously held that the trustees are an arm of the state that can properly lay claim to sovereign immunity.see jackson hayakawa,cir.in an action for incurred monetary damages,state sovereign immunity can be overcome only by explicit abrogation by congress pursuant to its powers under the fourteenth amendment or by state consent to suit.see in re harleston,cir.congress may abrogate the states constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.kimel.bd.of regents,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.similarly,a state consent must be unequivocally expressed.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d citations omitted see also coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d the test for determining whether a state has waived its immunity from jurisdiction is a stringent one.a state does not consent to suit in federal court merely by consenting to suit in the courts of its own creation.nor does it consent to suit in federal court merely by stating its intention to sue and be sued,or even by authorizing suits against it in any court of competent jurisdiction college sav.bank,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the supreme court has previously held that congress has properly abrogated state sovereign immunity for title ix claims.see franklin gwinnett county pub,d.thus,this claim is not barred on this basis.
stanley has not argued on appeal,however,that the district court erred in dismissing her section action based on state sovereign immunity.this argument is therefore waived.see greenwood faa,cir.
stanley argues that her state law claims are not barred because congress has abrogated state sovereign immunity by authorizing supplemental jurisdiction.the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is governed by,which is silent as to sovereign immunity.the statute is a far cry from the unmistakably clear language required for abrogation.additionally,there is no indication that congress intended to exercise its powers under section of the fourteenth amendment by enacting section the statute only addresses the jurisdiction of federal courts,which congress regulates through its article i powers.thus,we hold that does not abrogate state sovereign immunity for supplemental state law claims.
stanley also appears to argue that california has consented to suit by passing the unruh civil rights act act,cal,which is the basis for many of her state law claims.the act does not specifically consent to federal court actions.even assuming the trustees fall within the statute all business establishments language,see cal,the supreme court has held that the any court of competent jurisdiction language,see cal,is not sufficient to constitute consent to sue in federal court.see coll.sav.bank,at.
thus,stanley has not met the stringent test for establishing state consent to suit.see id.at.see also pennhurst,at.i t is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.such a result conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the eleventh amendment.state sovereign immunity bars all of stanley state law claims.
the district court held that stanley title ix claim is subject to california personal injury statute of limitations.we review a district court determination of the applicable statute of limitations de novo.taylor regents of of,cir.
title ix does not expressly provide any statute of limitations.because a title ix suit is a civil rights action,we borrow the most appropriate state statute of limitations.cholla ready mix,civish,cir,cert.denied sub,cholla ready mix,mendez,d,citing wilson garcia,d.for other civil rights actions,we have borrowed the state statute of limitations for personal injury.see taylor,at stating that the statute of limitations for personal injury actions governs claims brought pursuant to,and and holding the same applies to actions under title vi of the civil rights act of title vi.should we apply the same ruling for title ix claims it appears that every circuit to consider the issue has held that title ix also borrows the relevant state statute of limitations for personal injury.see curto edmundson,cir,cert.denied,d bougher of pittsburgh,cir lillard shelby county bd.of,cir egerdahl hibbing cmty,cir westminster,cir.the rationale of our sister circuits is compelling,and we adopt it.
the close similarity between title vi and title ix also supports applying the statute of limitations for personal injury.the supreme court has repeatedly held that title ix is based on title vi and has used similar modes of analysis to resolve title ix cases.see,grove city coll.bell,d the drafters of title vi approved identical language,and we discern no reason to believe that the congressmen who voted for title ix intended a different result cannon of chicago,d concluding private right of action exists under title ix after pointing out it was explicitly patterned after title vi.we have also observed the similarity between title vi and title ix.see,jeldness pearce,cir b
