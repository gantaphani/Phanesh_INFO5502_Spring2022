the missouri department of elementary and secondary education dese and the missouri school for the blind msb appeal the district court order affirming an administrative panel decision requiring them to provide,participate in,and pay for the education of katherine,a deaf and blind child,at a specialized private school.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the facts of this case describe a parental parents watched as the scholastic needs of their child were processed through the grinding machinery of state and local education bureaucracies.katherine resides within the springfield school district the district.the district began providing educational services within the school district to katherine when she entered kindergarten for the school year the district attempted to provide an appropriate educational program for katherine,including hiring numerous outside consultants and providing training programs for district staff.despite those efforts,katherine behavior deteriorated significantly during the school year,and in february,katherine parents,the lewises,removed katherine from public school.the lewises advised the district that they intended to place katherine in an residential setting at perkins school for the blind in watertown,massachusetts perkins the district agreed with the lewises that a residential placement was needed,but believed that msb could provide an appropriate residential program for katherine due to its proximity to the lewises home and its lower cost.
in march,the district referred katherine for admission to msb.some three months later,on july,msb notified the district that it would not accept katherine.the school claimed it did not have an appropriate program of services for katherine,even though it previously advertised that it continued to program for students.rather than accept katherine,msb recommended that the district consider placing katherine at the missouri school for the deaf.
in august,john heskett,then the assistant commissioner of education,division of special education within dese,told the district that the rejection letter from msb was curious,and he was having difficulty understanding why katherine would not be eligible for services to missouri school for the blind.he assured the district that msb could provide an appropriate program for katherine,and that katherine would be accepted at msb.on september,yvonne howze,msb superintendent,wrote a letter to dese administrators and the district describing the type of program that would need to be created to serve katherine at msb.the district and dese interpreted this as an acceptance letter for katherine to attend school there.however,howze later denied that it was a letter of acceptance.according to howze,the letter merely described parameters for a potential program.while the state and local education officials debated their relative capabilities and responsibilities,the lewises placed katherine at perkins for the school year.
on october,the lewises filed a request with dese pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act,et.idea.the lewises claimed that the district could not provide katherine with a free appropriate education and that perkins was the appropriate placement for her.the district settled the claim with the lewises by agreeing that it would reimburse lewises for the cost of katherine placement at perkins for the and school years.in settling,the district relied upon assurances from heskett,on behalf of dese,that dese would reimburse all of the district eligible expenses for katherine placement at perkins.the district then planned to seek reimbursement from a state fund called the extraordinary cost fund the district subsequently filed an extraordinary cost fund application with dese for the school year 
on april,representatives from the district and dese again discussed katherine placement options.pursuant to dese request,the district sent katherine individualized education program to dese for review.on may,representatives from the district and dese again met to discuss katherine placement.the district expressed its concerns about the cost of the program at perkins and indicated that the current level of state support was insufficient.dese took the position that msb would have no way to defend refusing a referral if one were made at that time.despite these assurances,msb again found katherine ineligible for placement after reviewing her individualized education program and determined that perkins was the appropriate placement.
in a telephone conversation with district representatives on june,stephen barr,the succeeding assistant commissioner of education,division of special education for dese,reversed msb refusal of admission.he assured the district that msb was an appropriate placement option for katherine and that she was eligible to attend the school for the school year.barr stated that msb would be katherine educational placement because he determined that a the lewises and the district could not reach a reasonable agreement to educate katherine in the district b msb formerly had a program for children c if dese had to spend a million dollars over five years to educate katherine,it should spend those funds to build capacity in the state and d legislators would be upset at spending for an program each year.
later that day,during the scheduled individualized education program meeting between the lewises and the district,the district recommended a change in placement to msb for the school year,relying on dese assurances that the necessary resources would be provided to develop an appropriate program for katherine in the state of missouri.however,the lewises continued to recommend perkins as the appropriate placement.disregarding the lewises recommendation,the district provided the lewises with a notice of action form that proposed changing katherine placement from perkins to msb.on june,the lewises filed an idea request that initiated the current proceeding.
after a hearing,a panel determined the following pertinent matters msb could not provide a free appropriate public education to katherine,and perkins was the appropriate placement for her katherine is a severely handicapped child as defined under.dese must provide services for all students who are not being provided such services by a local school district,either at a school or in private placement,pursuant to.pursuant to,the financial responsibility of a local school district for educating a severely handicapped child is limited to the amount of its local tax effort dese is responsible for the cost and expenses of katherine placement at perkins for school years and,minus the district local tax effort dese and msb violated a by failing to provide at the june,individualized education program meeting a representative who was knowledgeable about msb curriculum and financial resources.
the district court affirmed the panel decision in all respects relevant to this appeal.the district court also awarded the lewises their fees and expenses,copying costs,and exhibit costs to be paid by dese.this appeal involves interpretation of the idea,the planning and pecuniary feud between state and local educational entities under missouri law,and responsibility under federal law.
ii.analysis 
dese and msb raise three issues on appeal.first,they argue that the idea requires neither of them to have a representative attend a student individualized education program meeting,to review and revise that student individualized education program,or to select the student least restrictive environment,when those agencies may only potentially be a direct provider of educational services to the student.second,they argue that missouri education statutes require both the state and local school districts to educate,and pay for the education of,severely handicapped students.finally,dese and msb contend that the lewises expert witness fees and expenses associated with the hearing can not be recovered as costs.
we review de novo the district court decision.indep.sch.dist,cir.however,this does not mean that we start with a clean slate.rather,we must give due weight to the outcome of administrative pr
