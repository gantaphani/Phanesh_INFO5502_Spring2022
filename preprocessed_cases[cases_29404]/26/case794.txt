the little rock school district lrsd appeals from the district court denial of its request for unitary status.we affirm.

by,it had become apparent to the parties and the district court that lrsd would be unable to meet the terms of the settlement.at the suggestion of the district court,lrsd and lorene joshua joshua,the class representative for all students enrolled in lrsd and the two neighboring districts,entered into negotiations to modify lrsd obligations.the fruit of these negotiations was the revised desegregation and education plan revised plan,which the district court approved in.it was agreed that if lrsd substantially complied with the terms of the revised plan,it would be declared unitary at the conclusion of the school year.the revised plan required joshua to submit any unresolved compliance issues to the odm for facilitation of an agreement.revised plan.if the odm could not resolve the issue after good faith attempts at facilitation,joshua could seek resolution of the issue with the district court.id.

compliance plan,at footnote omitted.the district court imposed a compliance remedy remedy designed to bring lrsd into substantial compliance with section.id.at.on appeal by joshua from the district court ruling,we affirmed.little rock sch.dist.armstrong,cir.
on march,following what it believed was its substantial compliance with section and the remedy,lrsd asked to be declared unitary.joshua opposed the request.on june,the district court concluded that lrsd had not substantially complied with its obligations,denied unitary status,and imposed a new compliance remedy remedy.it is from this judgment that lrsd now appeals.
although this case traces its roots to federal desegregation efforts,the instant appeal presents no constitutional issues.the constitutional requirements for unitary status are set forth in green county school board,d,which held that a school district may be declared unitary and lacking racial discrimination based on satisfactory performance in five areas of a school district operations student assignment faculty and staff assignment transportation extracurricular activities and facilities.lrsd has met these requirements.see d at declaring lrsd partially unitary with regard to all aspects of its operations,because it has substantially complied with all sections of the revised plan,save for those obligations contained in.as the district court noted in,the revised plan included other desegregation obligations that went beyond green constitutional floor for a school district to become unitary.id.at.
section of the revised plan refers to section,which required lrsd to implement programs,policies procedures designed to improve and remediate the academic achievement of students,including but not limited to section of this revised plan.the impetus for section is colloquially referred to as the achievement gap between minority students and white students in the public school systems.for section to meet the constitutional threshold of a desegregation remedy,the achievement gap that it was designed to remedy would have to directly address and relate to the constitutional violation itself.missouri jenkins,d see also bd.of educ.dowell,d the legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the constitution by the local authorities.as the district court observed in 
n o court has ever determined generally,or with the specificity required in jenkins,what portion,if any,of the minority student achievement gap in lrsd is causally linked as a vestige of de jure segregation.furthermore,joshua has failed to introduce any evidence to establish that the achievement gap is causally linked to the system of de jure segregation which existed in lrsd decades earlier and the portion of the achievement gap which is attributable to de jure segregation,after excluding all of the socioeconomic factors that also have contributed to that gap.
d at.people who care rockford bd.of,cir i t is obvious that other factors besides discrimination contribute to unequal educational attainment,such as poverty,parents education and employment,family size,parental attitudes and behavior,prenatal,neonatal,and child health care,pressures,and ethnic culture.accordingly,it is unclear whether lrsd efforts to remedy the achievement gap are constitutionally compelled.we need not determine that issue,however,because lrsd obligations under section are clearly contractual matters.thus,we examine lrsd compliance under ordinary rules of contract interpretation.
lrsd obligations under section therefore arise as a matter of contract,not constitutional law,and thus we examine lrsd compliance under ordinary rules of contract interpretation.united states knote,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,little rock sch.dist.pulaski county special sch,cir,and its modification of a consent decree for an abuse of discretion.mcdonald armontrout,cir.we review de novo the district court interpretation of the terms of the revised plan.armstrong,at.
this litigation has been complicated by the shifting terminology employed by lrsd,joshua,and the district court.specifically,efforts to resolve this case since the revised plan took effect in have been marked by confusion over four terms assessment evaluation program and key program.the plain language of section of the revised plan,quoted in part i,supra,required lrsd to assess academic programs implemented pursuant to section,including but not limited to programs implemented under section.
on march,lrsd submitted an interim compliance report that described how it would meet its obligations under the revised plan.the report identified myriad programs that had been implemented pursuant to section and section and set forth both a program evaluation agenda and an assessment plan in response to section.interim compliance report at.significantly,the program evaluation agenda indicated that lrsd would evaluate rather than assess only a small subset of the section and section programs identified in the interim compliance report,and the assessment plan referred only to assessing students,testing,not programs.id.lrsd submitted its final compliance report on march.the compliance report incorporated by reference the interim compliance report.it contained additional information responsive to section under the title program evaluation,which indicated that lrsd had evaluated fourteen programs compliance report at.
as recounted above,the district court granted lrsd partial unitary status in,but concluded that lrsd had not substantially complied with the requirements of section.the district court noted that the interim compliance report had identified almost programs that lrsd had implemented to improve and remediate the academic achievement of students under sections and of the revised plan.d at.according to the district court,these were all of the programs that lrsd was implementing in accordance with its obligations under the revised plan.id.at.the district court elaborated that 
section of the revised plan required lrsd to assess annually each of the academic programs promulgated pursuant to,in order to determine if those programs,in fact,were improving achievement.if the assessment of a program revealed that it was not effective in improving achievement,lrsd was required to modify or replace the program.i find that the purpose of was to make sure that the programs promised under actually worked to improve the academic achievement of students.i further find that lrsd substantial compliance with was crucial to its commitment to improve the academic achievement of students for,without performing a rigorous annual assessment of each of the many dozens of programs implemented under,it would be impossible to determine which programs were working and should be continued and which programs were not working and should be discontinued,modified,or replaced with new programs.
id.at footnote omitted.
the passage is consistent with the terms of the revised plan.elsewhere in its order,however,the district court observed that lrsd interim compliance plan had specified that evaluations would be conducted for key programs including literacy program success for all the implementation of the new curriculum in english language arts,mathematics,and science in the middle schools the national science foundation project aimed at improving achievement in math and science and the implementation of the school improvement plan.id.at.the district court found that the much more and analytical program evaluations,which lrsd agreed to prepare on certain key remediation programs identified in the interim compliance report,were an integral and essential part of lrsd obligation under.id.at.
the district court also noted the distinction between assessment and evaluation.according to testimony from bonnie lesley,lrsd superintendent of curriculum and instruction,an assessment is dynamic,it is interactive,it ongoing,it happens frequently,and it is a measurement,along with the analysis that you would make of whatever results are available.id.at.in contrast,an evaluation is more long term,it may consider observations or measurements in addition to test scores,and is guided by a set of research questions that are usually provided by whoever the consumer is of that report.id.the district court noted that lrsd had interpreted section to include an obligation to perform some program evaluations.id.
at the conclusion of its order,the district court set forth the remedy,which contained six principal sections.the first four sections are those which are the most relevant to the issue before us 
for the entire school year and the first semester of the school year,through december,lrsd must continue to assess each of the programs implemented under to improve the academic achievement of students.lrsd now has over three years of testing data and other information available to use in gauging the effectiveness of those programs.i expect lrsd to use all of that available data and information in assessing the effectiveness of those programs and in deciding whether any of those programs should be modified or eliminated.
lrsd must maintain written records regarding its assessment of each of those programs.these written records must reflect the following information a the written criteria used to assess each program during the school year and the first semester of the school year b the results of the annual assessments of each program,including whether the assessments resulted in program modifications or the elimination of any programs and c the names of the administrators who were involved with the assessment of each program,as well as at least a grade level description of any teachers who were involved in the assessment process,all fourth grade math teachers all eighth grade english teachers.
lrsd must use nunnerly sic or another expert from outside lrsd with equivalent qualifications and expertise to prepare program evaluations on fourteen specified programs a s these program evaluations are prepared,lrsd shall use them,as part of the program assessment process,to determine the effectiveness of those programs in improving achievement and whether,based on the evaluations,any changes or modifications should be made in those programs.in addition,lrsd must use those program evaluations,to the extent they may be relevant,in assessing the effectiveness of other related programs.
joshua must monitor lrsd compliance with and must immediately bring to the attention of lrsd all problems that are detected in its compliance with its obligations under,as those obligations are spelled out in this compliance remedy.thereafter,joshua and lrsd must use the process for raising compliance issues set forth in,et,of the revised plan to attempt to resolve those compliance issues.if those efforts are unsuccessful,joshua must present the issues to me for resolution,as required by.any such presentation must be timely.
id.at footnote omitted.
the contrast between the assessments of subparts a and b and the evaluations of subpart c demonstrates that the district court was making a clear distinction between the two terms.viewed in this light,the meaning of subparts a and b is that the district court was requiring assessments for each of the many dozens of programs implemented under,id.at,irrespective of the requirements imposed by subpart c.this interpretation is consistent with the district court order as a whole,the revised plan,and lrsd interim compliance report.little earth of united tribes,united states dep t of hous.urban,cir we view an earlier order by the district court as a whole,and an interpretation that gives effect to all parts of the order will be preferred over one that leaves portions of the order meaningless or insignificant if there is any ambiguity in the order,its meaning is clarified by what preceded it and what it was intended to execute.
on october,lrsd board of directors adopted a compliance plan that outlined how lrsd would satisfy the remedy.the compliance plan indicated that lrsd would c ontinue to administer student assessments through the first semester of and m aintain written records of the results of the annual student assessments,including whether an informal program evaluation resulted in program modifications or the elimination of any programs.compliance plan at.these statements reflected lrsd interpretation of the revised plan by referring to lrsd efforts to administer student assessments rather than to its obligation to assess academic programs.
the compliance plan also stated that lrsd would p repare a comprehensive program evaluation of each academic program implemented pursuant to revised plan to determine its effectiveness in improving the academic achievement of students and to decide whether to modify or replace the program,and indicated that lrsd would satisfy this obligation by preparing the following new,comprehensive evaluations a elementary literacy,b middle and high school literacy and c mathematics and science.id.at.lrsd thus substituted comprehensive program evaluations for the revised plan requirement of assessments and,more significantly,construed each academic program implemented pursuant to revised plan to mean three programs.lrsd provided a copy of its compliance plan to joshua in october.see october,letter from john fendley.joshua disagreed with the proposal outlined in the plan and,pursuant to the revised plan,requested that the odm facilitate resolution of the disagreement.although the facilitation apparently failed,joshua did not contact the district court regarding the disagreement.
on march,lrsd submitted its new compliance report compliance report.lrsd indicated that its obligation to c ontinue to administer student assessments had been satisfied through its implementation of the assessment plan.compliance report at.with respect to how it had met its requirement to prepare a comprehensive program evaluation of each academic program implemented pursuant to revised plan,lrsd offered the following explanation 
the lrsd contracted with steve ross,an expert approved by joshua,to prepare comprehensive evaluations of the district elementary and secondary literacy programs.these evaluations,combined in a single report,were completed and approved by the board in november of don wold,a program evaluator funded through a national science foundation nsf grant dennis glasgow,interim associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction and vanessa cleaver,director of the nsf grant,authored the comprehensive mathematics and science evaluation.the comprehensive mathematics and science evaluation was completed and approved by the board in december.
on june,the district court concluded that lrsd had not substantially complied with the revised plan or the compliance remedy.the district court commented that 
while the fields of literacy and math and science may be convenient ways to divide academic knowledge,they most certainly do not constitute specific academic programs,reading for all,early literacy learning,reading recovery,or effective literacy that lrsd implemented,on a basis,to improve the academic achievement of students.
order of june,at.addressing what it perceived to be lrsd failure to distinguish between the concepts of assessment and evaluation,the district court explained that 
subparts a and b of the compliance remedy obligated lrsd to assess each of the programs i made no mention of lrsd preparing evaluations of programs because,on its face,nothing in of the revised plan obligated lrsd to perform program evaluations.however,lesley made it clear in her testimony that lrsd administrators knew and understood that the assessment obligation in included the obligation of preparing program evaluations.citation omitted.therefore,i concluded it would be best to use the same terms in the compliance remedy that the parties themselves had chosen to use in of the revised plan.
lrsd interim compliance report indicated that lrsd construed the revised plan requirement to assess all programs to mean that it must evaluate key programs.because joshua elected not to challenge lrsd interpretation,that interpretation became controlling under ordinary principles of contract law.in its order,the district court essentially concluded that lrsd had failed to comply substantially with both interpretations of section,that lrsd had neither assessed all programs nor adequately evaluated key programs.the district court thus imposed a bifurcated compliance remedy.subparts a and b reverted to the original,plain meaning,requirements of section.subpart c addressed lrsd interpretation.had lrsd appealed,subparts a and b might well have been deemed to be superfluous requirements.lrsd did not appeal the order,however,and thus the district court remedy became the governing interpretation of the section obligations.
lrsd compliance plan construed subparts a and b in the same manner that it had previously interpreted section it took assess all programs to mean evaluate key programs.when joshua again failed to raise a legally sufficient challenge to this interpretation,lrsd arguably became entitled to rely on its interpretation,that three program evaluations would satisfy the requirements of subparts a and 
the district court,however,refused to find that joshua had waived its right to challenge lrsd compliance,saying that i n a school desegregation case that has its origins in the infamous little rock school desegregation crisis,no court is likely to hold the silence of joshua if they are to be the students they represent,and who now fill almost of the total number of seats in lrsd classrooms.order of june,at.
the district court found that lrsd had failed to substantially comply with both the plain meaning of subparts a and b,assess all programs and lrsd interpretation of the remedy,evaluate three key programs.
at the outset,we have substantial concerns about the highly detailed,complex nature of the district court remedy,which imposes upon lrsd additional requirements,some of which appear to go well beyond those agreed upon by the parties in the revised plan.the revised plan constituted a contract between the parties,and the district court was not free to expand its terms beyond that which was contemplated by the parties.subpart c of the remedy exceeded the scope of the revised plan,which lacked any requirement for program evaluations.see krupnick ray,cir the law of arkansas provides that it is the duty of the court to construe the contract according to its unambiguous language without enlarging or extending its terms.holland dep t of,cir a court should interpret a consent decree as written and should not impose terms when the parties did not agree to those terms.equal employment opportunity comm times,cir a court may not replace the terms of a consent decree with its own,no matter how much of an improvement it would make in effectuating the decree goals.armstrong bd.of sch.dirs.of milwaukee,cir judges should not substitute their own judgment as to optimal settlement terms for the judgment of the litigants and their counsel.lrsd,however,elected not to appeal subpart c in,and so that issue is not before us today.
in its june,order,the district court set forth an even more highly detailed compliance remedy the remedy.we cite selected portions of that remedy as representative of the level of specificity that the district court engaged in 
because lrsd failed to substantially comply with the crucially important obligations contained in of the revised plan,it must remain under court supervision for two more complete school years,and.to avoid any misunderstanding regarding this compliance remedy,i will be specific.the new compliance remedy is as follows 
lrsd must promptly hire a highly trained team of professionals to reinvigorate pre.these individuals must have experience in a preparing and overseeing the preparation of formal program evaluations and b formulating a comprehensive program assessment process that can be used to determine the effectiveness of specific academic programs designed to improve the achievement of students.i expect the director of pre to have a to have extensive experience in designing,preparing and overseeing the preparation of program evaluations and to have a good understanding of statistics and regression analysis.i also expect lrsd to hire experienced statisticians and the other appropriate support personnel necessary to operate a pre department.
b.the first task pre must perform is to devise a comprehensive program assessment process.it may take a decade or more for lrsd to make sufficient progress in improving the academic achievement of students to justify discontinuing the need for specific programs.for that reason,the comprehensive program assessment process must be deeply embedded as a permanent part of lrsd curriculum and instruction program.only then will i have the necessary assurance that lrsd intends to continue using that process for as long as it is needed to determine the effectiveness of the various key programs in improving the academic achievement of students 
c.during each of the next two academic school years and,lrsd must hire one or more outside consultants to prepare four formal step evaluations.each of these step evaluations must cover one of the key programs,as it has been implemented in schools throughout the district.thus,over the course of the next two academic years,lrsd must hire outside consultants to prepare a total of eight formal step evaluations of key programs.during the recent compliance hearing,ross made it clear that lrsd must conduct these formal step evaluations of the key programs in order to continue to make progress in improving the academic achievement of students.again,i suggest that lrsd hire perform the following tasks identify the four key programs that should be formally evaluated during the school year and the four key programs that should be formally evaluated during the school year and prepare as many of the eight step evaluations as possible.if ross can not prepare all eight of the step evaluations,i recommend that lrsd hire someone that ross recommends as possessing the experience and ability necessary to prepare those evaluations.
e.in order to streamline lrsd obligation,i am going to require that each of the eight step evaluations contain,in addition to the traditional information and data,a special section which describes of the number of teachers and administrators,at the various grade levels,who were interviewed or from whom information was received regarding the effectiveness of the key program being evaluated lists each of the recommended program modifications,if any,that were deemed necessary in order to increase the effectiveness of each of the programs in improving the academic achievement of students and briefly explains how each of the recommended modifications is expected to increase the effectiveness of the program.this requirement is intended to relieve lrsd of any independent obligations under of the revised plan and the compliance remedy.
pre must submit quarterly written updates on the status of the work being performed on the four step program evaluations that will be prepared during the school year and the four step program evaluations that will be prepared during the school year.these quarterly updates must be delivered to the odm and joshua on december,march,june,and september of each of those two academic school years.as soon as each of the eight step evaluations has been completed and approved by the board,lrsd must provide a copy to the odm and joshua.
on or before october,lrsd must file a compliance report documenting its compliance with its obligations under of the revised plan,as specified in this compliance remedy.if joshua wishes to challenge lrsd substantial compliance,they must file objections on or before november.thereafter,i will schedule a compliance hearing and decide whether lrsd has met its obligations under the compliance remedy and should be released from all further supervision and monitoring.
l.this compliance remedy is intended to supersede and replace the identical compliance obligations that i imposed on lrsd,albeit with less specificity,in subparts a and b of section vii of the september decision.
order at footnotes omitted.there was much more in the way of detailed requirements,but those portions quoted are illustrative of what it is that lrsd is now being asked to do.
in reviewing the district court determination that lrsd had not substantially complied with the terms of the revised plan and the remedy,we note,as did the district court,that on march,the same day that lrsd filed what are termed its page evaluations,lesley,the person responsible for overseeing these evaluations,resigned.two months later,kenneth james,lrsd superintendent,also resigned.thus the two persons to whom direct responsibility had been assigned to ensure compliance with the requirements of the remedy were no longer available to assist lrsd in the implementation of the compliance plan.indeed,the authors of the odm march,compliance report observed that the loss of lesley and james at a crucial time in the implementation of the compliance plan,coupled with the delays and difficulties lrsd encountered in filling those positions with acting or interim employees,created a period of some uncertainty for lrsd.
we note these facts and observations to highlight the constraints under which lrsd was laboring as it sought both to satisfy the requirements of the compliance plan and to demonstrate through empirically based evidence that it had in fact accomplished that goal.
lrsd contends that by failing to challenge the adequacy of lrsd compliance plan,joshua in effect abandoned its objection to that plan and thus should not be heard to contest lrsd compliance with the remedy.if this case involved only a dispute between private litigants,we might well have disagreed with the district court holding that joshua had not waived its right to challenge either lrsd interpretation of the remedy or lrsd claim that it had substantially complied with the requirements of that remedy.given the lengthy nature of the litigation between the parties,however,and the substantial likelihood that lrsd ongoing attempts to comply with the order will in due course entitle it to be declared unitary,we will not reverse the district court ruling on this issue.nevertheless,in light of its failure to call to the district court attention to its disagreement with lrsd interpretation of the order,it would ill behoove joshua to raise any further technical complaints about lrsd efforts to comply with the order.
without recounting in depth the voluminous evidence that lrsd submitted in support of its claim that it had substantially complied with the revised plan and the remedy,we observe that had the question of compliance been submitted to us in the first instance,we might well have found that lrsd had met its burden of proof,all the more so in light of the heightened requirements imposed by the district court in its order.it is a close question whether all of those additional requirements are within the scope of the revised plan or whether they represent newly created,that neither of the parties contemplated when they entered into the settlement agreement that resulted in the revised plan.
nevertheless,and once again adverting to the lengthy,if not indeed tortuous,path on which this litigation has proceeded,we conclude that the district court,although it may have come close to crossing the line between proper judicial enforcement of an undertaking and the imposition of requirements that find no warrant in that undertaking,did not clearly err in finding that lrsd had failed to demonstrate substantial compliance with the revised plan and the remedy.
our concerns regarding the remedy are even greater with respect to the even more heightened requirements,as illustrated by the portions quoted above,imposed by the district court june,order.one can understand the frustration expressed by lrsd concerning that which it is now expected to do.indeed,during oral argument we asked lrsd counsel,can you tell us in plain,simple language what it is that the district court wants the district to do that it is unwilling to do counsel responded in part by saying that lrsd was complying with the new compliance remedy.in light of that representation,we are unwilling at this time to say that those heightened requirements surpass beyond all measure the requirements to which lrsd committed itself when it entered into the settlement.suffice it to say that there will be time enough for us to revisit the requirements of the order if this case should once again come before us.for the moment,then,we offer no comment beyond the observation that substantial compliance means just that,not mathematical precision.
conclusion 
in the concluding paragraphs of its june,order under the heading final thoughts on lrsd compliance efforts,the district court,referring to its review of the history of the negotiations that had led the parties to voluntarily enter into the revised plan,stated 
i review this history to make it crystal clear that the all of the program obligations contained in of the revised plan and voluntarily agreed to comply with all of those obligations.
i know it will be quite a burden for lrsd to formulate,implement,and deeply embed in its curriculum an effective program process that will allow it to determine the effectiveness of each of the key programs.but this is the medicine that lrsd knowingly and voluntarily decided it must take in an attempt to cure the historically low academic achievement of so many of its students.
in commenting upon lrsd duty to ensure that a significant number of students score at or above the proficient level in reading,math,and science,the district court concluded its remarks by stating,to this end,lrsd must do what it promised to do,and what it has been ordered to do because of this promise.in the words of the poet of the yukon,robert service,a promise made is a debt unpaid.id.at.
we add to these comments only the observation that a promise is that which has been made by the promisor,and not one that may be expanded by others beyond that which is fairly enco
