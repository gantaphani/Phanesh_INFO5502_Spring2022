background 
on june,california voters approved proposition.the initiative mandates that all children in california public schools shall be taught english by being taught in english.cal.unless a parent seeks a waiver pursuant to sections and,proposition requires that all children be placed in english language classrooms.id.english language classrooms are classrooms in which the language of instruction used by the teaching personnel is overwhelmingly the english language.id.b.students who are english learners shall be educated through sheltered english immersion during a temporary transition period.id.sheltered english immersion is defined as an english language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in english but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language.id.d.
section is the parental enforcement provision.it states that all california school children have the right to be provided with an english language public education.id.if a student is denied the option of an english language instructional curriculum in public school,the child parent or legal guardian has legal standing to sue for enforcement of the statute provisions as well as attorneys fees and actual damages.id.any educator,school board member,elected official,teacher,or administrator who willfully and repeatedly refuses to implement the terms of this statute by providing such an english language educational option may be held personally liable.id 
plaintiffs brought suit under against the state board of education,et.defendants asserting that the parental enforcement provision of proposition is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution plaintiffs also asserted that proposition violates other due process rights conferred by the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims.plaintiffs appeal the vagueness issue only.
vagueness challenge 
plaintiffs contend that proposition is unconstitutionally vague in two principal respects first,they contend it fails to define clearly when teachers are required to speak in english.plaintiffs argue that section mandate that educators provide an english language educational option is unfathomable,leaving them guessing under which circumstances the language restrictions of proposition apply.
second,plaintiffs argue that proposition fails to define clearly how much will subject them to personal liability under section.for public school students in general,proposition requires that the language of instruction be overwhelmingly the english language.id.b.for english learners,proposition requires that nearly all classroom instruction be in english.id.d.plaintiffs argue that the terms nearly all and overwhelmingly are inherently imprecise words,failing to provide adequate notice of what amount of is permitted under the statute.
scope of proposition 
as an initial matter,we must address the scope of proposition,that is,the circumstances under which the language restrictions apply.this determination affects our consideration of whether the initiative implicates first amendment interests,whether plaintiffs may challenge the initiative on its face,and which level of vagueness scrutiny guides the analysis.these issues are discussed in subsequent sections.
plaintiffs argue that proposition is potentially boundless because it imposes liability based on an educator failure to provide an english language educational option.plaintiffs contend that this phrase is so incomprehensible that they can only guess when they must speak in english.defendants respond that proposition applies only on the language of instruction,the language teachers use to present the curriculum to students in california public schools.we agree.
we recognize that it is solely within the province of the state courts to authoritatively construe state legislation.see united states photographs,d.nor are we authorized to rewrite the law so it will pass constitutional muster.virginia american booksellers ass n,d.a federal court duty,when faced with a constitutional challenge such as this one,is to employ traditional tools of statutory construction to determine the statute allowable meaning.grayned city of rockford,d stoianoff montana,cir.in doing so,we look to the words of the statute itself as well as state court interpretations of the same or similar statutes.grayned,at.moreover,before invalidating a state statute on its face,a federal court must determine whether the statute is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction by the state courts.american booksellers,at.nunez city of san diego,cir.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the language of the initiative.section allows aggrieved parents to sue an educator who willfully and repeatedly refuses to implement the terms of this statute by providing such an english language educational option at an available public school to a california school child.an english language educational option refers to the option of an english language instructional curriculum in public school,a phrase contained in the immediately preceding sentence.the phrase english language instructional curriculum is not specifically defined in section or elsewhere in the initiative.however,section indicates that the requirements of an english language instructional curriculum are detailed in article commencing with section and article commencing with section.
both terms,instruction and curriculum,are used in article.for example,section requires the placement of english learners in sheltered english immersion which is defined as an english language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in english but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language.id.d emphasis added.similarly,section requires the placement of all students in english language classrooms which is defined as classrooms where the language of instruction used by the teaching personnel is overwhelmingly the english language.id.b emphasis added.it seems plain that section requirement that educators provide an english language instructional curriculum is simply a shorthand reference to the core requirements of proposition embodied in sections and,namely,that educators must use english as the language of instruction.
this conclusion is confirmed by the initiative overarching mandate which declares that all children in california public schools shall be taught english by being taught in english.id.emphasis added.it is also supported by mclaughlin state bd.of,th,d.in mclaughlin,the california court of appeal analyzed proposition in the context of a challenge to the waiver provisions of the initiative.the court stated 
we conclude that the plain meaning of proposition was to guarantee that lep limited english proficient students would receive educational instruction in the english language,and that english immersion programs would be provided to facilitate their transition into classes.proposition also vests parents of lep students with the sole right to seek a waiver from the chapter provision requiring instruction for their own children.the chapter language permits no other means by which the program requirements may be waived,and in fact,allows for civil action against school districts,educators,and administrators who fail or refuse to provide instruction.
id.at emphasis added.the court also summarized section as affording parents a right to sue if their child or children are not provided instruction.id.at emphasis added.
in light of the plain language and purpose of proposition,and the california court of appeal reading of the same,we must reject plaintiffs contention that the scope of the initiative is potentially limitless.we conclude that,under the traditional tools of statutory construction,the language restrictions of proposition apply only to the language of instruction,the language teachers use to present the curriculum to students in california public schools.at the very least,the initiative is readily susceptible to this construction.see american booksellers,at.whether the scope of proposition construed as such is sufficiently specific and clear to withstand plaintiffs facial vagueness challenge is a different question,which we address below.
first amendment protection 
defendants argue that the speech by which teachers present the curriculum to students hereinafter referred to as instructional speech is excluded from the protection of the first amendment plaintiffs contend that the first amendment provides at least some protection for instructional speech,even if this protection is not of the highest order.neither this court nor the supreme court has definitively resolved whether and to what extent a teacher instructional speech is protected by the first amendment.see cohen san bernardino valley,cir see also karen daly,balancing act teachers classroom speech and the first amendment,educ,the supreme court has yet to squarely address what level of protection,if any,should be accorded to teachers speech.
we need not resolve this controversy,however,to decide the merits of this appeal.instead,we may assume arguendo that the instructional speech covered by proposition receives some first amendment protection.specifically,we will assume that regulations of such speech are subject to the test articulated in hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d.to survive first amendment review under the hazelwood test,regulations must be reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.id.at.although the hazelwood test is not a difficult one to satisfy,it appears to be more than the two alternatives we assume this more protective test applies because,as explained below,even with the benefit of this assumption,plaintiffs can not demonstrate that the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face.
two conclusions flow from our assumption that instructional speech receives first amendment protection under the hazelwood standard.first,plaintiffs may properly challenge section of proposition on its face,as opposed to simply as applied.in the first amendment context,facial vagueness challenges are appropriate if the statute clearly implicates free speech rights.foti city of menlo park,cir united states wunsch,cir see also roulette city of seattle,cir facial attack proper if the challenged statute is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly associated with expression quotation marks omitted.because we assume that proposition is subject to first amendment review under the hazelwood test,we may conclude that proposition clearly implicates free speech rights and,therefore,plaintiffs may challenge the initiative on its face 
second,if a teacher instructional speech enjoys first amendment protection under the hazelwood standard,then a more stringent vagueness test governs our review.when first amendment freedoms are at stake,courts apply the vagueness analysis more strictly,requiring statutes to provide a greater degree of specificity and clarity than would be necessary under ordinary due process principles.hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d foti,at.the reason for this rule is that first amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.button,d.uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.grayned,at.quotation marks,ellipses omitted.
defendants argue that,even if the hazelwood test applies,proposition is not subject to heightened vagueness scrutiny because the instructional speech it regulates and chills is not protected by the first amendment.such speech is not protected,according to defendants,because it could be banned completely under a broader,more precise law without violating the first amendment hazelwood test.we disagree.whether defendants hypothetical,complete ban would pass the hazelwood test does not determine whether proposition is subject to heightened vagueness scrutiny.it is determinative that the initiative must answer to the hazelwood test in the first place.to trigger heightened vagueness scrutiny,it is sufficient that the challenged statute regulates and potentially chills speech which,in the absence of any regulation,receives some first amendment protection.see cohen,at applying heightened vagueness scrutiny to speech receiving some first amendment protection while declining to determine whether broader,more precise rule could validly prohibit speech see generally lawrence tribe,american constitutional law,at ed discussing relationship between doctrines of vagueness and overbreadth.here,because we have assumed that instructional speech,in the absence of any regulation,receives some first amendment protection,restrictions on such speech must pass the hazelwood test,we may properly conclude that heightened vagueness scrutiny applies.
application of vagueness doctrine 
vague statutes are objectionable for three primary reasons.first,they trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.second,they impermissibly delegate basic policy matters to lower level officials for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.third,when vague statutes involve sensitive areas of first amendment freedoms,they operate to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms.grayned,at.foti,at.as explained in the previous section,these vagueness concerns are more acute when a law implicates first amendment rights and,therefore,vagueness scrutiny is more stringent.see hoffman estates,at.
nevertheless,perfect clarity is not required even when a law regulates protected speech.ward rock against racism,d.condemned to the use of words,we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.grayned,at.see kolender lawson,d even in the strictest sense,due process does not require impossible standards of clarity quotation marks omitted.therefore,even when a law implicates first amendment rights,the constitution must tolerate a certain amount of vagueness.
a statute vagueness exceeds constitutional limits if its deterrent effect on legitimate expression is both real and substantial,and if the statute is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts.young american mini theatres,d quotation marks omitted see also tribe,at the expression deterred by a vague statute must be both real and substantial.and a precise and narrow judicial reconstruction must be unavailable.whether a statute chilling effect on legitimate speech is substantial should be judged in relation to what the statute clearly proscribes.broadrick oklahoma,d substantial overbreadth judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.stated alternatively,uncertainty at a statute margins will not warrant facial invalidation if it is clear what the statute proscribes in the vast majority of its intended applications.hill colorado,d quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs argue that they are uncertain when they are required to speak in english because proposition uses varied,undefined,and conflicting terms to delineate its scope.as indicated above,we have concluded that the restrictions of proposition apply to the language of instruction,the language teachers use to present the curriculum to students in california public schools.nevertheless,plaintiffs contend that this construction still fails to give plaintiffs sufficient notice of when the language restrictions apply.specifically,they argue that it is unclear whether teachers must speak english when disciplining students,supervising students on the playground,informing students about safety concerns,taking students on field trips,tutoring students individually,discussing informal matters with students in class,or discussing informal matters with students outside of class.one plaintiff teacher also expressed confusion whether proposition precluded her from recommending that parents exercise their option under the initiative to place their children in bilingual classes.
in the context of this facial challenge,we decline to identify all the specific instances in which a teacher may or may not be providing instruction or presenting the curriculum.it is sufficient to note that instruction and curriculum are words of common understanding,see grayned,at,to which no teacher is a stranger.these terms unquestionably include activities such as teaching students mathematics,science,social studies,history,english,or any other subject matter taught in public schools we must presume that such activities comprise a large portion of the interaction educators have with their students.we agree with defendants that activities such as supervising children on the playground,disciplining students for inappropriate behavior,informing students of safety concerns or informally conversing with students outside the classroom,do not fall within the allowable meaning of instruction and curriculum.see id.at.federal courts must construe allowable meaning of state statute.also,there is no doubt that instruction and curriculum do not sweep within their reach a teacher conversation with a student parents concerning the option of bilingual education.
undoubtedly,there will be situations at the margins where it is not clear whether a teacher is providing instruction and presenting the curriculum.in these situations,where legitimate uncertainty exists,teachers may feel compelled to speak in english and may forgo some amount of legitimate,speech.the touchstone of a facial vagueness challenge in the first amendment context,however,is not whether some amount of legitimate speech will be chilled it is whether a substantial amount of legitimate speech will be chilled.see young,at.judged in relation to the situations where proposition clearly does and does not apply,we do not believe that the situations where proposition application is uncertain will cause a substantial chilling effect on legitimate speech.in other words,in the vast majority of circumstances,it should be clear when a teacher is providing instruction and presenting the curriculum to students.see hill,at.young,at.no substantial chilling effect,in part,because scope of statute will be readily answerable in most situations.
plaintiffs contend that the uncertainty about which activities are covered by proposition is compounded by the uncertainty about how much is permitted during these activities.the initiative requires that teachers present the curriculum overwhelmingly in english or nearly all in english.cal.b and d.plaintiffs argue that these terms are too vague to give them sufficient notice of how much english they must speak to avoid liability.
the terms overwhelmingly and nearly all,like curriculum and instruction,are terms of common understanding.although they are not readily translated into a mathematical percentage,the first amendment does not require them to be.see grayned,at.w e can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.to satisfy heightened vagueness scrutiny,it is sufficient that the vagueness of these terms does not result in the chilling of a substantial amount of legitimate expression.see young,at.
here,it is unlikely that the ambiguity in the terms overwhelmingly and nearly all will chill any more than a negligible amount of speech.plaintiffs admit that,r ealistically,educators do not have the option to speak to students exclusively in english because they have an affirmative obligation to effectively impart knowledge to students and because some school districts require educators to use some.this means that,despite any vagueness inherent in the terms overwhelmingly and nearly all,it is highly unlikely that educators will restrict themselves to speaking english only.instead,by plaintiffs own account,educators will continue to use some amount of.in light of these circumstances,we have no reason to believe that any chilling effect caused by the above terms will be more than negligible.bates state bar of arizona,d commercial speech unlikely to be chilled because commercial entities have strong economic interest in engaging in such speech.
moreover,even if some teachers,out of fear of liability,would limit their instructional speech to english only,it is unlikely that the amount of unspoken would be substantial.the amount of speech chilled,the difference between nearly all english and all english,is necessarily small.the same is true with respect to the difference between speaking overwhelmingly in english and speaking only in english.for the above reasons,we do not believe that any vagueness contained in the terms curriculum,instruction,nearly all and overwhelmingly,whether considered separately or together,will chill a substantial amount of legitimate speech.
in addition,these terms seem no more vague than other statutory terms which have survived facial vagueness challenges under the first amendment.for example,in young,the plaintiffs challenged a zoning ordinance restricting the location of adult theaters.by its terms,the ordinance only applied to theaters presenting material characterized by an emphasis on specified sexual activities.at.the plaintiffs in young argued it was impossible to determine how much of the specified sexual activity could be included in a film before city officials would find it characterized by an emphasis on such activity.id.at.a majority of the supreme court upheld the ordinance against the facial vagueness attack,in part,because it believed that,in most situations,it would be readily apparent whether a film fell within the scope of the ordinance.id.at.in the context of proposition,the terms overwhelmingly,nearly all,curriculum and instruction,seem more concrete,specific and objective than the amorphous phrase,characterized by an emphasis,which the court found sufficiently clear in young.
similarly,in grayned,the supreme court rejected a facial vagueness challenge to a city ordinance prohibiting any diversion which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or good order of such school session or class.at.while acknowledging that the ordinance did not specify the prohibited quantum of disturbance,the court found it sufficient that the statute was restricted to the school context and that the question of whether a diversion disturbed a school session easily could be determined by the impact on normal school activities.the court concluded that the ordinance gives fair notice to those to whom it is directed.id.at.quotation marks,alterations omitted.proposition requirement that public school teachers present the curriculum overwhelmingly in english gives at least as much notice as the ordinance in grayned prohibiting any diversion which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or good order of a school.
numerous other statutes have withstood facial vagueness challenges even though they contained language arguably more ambiguous than that contained in proposition.see,hill,at.rejecting vagueness challenge to ordinance making it a crime to approach another person,without that person consent,to engage in oral protest,education,or counseling within specified distance of health care facility boos barry,d rejecting vagueness challenge to ordinance interpreted as regulating conduct near foreign embassies when the police reasonably believe that a threat to the security or peace of the embassy is present cameron johnson,d rejecting vagueness challenge to ordinance prohibiting protests that unreasonably interfere with access to public buildings kovacs cooper.rejecting vagueness challenge to sound ordinance forbidding loud and raucous sound amplification.
furthermore,in analyzing whether a statute vagueness impermissibly chills first amendment expression,it is necessary to consider the context in which the statute operates.see hoffman estates,at.the degree of vagueness that the constitution tolerates depends in part on the nature of the enactment.schwartzmiller gardner,cir j udgment is necessary to determine the degree of vagueness that the constitution tolerates in a particular situation.alterations,quotation marks omitted see also bethel sch.dist.fraser,d more vagueness tolerated in public school setting regarding student disciplinary rules stephenson davenport comm.sch,cir same.
here,in the context of curriculum presentation,it is the state pedagogical interests that take clear precedence over the teachers first amendment interests.this is true,even given our assumption that teachers instructional speech receives first amendment protection under the hazelwood standard.to pass constitutional scrutiny under hazelwood,a restriction on a teacher instructional speech need only be reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.at.a teacher first amendment interests,therefore,must ordinarily give way to the state pedagogical interests.because any speech potentially chilled by proposition enjoys only minimal first amendment protection,assuming it enjoys any protection at all,and because it is the state pedagogical interests that are paramount in this context,any vagueness contained in proposition is even less likely to jeopardize first amendment values.
finally,any vagueness regarding proposition is mitigated by the section scienter requirement.t he court has recognized that a scienter requirement may mitigate a law vagueness,especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.hoffman estates,at.see also hill,at.potential vagueness ameliorated in part by scienter requirement.for liability to attach,an educator must not only refuse to implement the terms of proposition,the educator must also refuse to do so willfully and repeatedly.cal.in the context of this facial challenge,we need not definitively interpret the phrase willfully and repeatedly.it is sufficient to note that we seriously doubt such wrongful intent could be found if an educator in good faith attempts to comply with proposition or in good faith attempts to comply with the school district guidelines regarding the language of instruction.see people hagen,cal th,d,violation of california tax code not willful if defendant had good faith belief actions complied with law must show voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty people marsh,cal d,conspiracy to violate public welfare statute requires showing that defendant knew of the law and intended to violate it crofoot weger,d,refusal to pay contractual installments not willful when defendant had good faith belief payments were not owed see also lusardi constr.aubry,cal th,d,c ourts refuse to impose civil penalties against a party who acted with a good faith and reasonable belief in the legality of his or her actions.kwan of,th,d,same.such a reading of proposition scienter requirement is certainly within the allowable meaning of the statute.at the very least,the statute is readily susceptible to this construction 
we take heed of the supreme court admonition facial invalidation is,manifestly,strong medicine that has been employed by the court sparingly and only as a last resort.national endowment for the arts finley,d quotation marks omitted.because any vagueness in proposition threatens to chill only a small amount of legitimate speech,because such speech receives minimal protection under the first amendment,assuming it receives any protection at all,and because the initiative high scienter requirement mitigates any potential vagueness,we do not believe that the chilling effect of proposition is sufficiently substantial to warrant the extraordinary remedy of facial invalidation accordingly,we conclude that section of proposition is not unconstitutionally vague on its face 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the parental enforcement provision of proposition allows parents to sue california public school teachers for money damages for their use of without providing the teachers with sufficient clarity as to how much english is required and in what circumstances and settings.as a result,educators fearing personal liability must either teach at their own risk or,as is more likely,acquiesce in the complete elimination of in the performance of their duties.because the provision here raises all three concerns underlying the first amendment vagueness lack of fair notice,a threat of ad hoc and subjective enforcement,and a chilling effect on protected must respectfully dissent from the majority holding that the parental enforcement provision is not void for vagueness.
first amendment rights,applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment,are available to teachers and students.it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines indep.sch,d.in light of the special characteristics of the school environment,however,the government can more readily regulate teacher speech in expressive activities because of the state interest in educating students.see hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,and,d holding that the test for limiting student speech is whether the restrictions are reasonably related to pedagogical concerns but also approving of reasonable restrictions on the speech of students,teachers,and other members of the school community downs los angeles unified sch,cir suggesting the same principles of hazelwood would govern regulation of teacher speech.thus,the first amendment applies in the schoolhouse and the school yard.presumably the majority agrees,concluding that proposition clearly implicates free speech rights.see op.at.we have repeatedly recognized in no uncertain terms that w here the guarantees of the first amendment are at stake the supreme court applies its vagueness analysis strictly.cohen san bernardino valley,cir quoting bullfrog films wick,cir.unfortunately,the majority fails to do so here.
as an initial matter,the majority construes the scope of proposition language restrictions,and hence the basis for the potential liability of educators,as limited to the language of instruction,the language teachers use to present the curriculum to students in california public schools.op.at.assuming that it is sufficient simply to note that instruction and curriculum are words of common understanding,the majority then asserts that such an interpretation would include the teaching of academic lessons,but not other forms of interaction between teachers and their students.op.at.yet these terms have been recognized as having a far broader meaning than the majority is willing to recognize by none other than the united states supreme court itself 
the question whether the first amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student question we addressed in different from the question whether the first amendment requires a school affirmatively to promote particular student speech.the former question addresses educators ability to silence a student personal expression that happens to occur on the school premises.the latter question concerns educators authority over publications,theatrical productions,and other expressive activities that students,parents,and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.these activities may fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum,whether or not they occur in a traditional classroom setting,so long as they are supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences.
hazelwood,at.emphasis added.
thus,while the term curriculum has been construed broadly for purposes of defining the authority of the state to regulate expression that could reasonably bear the imprimatur of the school,when it comes to saving this ambiguously worded restriction on the use of by teachers the majority asserts that the provision is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that is contrary to the supreme court own understanding.nor,as the majority concedes,can this court authoritatively construe the enforcement provision and give it a narrowing construction,which is a matter of state law it is no wonder,then,that plaintiff teachers are concerned about the use of in such circumstances as student tutoring,field trips,supervision,and discipline 
even assuming that the scope of proposition is readily susceptible to some narrowing construction that would make it sufficiently clear to survive strict vagueness scrutiny as to when the use of is restricted,i can not agree that terms such as overwhelmingly and nearly all provide teachers with ample certainty as to how much could expose them to personal liability.the majority states that although terms such as these are not readily translated into a mathematical percentage,the first amendment does not require them to be.op.at.i agree.we should not ignore,however,as the majority does,the fact that individual school districts have interpreted these terms as requiring anywhere between and percent english while mathematical certainty may not be required,some modicum of objective clarity is constitutionally necessary.it is well settled that a statute must be sufficiently clear so as to allow persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.foti city of menlo park,cir quoting grayned city of rockford,d.holding that the terms nearly all and overwhelmingly are sufficiently clear,in light of the disparity of interpretation adopted by public school districts throughout california,necessarily impugns the ordinary intelligence of our school officials in a manner that i find unwarranted.
the majority then contends that because teachers have an affirmative obligation to impart knowledge to their students and because they may even be required to use in certain situations by their employing school districts,it is highly unlikely that educators will restrict themselves to speaking english only.op.at.the majority is apparently oblivious to the dilemma in which this places teachers of either fulfilling their legal and professional duties and exposing themselves to liability,or ignoring their teaching obligations in order to steer clear of a vague restriction on the amount of that is permitted.baggett bullitt,d the state may not require one to choose between subscribing to an unduly vague and broad oath,thereby incurring the likelihood of prosecution,and conscientiously refusing to take the oath with the consequent loss of employment,and perhaps profession,particularly where the free dissemination of ideas may be the loser.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under such circumstances,the use of would only reflect a professional duty that compels teachers to put themselves in jeopardy of liability to parents.
moreover,contrary to the assertion of the majority,the amount of foregone by teachers fearing liability is not negligible.assuming the terms nearly all and overwhelmingly could be interpreted,as the facts show they have been,to require anywhere between and percent english,then the amount of chilled could very well represent between and percent of expression by teachers.surely,by any measure,this amount of deterred expression constitutes a sufficiently real and substantial chilling effect of a substantial amount of legitimate speech for the purpose of strict vagueness scrutiny.
the majority suggests that any vagueness is ameliorated by the inclusion of a scienter requirement.however,a scienter requirement can not eliminate vagueness if it is satisfied by an intent to do something that is in itself ambiguous.nova records,sendak,cir.what does it mean wilfully and repeatedly to refuse to implement the terms of proposition by not providing an english language educational option,when the amount of permissible is not authoritatively defined and is in fact so imprecise that individual school districts have such widely varying interpretations the majority believes i t is sufficient to note that we seriously doubt such wrongful intent could be found if an educator in good faith attempts to comply with proposition or in good faith attempts to comply with the school district guidelines regarding the language of instruction.op.at.but school district guidelines are of no help when the officials promulgating those guidelines are accountable to parents for the implementation of an english language educational option the enforcement provision at issue specifically targets school board members,elected officials,and administrators,as well as teachers.will a teacher be held liable when she wilfully and repeatedly teaches under a percent guideline imposed by the school board,even though warned by the parents of a student that they consider that inadequate does adherence to such a guideline constitute good faith even when the officials of the school district may be sued as well must she disobey to show good faith,despite her obligation to teach in conformity with official school district policies and guidelines 
the mitigating effect of the scienter requirement is diluted not only by the futility of attempting to determine what it means to intend to do something as vague as refuse to implement the terms of this statute by providing an english language educational option,but also by the fact that it is the parents,not any governmental authority,who wield the prosecutor enforcement discretion section presents a real risk of subjective and ad hoc enforcement precisely because it is left to the discretion of individual parents and their own disparate notions of what constitutes an english language educational option.regardless of what the school district requires,the parents of any individual student may hold the threat of personal liability over any teacher who they contend refuses to implement the vague terms of proposition.the threat of such ad hoc enforcement is alone sufficient to chill the use of,despite any residual comfort that,at the end of the day,a teacher may not be held liable.because it is unclear when in what settings the language restrictions apply and how much english is required,proposition parental enforcement authority is so imprecise that discriminatory enforcement is a real possibility.united states wunsch,cir.
despite the majority hyperbole,plaintiff teachers need not establish that the terms of proposition are unfathomable,boundless,or incomprehensible.notably,not even appellees have argued that the terms nearly all and overwhelmingly would survive the strict vagueness scrutiny that the first amendment commands yet the majority so concludes.teachers do not have fair notice of when and how much english is required to avoid personal liability delegation of enforcement to the whims of individual parents invites ad hoc and subjective enforcement and the vague terms of the provision result in a real and substantial chilling effect on expression within the ambit of first amendment protection.the parental enforcement provision of proposition allows for what can best be described as a means of legalistic ambush.cohen,at.if teachers must fear retaliation for every utterance,they will fear teaching.ward hickey,cir.
for the foregoing reasons,i dissent.
