the board of trustees of the california state university the trustees demoted suleman moosa from full professor to associate professor at california state university,chico csuc for five years based on various actions by professor moosa which csuc claimed constituted unprofessional conduct the failure or refusal to perform the normal and reasonable duties of his position.on review of that decision,the state personnel board the board determined only one of the allegations against professor moosa was supported by substantial evidence professor moosa failure to comply with his dean directive to develop and submit an improvement plan.the board recognized professor moosa refusal to develop and submit an improvement plan was part of a battle with the dean that was a microcosm of a larger ideological struggle concerning educational policy at csuc that was occurring at the time.nonetheless,the board concluded professor moosa willful refusal to comply with the dean valid directive was improper.because the board dismissed all charges except this charge for lack of substantial evidence,however,the board modified the demotion from five years to one academic year.
in a mandamus proceeding in the superior court,professor moosa unsuccessfully sought to overturn the board decision.on appeal,we agree with the superior court that substantial evidence supports the board finding that professor moosa willfully refused to comply with the dean directive to develop and submit an improvement plan.we conclude,however,that the dean directive was invalid as a matter of law because it was inconsistent with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the trustees and the california faculty association.for this reason,professor moosa refusal to comply with the dean order can not be characterized as either u nprofessional conduct or the refusal to perform the normal and reasonable duties of his position,subds.b f.
deprived of its last remaining support,professor moosa demotion can not stand.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment and remand the case to the superior court with directions to grant professor moosa petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural history 
the relevant facts are undisputed.professor moosa is a professor of finance in the department of finance and management in the college of business at csuc.he has been a tenured professor there since.other than an informal letter of reprimand in for an unacceptable level of teaching performance,professor moosa had no history of disciplinary action against him before the incidents giving rise to the present proceeding.
as the board itself acknowledged,professor moosa had a reputation for demanding rigorous work of students.it was also generally well known that professor moosa had a rather high withdrawal rate from his classes and that he awarded fewer grades of c or above in his classes than did other finance instructors.
it was,and has always been,professor moosa position that the low enrollment and low grades in his courses were the result of university policies and the general lack of student preparedness for university level work.as early as,however,the dean of the college of business,arno rethans,expressed his view that the problem was rooted in professor moosa teaching performance.following periodic evaluations in both and,dean rethans initiated another periodic evaluation of professor moosa in.under the collective bargaining agreement between the trustees and the california faculty association,and csuc own faculty personnel policies and procedures,professor moosa was to be evaluated by a peer review committee consisting of at least three tenured faculty members.dean rethans specifically directed the committee and the chair of the department to e xplore with professor moosa the root causes for the low enrollment in the classes he taught in academic years and and make recommendations as to how his performance in this area may be improved.as the board found,however,rethans letter made it clear he had personally concluded that the root cause for the low enrollment in professor moosa classes was moosa deficient performance as an instructor.
in december,two members of the peer review committee assigned to evaluate professor moosa issued a report finding professor moosa to be a knowledgeable and resourceful educator with a strong commitment to the teaching profession and the ideal of life long learning.these professors agreed with professor moosa that the root cause of the low enrollment in his classes was the lack of prerequisite knowledge and skills possessed by the students,a serious problem the dean and other administrators needed to address.these professors offered no recommendations for improving professor moosa teaching performance.
the third member of the peer review committee authored a minority report.he concurred with his colleagues that professor moosa was knowledgeable resourceful with a strong commitment to quality education.he further opined that while professor moosa may or may not be part of the cause for low enrollments it is clear that he is not the sole cause.he made various recommendations about the conduct of any future periodic reviews of professor moosa and also recommended that an assessment of the level of preparedness of the students who take finance classes needs to be made however,like the other two members of the committee,he offered no recommendations for improving professor moosa teaching performance.
in january,the department chair,van auken,issued his own report to the dean regarding professor moosa periodic evaluation.he recommended that professor moosa develop a plan that would address the areas of course mechanics,material coverage,testing procedures,and grading practices.
in february,dean rethans issued his report on professor moosa evaluation.concluding that professor moosa performance in the area of instruction continues to be unacceptable,dean rethans instructed professor moosa to develop an improvement plan as suggested by van auken.the plan is to address the issues that have been discussed within the areas of course mechanics,material coverage,testing procedures and grading.the dean instructed professor moosa to submit the plan within two weeks for implementation in the spring semester.
believing dean rethans directive to be an attempt to entrap him in an illegal parallel rogue review scheme,professor moosa submitted under protest as his improvement plan a copy of the majority report of the peer review committee,which,as noted above,offered no recommendations for improving professor moosa teaching performance.
in march,the president of csuc issued professor moosa a notice of demotion informing him he was being demoted to associate professor for his unprofessional conduct and his failure or refusal to perform the normal and reasonable duties of his position.the notice alleged seven different bases for the demotion,including his failure to provide the required improvement plan to dean rethans.that notice was subsequently withdrawn and replaced in june with another notice containing the same allegations.in addition to alleging he had failed to submit the improvement plan as directed by dean rethans,the notice alleged he had treated students in a demeaning manner,was unresponsive to student requests for assistance,and had used class time to discuss his personal educational philosophy,all of which resulted in unacceptably low enrollment levels in the spring semester.the notice also alleged he had failed to adhere to csuc grading policy and had exhibited a severe lack of collegiality in the materials he submitted to the peer review committee.
shortly before the demotion took effect in august,it was modified from a permanent demotion to a temporary demotion for five years.professor moosa appealed the demotion to the board and the matter was heard by an administrative law judge alj on days between november and september.the alj issued his decision in march,finding only two of the seven allegations against professor moosa were supported by substantial evidence that he had failed to adhere to csuc grading policy and that he had failed to obey the dean dir
