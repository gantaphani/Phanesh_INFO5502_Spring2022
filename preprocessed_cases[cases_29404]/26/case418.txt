this appeal arises from the district court denial of lynn swanson and jackie bomchill appellants second motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity.appellants argue,as they did below,that the first amendment does not apply to elementary school students.because it has been clear for over half a century that the first amendment protects elementary school students from discrimination,we affirm.
appellees allege that appellants have in the past,and continue in the present,to ban the distribution of religious messages by appellees and other students while on school property,thereby resulting in religious viewpoint discrimination in violation of clearly established law.appellants deny that they practiced viewpoint discrimination however,because the motion on appeal is a rule b motion,the court must,for purposes of this review,accept the allegations contained in plaintiffs second amended original complaint as true set forth below are the allegations contained in the appellees complaint.
each elementary school classroom in plano independent school district plano isd hosts a winter break party at which students,if they so choose,may exchange goodie bags containing gifts.at the december winter break party at thomas elementary school,michaela wade gave each of her classmates a goodie bag containing,among other items,a pencil inscribed with the phrase jesus is the reason for the season.each gift bag was sealed and had a sticker affixed to it which addressed the bag to a specific student in michaela class.before allowing her to distribute the goodie bags containing the pencils,the school officials searched her gift bags in order to determine whether they contained any religious material.upon discovering the pencils,plano isd officials confiscated and banned them from school property.
swanson,the principal at thomas elementary school,called michaela mother,christine wade,to inform her of the school action and to explain that the candy canes that were also in michaela goodie bags were acceptable gifts but the pencils were unacceptable because they were inscribed with a religious message.swanson informed christine wade that plano isd administrators specifically instructed her that the school district would not allow michaela to pass out pencils with the phrase jesus is the reason for the season affixed to them because of the religious viewpoint of the gift.at the winter break party,school officials permitted michaela to hand out candy canes without a religious message attached and permitted her classmates to pass out goodie bags containing gifts inscribed with secular phrases and symbols,such as snowmen and snowflakes.neither michaela nor her younger sister bailey attempted to distribute gifts at their respective winter break parties in subsequent years because they believed that swanson and plano isd would continue to prohibit their distribution of religious materials 
plano isd,swanson,and other school officials at thomas elementary school also prevented students from passing out religious materials at december winter break parties.for his december winter break party,jonathan morgan chose to give his classmates goodie bags containing pens along with a laminated card entitled the legend of the candy cane that explained the christian origin of candy canes.each bag was individually addressed to a specific classmate with a tag specifying that the gift was from jonathan morgan.
several weeks before the winter break party,jonathan parents,doug morgan and robin morgan,met with swanson in order to determine whether she would permit students to exchange gifts bearing religious messages.the morgans discussed with swanson how 
students and parents are being interrogated by school officials at the winter break parties as to whether or not the contents of their gift or goodie they have brought to school to distribute to their classmates during the winter break any religious viewpoint,religious references or religious message and if the students or their parents acknowledged that the gift bags do contain religious messages or religious viewpoint materials,the bags are then confiscated by school officials and are banned from the classroom and prohibited from being distributed by the students while they are on school property.swanson affirmed that those actions of school officials have occurred in the past and will occur in the future.
swanson further emphasized that students were forbidden from using the term christmas in conjunction with any school event or activity including writing merry christmas on greeting cards sent to retirement homes and affirmed that the school would permit secular gifts to be distributed between students at the winter break parties but would prohibit messages and gifts of a religious nature.
on the day of the party,jonathan and his father unsuccessfully attempted to meet with swanson and then proceeded to jonathan classroom.jonathan teacher met them at the door and prevented jonathan from bringing his goodie bags into the classroom to exchange with his classmates because they contained religious messages.once swanson arrived at jonathan classroom and was apprised of the situation,she immediately informed the morgans that jonathan could place his goodie bags in the school library or he could distribute his gift bags on a public sidewalk off of school property.all of jonathan other classmates were allowed to exchange gift bags inside the classroom swanson only prohibited students from exchanging materials that contained a religious viewpoint.swanson allowed students to exchange other materials and,other than noting the religious nature of the materials,swanson offered no other justification for her censorship of jonathan speech.
in january,w hile at school,but during times and with no material and substantial disruption to the operations of the school,stephanie versher spoke with her friends about a christian drama and gave free tickets to those who were interested in attending.after stephanie had distributed several tickets,bomchill,the principal of rasor elementary school,another plano isd school,instructed stephanie teacher to stop her from distributing additional tickets and to confiscate and discard tickets that she had distributed.bomchill only justification for restricting stephanie distribution of the tickets was that the tickets expressed a religious viewpoint and that other students might disagree with the christian viewpoint and complain to school officials.
plano isd permits students to celebrate their birthdays with parties at school.students with summer birthdays may celebrate their during the school year with their classmates while at school.celebrants often distribute snacks and small gifts to their classmates.for example,students have distributed bookmarks with printed messages,key rings with words and symbols,bracelets,and pencils with various words and symbols.the parties are celebrated during times at school primarily at the end of the lunch period or during a snack break between instructional time.
for her party,on january,stephanie wanted to give her classmates brownies along with two pencils one inscribed with the word moon and another inscribed with the phrase jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so.stephanie mother,sherrie versher,unsuccessfully attempted to meet with principal bomchill prior to the party to discuss the snacks and gifts,so on the day of the party,she took the pencils and brownies to the school office and requested to see bomchill.upon arriving,sherrie versher received a letter accusing her of distributing material to students on school property and threatening that law enforcement officials would be called to arrest her bomchill also accused sherrie versher of distributing materials to students at school.
furthermore,bomchill threatened that,if stephanie distributed any more material while on school property,the school would call the police and stephanie would be in trouble.bomchill allowed stephanie to distribute the brownies and the moon pencils but not the jesus pencils.according to bomchill,such religious material,the tickets and jesus pencils can only be distributed outside of the school building.accordingly,stephanie mother removed the jesus pencils from the tie wrapping the brownies and brought the brownies and moon pencils to stephanie so that she could give them to her classmates during her party in the school cafeteria during lunch break.
when sherrie versher arrived in the afternoon to pick stephanie up from school,she observed her daughter amongst a small group of her classmates outside of the school building on the sidewalk and lawn giving the jesus pencils to her friends after school.as stephanie was attempting to give a pencil to one of her close friends,bomchill grabbed her by the shoulder,took the pencil away from stephanie friend,and told stephanie that she could not distribute those christian religious viewpoint jesus on plano isd school property.bomchill then approached sherrie versher and informed her that stephanie would be kicked out of school if she tries to distribute the christian tickets or jesus pencils at any time while on school property.when sherrie versher attempted to explain that bomchill had earlier that day told her that stephanie could distribute her materials outside the building,bomchill stated that sherrie versher apparently had a hearing problem and needed to have it checked.
this court has jurisdiction to review the district court denial of appellants motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity under and the doctrine,but only to the extent that the appeal turns on questions of law.mitchell forsyth.this court does not have jurisdiction to resolve factual disputes.roe texas dep t of protective and regulatory,cir.moreover,this court reviews a district court determination of a rule b motion de novo.in re scrap material,llc,cir.for a complaint to be dismissed for failure to state a claim,the f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact and the party must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atlantic twombly,
here,appellants motion to dismiss before the district court is based on a claim of qualified immunity,which the supreme court has held is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.mitchell,at.where the defense is raised in a b motion,a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery,unless the plaintiffs sufficiently allege a violation of established law.id.
qualified immunity does not provide officials with a license to engage in lawless conduct.harlow fitzgerald.rather,w here an official could be expected to know that certain conduct would violate statutory or constitutional rights,he should be made to hesitate and a person who suffers injury caused by such conduct may have a cause of action.id.footnote omitted.qualified immunity thus shields government officials performing discretionary functions from individual liability for civil damages but only insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known.id.at thompson upshur county,cir.the supreme court has outlined a test for determining whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity the first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged,saucier katz,overruled in part on other grounds by pearson callahan.and if the plaintiff has satisfied this first step,the court must decide whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged misconduct,pearson callahan.at 
appellants argued before the district court that the united states constitution does not prohibit viewpoint discrimination against religious speech in elementary schools and appellees claims should be dismissed because appellees have failed to allege any conduct of these appellants which constitutes a violation of appellees clearly established constitutional rights.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report denying appellants motion to dismiss,which correctly found that a child right to freedom of expression is not forfeited simply because of her age,and that this right is clearly established in light of the specific context of the case.appellants allege that the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity because t he first amendment is not implicated by restrictions on distribution of materials by elementary school students to their classmates.in the alternative,appellants allege that the law did not clearly establish that the first amendment free speech clause is implicated under the alleged circumstances of this case because neither this c ourt nor the supreme court has ever upheld a first amendment free speech claim by an elementary school student.
the issues before this court are straightforward and limited.this court is not tasked with determining whether appellants conduct actually violated appellees constitutional rights,because at this juncture,we must accept appellees allegations that appellants discriminated against religious viewpoints.nor is this court tasked with drawing the line at which student speech may be properly censored because of its potential to disrupt the classroom,see tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,or because of its potential to subvert the school educational mission,see hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier.because appellants asserted qualified immunity in a motion to dismiss,this court must accept as true appellees allegation that their actions did not cause substantial and material disruption of school operations.furthermore,the facts alleged,viewed in a light most favorable to appellees,provide no indication that the events at issue were curricular or that the speech was inconsistent with the school basic educational mission.hazelwood,at internal quotations and citation omitted.in fact,some of the alleged speech at issue occurred after school hours.therefore,we need only determine,under the facts pleaded here,whether it was clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct that elementary school students have a first amendment right to be free from discrimination while at school 
appellants contend that neither the supreme court nor this court has ever extended first amendment freedom of speech protection to the distribution of materials in public elementary schools.they are wrong.the supreme court has long recognized that public school students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker,at.furthermore,for years,the supreme court has recognized that school officials are subject to the constitution,and the free speech clause of the first amendment is no exception.if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,it is that no official,high or petty,can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,nationalism,religion,or other matters of opinion.state bd.of educ.barnette.over six decades ago,barnette made it clear that the first amendment applies to public school students 
the fourteenth amendment,as now applied to the states,protects the citizen against the state itself and all of its of education not excepted.these have,of course,important,delicate,and highly discretionary functions,but none that they may not perform within the limits of the bill of rights.that they are educating the young for citizenship is reason for scrupulous protection of constitutional freedoms of the individual,if we are not to strangle the free mind at its source and teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.
barnette,at.
appellants argue that reliance on barnette is misplaced because there is nothing in the supreme court decision in barnette,nor in the lower court decision,that indicates that the plaintiffs in barnette were elementary school students nor that the decision generally applies the free speech clause in the elementary school context,the supreme court was not presented with the question of whether it should differentiate between elementary school and high school students,and barnette involved compelled speech,not a restriction on the distribution of materials.these arguments are meritless.with respect to the age of the barnett sisters,although the supreme court opinion does not specifically use the term elementary school,it is evident on the face of the decision itself that the plaintiffs were elementary school students.id.at,describing the plaintiffs as children and little children.
furthermore,the fact that the supreme court did not analyze whether it should differentiate between elementary and high school students is inconsequential and does nothing to subvert the clarity of the opinion.the issue here is whether elementary school students have any first amendment rights,not whether their rights are coextensive with high school students.in addition,barnette overruled minersville school district gobitis,which involved a child.id.at see also bowen roy,stating that barnette involved young children at elementary and secondary schools citation omitted brennan,concurring.
as to appellants third contention,the state school board policy,which required every student to pledge allegiance to the united states flag regardless of religious beliefs,effectively prevented the barnett sisters from privately expressing their religious through school.the bill of rights,which guards the individual right to speak his own mind,does not leave it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind.barnette,at see also wallace jaffree,citing barnette,at,for the proposition that freedom of thought protected by the first amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.
years after barnette,the supreme court reiterated that the first amendment free speech clause applied to all students while in school 
first amendment rights,applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment,are available to teachers and students.it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.this has been the unmistakable holding of this court for almost years students in school are persons under our constitution they may not be confined to the expression of those sentiments that are officially approved.in the absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to regulate their speech,students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views.
tinker,at.in tinker,the problem involved direct,primary first amendment rights akin to pure speech and,similarly to the allegations in this case,did not concern speech or action that intrudes upon the work of the schools or the rights of other students.id.at.in that case,there was no evidence that the students expressive conduct materially and substantially disrupted the work and discipline of the school.id.at.
appellants contend that the first amendment,and therefore tinker,does not apply to distribution of materials by students in elementary schools and cite tinker,attempting to show that the united states supreme court has never clearly addressed the question of whether any first amendment free speech protections apply in public elementary schools.once again,appellants are mistaken.it does not follow that,because the majority opinion in tinker did not use the precise term elementary school,the court holding that first amendment rights are available to teachers and students somehow specifically excludes elementary school students.id.at.on the contrary,the petition for certiorari in tinker,urg ed that the first and fourteenth amendments protect the right of school pupils to express their political views all the way from kindergarten through high school.id.at black,dissenting.justice black dissent further illustrates that the court decision in tinker applied to elementary school students i f the time has come when pupils of schools,kindergartens,grammar schools,or high schools,can defy and flout orders of school officials to keep their minds on their own schoolwork,it is the beginning of a new revolutionary era of permissiveness in this country fostered by the judiciary.id.at black,dissenting.
appellants nevertheless contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity because the law does not clearly establish that the constitution prohibits viewpoint discrimination against religious speech in elementary schools.appellants are again mistaken 
in addition to tinker and barnette,the supreme court,the fifth circuit,the united states government,and even plano isd notified appellants that elementary school students have first amendment rights.see,good news club milford cent,applying the first amendment free speech clause to students ages to rosenberger rector visitors of of,it is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional.citations omitted lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,holding,without distinguishing on the basis of age,that the first amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others citation omitted planned parenthood of cent.danforth,citing tinker for the holding that c onstitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the age of majority and that m inors,as well as adults,are protected by the constitution and possess constitutional rights citations omitted chiu plano indep.sch,cir holding in the middle school context,without distinguishing on the basis of age,that i t is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys and that government actors violate a clearly established right if they discriminate on the basis of the views espoused by the speaker internal quotation marks and citations omitted united states department of education,guidance on constitutionally protected prayer in public elementary and secondary schools february,available at http stating that the first amendment protects privately initiated religious expression and activities from government interference and discrimination plano isd,student expression distribution of nonschool literature,showing that plano isd did not distinguish the legal right of a student to distribute literature on the basis of age in addition,this court has already observed in a related case that elementary school students are entitled to first amendment rights.morgan plano indep.sch,cir applying the time,place,and manner test to plano isd policy regulating distribution of materials in elementary test that would have been inappropriate had the court concluded that elementary school students are not covered protected by first amendment,cert.denied,wl.
moreover,appellants reliance on pearson callahan,to urge us to look to courts in other circuits to support their novel there is no clearly established right of elementary school students to distribute materials to their both misplaced and unhelpful.pearson does not stand for the proposition that courts are always required to consider decisions in other circuits when evaluating whether a right is clearly established.rather,pearson gives state officials the liberty to rely on clearly established law in other circuits in situations where the supreme court and their own circuit have not yet acted.id.at.conversely,even prior to pearson,we have observed that other precedent may be used in some circumstances to demonstrate the presence of a clearly established right in situations where the supreme court and this circuit have not yet addressed the issue.mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc i n the absence of directly controlling authority,a consensus of cases of persuasive authority might,under some circumstances,be sufficient to compel the conclusion that no reasonable officer could have believed that his or her actions were lawful.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
even assuming arguendo that it were necessary to consider the law of other circuits,appellants would not be entitled to qualified immunity.see,peck baldwinsville central sch,cir applying the hazelwood framework in the kindergarten setting to conclude that certain speech was but nevertheless holding that a manifestly viewpoint discriminatory restriction on speech is,prima facie,unconstitutional,even if reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical interests leonard,cir concluding that although age is a factor,this calculus does not necessarily mean that third graders do not have first amendment rights under tinker walz egg harbor twp.bd.of,cir e lementary school students retain certain first amendment rights of expression.citation omitted brown gilmore,cir despite language in supreme court precedent recognizing the impressionability of elementary school children nothing the court has said suggest s that,when the school was not actually advancing religion,the impressionability of students would be relevant to the establishment clause issue.quoting good news club milford cent,curry hensiner,cir applying hazelwood first amendment framework in the elementary school setting hosty carter,cir the supreme court itself has established that age does not control the question no public school,of any,secondary,or discriminate against religious speech in a public forum including classrooms made available to extracurricular activities hazelwood framework applies to elementary and secondary schools.citations omitted muller jefferson lighthouse,cir recognizing that religious speech can not be suppressed solely because it is religious,a principle that makes sense in the elementary school environment hedges wauconda cmty.unit sch.dist,cir n othing in the f irst a mendment postpones the right of religious speech until high school.frazier winn,cir finding that all florida public school students at all grade levels from kindergarten to twelfth grade have the first amendment right to not stand during the pledge of allegiance 
in light of the overwhelming precedent and persuasive authority to the contrary,it is unsurprising that appellants can point to no case stating that elementary school students are without protection under the first amendment from discrimination,absent evidence of disruption to the classroom or subversion of educational mission.appellants thus had fair warning that the suppression of distribution of literature on the basis of religious viewpoint is unlawful under the first amendment with respect to elementary school students.therefore,appellants are not entitled to qualified immunity.if the law was clearly established,the immunity defense ordinarily should fail,since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct.harlow fitzgerald.furthermore,this case does not present extraordinary circumstances,and appellants have set forth no argument that they neither knew nor should have known of the relevant legal standard.id.at.appellants conduct,as alleged,violated the elementary school students clearly established first amendment rights 
appellees have alleged a violation of clearly established law therefore,appellants are not entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denial of appellants motion to dismiss is affirmed.
