we sure it very frustrating at times to be the parents of a child with special needs.in this case,the parents of a boy named casey were apparently frustrated with his school progress,so they turned to mediation with the river falls wisconsin school district over his individualized education plan.after reaching a settlement,the parents filed this suit for attorneys fees pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.district judge barbara crabb,however,found that the parents did not,in the process,receive the kind of success necessary to annoint them as prevailing parties,and so the fee request was denied.this appeal followed.
casey was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder add,and he received special education services for learning disabilities throughout his tenure in grade school.in preparation for his move to high school,the river falls school district had casey reevaluated by a school psychologist,a step prompted by increasing concern over casey insubordination,aggressive behavior,and frequent absences from school.
in order to create an educational plan that would address casey learning disabilities and behavioral problems,the school convened a team of educators,including the school,a counselor,two learning disability teachers,and three other teachers.we will delve into a bit of detail about the efforts to meet casey needs several different plans are involved because the response of the district,and the basis for judge crabb decision to deny fees,is best understood in context.
over the summer,before high school started,the district team formulated an individualized educational plan iep for casey.it was noted that casey was functioning below grade level in reading and writing and that he required frequent monitoring.his emotional and social behavioral problems,however,were not thought to be severe enough to warrant placing him in an emotional disabilities program.thus,the school district allowed him to remain in regular classes while attending learning disability study halls.moreover,casey received special consideration in his regular classes.he was given additional time to complete assignments and tests,he could have test questions read aloud,and he was given written instructions in class.
in september,shortly after casey started high school,his mother wrote to gerald boock,the school district director of special education,requesting a review of casey iep.she also asked that the district employ an expert in add and hyperactivity to review casey program.although boock agreed to review the plan,he did not believe that an add specialist was necessary so early in the school year because casey seemed to be doing ok during his first few months of high school.
despite his initial resistance to an outside expert,boock eventually brought in a special education director from another school district to review casey records and attend meetings that resulted in the creation of a revised plan for casey freshman year.casey parents and the district agreed on several modifications,including an additional hours of learning disability services for spelling,math,and writing.moreover,the school gave him additional counseling regarding his social skills.the revised plan also included a list of objectives consisting of tasks casey was to finish,when they were to be completed,and what consequences would follow if he fell short of the goals.finally,the parties agreed to appropriate disciplinary measures that would not interfere with his schooling,including early morning and detentions,during which the school would provide additional learning disability services.
during the summer before his sophomore year,district officials and casey parents again met and approved a new individualized education plan for the year.in an effort to find subjects that might interest casey more and motivate him to attend class,the district agreed to have him complete an interest inventory and take a variety of courses in subjects like art,mechanics,and food.the school also agreed to provide learning disability support in the form of tutoring,test modification,and increased monitoring for math and intermediate biology classes.as for disciplinary measures,he was to serve lunch detentions when he was tardy and be rewarded if he was on time for days in a row.
again,a list of objectives was formulated,encouraging casey not to miss more than days per term,to take his prescription medication for add regularly,to reduce tardiness,and to complete assignments.the sophomore plan also focused on helping casey make the transition from high school to work.he was offered a course in employability.the school agreed to help him find a job and,if employment was found,to adjust his school schedule so he could work.
again,within months of starting the school year,in october,casey parents requested a review of the educational plan that they had helped formulate over the summer.again the district agreed to review and modify the plan.as before,casey failure to attend classes,his negative attitude,and his poor work habits hampered his school performance.in an effort to set attainable goals,casey academic requirements were further reduced.in the second term of his sophomore year,percent of his course work was to consist of pass programs designed for mastering basic skills in segments,and he could work at his own pace with the help of a tutor.similar reductions of regular classes and increased percentages of pass programs were put into place for the third and fourth terms of the school year.
moreover,at his mother request,all punitive measures for missing school were removed from his sophomore program,and point system with added.in hopes of reducing absenteeism,casey was encouraged to select courses of particular interest to him.he was enrolled in driver education,physical education,pottery,food,and general mechanics along with versions of integrated math and word studies.for the latter two classes he received support from a learning disabilities teacher.
the district hoped that a combination of shortened school days,credit for employment,courses,and subjects would motivate casey to attend school more regularly.finally,as part of his transition,the district arranged for an evaluation with a representative from the state department of vocational rehabilitation to perform a functional vocational evaluation and to help casey formulate employment objectives,adult living goals,and daily living skills.despite these modifications and incentives,casey was absent from percent of his classes during his sophomore year.
as it had done for the past two summers,in june the district began creating the third individualized educational program for casey junior year.with input from casey parents,the district agreed that casey would continue with the pass programs,working hours per day with a certified teacher.in addition,he was to attend physical education classes for minutes daily.thus,including lunch,casey would attend about hours of school a day and be free to work for hours.casey case manager found him a job at a grocery store.
because casey was still deficient in spelling,writing,math,and reading,the district also offered private tutoring,which the parents rejected because casey preferred to stay on campus with his friends.the district noted that casey had earned no credits towards graduation during his sophomore year and that,despite several modifications to his school program intended to make school more appealing,he continued to frequently skip classes.
on june,casey parents wrote to the department of public instruction,asking for a due process hearing to address casey failure to attend school and the school inability to resolve this problem.in particular,casey parents requested an independent educational evaluation iee,a transition planning consultant,and modifications to casey individualized education plan that would capitalize on his strengths.his parents believed the current program was too punitive and failed to provide positive reinforcements.
after hearing of their request for a due process hearing,the district agreed to mediate the dispute with casey parents.both sides retained coun
