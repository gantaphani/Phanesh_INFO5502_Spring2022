we must decide whether a public school teacher speaks as an employee or a private citizen when she voices concerns about the school special education program to her supervisors and her students parents.
tristan coomes worked for four years at meadowdale middle school meadowdale,in edmonds school district district,as the manager of the school new disorders ebd program and the primary teacher for students in the program.
initially,coomes got along with the administration,including joe webster,the assistant principal of meadowdale,and christine avery,the school principal.coomes received satisfactory performance evaluations.but coomes relationship with the school administration later deteriorated,arising from her disagreement with webster and avery over the mainstreaming of her students.coomes believed that some of her students who were ready for mainstream classes were not being allowed access to such classes for impermissible financial reasons.
in march,coomes sent andi nofziger,her union representative,and debby carter,a district human resources manager,an email complaining about treatment by meadowdale administrators,including avery.coomes noted that she had expressed concerns that ebd students who were ready to move to mainstream classes were not moved or had moves delayed based on improper financial considerations.coomes forwarded the email to a group of other meadowdale teachers,and the email chain was then forwarded to avery in april.
avery forwarded the email chain to district administrators,stating that it contained false accusations and that she hoped the district would take a very strong position in stopping this behavior.a few weeks later,avery emailed carter and district assistant superintendent ken limon to express her disagreement with a proposal to reassign coomes to another school because avery believed that the reassignment would publicly validate coomes complaints about avery.
then,during the next school year,the ebd program experienced a significant change.ebd students were placed in more mainstream academic classes than in past years as part of a concerted effort to move the ebd program from a model to a more inclusive model.coomes objected to this change when it was originally proposed.she sent webster an email stating that she thought that new students who had been in classrooms for sixth grade should start the year in her ebd classroom full time so she could get to know their needs and help them adjust to the new school setting.
coomes continued to express concerns about changes to the ebd program.meanwhile,coomes evaluations began to worsen,and webster and avery wrote coomes a number of letters criticizing her performance or reiterating their expectations regarding the curriculum and the ebd program.
after coomes complained to district superintendent nick brossoit in the spring of,the district agreed to transfer coomes to a position at nearby lynnwood high school for the school year.however,prior to the start of the academic calendar,coomes collapsed in the school halls,falling to the floor and sobbing uncontrollably.coomes then requested and was granted medical leave from september to december.but,on the advice of her therapist,coomes decided not to return to work,and on september,coomes attorney sent the district a letter stating that it was impossible for her to continue working and that she had been constructively discharged.after the district counsel contacted coomes counsel to confirm that coomes would not be returning to work,the district processed her employment separation.
thereafter,coomes filed suit against edmonds school district in washington state court,alleging that she had been wrongfully discharged under washington law,that her first amendment rights were infringed,that she was retaliated against for exercising such rights,and that she was entitled to recovery under a variety of other state law claims.her case was removed to the united states district court for the western district of washington,where she added avery and webster as defendants.after discovery,the district and administrators moved for summary judgment on the federal and state claims,and the motion was granted.coomes filed a timely notice of appeal,and we have jurisdiction under 
on appeal,coomes contends that genuine issues of material fact exist and that the district court improperly entered summary judgment.specifically,she contends that her speech to supervisors and parents about the treatment of students in the ebd program related to matters of public concern,was not made pursuant to her official duties,and was a substantial or motivating factor in the district adverse employment actions.she also contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that special education and whistleblower laws foreclose a wrongful discharge claim under washington law.
coomes first contends that her first amendment rights were violated by the adverse employment actions taken against her because of her expressed views about the treatment of students in the ebd program.
p ublic employees do not surrender all their first amendment rights by reason of their employment.garcetti ceballos,d.rather,the first amendment protects a public employee right,in certain circumstances,to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.id.while the protection of government employee speech serves both the individual interest and the public interest in receiving the views of government employees engaging in civic discussion,the public interest is also served by respect ing the needs of government employers attempting to perform their important public functions.see id.at.as such,while the first amendment invests public employees with certain rights,it does not empower them to constitutionalize the employee grievance.id.at quoting connick myers,d.
in eng cooley,cir,we set forth the inquiry for evaluating first amendment retaliation claims.first,the plaintiff bears the burden of proof at trial of showing that she spoke on a matter of public concern that she spoke as a private citizen rather than a public employee and that the relevant speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.id.at.if the plaintiff establishes such a prima facie case,the burden of proof shifts to the government to show that the state had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from other members of the general public or the state would have taken the adverse employment action even absent the protected speech.id.at 
all of the eng factors are necessary,in the sense that failure to meet any one of them is fatal to the plaintiff case.dahlia rodriguez,cir en banc.because all five factors are independently necessary,a reviewing court is free to address a potentially dispositive factor first rather than addressing each factor sequentially.id.
with the foregoing in mind,we focus on the second eng factor whether coomes spoke as a private citizen or as a public employee.
again,we are guided by ample precedent.the first amendment does not protect speech by public employees that is made pursuant to their employment responsibilities no matter how much a matter of public concern it might be.see garcetti,at.in garcetti,the court explained that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.id.at.consequently,r estricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.id.at.
the supreme court recently emphasized in lane franks that the mere fact that a citizen speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee rather than citizen speech,d.instead,the critical question under garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee duties,not whether it merely concerns those duties.id.thus,to the extent that coomes speech was within the scope of her employment duties,such speech is not protected by the first amendment.
whether coomes was speaking as a private citizen or a public employee is a mixed question of law and fact.hagen city of eugene,cir.the scope and content of coomes job responsibilities is a factual question.johnson poway unified sch,cir quoting eng,at.this inquiry is not limited to a formalistic review of coomes job description,but is practical.id.quoting garcetti,at see marable nitchman,cir.
also,the court must,as a matter of law,decide the ultimate constitutional significance of those facts.johnson,at quoting eng,at.if coomes speech owes its existence to her position as a teacher,then she spoke as a public employee,not as a citizen,and our inquiry is at an end.id.quoting garcetti,at.
regarding the factual inquiry,the garcetti court had no occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee duties where there is room for serious debate.posey lake pend oreille sch.dist,cir quoting garcetti,at likewise,in lane,the court did not provide such a framework because it was undisputed that the employee ordinary job responsibilities did not include the speech at issue.at see id.at thomas,concurring.in resolving this factual question,we consider a set of guiding principles drawn from our case law applying garcetti.see dahlia,at.
so the central question becomes whether any genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the second eng factor did coomes speak as a private citizen or a public employee because the plaintiff bears the burden of proof at trial on this factor,a defendant moving for summary judgment must either produce evidence establishing that the plaintiff spoke as a public employee or show,through argument,that the plaintiff does not have enough evidence to establish that she spoke as a private citizen.see nissan fire marine ins.fritz,cir.where the defendant meets that burden,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to designate specific facts demonstrating the existence of genuine issues for trial.see oracle,at.
here,the district initially bore the burden of production to show that coomes spoke as a public employee or lacked evidence sufficient to establish that she spoke as a private citizen.to meet that burden,the district submitted coomes formal job description and submitted her emails that allegedly formed the basis for retaliation.in addition,the district argued that coomes focused her complaints on things that happened in her classroom,with individual students,during the school day,that her complaints to her supervisors occurred in her role as teacher,and that she referred to herself as a teacher and employee in her email to the district human resources manager and her union representative.on appeal,the district cites both coomes job description and her declaration to show that she was responsible for managing the ebd program and was part of the iep team.coomes does not argue that the district failed to meet its initial burden and thus the burden shifts to coomes to demonstrate that genuine issues of material fact exist.
before the district court and now on appeal,it appears that coomes neglected to designate specific facts in the record demonstrating the existence of genuine issues of material fact for trial.although she argued below that her duties did not include battling with district representatives over the special education rights of her students and did not include speaking out on behalf of herself and her fellow staff members about bullying and harassment by meadowdale administrators,she cited only one piece of evidence to establish the scope of her duties her formal job description coomes conclusory statements about her duties and her lone citation to the factual record were insufficient to meet her burden to show that genuine issues of material fact exist.see bader line layers,cir b are assertions of a legal conclusion,not supported by any other specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.quoting fed.civ.e.
where the case turns on a mixed question of fact and law and the only disputes relate to the legal significance of undisputed facts,the controversy is a question of law suitable for disposition on summary judgment.mut.united states,cir.here,coomes failed to establish that there were any genuine issues of material fact for trial,but rather focused her argument on the relevant case law.as a result,summary judgment would be appropriate if legally supportable.
coomes describes her speech as relating to two topics the illegal and improper treatment of vulnerable students in the public school system and bullying and harassment by meadowdale administrators in retaliation for taking a stand.coomes speech was transmitted to two distinct audiences district personnel and parents.we address coomes speech as directed to each audience in turn.
as we have explained,whether or not the employee confined her communications to her chain of command is a relevant,if not necessarily dispositive,factor in determining whether s he spoke pursuant to her official duties.dahlia,at.thus,generally,when a public employee raises complaints or concerns up the chain of command at her workplace about her job duties,that speech is undertaken in the course of performing her job.id.quoting davis mckinney,cir.
in addition to this guiding principle from dahlia,coomes job description and her declaration both shed light on the factual question of the scope of her duties.coomes declaration states that she was put in charge of the ebd program and successfully managed the ebd program.according to her job description,coomes was responsible for assisting and supporting building staff regarding ebd students,participating with staff to develop strategies to address behavior problems,developing ieps,providing instruction within the ebd classroom,implementing positive behavior supports for all students,and attending to the physical and safety needs of students.lastly,the job description notes this position will have significant contact with parents,students,and district staff requiring the ability to work collaboratively with a variety of people.
based on the job description and declaration,the district court concluded that it was part of coomes job as the iep manager and a member of the iep team to point out failures to abide by ieps and that it was part of coomes job as the ebd teacher to communicate with administrators and parents about her views on the placement and progress of ebd students and appropriate management of the ebd program.as discussed above,coomes has not identified sufficient record evidence to demonstrate that an issue of fact exists with respect to the scope of her duties.
coomes speech to district administrators raised complaints or concerns about poor treatment by the meadowdale administration and about potential mismanagement of the ebd program.coomes complained about the administration treatment of teachers in an email sent on march,from her to carter and nofziger coomes stated that she believed avery created a hostile work environment by targeting teachers who openly disagreed with administrative decisions.coomes noted that she was a target of administration hostility because she expressed concerns that ebd students who were ready to move to mainstream classes were not moved or had moves delayed based on financial considerations.she stated without elaboration that this late mainstreaming practice was,in some opinions,unethical.coomes forwarded the email to a group of other meadowdale teachers,and it was eventually forwarded to avery.
in addition to complaints about treatment by the administration,coomes raised concerns about the management of the ebd program in numerous communications.for example,she emailed her union representative and assistant superintendent anthony byrd with concerns that students placements were inconsistent with their ieps and said that she wanted to put her concerns on the record before something seriously negative happens.two days later,coomes emailed nofziger and limon claiming that webster decision to mainstream ebd students was n
