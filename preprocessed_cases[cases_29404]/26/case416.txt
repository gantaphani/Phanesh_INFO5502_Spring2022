julie that the liberty independent school district had infringed her constitutionally protected the district and several of its officials.she claimed the firing not allow her at a school board meeting to present her side of her troubles with a teacher for whom she had been an aide,issues then on an review before consideration by the board.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on all claims,and fairchild appealed.we affirm the judgment but travel a somewhat different path than did the district court.
fairchild worked for the district as a teacher aide for special needs children in jessica barrier lanier classroom the two did not get along,and the district eventually fired fairchild in may of.the next day,fairchild submitted a grievance.she alleged that the district had terminated her in retaliation for accusing barrier lanier of such things as overdosing children with prescription medicine,lifting a severely handicapped student by her hair and belt loops,and shopping for her wedding during school time 
two district policies,dgba local and bec legal,govern employee concerns and grievances dgba local requires employees to follow a administrative process in which the school board for the first time directly hears and deliberates on the matter at level iii.per bec legal,the board will hear the employee concern in closed session,unless the target of the concern demands a public hearing.
at level i fairchild alleged that the district had terminated her for trying to blow the whistle on barrier lanier that she posed a danger to the children and should be fired.the district denied fairchild level i grievance.fairchild then progressed on two parallel within the district and one outside of it.she filed for a level ii hearing,and,after failing to reach an agreement,she requested a level iii and final hearing.in the meantime,fairchild reported barrier lanier to child protective services,and began a parents petition asking the district to be more forthcoming with information regarding special needs demanding that the district not retaliate against any employee who shares information about an endangered child.
all of this came to a head on august.that night,the district held a school board meeting.at the beginning of its meetings,the board allows public comment on board business.it resolves no disputes at this opening comment session and decides no questions.rather,issues requiring resolution must proceed through alternative channels.when commentary moves to issues with named teachers or individual employees,the board notes it as matter beyond the scope of the opening session,and the speaker must first proceed through an alternative process.this decision steers away personal grievances or examinations of individual performance,both of which would necessitate reply and a frustration of the board agenda.it also avoids a frustration of the policy of not hearing personnel including grievances in public absent the consent of the employee whose performance is questioned.after the opening comment session,the board moves to the remainder of its meeting in open and sometimes in executive sessions.
the board scheduled fairchild to speak during the comment session of the august meeting to allow her to present her petition.fairchild had to sign a statement acknowledging that a ny issues pertaining to specific district personnel may necessitate a closed session.she had to further acknowledge,this comment period is not intended for the presentation of complaints.the board will only consider complaints that remain unresolved after they have been addressed through proper administrative channels and when they have been placed on the agenda.additionally,the district has in place an enforcement rule which governs all public meetings it states in part 
the board shall not tolerate disruption of the meeting by members of the audience.if,after at least one warning from the presiding officer,any person continues to disrupt the meeting by his or her words or actions,the presiding officer may request assistance from law enforcement officials to have the person removed from the meeting.
at the same meeting,the board decided to hold fairchild level iii grievance hearing,which would commence after the open session.as required by bec legal,the level iii grievance would close,this because fairchild sought to level charges against barrier lanier.
but fairchild requested a different hearing and decision on her level iii appeal in the open session of the meeting.she cited the texas open meetings act this chapter does not require a governmental body to conduct an open meeting to deliberate the appointment,employment,evaluation,reassignment,duties,discipline,or dismissal of a public employee unless the employee who is the subject of the deliberation or hearing requests a public hearing.even though she sought with her grievance to attack barrier lanier,fairchild contended that her hearing bore on her own firing.that is,she was the subject of a negative employment deliberation and she demanded an open session.the district fairchild that she could have her public hearing but that,if it moved to concerns,the session would close pursuant to bec legal.
ultimately,during the august meeting fairchild presented her petition in the comment session without mentioning school employees by name.she also had her level iii grievance in the closed session,as scheduled.there,fairchild made her complaints against barrier lanier and sought to clear her own name.in the end,the district denied the relief sought in the grievance hearing.
fairchild brought this action in federal district court to contest the procedures used at the august board meeting.she alleged that the district had misinterpreted the texas open meetings act,because the act requires a public grievance hearing in the alternative,the act is unconstitutional as applied to her in that it closed her level iii grievance hearing the district had retaliated against her for trying to blow the whistle on barrier lanier the district public comment rules,collectively called bed local,which she claims do not allow parents in the opening comment session to complain against teachers,are facially unconstitutional the district policies dgba local and bec legal violate the first amendment,both on their face and as applied to fairchild grievance hearing and the individual district administrators and teachers had deprived her of constitutional first amendment rights and should be held liable under.
through the course of multiple voluminous motions,the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all claims.on appeal,there remains only a facial challenge to the rules concerning the comment session of the board meeting and both a facial and challenge to the closing of fairchild grievance hearing 
our review is de novo,and we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any grounds supported by the grounds different than those relied upon by the district court 
we begin with fairchild facial attack on the comment session rules,bed local the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,persuaded fairchild had not shown the injury essential to article iii standing.we hold that fairchild has standing to bring her first amendment facial challenge to the comment portion of the board meeting and affirm the summary judgment on the merits.
a plaintiff must meet both the constitutional demands of article iii standing as well as instrumental prudential concerns prudential considerations are and are seen as jurisdictional in reach article iii standing has three elements an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and the likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.
in first amendment facial challenges,federal courts relax the prudential limitations and allow litigants to attack potentially overbroad statutes to prevent the statute from chilling the first amendment rights of other parties not before the court.at the same time,article iii standing retains rigor even in an overbreadth claim the defendants allege,and the district court found,that fairchild had not shown the requisite.we disagree.
chilling a plaintiff speech is a constitutional harm adequate to satisfy the requirement.fairchild alleges that bed local chills public speech by forbidding the disclosure of information about specific teachers during open board meetings.more to the point,fairchild asserts that she had to reign in her own speech during the august comment session.asked in her deposition,i s there anything that you did get to say to the school board during the august open meeting that you wanted to say she responded,yes,i would like to have used the teachers names and they would not allow me any of the names or any of that.the district concedes fairchild would not have been allowed during the comment session presentation of her parents petition to attack the work of the teacher whom she had aided 
fairchild has satisfactorily shown that she is seriously interested in engaging in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by statute,a sufficient constitutional injury.we turn to the merits of her facial attack on the comment session rules,bed local 
fairchild seeks an injunction to prevent the district from enforcing its bed local policy.she brings only a claim of facial invalidity a court first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.if it does not,then the overbreadth challenge must fail.if the ordinance passes the overbreadth test,the court moves to examine the facial vagueness challenge and,assuming the enactment implicates no constitutionally protected conduct,should uphold the challenge only if the enactment is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.
we must start by determining exactly what the policy entails.in doing so,we find that bed local is amenable to a proffered limiting construction the bed local written policy states under the heading public comment at regular meetings,the board shall allot time to hear persons who desire to make comments to the board.the policy further explains how the board must respond during the comment session specific factual information or recitation of existing policy may be furnished in response to inquiries,but the board shall not deliberate or decide regarding any subject that is not included on the agenda posted with notice of the meeting.regarding complaints and concerns the presiding officer or designee shall determine whether a person addressing the board has attempted to solve a matter administratively through resolution channels established by policy.if not,the person shall be referred to the appropriate policy to seek resolution.
during his deposition,board president frank local minister in liberty,the nuances of the written policy.during the opening session,the residents can present comments having to do with board business.he described that the board duty there is to listen and we do not deliberate.the fairchild assertions to the the public to voice concerns and complaints,just not if the complaint involve s naming of people employees or students this rule dovetails with another of the board default policies to discuss behind closed doors personnel matters including the appointment,employment,evaluation,reassignment,duties,discipline,or dismissal of a public employee 
experience confirms davis representations.fairchild complained during the comment session without interruption.indeed,the petition she presented asserted that parents reasonably believe d that we have been denied access to important information concerning special needs children.fairchild even demanded that the board i ssue a directive to all school administrators that they may not fire any employee because the employee provides information concerning a child with special needs to an administrator a familiar exhortation,as fairchild claimed that the district had fired her for sharing information about dangers to special needs students.because fairchild did not divulge personally identifiable information at the comment session,the interpreted fairchild speech as a parent concern never interrupted her presentation of complaints.additionally,another at board meetings complained that the district high school did not have adequate wheelchair accessibility.with no board interference,she challenged the board to negotiate the school grounds in wheelchairs 
responsive to the principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties,we decline to read the text expansively.rather,we agree with the board construction bed local opens a session for the public to air concerns about board it is not an occasion for resolution of personal disagreement with employees.those must first proceed through an alternative process where they will either be resolved or sharpened for board resolution.
we start with overbreadth,asking if bed local infringes a substantial amount of protected speech.in doing so,we must identify the type of forum the opening session represents,because our determination of the character of the forum in which expression was regulated shapes our determination whether a constitutional violation occurred.
there are three categories of forums,only the first two of which are relevant here traditional and designated public forums limited public forums and nonpublic forums traditional public forums include sidewalks,streets,and parks that the public since time immemorial has used for assembly and general communication the state can also intentionally create designated public forums on other state property for the same widespread use as traditional public forums regulation of speech in traditional or designated public forums must pass strict scrutiny with a compelling state interest and narrow tailoring 
limited public the name for public expression of particular kinds or by particular groups.the government may restrict speech in these limited public forums,as long as the regulation does not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint and is reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.a restriction based on subject matter may be permissible if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum.
the this case and most at the line between designated and limited public forums on one side,a designated public forum is open for indiscriminate public use for communicative purposes.on the other side lies the limited public the government may legally preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.the necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the state in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.in distinguishing between the two types of forums,our precedent directs us to focus on two factors the government intent with respect to the forum,and the nature of the forum and its compatibility with the speech at issue.
the board meeting the comment session in a limited public forum for the limited time and topic of the meeting.plainly,public bodies may confine their meetings to specified subject matter and may hold nonpublic sessions to transact business,and the board meeting here fits the hornbook definition of a forum,in which the state is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of speech.the board policies exclude from public discourse certain topics of individualized personnel the board channels into more effective dispute resolution arenas,before it hears the matter and resolves it.so limited,the board meeting defies categorization as a designated public forum,because t he government can not create a designated public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse 
close analysis only confirms these axiomatic observations.turning first to the district intent in creating the comment session,we push aside statements regarding the purpose of the meeting for objective evidence leavened by common sense.the board opens its meetings for a short duration to hear comments relevant to this part of its agenda.but this item of the agenda as designed and limited is not for dialogue or.rather it is a learning and routing mechanism.by its rules the board does not engage the public in debate,because it may not deliberate or take action at this juncture.instead,the recite only policy and list facts.at the comment session,the board is to alert a speaker to an administrative proceeding at which the speaker may be heard and seek a remedy or the board may put that topic on future agendas.it follows that quarrels between employees and rehearsals of disputes moving through the administrative process have no place in the comment session and are not here reflective of viewpoint preference.the board has limited the comment session to flagging issues for potential,diverting controversies that surface to an alternative hearing path to be developed before being resolved by the board.the board has a strong and interest in setting an agenda and paths to board hearings to avoid irrelevant topics or extended contentious debate.
while the board has here a limited public forum,its policies must be both and reasonable in light of the forum purpose.they are plainly both.there is no evidence that the liberty school board discriminates based on the view or identity of a given speaker.a speaker may discuss concerns generally as fairchild did,but can not move to the merits of an extant dispute.to do so could derail the agenda for the meeting and risk unnecessary disclosure of private information about employees or students 
and the rule is reasonable.the board has a legitimate interest,if not duty,to protect student and teacher privacy and to avoid naming or shaming as potential frustration of its conduct of business.as the ninth circuit has explained,the usual f irst a mendment antipathy to control of speech can not be imported into government meetings intact while a speaker may not be stopped from speaking because the moderator disagrees with the viewpoint he is expressing,it certainly may stop him if his speech becomes irrelevant or repetitious.where the board can not take immediate responsible action,it need not suffer one side of a dispute awaiting resolution by alternative channels.in short,the board did not open the comment session of its agenda to create a dispute resolution forum,anticipating that issues that do arise can be channeled into and heard at one of the board robust grievance processes.this leaves the public ample opportunity to be not here and now.
so understood,the seeming viewpoint index of not allowing attacks upon an individual in its limited public forum disappears.the district excludes resolution of the merits of disputed individual performance in its limited forum,and to allow the charges of one side would force allowance of a frustration of this studied effort to manage its agenda.in short,the board agenda does not allow at this time and place charges against its teachers.rather,it reroutes them for further treatment.
although forum analysis lights the path to the correct result,it bears emphasis that the board rules ultimately do not constrain by the content of protected speech but rather do no more than limit the time,place,and manner for its expression absent the afforded alternative paths for expressing this category of protected speech we would be faced with a quite different case.where boundary lines of forum use cross to content and viewpoint discrimination can be elusive,and we do not suggest that in application a rule can not offend.as we have just observed,the absence of alternative paths for expression here would be difficult to defend and a rule may be calculated to step upon,for example,public criticism of teachers.this record supports neither of these possible first amendment failings of an otherwise permissible rule.finally,it may be suggested that the fit between the district ends and its means are insufficiently exact we are unpersuaded.these rules were designed to serve a substantial government interest and allow for reasonable alternative communication 
under the limiting construction of bed local,the policy does not infringe a substantial amount of protected speech.application of the overbreadth doctrine is,manifestly,strong medicine.it has been employed by the court sparingly and only as a last resort.we have no reason today to write that prescription 
fairchild wisely does not push the vagueness prong,as it lacks merit.a statute can be impermissibly vague for either of two independent reasons.first,if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits.second,if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
fairchild offers no evidence that the board has ever gagged a speaker,or that the police have removed a speaker from a board meeting.regardless,for the government to prosecute a person for causing a disturbance at a board meeting,the persist in the disturbance.nothing unascertainable here to people of common intelligence.indeed,the predicate a scienter this law of any difficulty in understanding if the moderator asks you to cease,stop doing it.for essentially the same reasons,nothing in bed local fails adequately to guide law enforcement officials.the police can only remove a speaker after the speaker receives warning to stop disrupting the meeting 
fairchild wanted the board to hold her grievance hearing in public,she sought also to ask the board to fire barrier board closed fairchild hearing pursuant to dgba local and bec legal.unlike with the comment session she brought only a facial offers both an and facial challenge to the grievance policies.we apply the same analytical framework as we did to fairchild claim against bed local,of the similarity between the,not surprisingly,come to the same result.
fairchild hearing represented a limited public forum.the board by definition intended that fairchild use this hearing merely to appeal her termination.at these hearings,only the employee,counsel,witnesses,and district can speak.the board may only consider the issues and documents presented at levels i ii.a soapbox the grievance hearing is not.and a level iii termination appeal restricting ancillary topics is necessary to implementing the board narrow purpose of resolving the appeal at hand.
the board restrictions in this limited forum are both and reasonable.the board by default closes discussion of personnel matters.the subject matter of the closed hearings includes both appointment and dismissal opposite sides of the same coin.additionally,the district rule directly serves substantial state interests in employee privacy and disciplined agenda while ensuring the accuracy of information disclosed at the hearing.on their face,the policies do not infringe a substantial amount of protected speech.
turning specifically to fairchild termination appeal,the board mechanically applied its otherwise valid policies.fairchild asked the board to hold her hearing in public,which it would have done.fairchild,though,sought in the hearing to complain about a district to ask that the board fire her.this triggered bec legal,a reasonable,rule of general applicability the board will hear in closed session matters relating to the appointment,employment,evaluation,reassignment,duties,discipline,or dismissal of a public employee unless the subject of that personnel matter requests otherwise.although fairchild wanted her own issues aired to the public,she also wanted to seek dismissal of barrier lanier,a different employee who did not.we are persuaded that the board level iii termination appeal policies did not violate fairchild first amendment rights.
fairchild also has three children who during the relevant time period attended district schools.fairchild also has three children who during the relevant time period attended district schools.

see at.as part of her facial challenge,fairchild argues that a policy called fng local contributes to the unconstitutionality of bed local.fng local provides for a parents grievance to the administrative process provided for employee grievances.fairchild claims contrast to davis parents seek generically to complain in the comment session,bed local forces these complaints into an extended fng local remedial process.although bed local does say that parent concerns shall be referred to fng local,referring does not mean silencing.bed local prevents the board from acting during the comment session,so fng local actually assists the parents in seeking pointing them to an outlet at which the board can deliberate.nothing on the face of bed local says that parents can not at the comment session air their concerns and then subsequently pursue fng local.that is,the comment session and fng local are not mutually exclusive.the comment session sheet is not to the contrary.the paper reads this comment period is not intended for the presentation of complaints.the board will only consider complaints that remain unresolved after they have been addressed through proper administrative channels and when they have been placed on the agenda.on its face,this note merely communicates the bed local rule that the board can not deliberate or ta
