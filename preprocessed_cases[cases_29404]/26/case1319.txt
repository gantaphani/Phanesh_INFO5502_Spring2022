introduction 
daniel berman appeals the judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate against the regents of the university of california regents.he seeks to overturn a suspension from the university of california san diego ucsd,which was imposed against him for hitting another student in the head with sufficient force to knock the other student to the ground and to cause him to lose consciousness,sustain a concussion and require medical attention.berman does not challenge the factual finding he violated ucsd student conduct code the code his sole contention on appeal is the code did not authorize either the student conduct officer responsible for his case,who is also a dean of student affairs,or the council of deans of student affairs council of deans to impose suspension as a sanction when the student conduct review board did not recommend suspension.we disagree and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the incident 
during an altercation on the night of february,involving a group of ucsd students,berman admits he hit another student in the head with his fist causing the other student to fall to the ground and lose consciousness.the other student sustained injuries,including a concussion,and required medical treatment 
ucsd student conduct proceedings 
the ucsd office of student conduct notified berman in writing of its receipt of a report alleging berman violated the code by engaging in physical acts of violence with another ucsd student while possib ly under the influence of alcohol.it is a violation of the code and ucsd community standards to engage in physical abuse including physical assault,battery,or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person.it is also a violation to engage in disorderly conduct.
the letter alleged multiple witnesses saw berman hit a member of the ucsd soccer team while outside a social event and the individual was taken to the hospital for the injuries that were sustained.berman was offered the opportunity to meet with the dean of student affairs,patricia mahaffey,to discuss an administrative resolution.
enclosed with the notification were electronic copies of the code and a copy of a document entitled frequently asked questions about the student conduct process.this document explains the administrative resolution meeting,possible sanctions and the right to request a student conduct review if the student does not accept responsibility for the alleged code violations.
in a student conduct review,a student has the opportunity to present information and witnesses regarding the case to a conduct board board consisting of students,faculty,and staff.after the review,the board determines whether or not the student is responsible for alleged code violations and,if so,recommends appropriate sanctions.according to the document provided to berman,the board report is then forwarded to the student conduct officer who will determine the final sanctions if the student is found responsible.for reviews involving suspension for an undergraduate student,the council of deans of student affairs will determine the sanctions.
berman participated in an administrative resolution meeting with the assigned student conduct officer,dean mahaffey.thereafter,the matter proceeded to a student conduct review.
at the student conduct review hearing,the board heard witnesses and berman defense.the board made the following factual findings d irectly before the altercation,loud and unreasonable noise was being created by other individuals,excluding berman berman was present at the date,time,and location of this altercation berman stated that he struck another student during this altercation and the other student was treated at a hospital for injuries that he incurred during this altercation.after consideration of the incident report,the investigative report and statements at the review,the board concluded it is more likely than not berman violated the code regulations against physical abuse by engaging in physical assault,battery and conduct threatening the health or safety of any person.the board did not find berman in violation of the regulation against disorderly conduct.the board recommended the following sanctions probation through tenure,anger management workshop,alcohol risk reduction seminar,and conversations with dean mahaffey.
dean mahaffey received the report and recommendations from the review board along with the materials submitted to the board.she had the opportunity to review the audio recording and transcript of the hearing.after completing her review,dean mahaffey determined the board finding berman hit another student with sufficient force to require the other student to go to the hospital warranted more serious sanctions than the board recommended.she thought suspension was appropriate under the circumstances.dean mahaffey consulted with the council of deans and presented both the board findings and the sanctions she recommended.the council of deans agreed suspension was appropriate and fair,as were other sanctions dean mahaffey recommended 
dean mahaffey notified berman he was found responsible for violations of the code.she provided him a copy of the student conduct review report summarizing the board findings and recommended sanctions.the letter then stated,a fter reviewing the student conduct review report,the recommended sanctions,your student conduct record,and the ucsd sanctioning guidelines the council of deans of student affairs have imposed the following sanctions probation through graduation from ucsd attendance at a education and evaluation program regarding substance and alcohol use suspension from june,through march,and no contact with the injured student until june.
berman appealed the suspension to the council of provosts asserting the finding by the board he was responsible for violation of the code was not supported by the evidence at the hearing because he acted in and the sanctions imposed by the council of deans should be reduced to the sanctions recommended by the board.the council of provosts reviewed berman appeal and concluded that a suspension is the appropriate sanction for his violations of the code.the council of provosts also confirmed the other sanctions set forth in dean mahaffey correspondence.
petition for writ of mandate 
berman filed a petition for writ of mandate with the superior court pursuant to code of civil procedure section contending the council of deans exceeded its jurisdiction under the code by reviewing the matter and increasing the recommended sanctions to include suspension without further hearing.the petition also alleged the decision was not supported by the findings and the findings were not supported by the evidence,but berman did not raise this allegation in the motion.
berman sought and obtained an order from the superior court staying his suspension and allowing him to register for and attend classes until january,after the hearing on berman motion for peremptory writ of mandate.all other terms and conditions of the sanctions decision remained in effect.
on december,the superior court denied the petition for writ of mandate concluding the council of deans did not act in excess of its jurisdiction.after analyzing pertinent provisions of the code,the court concluded the code does not bind the student conduct officer to the review board recommendations.if the student conduct officer determined suspension was warranted,there is nothing in the code that prohibits the student conduct officer from presenting this determination to the council of deans for review.in fact,it would be consistent with the code to have such a determination reviewed by the council of deans before imposing suspension as a sanction.some capitalization omitted.the court also determined the code did not require another hearing before the council of deans.
suspension stayed pending appeal 
at berman request,we issued a stay of berman suspension pending resolution of this appeal.berman was permitted to participate in commencement activities in june,but will not receive his degree until the student conduct process has been resolved either by ruling of this court or fulfillment of the
