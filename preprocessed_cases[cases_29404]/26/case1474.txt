carlos,liliana and odalys garau appeal from an order of the superior court reclassifying their case and transferring it to a limited jurisdiction department.on appeal from the reclassification order,appellants also claim error with respect to orders which preceded reclassification,including an order dismissing the seventh cause of action seeking a writ of mandate and an order sustaining respondent,torrance unified school district demurrer to the fifth declaratory relief and sixth injunctive relief causes of action without leave to amend.notwithstanding code of civil procedure section specifies a reclassification order is reviewable on a petition for a writ of mandate,appellants claim the reclassification order here is in effect an appealable final judgment because the transfer to the limited jurisdiction department of the superior court eliminated the right to appellate review of the dismissed causes of action for mandamus and equitable relief.we do not agree.the dismissed causes of action are beyond the appellate review powers of the appellate department of the superior court.nonetheless,upon the timely filing of a petition for a writ of mandate under section,this court would have reviewed the superior court order reclassifying and transferring the case to the limited jurisdiction department,and this court could have considered the superior court actions in dismissing the fifth,sixth and seventh causes of action.moreover,upon entry of a final judgment in the unlimited jurisdiction department as to the dismissed causes of action,appellants could file an immediate appeal.consequently,because the dismissed claims would not have eluded appellate review,we will not deem the reclassification order in this case as an appealable final judgment,and accordingly we dismiss this appeal.
factual and procedural history 
in april of,appellants filed a complaint against respondents,asserting seven causes of action alleging statutory,regulatory and california constitutional violations and seeking damages,an injunction,declaratory relief and mandamus in essence,appellants claimed that in violation of the california constitution free public education and equal protection clauses and various statutes,respondent charged students their parents for numerous services,supplies and activities.
respondent filed a demurrer to the second,third,fourth,fifth and sixth causes of action and moved to strike portions of the complaint.thereafter,on july,the superior court judge fromholz presiding stayed the first through sixth causes of action pending the resolution of the seventh cause of action for mandate in department of the superior court.
on august,judge yaffe presiding in department dismissed the seventh cause of action,concluding appellants lacked standing to pursue the writ.the order of dismissal also noted that the ruling is to remain interlocutory until a final judgment is rendered with respect to the other causes of action in the plaintiffs complaint.
thereafter,the stay was lifted as to the other causes of action and the court considered respondent demurrer.on october,judge fromholz issued an order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second,fourth,fifth and sixth causes of action.with respect to the declaratory fifth cause of action and the injunctive sixth cause of action relief claims,the court concluded that they sought the same relief as the mandamus seventh cause of action claim and were a rehash of the seventh cause of action which had already been adjudicated and dismissed for lack of standing 
on october,appellants filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court in an effort to overturn the dismissal of the seventh cause of action and to reverse the ruling as to the fifth and sixth causes of action.on october,this court summarily denied the petition.
at a case management conference on november,respondent noted that the only remaining issues in controversy involved a claim for approximately.while appellants counsel agreed with that assessment,she also indicated her intent to seek leave to amend the complaint to raise additional issues and remedies concerning claims of wrongdoing by respondent.the court,however,stated that it would not allow an amendment to causes of action to which a demurrer had been sustained without leave to amend.thereafter,the court,sua sponte,stated that given the limited amount in controversy the court would reclassify the case as limited civil jurisdiction and transfer it to the limited jurisdiction department of the superior court.
on december,appellants filed written objections to the order,arguing among other things,the reclassification was improper because they were entitled to amend their complaint to allege new facts or rephrase their legal theories in order to obtain appropriate and necessary relief in this action,namely declaratory relief,judgment,mandamus and injunction.they argued that because those actions and forms of relief could not be pursued in a limited jurisdiction department,the unlimited jurisdiction department was the appropriate forum for their case and the court should not have reclassified the matter.
appellants did not file a petition for a writ of mandate in this court to seek review of the trial court reclassification order.
on december,the case was transferred and reassigned to the limited jurisdiction department.on january,appellants filed a motion to amend and supplement the complaint.in connection with their motion,appellants also requested that the case be reclassified and returned to the unlimited civil jurisdiction department,arguing it had been improperly transferred to the limited jurisdiction department.respondent opposed the motion.on january,appellants filed their reply,requesting that the limited jurisdiction department take the motion to amend off calendar pending the resolution of an appeal in this court of the order reclassifying the case.the limited jurisdiction department granted appellants request and stayed the proceedings.
appellants notice of appeal in this court filed on january,indicates that it is an appeal from 
t he november,order reclassifying this action as a limited civil case,and all other prior orders reviewable thereunder,including,without limitation,the august,order of judge yaffe dismissing the seventh cause of action petition for writ of mandate,and the october,order of judge fromholz partially sustaining defendant demurrer without leave to amend.
this appeal is taken under the authority of daar yellow cab company cal d,which renders the november,reclassification order of judge fromholz an appealable final judgment of the unlimited civil portion of this case,since by severing and transferring the remaining two causes of action of plaintiffs complaint to the limited civil division of the superior court it would otherwise eliminate the right of appeal as to the dismissed causes of action.
on february,respondent filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground the reclassification order was not an appealable order and consequently,this court lacked jurisdiction to consider appellants appeal.appellants opposed the motion.this court subsequently deferred consideration on the motion to dismiss and invited the parties to submit additional arguments and authority on the issue of appealability in connection with the briefs on the merits.
discussion 
appellants urge the court to review the merits of the appeal,arguing the reclassification order should be treated as an appealable final judgment because in transferring the case to the limited jurisdiction department of the superior court the dismissed mandamus and equitable relief claims will otherwise forever evade appellate review.we disagree.as we shall explain,the reclassification order was subject to appellate review through a writ proceeding pursuant to section.appellants could also have requested review of the orders dismissing the mandamus and equitable claims in connection with the section writ proceeding.in our view,nothing about the dismissed claims serves to transmute the reclassification order into a final appealable judgment.
in general,the right to an appeal is entirely statutory unless
