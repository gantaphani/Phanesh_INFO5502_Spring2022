the issue in this case is whether early retirement payments made by the university of pittsburgh the university to its tenured faculty are taxable as wages under the federal insurance contribution act fica.from to,the university paid over million in fica taxes on these payments.in,however,it sought a refund from the internal revenue service irs,on the ground that the early retirement payments were not wages,but instead were buy outs not subject to fica taxes.the irs denied the refund,and the university filed this action in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania.the district court granted the university motion for summary judgment,concluding that the payments were not wages,and denied the government for summary judgment.this appeal followed.
because we agree with the government that the retirement payments are within the act definition of wages we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment,and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the government 
background 
the following facts are not disputed.between and,the university offered five successive early retirement plans the plans to tenured faculty members and administrators,as well as librarians whose contracts provided an expectation of continued employment.payments under all five plans were made monthly,and were based on an employee salary at the time of retirement,as well as length of service to the university.in four of the plans,participation was limited to covered employees with at least ten years of service,between the ages of and years old.in the fifth plan,participation was limited to employees with twelve years of service,who were at least sixty years old,or whose sum of service and years of age equaled at least.to participate,employees were required to execute an irrevocable contract for participation.employees who held tenure were required to relinquish their tenure rights.
pursuant to university policy,tenure constitutes recognition by the university that a person so identified is qualified by achievements and contributions to knowledge as to be ranked among the most worthy of the members of the faculty engaged in scholarly endeavors research,teaching,professional training,or creative intellectual activities of other kinds.
app.at.a faculty member can serve without tenure for a maximum of seven years with some exceptions not relevant here.after seven years,a faculty member can be terminated for failing to meet the requirements for tenure,or be granted tenure at the discretion of the chancellor and the chief executive of the university.
according to the university,tenure fosters an environment of free inquiry because,once conferred,it affords faculty rights and immunities,including immunity from termination except for cause or financial exigency.br.at.the university also may not terminate a tenured faculty member without a hearing that comports with standards of procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment.see bd.of regents roth,d mcdaniels flick,cir.
as noted above,the university paid over million in fica taxes on payments under the plans between and.on november,the university filed claims with the irs for refunds totaling,the total amount of the university fica tax payments since,including portions.employees who participated in the plans consented to have the university seek a refund on their behalf.
on october,the irs denied the refund request,and on october,the university filed this suit in the district court the parties filed for summary judgment,which the court referred to magistrate judge robert mitchell.the magistrate judge recommended granting the university motion with respect to plan payments to tenured employees,but recommended granting the government with respect to plan payments to librarians.
on november,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,granting each party motion for summary judgment in part,and denying each in part.the court entered judgment in favor of the university in the amount of,plus statutory interest.only the government appealed 
ii.legal framework 
wages under fica 
the purpose of fica taxes,as distinct from income taxes,is to fund a national system of social insurance that supports important and extensive social security and medicare health programs.temple united states,cir.fica taxes include a tax to fund,survivors,and disability insurance,and a tax to fund hospital insurance.see.in temple we cited the senate comments explaining the underlying purpose of fica 
the social security program aims to replace the income of beneficiaries when that income is reduced on account of retirement and disability.thus,the amount of wages is the measure used both to define income which should be replaced and to compute fica tax liability.since the security system has objectives which are significantly different from the objective underlying the income tax withholding rules,the committee believes that amounts exempt from income tax withholding should not be exempt from fica unless congress provides an explicit fica tax exclusion.
at quoting,sess,reprinted in.
under the internal revenue code,employers and employees are liable for payment of fica taxes on all wages that are received by an employee with respect to employment.see a b.section a defines wages subject to fica taxes as all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.section b defines employment as any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him.
the supreme court has interpreted the term employment a component of the definition of the very words any service performed for his employer,with the purpose of the social security act in mind import breadth of coverage.see social sec.bd.nierotko.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.nierotko concluded,specifically,that service in the phrase any service performed means not only work actually performed,but also the entire relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.id.at.applying this interpretation,nierotko held that back pay awarded under the national labor relations act to a wrongfully discharged employee had to be taxed as wages under the social security act see id.at.
treasury regulations further provide that t he name by which remuneration for employment is designated is immaterial.a c.thus,for example,salaries,fees,bonuses,and commissions on sales or on insurance premiums,are wages if paid as compensation for employment.id.likewise,the basis upon which the remuneration is paid is immaterial in determining whether the remuneration constitutes wages.id.at a d.for example,it may be paid on the basis of piecework,or a percentage of profits and it may be paid hourly,daily,weekly,monthly,or annually.id.unless remuneration for employment is specifically excepted,it constitutes wages even though at the time paid the relationship of employer and employee no longer exists between the person in whose employ the services were performed and the individual who performed them.id.at a i.
relevant irs revenue rulings 
both parties rely on irs revenue rulings interpreting the code and regulations to support their characterization of the plan payments.we have explained that although revenue rulings are entitled to great deference,courts may disregard them if they conflict with the statute they purport to interpret or its legislative history,or if they are otherwise unreasonable.reese,united states,cir see also united states mead,d the weight accorded to an administrative judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.internal quotation marks omitted.neither party challenges the validity of the applicable revenue rulings,but they dispute which among them is most analogous to this case.
the university relies principally upon revenue ruling.in that ruling an employer and employee entered a employment contract,which both parties agreed to cancel in the second year.see rul.in consideration of the employee relinquishment of his contract had been negotiated at the outset of the employment employer paid the employee a lump sum.id.the irs held that a lump sum payment received by an employee as consideration for the cancellation of his employment contract is not subject to the fica tax.id.the university argues that plan payments were made in consideration for its employees relinquishment of their prospective contract rights and are therefore not wages,like the payments in ruling.
in response,the government points to three subsequent revenue rulings that distinguish and limit the applicability of ruling.first,it cites revenue ruling,which involved a contract providing that the employer could terminate the employee during the term of the contract if it paid the employee an amount equal to six months salary.see rul.the employer terminated the contract before it expired,and paid the required sum under the contract in monthly payments.id.the irs deemed these dismissal payments that were made pursuant to the provisions of the contract rather than as consideration for the relinquishment of property interests and,on this basis,concluded that the payments were wages under fica.id.the irs distinguished ruling as involving consideration for the cancellation of the employment contract,rather than dismissal payments provided for as part of the employment contract.
second,the government cites revenue ruling,in which a railroad employee received a lump sum payment as consideration for relinquishing seniority rights that he earned under his employment contract.see rul.the employee acquired the rights,including the right to security in his employment,based on longevity,but he remained an at will employee.id.the irs determined that the lump sum payment constituted taxable wages,and distinguished ruling 
in the instant case,the employee had acquired his relinquished employment rights through his previous performance of services whereas in rul,the contractual rights relinquished were acquired in the original negotiation of the contract canceled.in rul,the lumpsum payment was primarily in consideration of the cancellation of the employee original contract rights rather than primarily in consideration of the past performance of services through which the relinquished employment rights were acquired.
id.emphasis added.
finally,the government directs our attention to revenue ruling,in which the irs modified and superceded ruling.ruling held that payments to an employee for cancellation of the employment contract and relinquishment of contract rights are wages subject to fica taxes.after reviewing these rulings,in addition to several others,the irs reasoned that 
e mployment encompasses the establishment,maintenance,furtherance,alteration,or cancellation of the relationship or any of the terms and conditions thereof.if the employee provides clear,separate,and adequate consideration for the employer payment that is not dependent upon the relationship and its component terms and conditions,the payment is not wages for purposes of fica 
under the facts presented in this ruling,the employee receives the payment as consideration for canceling the remaining period of his employment contract and relinquishing his contract rights.as such,the payment is part of the compensation the employer pays as remuneration for employment.
id.ruling limited ruling to its facts and to payments made before january.id.
c.the circuit split 
this case presents an issue of first impression in our court.two other courts of appeals have addressed these precise questions,however,and have reached contrary conclusions.the university relies on north dakota state united states,cir,which held that early retirement payments to faculty who were required to relinquish their tenure rights,were not wages under fica.the government relies on appoloni united states,cir which held that early retirement payments made to public school teachers,who relinquished their statutory tenure rights,were wages under fica.
in north dakota state,the eighth circuit determined that a university early retirement payments were made in exchange for the relinquishment of the faculty contractual and tenure rights rather than as remuneration for services to the university.at.after examining the relevant revenue rulings,the court reasoned 
under the terms of north dakota state early retirement program,the tenured faculty received a negotiated amount of money in exchange for their tenure rights.they did not receive what they were entitled to under their contracts,which was continued employment absent fiscal constraints or adequate cause for termination.rather,they gave up those rights,making this case more analogous to revenue ruling than to revenue ruling.
the district court adopted this reasoning,holding that payments made by the university under the retirement plans are not subject to fica taxes because,as in north dakota state,the payments are analogous to rul,in that they were made in exchange for the relinquishment of contractual and tenure rights rather than as remuneration for services to the university.app.at.
subsequent to the district court decision,the sixth circuit declined to follow north dakota state.see appoloni.appoloni summarized its reasoning as follows 
w e find it of great significance that the tenure rights at issue were earned through service to the employer.this is for two reasons.first,we see no reason to differentiate tenure rights from any other right an employee earns through service to any employer c ourts have found the relinquishment of seniority rights,rights to bring suit,and other types of rights in exchange for a severance payment constitute fica wages.secondly,because these rights were earned through service rather than contracted for at the time of employment,this suggests rul.is more on point than rul.
we also want to again emphasize the importance of the school district principal purpose in offering these severance payments.the school district purpose here was not to buy tenure rights.it was to induce those at the highest pay scales to voluntarily retire early.relinquishment of tenure rights was incidental to the acceptance of the severance payment.a school district could not offer an early retirement payment and permit the teacher to keep tenure and remain employed.

iii.analysis 
the weight of authority holds that compensation paid to an employee for services to her employer constitutes wages under fica regardless of whether it is prospective for lost earning potential,or retrospective as a reward for past service for the following reasons,we conclude that the relinquishment of tenure a condition precedent to the not alter the plan payments character as compensation for services,and therefore as wages.
first,the eligibility requirements for payments under the plans are linked to past services at the university,not relinquishment of tenure.as appoloni explained,i n determining whether a payment constitutes wages,courts have looked to eligibility requirements,specifically longevity,as an important factor.at in this case,there is no dispute that eligibility for the plans,for both tenured and plan participants,was based on the employee age and years of service.these requirements link the plan payments to past services for the employer,not the specific rights being relinquished,and weigh heavily in favor of treating the payments as wages 
second,the plans themselves make clear that the payments were viewed as compensation for service to the university.for example,the face of the plan reveals that an important motivation for the plans was to keep the university compensation package competitive with peer universities.see university board of trustees resolution approving implementation of retirement plans,app.at,resolving that plan would be last plan approved because the university does have a favorable retirement plan compared to peer universities.also,the plan states that,in addition to making room for new faculty,the university offered the plan because it deem ed it desirable and appropriate to provide maximum flexibility and opportunities for its faculty members to retire voluntarily prior to the mandatory retirement age.app.at.subsequent plans state a similar desire to reward valued faculty members.
to the extent the payments are a reward for the plans themselves qualify as wages payments for hard work and faithful service arise directly from the relationship and are payments which recognize the value or character of the services performed for the employer.associated electric,at finding manager testimony that early out payments were the right thing to do because t hese people had worked hard,and were good people,indicated payments were reward for past service and therefore wages second alteration in original.
third,even if the university made the payments in part to secure relinquishment of tenure rights,their main purpose was to provide for employees early retirement.in this way,they were indistinguishable from severance payments,which are generally taxed as wages.in this regard,we agree with the sixth circuit statement in appoloni that it 
fail ed to see how this is different from other severance packages just because a tenure right was exchanged.in almost all severance packages an employee gives up something,and we have a hard time distinguishing this case from similar cases where an employee,pursuant to a severance package,gives up rights in exchange.courts have consistently held that severance payments for the relinquishment of rights in the course of an employment relationship are fica wages.in fact,we are at a loss to find a case,other than the eighth circuit decision,to hold otherwise.
at.this reasoning is consistent with numerous cases treating payment for the relinquishment of rights gained over the course of severance packages requiring waiver of all rights to wages 
the university seeks to distinguish these and severance cases on the ground that the employees had at will employment contracts,whereas here,tenure is obligatory for the university,optional with the faculty member.br.at app.at.this distinction misses the point.regardless of whether an employee voluntarily ended the employment relationship,or whether the employee had a due process right to maintain his employment,the rights relinquished were gained through the employee past services to the employer.
in this way,the tenure rights relinquished in this case are most like the seniority rights relinquished in revenue ruling.that ruling drew an important distinction between payments made for relinquishment of contract rights acquired at the negotiation of a contract as in ruling,which are not fica wages,and payments for the relinquishment of rights acquired over the duration of an employment contract as in ruling,which are fica wages.the plan payments here compensate employees for relinquishment of tenure rights acquired through past service,and for this reason are most like the payments in ruling 
fourth,and relatedly,we reject the university suggestion that because tenure is wholly discretionary and affords new rights to the recipient,it is necessarily the start of a new employment relationship,like the contract in revenue ruling.the university policy on appointment and tenure shows that the award is contingent on past performance and is more like a promotion than an entirely new contract 
academic tenure is a status accorded members of the university faculty who have demonstrated high ability and achievement in their dedication to growth of human knowledge.
tenure is intended to assure the university that there will be continuity in its experienced faculty and in the functions for which they are responsible.
promotion to tenured rank constitutes recognition by the university that a person so identified is qualified by achievements and contributions to knowledge as to be ranked among the most worthy of the members of the faculty engaged in scholarly endeavors.
app.at emphasis added the fact that tenure is awarded on a very limited,discretionary basis does not change the fact that it is awarded based on service to the university.in this regard,we agree with appoloni that courts 
must not look simply at what is being relinquished at the point a severance payment is offered,but rather,how the right relinquished was earned.thus,we can not understate the importance of the fact that a teacher earns tenure by successfully completing a probationary period.in other words,a teacher does not obtain tenure at the onset of employment it is a right that is earned like any other job benefit.admittedly,the grant of this right is guaranteed and protected by statute.but we fail to see how the fact that this right is protected by statute takes away from the point that it still must be earned through services to the employer.
at citations omitted emphasis added 
in sum,because tenure is a form of compensation for past services to the university,payments offered as a substitute for tenure are compensation and therefore taxable as wages.see a w ages includes all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.appoloni,at tenure rights were previously paid in now are being paid in cash.csx.at pursuant to a the value of the benefits and protections that each employee held in his or her to vacation pay,sick pay,layoff pay,and part of the employee total compensation package and,hence,constituted wages.therefore,when these benefits are relinquished in favor of a payment,the transaction simply amounts to a redemption,paid in cash,of wage amounts previously paid in kind w hat were wages at the start remain wages at the end.
iv.conclusion 
the record in this case shows that payments under the plans were primarily in consideration for employees past service to the university.relinquishment of tenure rights,while a condition precedent to the payments,was not the primary consideration that employees offered.the payments therefore qualify as wages subject to fica taxation.accordingly,we will vacate the district court entry of summary judgment in favor the university,and remand to the district court for entry of summary judgment in favor of the government.
this case presents the question whether retirement payments the university of pittsburgh university made to former tenured faculty members were wages subject to fica tax.although the matter is not free from doubt,i would hold the payments were not wages because they were given primarily in exchange for the faculty members relinquishment of tenure,which is a property interest in continued employment absent cause or financial exigency.see north dakota state united states,cir.
the problem of defining wages in this case presents a contrast between two possible concepts of faculty tenure at the university.is tenure,as the government contends,analogous to seniority rights and other benefits earned in the course of employment or,as the university argues,does tenure mark the beginning of a new employment relationship distinct from prior service according to the first view,the payments at issue here were remuneration for employment and were subject to fica tax.according to the second view,the payments were not remuneration for employment,because they were given primarily in exchange for the relinquishment of property rights the faculty received at the beginning of the tenured relationship.the district court,following north dakota,agreed with the university.the majority reverses and adopts the government view.i would affirm and follow north dakota.
i would hold the payments made in exchange for the relinquishment of tenure by the university faculty members were not subject to taxation under the federal insurance contribution act fica because they were not wages as that term is defined at a.
the internal revenue code requires employers and employees to pay taxes under fica on all wages an employee receives with respect to employment.a b.wages means all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.id.a.employment is any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person empl
