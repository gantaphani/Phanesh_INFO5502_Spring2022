anna darchak is a polish bilingual teacher whose contract with the chicago public schools was not renewed after a tumultuous school year.darchak claims that she lost her job because she complained that the school principal was violating the no child left behind act.she says the principal hostility also stemmed from her animosity toward people of polish descent.darchak filed this lawsuit against the city of chicago board of education board,alleging,inter alia,retaliatory discharge,first amendment retaliation and national origin discrimination.the board offers several explanations for not renewing darchak contract insubordination,ineffective classroom management and refusal to follow a teaching schedule.yet darchak also offers evidence of discrimination.
the district court granted the board motion for summary judgment.we affirm the dismissal of darchak retaliatory discharge and first amendment retaliation claims.however,because she has put forth sufficient evidence of discrimination to reach a jury,we reverse on her national origin discrimination claim.
anna darchak moved to the united states from poland in.three years later,she began working for the chicago public school system cps at taft high school,where she taught in the bilingual and english as a second language esl program.she resigned from her post at taft in and took a job with the cps office of language and cultural education olce.
at the beginning of the school year,darchak began providing esl support to english language at cps schools whose native language was not english.one of these schools was the princeton alternative center,an elementary school in chicago.by february,darchak was working at princeton five days a week as an esl and teacher.at that time,most of the students enrolled at princeton were hispanic there were also and polish students.
princeton principal rosalva acevedo hired darchak as a teacher for the school year in anticipation of an increase in students.darchak status in this new job was that of a probationary appointed teacher,and she had a contract,renewable at the end of the school year.her position was funded by olce and was dependent on the number of english language learners at princeton.
darchak claims that within the first month of her employment at princeton,she noticed that the hispanic students were receiving better treatment than the polish students hispanic students were given better resources and native language services.when darchak approached acevedo with her concerns,acevedo allegedly responded,hispanic students are better than polish and deserve more than polish people i f you do want to do whatever i tell you to do,you can leave my school.at the time,darchak did not tell anyone about acevedo remarks.then,in early november,acevedo gave darchak a cautionary notice charging her with insubordination for refusing to follow the esl teaching schedule.when darchak confronted acevedo about the notice,acevedo allegedly replied,i brought you to this school and you stupid polack pushed the teachers against me.
darchak immediately began complaining to acevedo supervisors in meetings and letters about what she perceived as acevedo mismanagement of the school.in none of this communication,however,did she mention acevedo disparaging remarks about darchak national origin.though not at issue on appeal,darchak also claims that,as a result of acevedo discrimination,she sought treatment for depression and anxiety beginning in november.
in march,a teaching position opened in room,a classroom with a number of english language learners,most of whom were native spanish speakers.acevedo checked with the cps accountability department to determine whether darchak was qualified to temporarily teach the students in room.after confirming darchak qualifications,acevedo assigned her to the classroom on a temporary basis.
darchak felt that her assignment to room violated the federal no child left behind act because she was not qualified to teach in a bilingual spanish classroom.she repeatedly expressed this concern to acevedo and to acevedo supervisors.on march,darchak received a second cautionary notice,which said that she had been discourteous and negligent in supervising her students.this notice was followed by a negative performance evaluation,which stated that darchak had difficulty following rules,interacting with students,and getting along with other school community members.
acevedo had received word in february that funding for darchak position would not be available from olce for the following school year because of declining enrollment.in,the board asked acevedo which probationary appointed teacher contracts she wanted to renew for the next school year.despite the cut in funding,acevedo chose to renew the contracts of several probationary teachers,including that of another polish teacher.acevedo could have renewed darchak contract with funding from princeton discretionary budget acevedo did not recommend renewing darchak contract,and the board accepted acevedo recommendation.in april darchak took a leave of absence that she attributed to stress.she never returned to princeton.darchak was officially terminated on august.
darchak filed this lawsuit in january,naming the board as the sole defendant.darchak complaint alleged retaliatory discharge,a common law tort under illinois law retaliation for exercising her first amendment rights in violation of national origin discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,and disability discrimination in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada.the district court granted summary judgment for the board.darchak appeals her retaliatory discharge,first amendment retaliation and national origin discrimination claims she does not challenge the dismissal of her ada claim,and therefore we do not disturb that ruling.
to begin,darchak claims that the board refused to renew her teaching contract in retaliation for her complaints that her teaching assignment in room violated the federal no child left behind act.this claim is styled as an illinois retaliatory discharge claim,cognizable here under our supplemental jurisdiction.a.
to establish a retaliatory discharge,darchak must demonstrate that she was discharged in retaliation for her activities and that the discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy.blount stroud,citations omitted.darchak claim fails the first and third of these requirements.
first,illinois courts evaluating retaliatory discharge claims have refused to recognize a claim in any injury short of actual discharge.bajalo northwestern,d.actual discharge means termination of an whose employment has a nonspecific duration that can be terminated for any nonrenewal of a employment contract.krum chi.league ball club,d.indeed,illinois appellate courts have expressly refused to extend the reach of the retaliatory discharge tort to cover the nonrenewal of a contract.id.at see also bajalo,at darchak had a fixed,contract with the school district.it is therefore highly unlikely that the illinois supreme court would permit her to bring a retaliatory discharge claim.
yet darchak retaliatory discharge claim fails in any event because the nonrenewal of her contract did not violate a clear mandate of public policy.although what counts as a clearly mandated public policy is not precisely defined,see,palmateer int l harvester,carty suter,d,the tort has been narrowly construed in illinois to include only discharges in retaliation for certain activities,such as reporting an employer criminal violations,palmateer,at,or violations of health and safety standards,wheeler caterpillar tractor.see also kelsay motorola.the illinois supreme court has defined public policy only within these limited bounds and thus has consistently sought to restrict the common law tort of retaliatory discharge.fisher lexington health care,citing buckner atlantic plant maintenance.
the public policy that darchak cites is found in the general purpose declaration of the no child left behind act that all children have a fair,equal,and significant opportunity to obtain a education.darchak maintains that the polish students at princeton
