a small dental implant company that had net profits of in has sued a university for breach of a contract for the university to clinically test a new implant the company had patented.the company seeks damages for lost profits beginning in,ranging from million to over billion.it claims that,but for the university breach of the contract,the company would have become a worldwide leader in the dental implant industry and made many millions of dollars a year in profit.following an evidentiary hearing,the trial court excluded as speculative the proffered testimony of an expert to this effect.we must determine whether the court erred in doing so.
we conclude that the trial court has the duty to act as a gatekeeper to exclude speculative expert testimony.lost profits need not be proven with mathematical precision,but they must also not be unduly speculative.here,the court acted within its discretion when it excluded opinion testimony that the company would have become extraordinarily successful had the university completed the clinical testing.
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,which had held the trial court erred in excluding the testimony.
factual and procedural history 
because neither party petitioned the court of appeal for rehearing,much of this summary of the factual and procedural history is taken from that court majority opinion.see richmond shasta community services dist.cal th,d,cal.rules of court,rule c.
a.the lawsuit and first appeal 
in,plaintiff sargon enterprises,sargon patented a dental implant that its president and chief executive officer,sargon lazarof,had developed.the united states food and drug administration approved the implant,which meant it could be sold and used in the united states.as the court of appeal opinion described it,sargon implant could be implanted immediately following an extraction and contained both the implant and full restoration.in the,the standard implant was the branemark implant developed at the university of gothenburg in sweden.the branemark implant required several steps.first,surgery would place the implant in a healed extraction socket in the patient mouth a second surgery would inspect the implant to see if it had properly integrated with the bone a process known as osseointegration last,a crown would be placed on the implant.sargon implant was a one stage implant it expanded immediately into the bone socket with an expanding screw this mechanism permitted the implant to be loaded with a crown the same day.
in,sargon contracted with defendant university of southern california usc for the usc school of dentistry to conduct a clinical study of the implant.in may,sargon sued usc and faculty members of its dental school involved in the study,alleging breach of contract and other causes of action.usc for breach of contract.all of sargon claims except the breach of contract claim against usc were eliminated by demurrer or summary judgment.in,the contract action was tried before a jury.before trial,at an in limine hearing,the trial court excluded evidence of sargon lost profits on the ground usc could not have foreseen them.
the evidence presented at trial showed that after initial success in the clinical trials,usc failed to present proper reports as its contract with sargon required.the jury found that usc had breached the contract and awarded sargon in compensatory damages.it also found in sargon favor on usc for breach of contract.
sargon appealed.the court of appeal reversed the judgment,holding that the trial court had erred in excluding evidence of sargon lost profits on the ground of foreseeability it also stated,given that the in limine hearings focused on foreseeability and not the amount of lost profit damages,it is premature to determine whether such damages can be calculated with reasonable certainty.sargon enterprises,university of southern california,nonpub.opn.
on remand,the case proceeded to retrial on the breach of contract claim.usc moved to exclude as speculative the proffered opinion testimony of one of sargon experts,james skorheim.the court presided over an evidentiary hearing at which skorheim was the primary witness.
b.the evidentiary hearing 
skorheim testified that he was a certified public accountant and an attorney.he had been an accountant for years and work ed as a business and industry analyst and forensic accountant.as the court of appeal summarized,he testified that sargon lost profits ranged from million to billion.in preparing his opinion,skorheim reviewed litigation materials including deposition transcripts and reports of usc damages experts,financial information from sargon and its competitors including annual reports,and market analyses of the global dental implant market prepared by millennium research group millennium.skorheim based his opinion on a market share approach,by which he determined what share of the worldwide dental implant market sargon would have gained had usc completed a favorable clinical study,and he calculated future profits based on that market share.skorheim used the market share approach to lost profit damages because the methodology had been used in complicated patent cases,antitrust cases,and unfair competition cases.
the court of appeal summarized skorheim testimony about the dental implant industry nobel biocare branemark implant was the pioneer implant developed in the and and required two surgeries.straumann developed the second generation implant,which was placed in the bone without being submerged in the gum.in the early,there was very little penetration into the potential dental implant market.out of millions of potential patients,only about percent of this potential market was receiving product,presenting an opportunity for tremendous growth.in the late,the market began to grow dramatically.industry reports demonstrated the global market was expected to grow during the period to at an annualized rate of percent.at the time,the market craved technological innovation aimed at shortening healing time,cost,and treatment time.millennium predicted that sales of immediate load implants would grow at compound annual rates of percent during to,and percent from to.further,millennium reported in,immediate loading implants represented only a niche market because demand was limited by industry acceptance.by,immediate load implants would account for percent of the united states market,up from percent in.
sargon innovation lay in the use of an immediate load implant,the holy grail of dental implantology,which was directed at the market need for ease of use,shortened healing times,and overall cost.given the state of the implant market at the time,in skorheim opinion an innovator such as sargon would have rapidly commanded a significant market share with the exception of nobel biocare,all of the other major implant makers are recent arrivals on the scene.
in skorheim opinion,three key market drivers operate in the dental implant industry innovation,clinical studies,and outreach to general practitioners.a company must have all three to be successful.skorheim had testified,the court of appeal stated,that t he value of a clinical study to an implant maker is it establishes the efficacy of the device and permits entry into the universities where students can be taught to use the device,with the expectation that,upon graduation,they will use the product in their practices.he believed that clinical success of the sargon implant would likely lead to commercial success.skorheim also had testified that because virtually every dental implant company employed clinical studies and general practitioner outreach,innovation really determined market success and what market share a company would achieve.he had explained,the greater the technological achievement in the product mix,the greater the likelihood for revenues.in skorheim opinion,innovation was a necessary prerequisite to achieving market success.f irst and foremost,you have to have the technological innovation and the efficacy.
as the court of appeal observed,skorheim market share approach was based upon a comparison of sargon to six other large,multinational dental implant companies that were the dominant market leaders in the industry,and which controlled in excess of percent of global sales big six nobel biocare,straumann,biomet,zimmer,dentsply,and astra tech.although there are approximately companies worldwide that make dental implants,skorheim believed the big six were the top innovators based upon his analysis of the millennium report and market intelligence.skorheim had described the smaller companies as copycats and price cutters that competed on the basis of price and were not innovative he believed that the top six are innovators and the rest are copycats.the court of appeal stated on,skorheim acknowledged that millennium report did not state the big six were the most innovative rather,it was an inference he drew from reviewing the report and the size and success of the companies in comparison to other,smaller companies.
skorheim had acknowledged that many of the smaller companies claimed to be innovative,but he believed in fact they were not.when the trial court noted that the millennium report mentioned other companies that claimed to be innovative,skorheim had responded,and i would say that the proof is in the pudding.and the proof is their ability to track the market share and they have been able to do that.when asked whether he agreed that the company with the largest market share is not necessarily the most innovative,skorheim had answered,i do think i can agree with that.i mean,ultimately,the markets determine what innovative and what not innovative.these markets reward innovativeness and so the market really makes a determination of which of these companies is more innovative than not by the extent to which they reward them with purchasing their products,and so forth.skorheim had acknowledged that the millennium report did not specifically indicate that some of the smaller companies were not innovative,but explained that this was because those companies are not big enough to be even addressed in the global market,so there nothing specific.
skorheim believed that sargon was innovative,like the big six,and not a copycat or price cutter,like the other small companies.he acknowledged that sargon was a very small company whose annual profits peaked in at around and,unlike the big companies,it had no meaningful marketing or research and development organization and no parent company to assist it.but he believed these factors were merely incidental to innovation and played little role in achieving market share.accordingly,and because innovation is the key factor driving market success,skorheim had compared sargon to the big six rather than to the smaller companies in computing lost profits.he considered the big six and sargon to be comparable companies.
skorheim had testified that assuming the jury finds the new implant was a superior innovative revolutionary product and based upon everything else i see in the materials here,i think that sargon had a very good chance of becoming the market leader over a period of time.i estimated maybe a year period of time.indeed,he believed to a reasonable certainty that within years or so sargon would have become a market leader.he also believed it likely that one of the big six would have dropped out of the leadership,and that sargon would have replaced that company as a world leader.
when the trial court asked whether it mattered that some of the big companies had many different products,skorheim had responded that sargon would have to remain competitive by investing significant amounts of money in research and development like the other major manufacturers.each of them are investing tens of millions of dollars a year into research and development to remain strong and technologically sound.he was confident that a company like sargon would have been able to expend the necessary resources to develop other products over time,that they would be able to use their patented expandable root process with other types of coatings,let say,or shapes or sizes.he thought sargon ability to do so distinguished it from the other small companies.
the court of appeal stated skorheim outlined similarities and differences between the big six and sargon first,they all manufactured titanium implants,and the implants were,or immediate load sargon only second,all used clinical studies third,all used outreach to general practitioners fourth,pricing was substantially the same fifth,their qualitative and quantitative cost structures were the same and the implants were manufactured either or pursuant to a contract with a third party.qualitative cost structure consisted of cost of goods sold,research and development costs r d,sales and marketing costs,and general administrative costs.sargon did not have a meaningful r d organization or a sales and marketing department.in all other respects,sargon costs were similar to the big six.skorheim had acknowledged,however,that he could not think of any objective business metric whether it sales,number of employees,number of distributers,anything by which sargon was comparable to,for example,astra tech,the member of the big six with the smallest market share.
the court of appeal opinion provided a chart summarizing skorheim testimony regarding sargon and its competitors for the relevant time period,approximately.we reproduce it here 
the dental implant business was only part of astrazeneca company.skorheim testified that astra tech,its dental implant division,had sales in of million.
for the reasons he gave,skorheim believed that sargon,unlike any of the other smaller companies,would,over time,have become a market leader,one of the big six.in calculating sargon lost profits,he had not considered profits sargon had ever actually realized,but instead considered the market leaders profits.he believed that sargon profits would have increased over time until they reached the level of one of the market leaders.he testified,however,that in one respect he had taken into account sargon actual income he had started with sargon gross revenues not net income in,the year usc should have produced an interim report,which were around million to million and constituted approximately one half of percent of the total global market.he then doubled that number based on his belief that,had the initial report from the clinical study been favorable and had other potentially favorable publicity followed,sargon would have sold approximately implants each to approximately additional dentists.this would have brought sargon market share for that year to about percent.skorheim believed that beginning in,sargon market share would have ramp ed up over the years from this percent to a share that a comparable member of the big six enjoyed.he had calculated the lost profits based on sales in of over million and a subsequent increase each year until sargon reached the level of one of the big six.
skorheim claimed no expertise regarding how innovative sargon dental implant was,although he had testified that the immediate loading of implants is kind of the holy grail of dental implantology.he said the jury would have to wrestle with the question of how innovative sargon was.because of this lack of expertise,skorheim could not give a single sum of lost profits.rather,in skorheim opinion,the amount would depend on how innovative the jury found sargon to be,compared to the market leaders.
as the court of appeal explained,skorheim damages model created four alternative damage scenarios based upon the jury determination of the innovativeness of the implant.as a predicate,skorheim had ranked the innovativeness of the comparator companies and established a hierarchy.if the jury concluded sargon level of innovation was equal to the least innovative of the benchmark companies,astra tech,sargon would have attained a percent share if the jury concluded sargon level of innovation was equal to one of the lesser innovators of the benchmark companies,like dentsply,sargon would have attained a percent market share if the jury concluded sargon level of innovation was equal to a innovator,like biomet,sargon would have attained a percent share and if the jury concluded sargon level of innovation was that of the most innovative companies,nobel biocare and straumann,sargon would have attained a percent market share.in establishing this hierarchy,skorheim had assumed that the higher the market share a company had obtained,the more innovative it was.he also agreed,however,that it was possible,for example,that astra tech,with its smaller market share,was more innovative than biomet,which had a greater market share.
for each of these four scenarios,skorheim had calculated lost profits from to,then added what he calculated to be post lost profits.skorheim believed that sargon net profits,which in actuality peaked at in,would have grown to million per year in under the least profitable of the scenarios,and to million per year in under the most profitable of the scenarios.
the court of appeal opinion provided a chart summarizing skorheim lost profits calculations.we reproduce it here 
thus,skorheim had projected total lost profits of million if the jury found sargon innovation was comparable to that of the least innovative market leaders,making what he described as a meaningful contribution to innovation of million if the jury found sargon innovation was somewhat greater of million if the jury found sargon innovation was somewhat greater yet and of billion if the jury found sargon innovation was comparable to that of the market leaders,making what he described as revolutionary industry changing technology.
the court of appeal summarized the testimony of the other witnesses at the evidentiary hearing.lazarof confirmed skorheim conclusion that innovation coupled with clinical studies was the driver of market share.sargon also presented the testimony of steven hanson,president from to of calcitek,a successful implant company,who testified sargon could have commanded a to percent share of the market if the usc study had been completed,although he had not done a market study or considered the probability of all of the other steps necessary to get sargon a to percent market share.robert pendry was at straumann from to and at thommen medical from to,and testified that in his opinion the sargon implant was absolutely revolutionary and world changing when introduced in to.in pendry words,the sargon implant was the most exciting thing i heard in the implant business ever.
c.the trial court ruling 
following the evidentiary hearing,the court issued a page written ruling on usc motion to exclude skorheim testimony.
the court began by quoting an opinion by judge friendly of the second circuit court of appeals stressing the need to protect juries from an array of figures conveying a delusive impression of exactness in an area where a jury common sense is less available than usual to protect it.herman schwabe,united shoe machinery cir.the court found it unreasonable for skorheim,or any such expert,to rely on much of the data which forms the basis of his opinions,because no data bears any resemblance to plaintiff historical profits or to those of any similar business.skorheim opinion leaves the determination of up to a billion dollars of lost profit damages to pure speculation.
the court assumed for purposes of its ruling that a market share analysis is appropriate and warranted under california law,but it found that skorheim market share opinion is not based on any actual historical financial results or comparisons to similar companies and,therefore,is not based on matter of a type on which an expert may reasonably rely.the fatal flaw in skorheim reasoning is that it starts off assuming,without foundation,its conclusion.the fatal flaw in his analysis is that he relies on data that in no way is analogous to plaintiff.skorheim deems plaintiff historical data,such as past business volume,not relevant to his lost profits projections.
the court noted that at the evidentiary hearing,skorheim had offered a new opinion that would have been grounded in some historical performance.it explained that it had sustained usc objection to this new opinion on grounds it was never disclosed in discovery.this court notes that this new methodology is directly inconsistent with skorheim declaration,depositions testimony and the position plaintiff has taken throughout this litigation regardless,the methodology of the new opinion is unreasonable.later in the evidentiary hearing,plaintiff again attempted to show some historical grounding for the damage projections.skorheim testified that his damage projections started with sargon gross revenues of in.skorheim then doubled those revenues in to accomplish this,skorheim assumed a favorable usc study and resultant publicity would cause more dentists to buy at least more implants each.the court can find no factual basis for this assumption.this court specifically finds that sargon historical performance played no role in determining skorheim market projections,except to the extent that sargon data showed it had some sales.
the court found that skorheim projections are wildly beyond,by degrees of magnitude,anything sargon had ever experienced in the past.under the market share scenario,for example,plaintiff would see its profits climb by the first year,and by over by.instead,the court found,skorheim starts his analysis with a comparison to industry leaders,all or international corporations,or subsidiaries of such.this,of course,is unavoidable if one only looks to industry drivers to ascertain who most successfully employs those drivers.the only thing these established companies have in common with plaintiff is that they all sell or make dental implants.in all other respects,in areas the millennium report deems relevant,such as size,history,product line,sales force,access to financing,among others,they are worlds apart from sargon.
the court noted that skorheim had testified that of all the dental implant manufacturers,he could not identify one that did not pursue clinical studies or target general practitioners,rendering these two drivers meaningless for comparison purposes.moreover,many implant companies who touted innovative products,yet had smaller revenues,were omitted for comparison purposes.in his testimony,skorheim grouped the companies that he deemed had innovative products.he omitted certain smaller companies who,according to the millennium report,also claimed to have innovations.when asked in court to explain this omission,he testified,the proof is in the pudding.the small market share of these companies showed the market disagreed.apparently,a product is innovative if the market embraces it and it sells.the summary exclusion of other companies from his analysis,along with the fact that it should not be a startling revelation that biotechnology companies that have innovative products,all other things being equal,do better than those who do not,render this driver equally meaningless for comparison purposes.the court found this argument to be entirely circular.
the court continued at the hearing,plaintiff changed its theory and attempted to show that it was similar to the industry leaders in ways other than possession of the three drivers.the characteristics that skorheim contended made plaintiff similar to the industry leaders,however,were characteristics common to most,if not all,implant companies.obviously,if most share these common traits,the traits are meaningless for comparison purposes.if,based upon these common characteristics,the very smallest is considered similar to the very biggest,all cases that have required objective similarity would be effectively overruled,and the rule requiring similarity would cease to exist.this court finds that sargon is not similar to the industry leaders by any relevant,objective business measure.
the court found that the dissimilarity between sargon and the industry leaders is sufficient,itself,to grant defendant motion to exclude skorheim testimony,but this court has other problems with skorheim opinion that give further grounds,by themselves,to grant defendant motion.it found that c omparing degrees of innovation with other products fails to give the jury standards from which it can make a rational decision,is inherently speculative and subjective,and thus fails to assist the jury in its function.the relevance of skorheim testimony,if any,is that it provides the jury with an evidentiary basis to make market share choices and thus assess damages.the jury can choose from four market shares ranging from to,depending upon its finding of relative innovativeness.the highest rating gets nobel biocare share,with the lesser market share percentages awarded depending upon whether the innovativeness of the plaintiff implant is more on a par with products from zimmer,and straumann.the lowest percentage finding the jury can make is that the innovativeness of the sargon implant is comparable to astra tech or dentsply products.the fatal problem with this is that there is little rational basis for this choice,and no rational standards for how the jury is to choose.
implicit in this choice is that there is an evidentiary basis for this ranking an innovativeness pecking order where,in fact,nobel biocare is on top,others follow,with astra tech and dentsply on the bottom.likewise,there must be an evidentiary basis for degree of difference evidence that shows not only that nobel biocare is more innovative,but,with of the market,it must be twice as innovative as,in the group,and so on.otherwise,innovativeness would not track the percentage market share for the findings he proposes the jury make.yet,the only factual basis for such a pecking order comes from lazarof opinion of such,and there is no evidence or reason to believe one company is more innovative than another,in the percentage difference,other than the fact the companies have different market shares.the only possible evidentiary support for the percentage difference in the pecking order comes from skorheim oft repeated observations of the marketplace.certain smaller companies,who claimed to have innovative products,were excluded from his industry leader market share list because the market disagreed with their claim of innovativeness.the proof is in the pudding,skorheim explained.if their products were truly innovative,they would sell more and thus have larger market shares.to the extent that this ranking of innovativeness,with nobel biocare on top with,and astra tech on the bottom with,rests on the fact that some have larger market shares,it rests on nothing more than a tautology.as there is no evidentiary basis that equates the degree of innovativeness with the degree of difference in market share,the question posed to the jury to rank innovativeness and assign a market share,the sine qua non of skorheim opinion has no rational basis.
additionally,the court continued,t he only rational answer to the question skorheim seeks to have the jury answer comparing innovativeness is it depends.what is most innovative about any implant depends upon what the practitioner and patient think is important.what is good,better or best is inherently subjective,and depends upon the need,the patient,the price,and the situation.it is not that the jury,given the time confines of a trial,will not have enough information to decide relative innovativeness,it is that no jury,given an infinite amount of time,will ever have enough information.such is the nature of purely subjective determinations.which is the most innovative implant the court expects there to be experts giving their views,but do we have any standards or guidelines to help us in the determination 
the court explained that in the millennium reports there are many different types of implants.the market leaders have product lines of implants to serve the diverse needs of patients and practitioners.some implants have different coating screws.some are immediate loading,some are loading,others have internal or external connections.astra tech markets an implant that it claims has amassed significant documentation that confirms the increased bone retention right up to the top of the implant compared to competitive products.another astra tech implant is touted as simple and easier to use.citation.others are more affordable such as innova life sciences and imtec.citation.each company offers a line of implant products it claims are excellent for various uses.is the sargon implant as good or better than those offered by competitors plaintiff will advocate for the sargon implant.who will advocate for all the rest 
the court explained why,in its view,skorheim opinion was speculative.a jury can determine if a ford was defective,because there are objective facts,such as industry standards and standards for safety,as well as a body of case law on the subject of products liability.a jury can not say if a ford is a better car than a chevrolet,because that is subjective and depends upon what the driver wants and what he can afford,among other things.
by way of example,assume that miss oklahoma entered into a contract to transport her to the miss america contest.assume further that the carrier breached the contract and miss oklahoma missed the chance to compete.a jury could decide if she was damaged by the breach,to the extent damages could be ascertained.could the jury go further and,based upon testimony of experts,decide that,had she been allowed to compete,she would have defeated miss colorado for the title of miss america,or decide that she would have been second,behind miss colorado and ahead of miss montana it is not a situation that juries can and do decide complex issues.of course they do.but in all cases,including cases where jurors are asked to rank,as in comparative fault,there are standards in the form of jury instructions and a body of case law to refer to if needed for special instructions.
the court believed that asking a jury to rank innovativeness is no different than deciding whether miss oklahoma or miss colorado should wear the miss america crown.skorheim question calls for nothing but a subjective and speculative response.whether an implant is good,better or best can only be answered in the market place,not the jury room.the market place has rendered its verdict it depends.that is why all the various implant companies,even the very biggest,and their implants have their own market niche with corresponding minority market shares.because there are no standards or guidelines to determine degrees of innovation,it relegates the question of determining potentially more than a billion dollars in damages to pure speculation.accordingly,the court finds that there are two independent grounds to rule this evidence inadmissible no damage award can be based on speculation and evidence that can not assist the trier of fact in the resolution of an issue is not relevant.
the court continued skorheim has no qualifications to opine that but for defendant breach,plaintiff would have a program of targeting general practitioners on a par with any of the companies he singled out for comparison.the millennium report sets forth sales and marketing strategies for the industry leaders.for example,nobel biocare in the timeframe had field representatives in the united states alone.what makes skorheim think that plaintiff would equal or surpass these numbers,or done so with equal or greater success the only information he can offer is the uncritical acceptance of lazarof marketing plans.whether these plans would ever have been implemented as anticipated,or succeeded,is pure speculation.
skorheim testified that,in the perfect world where there had been no breach,by sargon would have made the seamless transition from a operation to sharing industry leadership with nobel biocare,a dollar international corporation.nobel biocare touts,according to the annual reports he relied upon,many different product lines,including different types of implants.when asked how sargon could be an industry leader with only one implant he later testified that sargon had developed seven skorheim testified that he would expect sargon to have invested in r and in the intervening years and also,by,to have invented new products and coatings.skorheim thus opined that not only would sargon have invested in r and by,but has also opined on what the results of that r and would be.it is not reasonable for any expert to make such a prediction so absolutely devoid of any factual basis about an industry where he has no expertise.
additionally,nowhere in skorheim success scenario is any mention of how competitors will react to having their market share taken by plaintiff we do not know if these million or billion dollar corporations,or their shareholders,would just go quietly,because it is not discussed or considered.we are forced to assume they would do nothing.this field of dreams trust me analysis forces us to assume,speculate and believe too much.it is no different than our miss oklahoma asking the jury to vote her miss america and arguing that her damages include the inevitable movie deals and product endorsements that common sense dictates every miss america receives and were lost because her transportation breached the contract to take her to the contest.
in its concluding portion,the court stated that case law demands that to establish such lost profits through expert testimony,the expert must base opinion on either historical performance of the company or a comparison to the profits of companies similar in terms of size,locality,sales,products,number of employees and other relevant financial factors.a party is not permitted to make up its own factors as a basis for comparison and invite the jury to decide whether the corporations are similar.to allow this is to invite proceedings where there are no objective standards as there will always be some way to argue that companies are similar,no matter how superficial or irrelevant.here,for example,the factors skorheim uses would lead to the absurd result that sargon,one of the industry smallest companies,was similar to the largest.in assessing lost profit damages in this context,there is a meaningful difference between biggest and smallest.skorheim admittedly shunned historical performance and comparison to companies of similar size and financial situation,choosing instead to compare plaintiff to industry giants based upon his own criteria of similar.his criteria,even assuming he has the qualifications to decide them,which he does not,are nebulous and legally irrelevant under case law.accordingly,there is no issue of similarity to give to the jury to compare and decide.
the court concluded that skorheim opinions are not based upon matters upon which a reasonable expert would rely,and do not show the nature and occurrence of lost profits with evidence of reasonable reliability,because his opinion is not based on any historical data from plaintiff or a comparison to similar businesses.the court also finds his market drivers meaningless for comparison purposes.additionally,his opinion rests on speculation and unreasonable assumptions.
accordingly,the court granted usc motion to exclude skorheim testimony.
d.the second appeal 
after the court excluded skorheim testimony,the parties stipulated to entry of judgment for on sargon breach of contract claim.sargon appealed for the second time.
by a vote,the court of appeal reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for a new trial on lost profits.it concluded the trial court erred in excluding skorheim testimony.
after reviewing in detail the facts,the parties arguments,and the relevant law,the court found that sargon has the better argument here in,sargon had about million in revenues,roughly of percent of the global market for dental implants.astra tech,one of the companies relied on by skorheim,had around million in revenues,for a percent market share.the other companies had greater revenues and market shares.at the very least,the jury was entitled to hear about astra tech because it was sufficiently similar to sargon,and a damages award based on a comparison to that company would have been supported by substantial evidence,not speculation.
we acknowledge the difficulty in determining lost profits when an established business is built upon the sale of an innovative,revolutionary,or product.the factor of innovation what the trial court described as a beauty contest is not easily converted into dollars and cents.but exactitude is not required.none of sargon competitors used its implant,and,to that extent,they were different.but lost profits may be based on a comparison of similar companies they need not be identical in all respects.skorheim expert opinion was based on economic and financial data,market surveys and analyses,business records of similar enterprises,and the like.kids universe th.he also considered sargon historical financial data.the trial court ruling is tantamount to a flat prohibition on lost profits in any case involving a revolutionary breakthrough in an industry.
if usc had not sabotaged the clinical study of the sargon implant,sargon would have had a successful clinical trial to its credit and a prominent university using the implant at its dental school.but it was denied.through its wrongful conduct,usc allegedly caused the loss of profits and has made the proof of lost profits all the more difficult,thereby rendering its evidentiary attack unconvincing.ghk associates mayer group,d.we have carefully reviewed the trial court criticisms of skorheim proffered testimony and conclude they were better left for the jury assessment.
justice johnson dissented.he argued that w here,as here,the law does not offer precise parameters to the quantum of proof required to establish lost profit damages,a trial court must be permitted to draw the line in the sand,either letting the evidence in as meeting the certainty threshold,or excluding it as below that threshold.the placement of that threshold is left to the trial court so long as it is within the bounds of the law.he found the trial court decision to be founded on a detailed,methodical and examination of the law of contracts and the limits on lost profits damages t he task of determining the threshold measure of certainty to permit skorheim opinion to go to the jury should be left to the gatekeeping function of the trial court,in the context of its evidentiary rulings after an evaluation of all of the facts,evidence,and arguments.here,the trial court drew a very reasonable line in the sand with its ruling excluding sargon evidence of lost profit damages.i see no justification for this court to overturn that decision.
the dissent argued that sargon was not similar to the big six under any relevant,objective business measure and found nothing in this ruling that indicates the trial court acted in an arbitrary,capricious fashion,was guided by whim rather than the rule of law,or exceeded the bounds of reason.justice johnson added that while i admittedly share with the trial court a healthy dose of skepticism over skorheim unyieldingly optimistic projections for sargon market share growth and while i struggle to see a nexus between those projections and business and economic reality,this dissent nonetheless does not stem from the havoc that skorheim methodology may wreak upon reasonable damage calculations but from the damage done to the trial judge reasonable and prudently exercised judgment on an evidentiary issue over which he and he alone should have decisional authority,absent arbitrariness and capriciousness.nothing in the trial judge reasonable,straightforward and clearly articulated evidentiary ruling bears even a smidgeon of arbitrariness or capriciousness.accordingly,justice johnson would have affirmed the trial court ruling excluding skorheim testimony.
we granted usc petition for review to decide whether the trial court erred in excluding skorheim testimony.
ii.discussion 
this case stands at the intersection of two legal principles expert testimony must not be speculative,and lost profit damages must not be speculative.we will discuss both principles,then apply them to this case.
expert testimony 
as did the trial court,we begin our consideration of expert testimony with words that judge friendly wrote half a century ago there is no bright line that divides evidence worthy of consideration by a jury,although subject to heavy,from evidence that is not.especially because of the guaranty of the seventh amendment,a federal court must be exceedingly careful not to set the threshold to the jury room too high.yet it is the jury system itself that requires the common law judge,in his efforts to prevent the jury from being satisfied by matters of slight value,capable of being exaggerated by prejudice and hasty reasoning to exclude matter which does not rise to a clearly sufficient degree of value something more than a minimum of probative value is required.wigmore,evidence ed.these comments are especially pertinent to an array of figures conveying a delusive impression of exactness in an area where a jury common sense is less available than usual to protect it.herman schwabe,united shoe machinery,supra,at.
although judge friendly was discussing federal law and federal courts,his comments,both in their cautionary note that,due to the jury trial right,courts should not set the admission bar too high,and in their stressing the need to exclude unreliable evidence,could just as well have described california law and california courts.under california law,trial courts have a substantial gatekeeping responsibility 
evidence code section provides if a witness is testifying as an expert,his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion as is a related to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact and b based on matter that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates,unless an expert is precluded by law from using such matter as a basis for his opinion.italics added.subdivision b clearly permits a court to determine whether the matter is of a type on which an expert may reasonably rely.
in lockheed litigation cases th,d,the plaintiffs argued that under evidence code section,subdivision b,a court should determine only whether the type of matter that an expert relies on in forming his or her opinion is the type of matter that an expert reasonably can rely on in forming an opinion,without regard to whether the matter relied on reasonably does support the particular opinion offered.the court of appeal disagreed.an expert opinion has no value if its basis is unsound.citations.matter that provides a reasonable basis for one opinion does not necessarily provide a reasonable basis for another opinion.evidence code section,subdivision b,states that a court must determine whether the matter that the expert relies on is of a type that an expert reasonably can rely on in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates.italics added.we construe this to mean that the matter relied on must provide a reasonable basis for the particular opinion offered,and that an expert opinion based on speculation or conjecture is inadmissible.lockheed litigation cases,supra,at,d.
we agree with this analysis.indeed,as the court of appeal in that case also noted lockheed litigation cases,supra,th at,d,the california law revision commission comments to evidence code section explained that under existing law,irrelevant or speculative matters are not a proper basis for an expert opinion.see roscoe moss jenkins d expert may not base opinion upon a comparison if the matters compared are not reasonably comparable cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.ed.foll.comments of a commission that proposed a statute are entitled to substantial weight in construing the statute,especially when,as here,the legislature adopted the statute without change.jevne superior court cal th,d.thus,under evidence code section,the trial court acts as a gatekeeper to exclude speculative or irrelevant expert opinion.as we recently explained,t he expert opinion may not be based on assumptions of fact without evidentiary support citation,or on speculative or conjectural factors exclusion of expert opinions that rest on guess,surmise or conjecture citation is an inherent corollary to the foundational predicate for admission of the expert testimony will the testimony assist the trier of fact to evaluate the issues it must decide jennings palomar pomerado health systems,th,d.people richardson cal th,d,accord,people moore cal th,d.
additionally,as a recent law review article explains,evidence code section is not the only statute that governs the trial court gatekeeping role.we must also consider evidence code section.see imwinkelried faigman,evidence code section the neglected key to rationalizing the california law of expert testimony loyola.hereafter imwinkelried faigman.
evidence code section provides a witness testifying in the form of an opinion may state the reasons for his opinion and the matter upon which it is based,unless he is precluded by law from using such reasons or matter as a basis for his opinion.the court in its discretion may require that a witness before testifying in the form of an opinion be first examined concerning the matter upon which his opinion is based.italics added.this section indicates the court may inquire into the expert reasons for an opinion.it expressly permits the court to examine experts concerning the matter on which they base their opinion before admitting their testimony.the reasons for the experts opinions are part of the matter on which they are based just as is the type of matter.evidence code section governs judicial review of the type of matter evidence code section governs judicial review of the reasons for the opinion.the stark contrast between the wording of the two statutes strongly suggests that although under section b the judge may consider only the acceptability of the generic type of information the expert relies on,the judge is not so limited under section.imwinkelried faigman,supra,loyola.at.
evidence code section also permits the trial court to find the expert is precluded by law from using the reasons or matter as a basis for the opinion.law includes constitutional,statutory,and decisional law.thus,construed in the context of section,section authorizes a court to promulgate case law restrictions on an expert reasons imwinkelried faigman,supra,loyola,at.this means that a court may inquire into,not only the type of material on which an expert relies,but also whether that material actually supports the expert reasoning.a court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.general electric joiner,supra,at,quoted in imwinkelried faigman,supra,loyola,at.
thus,under evidence code sections,subdivision b,and,the trial court acts as a gatekeeper to exclude expert opinion testimony that is based on matter of a type on which an expert may not reasonably rely,based on reasons unsupported by the material on which the expert relies,or speculative.other provisions of law,including decisional law,may also provide reasons for excluding expert opinion testimony 
but courts must also be cautious in excluding expert testimony.the trial court gatekeeping role does not involve choosing between competing expert opinions.the high court warned that the gatekeeper focus must be solely on principles and methodology,not on the conclusions that they generate.daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,supra,at.the advisory committee on the amendments to federal rules of evidence,rule,which codified the rule established in daubert,noted that the trial court task is not to choose the most reliable of the offered opinions and exclude the others when a trial court,applying this amendment,rules that an expert testimony is reliable,this does not necessarily mean that contradictory expert testimony is unreliable.the amendment is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing principles or methods in the same field of expertise.advisory com.notes to federal rules,rule,
the trial court preliminary determination whether the expert opinion is founded on sound logic is not a decision on its persuasiveness.the court must not weigh an opinion probative value or substitute its own opinion for the expert opinion.rather,the court must simply determine whether the matter relied on can provide a reasonable basis for the opinion or whether that opinion is based on a leap of logic or conjecture.the court does not resolve scientific controversies.rather,it conducts a circumscribed inquiry to determine whether,as a matter of logic,the studies and other information cited by experts adequately support the conclusion that the expert general theory or technique is valid.imwinkelried faigman,supra,loyola.at.the goal of trial court gatekeeping is simply to exclude clearly invalid and unreliable expert opinion.black et,science and the law in the wake of daubert a new search for scientific knowledge.in short,the gatekeeper role is to make certain that an expert,whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience,employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.kumho tire carmichael,supra,at.
except to the extent the trial court bases its ruling on a conclusion of law which we review de novo,we review its ruling excluding or admitting expert testimony for abuse of discretion.people mcwhorter cal th,d,people gardeley cal th,d,people mickey cal d,lockheed litigation cases,supra,th at,d.a ruling that constitutes an abuse of discretion has been described as one that is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.people carmony cal th.but the court discretion is not unlimited,especially when,as here,its exercise implicates a party ability to present its case.rather,it must be exercised within the confines of the applicable legal principles.
the discretion of a trial judge is not a whimsical,uncontrolled power,but a legal discretion,which is subject to the limitations of legal principles governing the subject of its action,and to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,see westside community for independent living,obledo cal d,quoting this language.the scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.citation.the legal principles that govern the subject of discretionary action vary greatly with context.citation.they are derived from the common law or statutes under which discretion is conferred.city of sacramento drew d.to determine if a court abused its discretion,we must thus consider the legal principles and policies that should have guided the court actions.people carmony,supra,cal th at.
in this case,we consider whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion to exclude expert opinion testimony.as we have explained,the trial court discretion in this regard is circumscribed it must be exercised within the limits the law permits.accordingly,we must review the record to ensure that the ruling comes within the scope of that discretion.
lost profits 
lost profits may be recoverable as damages for breach of a contract.t he general principle is that damages for the loss of prospective profits are recoverable where the evidence makes reasonably certain their occurrence and extent.grupe glick cal d.such damages must be proven to be certain both as to their occurrence and their extent,albeit not with mathematical precision.lewis jorge construction management,pomona unified school dist.cal th,d.the rule that lost profits must be reasonably certain is a specific application of a more general statutory rule.no damages can be recovered for a breach of contract which are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin,see greenwich,llc wong th,d.
regarding lost business profits,the cases have generally distinguished between established and unestablished businesses.w here the operation of an established business is prevented or interrupted,as by a breach of contract,damages for the loss of prospective profits that otherwise might have been made from its operation are generally recoverable for the reason that their occurrence and extent may be ascertained with reasonable certainty from the past volume of business and other provable data relevant to the probable future sales.grupe glick,supra,cal d at.lost profits to an established business may be recovered if their extent and occurrence can be ascertained with reasonable certainty once their existence has been so established,recovery will not be denied because the amount can not be shown with mathematical precision.citations.historical data,such as past business volume,supply an acceptable basis for ascertaining lost future profits.citations.in some instances,lost profits may be recovered where plaintiff introduces evidence of the profits lost by similar businesses operating under similar conditions.citations.berge international harvester d.
on the other hand,where the operation of an unestablished business is prevented or interrupted,damages for prospective profits that might otherwise have been made from its operation are not recoverable for the reason that their occurrence is uncertain,contingent and speculative but although generally objectionable for the reason that their estimation is conjectural and speculative,anticipated profits dependent upon future events are allowed where their nature and occurrence can be shown by evidence of reasonable reliability.grupe glick,supra,cal d at.
where the fact of damages is certain,the amount of damages need not be calculated with absolute certainty.citations.the law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation of damages be used,and the damages may be computed even of the result reached is an approximation.citation.this is especially true where it is the wrongful acts of the defendant that have created the difficulty in proving the amount of loss of profits citation or where it is the wrongful acts of the defendant that have caused the other party to not realize a profit to which that party is entitled.ghk associates mayer group,d.permitting an award of profits calculated from a project actual income.
a recent case provides an example of claimed lost profits that were found to be uncertain,hypothetical and entirely speculative.greenwich,llc wong,supra,th at,d.there the plaintiffs sought lost profits for breach of a real property sales agreement.they presented evidence of lost profits through the testimony of a real estate appraiser,who testified about what the property would have been worth had it been developed according to the intended plans and specifications.id.at,d.the appellate court found the resulting award of in lost profits to be unsupported.t he occurrence and extent of the projected lost profits were not proven with the requisite reasonable certainty in this case.id.at,d.the evidence in this case was insufficient to show that either plaintiff was an established business or had a track record of successfully developing or redeveloping properties the existence of plans for a development does not supply substantial evidence that the development is reasonably certain to be built,much less that it is reasonably certain to produce profits.id.at,d.the lost profits claim was based on the assumption that plaintiffs would have constructed the residence according to the plans and specifications without changes and that the venture would have been profitable.these assumptions were inherently uncertain,contingent,unforeseeable and speculative.the proposed real estate development project here involved numerous variables that made any calculation of lost profits inherently uncertain.id.at,d.
once again,we add a cautionary note.the lost profit inquiry is always speculative to some degree.inevitably,there will always be an element of uncertainty.courts must not be too quick to exclude expert evidence as speculative merely because the expert can not say with absolute certainty what the profits would have been.courts must not eviscerate the possibility of recovering lost profits by too broadly defining what is too speculative.a reasonable certainty only is required,not absolute certainty.
application to this case 
we now apply these principles to this case.the issue before us is whether the court abused its discretion in excluding the expert testimony,not whether substantial evidence supports a lost profits award.but the substantive law regarding lost profits is r
