we reverse.
factual and procedural history 
environmental operates as a charter school.originally,it sought sponsorship as a charter school by centinela but centinela refused.thereafter,environmental obtained its charter through another school district in december and began teaching students in august.
on october,environmental wrote centinela and submitted a request for facilities based on section,subdivision b.in its request,environmental projected a total of students,including in the class of,in the class of,and in the class of.it also provided information about its instructional calendar,the general geographic area in which it wished to locate,and special facility needs for its program.
centinela requested the following information student names and dates of birth,home addresses,names of parents or guardians,grade levels,and schools and school districts attended.in response,environmental stated that it could not comply because the information was confidential and could not be released without parental consent as well,environmental maintained that it had provided all the information required by the regulations.it did,however,offer to discuss alternative methods for addressing centinela concerns.
on october,centinela informed environmental,inter alia,that its request was incomplete because it lacked the documentation required by california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c c and that its facilities request for was denied.according to centinela,if environmental wanted to make a facilities request for,then it would have to provide the same student information that was requested for.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section,environmental filed a verified petition for writ of mandate on april.it sought to compel centinela to process the request for facilities in good faith and adhere to all statutory and regulatory requirements.subsequently,the parties negotiated a confidentiality agreement and environmental agreed to provide student information but then centinela refused to sign the agreement.
the matter came on for hearing.the trial court concluded that even though environmental offered less foundation for its projections than the charter school in sequoia union high school dist.aurora charter high school th,d sequoia,environmental still gave centinela a fairly substantial amount of information.based on language in sequoia,the trial court found that environmental information was sufficient and ordered centinela to provide facilities for the current school year.
this timely appeal followed.
if relief granted by the trial court is temporal,and if the relief granted expires before an appeal can be heard,then an appeal by the adverse party is moot.see american civil liberties union board of education cal d.however,there are three discretionary exceptions to the rules regarding mootness when the case presents an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur citation when there may be a recurrence of the controversy between the parties citation and when a material question remains for the court determination citation.cucamongans united for reasonable expansion city of rancho cucamonga th,d.
the trial court ordered centinela to provide environmental with facilities for the school year beginning on january.but,pending appeal,the school year expired.nonetheless,this is a case that calls upon us to decide the merits because the parties dispute over application of the regulations to a facilities request is likely to recur.
contentions 
according to centinela 
this case is governed by california code of regulations,title,section,not sequoia.however,the trial court disregarded the controlling regulations and relied on a straight interpretation of section.
california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c c,which requires documentation for a charter school reasonable projection of enrollment,applies to all charter schools.
the requested student information was subject to disclosure.
the facilities request did not provide any documentation.as a result,writ relief was improper.
the petition was barred by laches.
standard of review 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a authorizes a court to issue a writ to any inferior tribunal,corporation,board,or person to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right.
the writ will lie where the petitioner has no plain,speedy and adequate alternative remedy,the respondent has a clear,present and usually ministerial duty to perform,and the petitioner has a clear,present and beneficial right to performance.citations.kong city of hawaiian gardens redevelopment agency th,d.
trial courts must uphold an agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,lacking in evidentiary support,or was made without due regard for the petitioner rights.citations.sequoia,supra,th at,d.when considering a case,a trial court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.ibid.consequently,because trial and appellate courts perform the same function in mandamus actions,an appellate court reviews the agency action de novo.ibid.
environmental urges us to apply the substantial evidence test to the trial court finding that the facilities request was sufficient to document how many students were meaningfully interested in enrolling for the following year.the case environmental relies gas and electric department of water resources th,d pacific gas states that a trial court ruling under code of civil procedure section is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial,credible and competent evidence.pacific gas,at,d.but it goes on to explain that when an appellate court is asked to resolve questions of law on undisputed facts,then the standard of review requires an independent analysis.ibid.the facts in this case,as were the facts in sequoia,are undisputed.consequently,we follow the standard of review set forth in sequoia and supported by pacific gas.
discussion 
i.the statutory and regulatory scheme.
section,which is known as the charter schools act of,allows the establishment of a school that operates independently from the existing school district structure.citation.a charter school within a particular school district is established when a petition,containing the proposed charter for the school and signed by a specified percentage of designated people,is submitted to the district governing board and the board grants the charter.citation.sequoia,supra,th at,d.in november,proposition amended section sequoia,at,d to provide,inter alia,that each school district shall make available,to each charter school operating in the school district,facilities sufficient for the charter school to accommodate all of the charter school students in conditions reasonably equivalent to those in which the students would be accommodated if they were attending other public schools of the district,subd.b.
a charter school must provide a reasonable projection of its average daily classroom attendance by students for the following year,subd.b.if the charter school generates less average daily attendance by students than it projected,then the charter school shall reimburse the district for the space at rates to be set by the state board of education.ibid.a school district may deny a facility request that is based upon projections of fewer than units of average daily classroom attendance for the year,subd.b.to carry these rules into effect,subdivision b empowers the department of education to propose,and the board of education to adopt,regulations designed to implement subdivision b.
implementing regulations were proposed and adopted.they were made operative on august.
california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b provides that a charter school must request facilities by october of the preceding fiscal year.subdivision c of that regulation establishes,inter alia,the following the written facilities request must include a reasonable projections of and total ada and and total classroom ada b a description of the methodology for the projections c if relevant,documentation of the number of students meaningfully interested in attending the charter school d the charter school instructional calendar e information regarding the general geographic area in which the charter school wishes to locate and f information on the charter school educational program that is relevant to assignment of facilities.projections of ada,classroom ada,and the number of students shall be broken down by grade level and by the school in the school district that the student would otherwise attend.under subdivision d,a school district must provide a charter school with a reasonable opportunity to respond to any concerns raised by the school district regarding the projections.
ii.sequoia.
in,the first appellate district decided sequoia.in that case,as here,the school district was ordered to provide facilities to a charter school.on appeal,the school district argued that the charter school failed to demonstrate that its student body was comprised of at least students.sequoia,supra,th at,d.the appellate court affirmed the judgment.
to qualify for district facilities,the sequoia court explained,a charter school shall provide the school district in which it is operating with a reasonable projection of the charter school average daily classroom attendance by students for the following year,and the district shall allocate facilities to the charter school for that following year based upon this projection.citation.sequoia,supra,th at,d.
the court noted that t he statute is silent as to any mechanism for calculating the reasonable projection of students,the evidentiary standard of proof for the projection,the procedure for the district to question the reasonableness of the projection,or the district right to deny the request when the school projection is for or more units of average daily attendance.sequoia,supra,th at,d.because the word reasonable modifies projection,the court held that the statute necessarily implies the charter school must offer some explanation in its facilities request for the basis for its projection.however,the statute does not require the school to demonstrate arithmetical precision in its projection or provide the kind of documentary or testimonial evidence that would be admissible at a trial.rather,the school is subsequently penalized if its projection was incorrect by having to reimburse the district for space.citation.id.at,d.
the court theorized that,in the absence of any other articulated statutory procedures for requesting facilities,section requires a district to allocate facilities to a requesting charter school once the school provides a reasonable projection of at least units of average daily attendance for the following year.citation.sequoia,supra,th at,d.
according to the court,the charter school did in fact provide a reasonable projection of students.the projection was based on the charter school historical attendance rates it had then been in operation for two years,its current enrollment of students,the expressed interest of current students and their families of continuing education at the charter school,and the expressed interest of prospective students and their families in attending the charter school during the next academic year.it anticipated a student body of freshmen,sophomores,juniors,and seniors.sequoia,supra,th at,d.
in a footnote,sequoia noted that the state board of education adopted regulations the day after the hearing in the trial court.the court then stated even if these regulations were fully operative when the charter school made its december facilities request,the school district march denial would be an abuse of discretion.although the regulations permit a district to question the projected enrollment,they do not permit the district to deny the request once the school has responded to the district concerns with a showing of a projected units of average daily attendance.the school district denial raised a concern about the charter school projected attendance and invited the charter school to respond.the charter school did so via the declaration of alice miller in support of the charter school mandamus petition.she declared that the charter school historically maintained percent attendance of students,and her declaration included documents from approximately students who were either currently attending the charter school and planning to continue or had applied for admission for the school year.sequoia,supra,th at,fn,d.
iii.applicability of the documentation requirement.
in construing a regulation,we take heed of the following guideposts our task is to arrive at a construction that carries out regulatory intent.simi garamendi th,d.the words used are the primary source for identifying the drafter intent.citation.we give those words their usual and ordinary meaning where possible.citations.we give significance to every word,avoiding an interpretation that renders any word surplusage.citation.we also interpret the words of a regulation in context,harmonizing to the extent possible all provisions relating to the same subject matter.citation.id.at,d.if the language is clear,there is no need to resort to other indicia of intent there is no need for construction.citation.citation.gregory state bd.of control th,d.when analyzing a regulation,we keep in mind that a department has no power to propose and then adopt a rule that conflicts with the enabling statute.see department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.th,d.
now to the bone of contention.california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c c requires,if relevant,documentation of the number of students meaningfully interested in attending the charter school.according to centinela,all charter schools must provide documentation with their facilities requests.environmental,in contrast,posits that the documentation requirement applies to new charter schools but not existing charter schools.alternatively,environmental suggests that if the documentation requirement does apply,then it is void because it is inconsistent with sequoia interpretation of section.
we examine this issue.
section,subdivision b provides that for each year a charter school desires facilities it must provide a reasonable projection of its average daily classroom attendance by students for the following year.california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b establishes to receive facilities during a particular fiscal year,a charter school must submit a written facilities request to the school district by october of the preceding fiscal year.next,subdivision c of that regulation informs charter schools of what a written facilities request must include.the plain language of the regulation makes subdivision c which includes subdivision c c applicable to all charter schools,not just new charter schools.this reading is consistent with section,subdivision b because both,by their language,cover any facilities request.
environmental directs our attention to the department of education final statement of reasons for proposing california code of regulations,title,section.as it pertains to subdivision c c,the department of education stated the third item c is documentation of the number of students that are meaningfully interested in enrolling in the charter school,if relevant.the purpose of this requirement is to enable school district review of reasonableness of the projections and verification that the charter school is operating in the school district,as defined.developing a list of meaningfully interested students is required by previously existing law as part of the process for obtaining approval of a charter petition.this statement does not change our conclusion.whether t
