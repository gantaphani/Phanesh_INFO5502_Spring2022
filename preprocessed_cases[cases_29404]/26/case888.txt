introduction 
this is an individuals with disabilities education act idea case of an emotionally troubled young child with suicidal tendencies beginning in the second grade,and with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd augmenting his disruptive behaviors.congress created the idea to bring disabled students into the public education system by requiring states to adopt procedures to develop individualized plans for such students.students with disabilities are entitled to special education services to ensure that they receive a free and appropriate public education fape.
the pittsburg unified school district school district determined that was not entitled to special education services because he was not disabled,and its determination was upheld on administrative review.mother filed this action in federal district court to require the school district to provide with an individualized education plan iep to provide specialized services to assist with what she contends are serious disabilities.
the district court reviewed the record and found that was disabled under three categories defined by the idea.it nevertheless concluded that an iep for specialized services was not necessary because of satisfactory performance in general education classes.the court discounted suicide attempts as not bearing on the need for educational services because they took place outside of school.
the school records show,however,that beginning in the second grade and continuing into the third and fourth grades,when the parent invoked administrative remedies,the school district had already been providing with special services,including counseling,assistance,and instructional accommodations.these services resulted in materially improved performance.the school district consistently refused,however,to provide him with an iep that would ensure such services in the future as required by the idea.the record also reflects that the school district violated procedural protections of the idea by failing to provide the parents with education records bearing on disabilities and services that had been provided.we therefore reverse and remand for consideration of appropriate remedies.
background 
this case presents a bright child disturbingly troubled history in the primary grades of two through five.was suspended from school multiple times for disruptive behavior that included kicking and hitting his teachers,throwing rocks,calling teachers and students names,and endangering and physically injuring classmates.has attempted to kill himself on at least three occasions and has manifested suicidal ideations prompting the school district mental health providers to conduct at least one emergency suicide evaluation.has been diagnosed with three serious disorders,including bipolar disorder,oppositional defiant disorder odd,and adhd.he has been prescribed a cocktail of serious medications for these conditions.
for years,mother has repeatedly requested,to no avail,that the school district find eligible for special education.the school district has provided many services to,but has never classified as eligible for special education under the idea.without such eligibility,is not guaranteed the services his mother believes that he needs,such as educational therapy,counseling services,and behavior intervention services.instead,the school district has transferred him between at least three different schools.
the history of difficulties began in second grade.during this year,demonstrated inappropriate behaviors at school,including anger,lack of,and not following rules.after being verbally disciplined by his teacher for bullying other students,told her that he wanted to die and that life was too hard.school staff called mother,and mental health staff prepared an emergency suicide evaluation.the school district referred to lincoln child center lincoln,the school district counseling center,where mental health providers assessed him.was diagnosed with adhd,odd,and bipolar disorder.
began his third grade year at the same school,but exhibited negative behaviors which the teacher had difficulty controlling.the school district held a student study team sst meeting on september.the purpose of an sst is to develop interventions for students having trouble in school,either academically or behaviorally.in many schools,an sst is the first step in addressing a student needs before initiating the iep process.
after sst meeting,the school district behavior specialist created a behavioral support plan bsp to address his problematic behavior.over the course of the school year,the behavior specialist revised the bsp multiple times,but continued to act inappropriately.as a result of the failed bsp,the school district proposed moving to a segregated trailer at a different school,but with no special education services,with six other boys with extreme behavior problems.
mother disputed the move,retained counsel,and entered mediation.the parties settled by agreeing to place,temporarily,in a different school,in a general education class,conditioned on his having a behavioral aide.the school district also agreed to evaluate for special education.
at the new school,a paraeducator was assigned to work with,and continued to work with him through his third grade year.a paraeducator is a specially trained staff member,assigned to work with special education students.while progressed academically and behaviorally,he continued to have issues.in april,wrapped a seatbelt around his neck,and saying he wanted to die,began rolling around uncontrollably trying to rub his face on the ground.was taken to the emergency room.
also,pursuant to the settlement agreement,sherry burke,a school psychologist,conducted psychoeducational and functional analysis assessments of to assist the iep team in determining if he qualified for special education under the categories of other health impairment,or specific learning disability.see c.burke reviewed available school records,conducted various interviews of teachers,counselors,and family members,and administered a series of tests.she concluded that did not meet the eligibility criteria for special education.
on may,again attempted to kill himself by sticking his finger in a light socket and putting items down his throat.he said that everyone hated him and he did not want to live.he was then confined to a psychiatric hospital,causing him to miss six school days.
the next day,may,while was hospitalized,the iep team held a meeting to review assessment results and to make a special education eligibility determination.an iep team is composed of school district teachers,the parent and other experts familiar with the child.see d b.burke presented her findings to the iep team,including her recommendation that did not meet eligibility requirements.the iep team agreed with the psychologist that had no qualifying disabilities.
the next month,on june,mother formally requested all of school records from the school district,including any records from lincoln,where had received counseling and had been assessed.the school district claimed there were no lincoln records that had not already been disclosed.mother submitted another request for records on june.the school district again failed to disclose any further records.
was admitted for psychiatric hospitalization on july and again on july,when he was detained as a danger to himself or others for banging his head and making threats.doctors placed on the psychotropic medications,adderall,seroquel,and wellbutrin,to help stabilize his mood and sustain focus,and later vistaril to treat his anxiety.
on july,mother filed a request for a due process hearing with the california office of administrative hearings oah.she claimed that the school district denied a fape by failing to make him eligible for special education and related services,and that the school district had failed to conduct assessments in areas of suspected disability,specifically other health impairment and emotional disturbance.mother also contended that the school district had failed to make requested records available.
the parties again participated in mediation on august.the parties agreed to place at yet another elementary school,pending the school district review of psychiatric hospitalization records and burke updating her report.the school district generated a new assessment plan for iep eligibility purposes.mother authorized the release of psychiatric records on the condition that a school nurse would conduct a health assessment and that original third grade teacher would be included in the eligibility process.
for fourth grade,beginning in the fall of,was in a classroom with a teacher experienced with students with disciplinary problems.was also provided with special accommodations,including freedom to leave the classroom at will.on september,was suspended for two days for throwing rocks and threatening to kill the school principal.the teacher assistance and special accommodations continued throughout the school year,and,as a result,academic performance was satisfactory.
after burke updated her assessments,a second iep team meeting was held on october,to reconsider eligibility for special education services under the category of emotional disturbance.see c.the requested third grade teacher was not present at the meeting and had not been assessed by a nurse,in violation of both conditions insisted upon by mother in the agreement.the team again concluded that was not eligible for special education,the same conclusion reached at the first meeting the preceding may,despite repeated intervening hospitalizations,heavy medications,renewed suicide attempts,and individualized accommodations in school.
on october,filed an amended complaint with the california oah.mother again submitted formal requests for school records in october and november,and in march.the mental health records kept by the school district,including lincoln,were never disclosed.
during that fourth grade year,was sent to the office multiple times for physically injuring classmates,disrupting class,and refusing to follow directives.school staff contacted mother to pick him up from school early on numerous occasions.the school district conducted another mental health assessment.he was again diagnosed with adhd.in this assessment,the clinician concluded his adhd symptoms caused clinically significant impairment in social and academic functioning,that relied extensively on medications,and further,that he evidenced functional impairments in the areas of family relations,school performance,and peer relations.
the following year,in the fall of,the school district nevertheless placed in a regular fifth grade classroom without accommodations or services.in november,was rushed to the emergency room by ambulance after attempting to hang himself with a lanyard.that year,physically injured children and at least one teacher.was suspended for kicking and hitting his science teacher,calling another teacher stupid,and brandishing a fake knife in the classroom.was also suspended again because he endangered a classmate by putting expandable pellets in the classmate water bottle without his knowledge.
that spring,due process request made its way before an administrative law judge alj.the alj conducted a hearing in april,and on may,the alj issued her decision,denying all of requests for relief.the alj found that had no disabilities that would qualify him for special education services,and even if he had qualifying disabilities,he had not demonstrated a need for special services because his academic performance was satisfactory when he was able to attend school.
procedural background 
timely appealed the alj ruling to the district court.contended that he was eligible for special education services and asked the district court to order the school district to provide an iep.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court disagreed with the alj decision that had no disabling conditions.the district court ruled that met the qualifying criteria as a student with three disabilities specific learning disability,other health impairment due to his adhd,and serious emotional disturbance due to his odd and bipolar disorder.
the district court,nevertheless,granted the school district motion for summary judgment,ruling that did not need special education services because of his satisfactory performance in general education.the district court adopted the alj findings that was performing well behaviorally,socially,and academically between may and october with the help of services the court characterized as general education accommodations,not individualized special education services.
this appeal followed.
standard of review 
the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,even when the district court based those findings on an administrative record,and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.douglas cty.sch,cir.this court gives due weight to alj special education decisions.fresno unified sch,cir.this standard is far less deferential than judicial review of other agency actions,but requires this court to refrain from substituting its own notions of educational policy for those of the school authority it reviews.amanda clark cty.sch,cir.
statutory background and legal framework 
under the idea,all states that receive federal education funding must establish policies and procedures to ensure that a free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities.id.at a a.the idea defines a fape as special education that is provided at public expense.id.at.a child receives a fape,for purposes of the idea,if the program addresses the child unique needs,provides adequate support services so that the child can take advantage of educational opportunities,and is in accord with the iep.id.a state must comply both procedurally and substantively with the idea.id.at et.
in determining whether a student has received a fape in compliance with the idea,the court conducts both a procedural and substantive inquiry.the court considers whether the school complied with the procedures set forth in the idea.bd.of educ.rowley.the court also evaluates whether the iep in this case,or lack thereof,was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.id.where a court identifies a procedural violation that denied a student a fape,the court need not address the second substantive prong of the inquiry.doug haw.dep of,cir.
not all procedural violations constitute a denial of a fape.napa valley unified sch,cir.a child is denied a fape when procedural inadequacies result in the loss of an educational opportunity,or seriously infringe on the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process.doug,at.a procedural error is harmless if the student is substantively ineligible for idea benefits,at.
ii.eligibility for idea benefits 
the initial issue in this case is whether was substantively eligible for idea benefits,since the alj held he was not.a child is substantively eligible for special education and related services if he is a child with a disability,which is statutorily defined,in relevant part,as a child with a serious emotional disturbance,other health impairment,or specific learning disability and who,by reason thereof,needs special education and related services.a.california education code similarly provides that a student with exceptional needs who is eligible under a must have an impairment that requires instruction and services which can not be provided with modification of the regular school program.cal.educ.code a,b.
even if a child has such a disability,he or she does not qualify for special education services if support provided through the regular school program is sufficient.a cal.educ.code.s pecial classes,separate schooling,or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services can not be achieved satisfactorily.a a.
the parties on appeal no longer dispute that should have been categorized as a child with a disability under three categories set forth in the statute.first,has a specific learning disability because he has exhibited a severe discrepancy between his intellectual ability and his achievement.c.second,has an other health impairment because his adhd and mood disorders interfere with his ability to progress academically and socially.c.lastly,mood disorders constitute a serious emotional disturbance.c.
the critical issue in this appeal therefore is whether demonstrated a need for special education services.this case differs from most idea cases in that never received an iep because the school district continually maintained he had no qualifying disabilities.the alj agreed that he had no qualifying disabilities.the district court held that the alj was incorrect in this regard and that had qualifying disabilities.the district court went on to conclude,however,that was performing satisfactorily without the need for special education services.we must therefore determine whether general education was appropriate or whether exhibited a need for special education services.
the appropriateness of a student eligibility should be assessed in terms of its appropriateness at the time of the child evaluation and not from the perspective of a later time with the benefit of hindsight.adams oregon,cir.when making this assessment of whether an eligibility determination is appropriate under the idea,this court looks to the time of the child evaluation by the school district.we employ what is termed the snapshot rule that instructs the court to judge the appropriateness of the determination on the basis of the information reasonably available to the parties at the time of the iep meeting.id.an iep must take into account what was and was not,objectively reasonable when the snapshot was taken.id.citation omitted.we judge the eligibility decision on the basis of whether it took the relevant information into account,not on whether or not it worked.id.
in this case,it is undisputed that the snapshot period was the period surrounding the two iep meetings on may,in the third grade,and october,in the fourth grade.that was the critical period on which the school district based its eligibility decisions,and the district court correctly focused on eligibility for special education by looking to his behavior,academic progress,and social needs at that time.the district court was correct when it found that should have been categorized as a child with a disability within the meaning of the idea.had multiple disabilities,which manifested serious behavioral problems.
the district court nonetheless concluded that was not eligible for special education because he was academically performing satisfactorily without receiving special education services and on the basis of the general education curriculum.this was clear error because was receiving special services,including mental health counseling and assistance from a paraeducator.these are not services offered to general education students.
this distinction is important.general education is what is provided to children in the classroom.special education,on the other hand,is specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.a.specially designed instruction is defined under the idea regulations 
specially designed instruction means adapting,as appropriate to the needs of an eligible child under this part,the content,methodology,or delivery of instruction 
i to address the unique needs of the child that result from the child disability and 
ii to ensure access of the child to the general curriculum,so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.
b emphasis added.
the district court decided that did not need an iep because,despite his multiple disabilities,was performing satisfactorily in general education.the problem with the district court analysis is that many of the services the district court viewed as general education services were in fact special education services tailored to situation.the district court thus classified many of the services received as general education,when they were not.discussion of a few examples will make the point.
first,general education instruction does not provide for direction.received special assistance in the third grade from a paraeducator,pursuant to the parties agreement that year.the school district claims that the paraeducator faded back considerably by may,the date of the initial iep meeting,but this is not accurate.the paraeducator continued to assist throughout the third grade.
second,general education instruction does not provide for specially designed mental health services.the school district position is that received only general education mental health services from lincoln that the school district makes available to all students.the school district distinguishes such services from services received by special education students,which are specially designed mental health services.
the flaw in the school district argument is that the mental health services that received from second grade through fourth grade were for him.such services included services that the school district described as follows assessments,plan development,group and individual rehabilitation,group and individual therapy,family therapy,and collateral family group and intensive services.the school district acknowledges that only students requiring special education receive an mental health assessment.received two such mental health assessments.was referred to lincoln by the school district director of special education and psychological services,and the school district acknowledged this means of referral is for special education students only.
third,general education instruction does not typically include extensive clinical interventions by a school district behavior speci
