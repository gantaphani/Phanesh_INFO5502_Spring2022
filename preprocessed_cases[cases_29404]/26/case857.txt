howard lockridge brought race and sex discrimination claims under title vii of the civil rights act of through,and based on the denial of equal protection,against the university of arkansas board of trustees,the university president in his official capacity,and the chancellor of phillips community college of the university of arkansas pccua,steven jones,in his official and individual capacities.because we have held that a claim alleging a violation of may not be brought directly against a state actor,but must be brought under,see artis francis howell north band booster ass n,cir,we liberally construe lockridge complaint as including claims for violations of the equal protection clause and brought under.in an order granting in part and denying in part the defendants summary judgment motion,the district court denied jones request for qualified immunity.all of the defendants appeal.
lockridge,who is black,alleged in his complaint that he was denied a promotion from his position as chair of the department of industrial technology to the position of dean of industrial technology and workforce development at pccua on account of his race and sex.the court granted summary judgment to all of the defendants with respect to lockridge sex discrimination claims,and held that neither jones nor the university president could be individually liable under title vii.the court ruled with respect to the remaining race discrimination claims that the defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the merits and that jones was not entitled to qualified immunity.
on appeal,jones contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity because lockridge did not apply for the promotion and told his supervisor that he was not going to apply.the other defendants argue that the claims against them may also be resolved in this appeal because the qualified immunity issue is intertwined with the merits of lockridge claims against all of the defendants.in response,lockridge argues that we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal.he also contends that he may prevail despite not having applied for the position because employees had previously been promoted to dean without filing applications and past practices indicated that filing an application would have been futile,and that he would have applied if the application period had not been shorter than usual.
lockridge,as we have said,questions this court jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal,and we first address our jurisdiction over the denial of qualified immunity to jones.such a ruling is immediately appealable if it resolve s a dispute concerning an abstract issu e of law relating to qualified immunity typically,the issue whether the federal right allegedly infringed was clearly established behrens pelletier,d quoting johnson jones,d.although we may not review in an interlocutory appeal a district court finding that certain facts are in dispute,see thomas talley,cir,we may determine whether all of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment violated the plaintiff clearly established federal rights,see behrens,at.heidemann rother,cir.
here,jones argues that the undisputed facts compel the conclusion that he did not violate lockridge clearly established federal rights.we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this abstract issue of law.we conduct our review by accepting as true the facts that the district court specifically found were adequately supported,along with those facts that the district court likely assumed,see behrens,at.quoting johnson,at.where the district court did not make a finding regarding a factual issue,we determine the facts that it likely assumed,see,by viewing the record favorably to the plaintiff as in any other summary judgment motion,see heidemann,at.
the threshold question in a qualified immunity case is whether t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the evidence shows that the defendant conduct violated a federal right at all.see saucier katz,d.if the answer to this question is no then we need not inquire further to determine whether the right was clearly established.see id.here jones argues that the undisputed facts compel the conclusion that he did not violate lockridge federal rights,and that therefore the court need not inquire further and should grant him qualified immunity.we agree for the reasons that follow.
the facts that were found supported by the district court as well as those it likely assumed,see behrens,at,indicate that in the spring of jones appointed a search committee to seek applicants for the position of dean of industrial technology and workforce development.although a pccua employee testified that notices of the opening were posted on college bulletin boards before april,lockridge and others denied seeing these notices.
lockridge testified at his deposition that he first learned that pccua was seeking applicants for the position on april,when he received a notice from jones by electronic mail.this notice,which was sent to the entire pccua community,stated that at the recommendation of linda killion lockridge supervisor and others the division of business and technology,over which she was dean,was being restored to its dual components.the notice further stated that killion was to become dean of the division of business and computer technology that pccua was currently advertising for the dean of the other component,the division of industrial technology and workforce development that copies of the job announcement had been posted on the campus and that advertisements would run in statewide newspapers the following weekend.
upon reading the notice,lockridge became upset.he testified that in the past pccua had hired all the other deans positions and most of the executive staff from within the college community without advertising in outside publications very seldom in pccua history,he said,did it go outside to fill positions.he contended that this changed when he was the logical choice for the position within the pccua community,and that he should have been offered the position before outside applicants were sought.the day after he received the electronic mail,lockridge went to killion and asked her why she had not recommended him for the position.killion did not respond to the question directly but asked him if he was going to apply for the job,and he said that he was not.according to jones,killion notified him that lockridge stated that he was not going to apply.
lockridge further testified that at some point after his conversation with killion,he decided to apply for the job.he began preparing an application but did not notify anyone of his change of heart.in the meantime,the search committee recommended tracy mcgraw,a white male who was not a pccua employee,for the position,and jones decided to hire him.on may,jones told lockridge that he was going to hire mcgraw.at the time that he learned that the decision had been made,lockridge had not applied,and he had thought that he still had time to do so because pccua usually took at least four weeks to fill a position.
in its order denying summary judgment in part,the district court found that fact questions remained regarding the policy and practice followed at pcc ua as to promotions and whether certain positions such as the department chair for which killion a white female was selected were announced as vacancies whether internal searches were conducted first before positions were advertised whether everyone was required to apply for promotions and what time period was usually allowed for applying for a position.the court denied jones qualified immunity because the fact questions surrounding the actual policy and practices regarding promotions and whether applications were always required prevented it from determining whether he violated a clearly established right in selecting a search committee.
we first determine whether lockridge established a violation of a federal right at all.see saucier,at.his claims against jones are brought pursuant to,which requires that lockridge show that jones was acting under color of state law and violated lockridge federal rights.the federal rights at issue are based on the equal protection clause and on.as applied in this case,either provision requires lockridge to present evidence of purposeful racial discrimination,see dickens missouri,cir per curiam equal protection general building contractors ass pennsylvania,d,and evidence of jones participation in that discrimination,see mcdowell jones,cir.
we believe that jones was entitled to qualified immunity because the circumstances present here can not support a finding that lockridge was intentionally discriminated against when he was denied the promotion.where,as here,there is no direct evidence of discrimination,the mcdonnell douglas analysis is applied to employment discrimination claims based on,see bogren minnesota,cir,cert.denied,d,and the equal protection clause,see floyd state of.dep t of soc,cir,as a way to show intentional discrimination.see mcdonnell douglas green,d see also richmond board of regents,cir.under this framework,the plaintiff ordinarily must establish a prima facie case by showing,inter alia,that he or she applied for the promotion and was rejected.see dotson delta consol.industries,cir.as we have said,lockridge acknowledged that he did not apply for the position and that he told his supervisor that he was not going to apply.
as lockridge points out,however,the requirements for establishing a prima facie discrimination case are flexible and may vary according to the case.see mcdonnell douglas,at.to excuse his failure to apply for the promotion,lockridge relies on lyoch companies,cir,which held that the plaintiff was not required to establish the typical requirements for a prima facie case because the employer promotions policy was informal and subjective and vague and secretive.but here lockridge was directly notified of the particular opening at issue and asked whether he was going to apply.
although the district court found that factual questions were raised as to pccua promotion procedures generally,and lockridge testified that pccua had always chosen deans from within the college community,we do not believe that this circumstance is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.here,lockridge acknowledged that two of the six deans at pccua were black,and that at least two other black individuals had previously held the position of dean.based on lockridge testimony,these individuals became deans without consideration being given to outside applicants.more importantly,vacancies in many positions at universities and most other places are necessarily filled in different ways,depending on the nature of a position and its responsibilities,internal circumstances,and the exigencies of the moment.we do not believe that a reasonable could infer intentional race discrimination from the decision to consider outside applicants when seeking a qualified individual for the position involved in this case,particularly where each member of the college community was individually notified of the opening.
lockridge also argues that he comes within the rule that excuses a failure to make an application when an employer consistently enforces a policy of discrimination,thereby making it apparent that applying for the position would be futile.see int l of teamsters united states,d.in teamsters,the court stated that v ictims of gross and pervasive discrimination are not required to apply formally for a position if they can establish that but for the employer discriminatory practices they would have applied for a job.see id.at.according to lockridge,jones failed to promote him on prior occasions and thereby created an atmosphere at pccua in which it was futile for him to apply for the position of dean.he also describes incidents in which he asserts that other individuals at pccua were subjected to racial discrimination.
as the original panel in this case noted,teamsters was a class action,and the analysis used there is usually applied in other class actions,rather than to actions brought by individual plaintiffs.see celestine petroleos de venezuella sa,cir craik minnesota state,cir.but even if that fact is of no particular legal significance,there is no claim here that there was a consistently enforced practice of refusing to hire black individuals for the position of dean,such that a black applicant would face certain rejection,see teamsters,at.having reviewed all of the evidence,we believe that no reasonable person could conclude from the present record that gross and pervasive discrimination made it futile for lockridge to apply for the promotion.
lockridge draws our attention to the fact that he had applied for promotions a number of times before and had been rejected.in three of those instances,he asserts,twice in and once in,a less qualified white person was appointed to the position.it might well be that lockridge would have been able to make out a prima facie case of race discrimination in these prior instances,and it might be that an employee proven experience with an employer could,in a proper case,furnish a reason for relaxing the requirement that an employee must apply for a position in order to make out a prima facie case that he was unlawfully discriminated against.but here,lockridge seeks to rely on incidents some of which occurred at least a decade before the relevant employment decision,not all of which,moreover,included the same principal actors.in these particular circumstances,we are unable to conclude that lockridge has made out a case on the question of whether it was futile for him to apply.
we have observed that plaintiffs in discrimination actions have been excused from applying for promotions if the job opening was not officially posted or advertised and either the plaintiff had no knowledge of the job from other sources until it was filled,or the employer was aware of the plaintiff interest in the job notwithstanding the plaintiff failure to make a formal application.chambers wynne school,cir emphasis added citing paxton union bank,cir,cert.denied,d and eeoc metal service,cir.here,however,lockridge can not meet the threshold requirement because the job opening was officially posted.in fact,jones himself notified lockridge of the position in writing.
we have also stated that an employee who does not formally apply must make every reasonable attempt to convey his or her interest in the job to the employer before he or she may prevail on a discrimination claim.see chambers,at quoting metal service,at.but lockridge did not apply,told his supervisor that he was not going to apply,and although he contends that he later changed his mind did not notify the that he had decided to apply.under these circumstances we believe that as a matter of law lockridge did not make every reasonable attempt to let pccua or jones,in particular,know that he was interested in the position.
in addition,lockridge asserts that the time between the date of the announcement of the opening and the date of hiring was shortened here because of his race,so that he was denied the opportunity to apply.although in this appeal we accept as true lockridge testimony that the time period for applying was shorter than usual,we do not believe that this fact can raise an inference in a reasonable mind of racial animus.
lockridge asks us to take into account the fact that he made the statement to killion that he was not going to apply in anger.first,we note that there is no evidence that jones knew that lockridge was angry or that he knew anything about this conversation other than that lockridge said he was not going to apply,and the defendant lack of knowledge sometimes may affect whether qualified immunity is available,see foster basham,cir per curiam.but here we do not think that jones knowledge matters because neither lockridge emotional state nor his query as to why killion did not recommend him for the job alters the legal effect of his statement that he was not going to apply.we further note that lockridge,rather than repudiating his statement,communicated with no one at pccua about the job for nearly two weeks afterward,at which time jones informed him that he ha
