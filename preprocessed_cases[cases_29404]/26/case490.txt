charles vereecke,a high school english teacher at milford high school milford,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for michael krystyniak,michael teasdale,and the huron valley school district on vereecke claim that the defendants unlawfully retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights.in october,vereecke filed a lawsuit on behalf of his daughter,alleging that a teacher had broken her wrist while engaged in attempted horseplay and that the school had previously failed to investigate harassment complaints against the teacher.vereecke alleges that,in direct retaliation for having filed that suit,the defendants issued multiple reprimands to him,removed him from his position on the high school hall of fame committee,declined to renew his contract as the athletic coordinator,and initiated a larceny investigation by the police against him.the district court found that vereecke was unable to present evidence that the underlying lawsuit was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants decisions to discipline him and granted summary judgment for the defendants.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
charles vereecke has been an english teacher at milford high school,part of the huron valley school district,for over years.for the time relevant to the case,defendant michael krystyniak was the principal of milford,and sean maloney was the school athletic director.defendant michael teasdale worked for the school district as the executive director of human resources,and the district superintendent was jackie johnston.
until the fall of,vereecke professional record was unblemished.in addition to his duties as a teacher,vereecke also had held the position of athletic coordinator at milford for over twenty years.as athletic coordinator vereecke coordinated and hosted athletic competitions with other schools.the position of athletic coordinator is considered an extracurricular activity,separate from regular teaching duties,and vereecke was paid nearly per year in addition to his annual salary for serving in the position.his service as the athletic coordinator was an position that did not affect tenure.terms of the appointment were contained in a contract,renewable annually.vereecke further served as one of ten members of the milford high school hall of fame committee as the designee of krystyniak.the primary purpose of the committee was to meet once a year to discuss and vote on that year nominees to the hall of fame.vereecke was not paid to serve on this committee.
on october,vereecke,on behalf of his daughter,kelly,who was also a student at milford,filed a lawsuit in michigan state court against the huron valley school district,krystyniak,and a former teacher at milford,charles stolz.in addition to alleging that stolz broke his daughter wrist,vereecke claimed krystyniak was grossly negligent for failing to investigate sexual harassment complaints brought against stolz by other students.although the school had decided that stolz contract would not be renewed,he was still on duty at the time of the altercation with kelly in may.vereecke demanded compensatory damages for kelly broken wrist and exemplary damages for her mental anguish.the suit was eventually settled on august.
although vereecke did not file the lawsuit until october,in june,he told krystyniak of his intent to file the suit on his daughter behalf.vereecke did not mention,however,that he was planning to name krystyniak or the huron valley school district as defendants.until he was served on october,krystyniak believed that stolz would be the only defendant.
immediately before and during the pendency of the lawsuit arising from kelly injury,a series of confrontations between vereecke and milford administration took place.the facts surrounding these incidents are largely undisputed.vereecke alleges that he was disciplined after these confrontations because of the suit.
the basketball coach dispute and removal from the hall of fame committee 
during the school year,a number of parents of students on the milford girls basketball team became angry with the coach of the team,don palmer,to the point that they eventually hired an attorney and filed grievances with the administration.one of the parents was debbie schultz,who was also a member of the first milford hall of fame class.schultz began videotaping the basketball games,although,according to vereecke,she taped only palmer on the sideline in an attempt to record evidence of his misconduct.
two of vereecke daughters were on the team,but he did not participate in the complaints against palmer.vereecke disapproved of schultz actions and felt that she should have contacted all the parents of the players on the team,or contacted the coach,before filing a grievance with the superintendent.vereecke and palmer were lifelong friends,so,in a show of support for him,vereecke wore to basketball games a with palmer attorney name and phone number on it.
vereecke was not alone in disapproving of schultz tactics.in august,the hall of fame committee began receiving letters from members of the milford community,at least three of whom were themselves inducted into the milford hall of fame,expressing their displeasure with schultz actions.in early september,vereecke drafted a letter to schultz informing her of the letters and that the board reserves the right to remove any inductee for conduct detrimental to milford high school to the hall of fame.the letter was signed by vereecke alone,but below his name vereecke added milford hall of fame.twice,vereecke asked krystyniak and athletic director maloney for permission to send the letter.they advised him not to send the letter at the first meeting,but remained silent the second time,neither authorizing him to send the letter nor expressly telling him not to.vereecke viewed their silence as consent to send the letter,so he mailed it to schultz on september.vereecke never obtained authorization from the hall of fame committee to send the letter,nor was there a provision in the committee bylaws that authorized him to do so.
upon receiving the letter,schultz contacted krystyniak,telling him that both she and her husband were extremely upset by the letter and that they had emailed complaints to the huron valley school district superintendent,deputy superintendent,and director of human resources.on october,the hall of fame committee convened to discuss,among other things,vereecke actions.krystyniak,who was not a member of the committee,attended,asked the members if they had authorized or were aware of vereecke letter,and was informed they were not.krystyniak disagreed with the content of the letter and was displeased with vereecke actions,specifically his decision to send the letter unilaterally.vereecke filed the underlying lawsuit on behalf of kelly nine days after this meeting.as noted above,krystyniak was served with process eight days after that.
despite attending the meeting in early october,krystyniak did not take any action against vereecke until november,a month after kelly vereecke suit was filed.on that date,krystyniak sent a letter to vereecke chastising him for having failed to model,utilize,or demonstrate the appropriate conduct necessary for the athletic coordinator position.it cited the letter to schultz and vereecke overt support for palmer as indicative of inappropriate conduct.in the end,vereecke was removed from his position as the principal designee to the hall of fame committee,and his position as athletic coordinator was changed with reduced visibility and his professional conduct placed under review for the remainder of the school year.this letter was vereecke first written reprimand or discipline of any kind in over thirty years of teaching.
before reprimanding vereecke,krystyniak got input from teasdale.in his deposition,teasdale explained that reduced visibility meant vereecke would not be the public face of the school at athletic events.teasdale understood the professional conduct mentioned in the letter to refer to the manner in which vereecke handled himself as the athletic coordinator.maloney states in an affidavit that krystyniak,teasdale,and deputy superintendent nancy coratti mentioned to him in a november meeting that they also wanted to remove vereecke from his role as athletic coordinator at milford,but neither krystyniak nor teasdale was questioned about such a meeting in their depositions.
the basketball game incident and removal from position as athletic coordinator 
during a varsity basketball game at milford on february,a fight broke out among the student spectators after a halftime sportsmanship activity soured.according to greg michaels,athletic director at lakeland high school lhs,whose team was milford opponent,a former police officer attempted to stop the fight.lhs parents reacted aggressively to the officer actions and michaels intervened to head off the parents.after order was reestablished,vereecke approached michaels in a rude,hostile and unprofessional manner to complain about the lhs students.michaels reported that vereecke then acted inappropriately for the rest of the game,including yelling profane language at lhs students.in contrast,maloney,who was also at the game,asserts that gregory michaels and charles vereecke were equal participants in the verbal confrontation and both raised their voice to the other.
after the incident,teasdale conducted an investigation into what happened.teasdale reported that he received accounts that michaels was in control and not animated to the same degree that vereecke was.teasdale interviewed michaels,who reported that he felt vereecke had been overreacting.teasdale also met with vereecke,who admitted to him that he knew a group of students from each school would meet and shake hands at halftime to demonstrate good sportsmanship he should have but did not inform the athletic director or principal about the plan he confronted michaels demanding to know what action was going to be taken and that he blew his temper.on march,teasdale issued vereecke a written reprimand for his conduct at the game.teasdale did not issue a written reprimand to michaels,although he had the power to do so.vereecke concedes that neither his tenure as a teacher,his compensation,nor his benefits were affected by this reprimand.
sometime after teasdale sent vereecke the reprimand,however,he recommended to superintendent johnston that she not renew vereecke position as the athletic coordinator at milford.he based his recommendation on the february basketball incident and the issues in the beginning of the year with debbie schultz.at some point that spring,johnston followed teasdale recommendation and decided that vereecke athletic coordinator contract would not be renewed for the school year.johnston testified at her deposition that she concluded vereecke was no longer a suitable ambassador for the school because of these incidents.teasdale notified vereecke of the district decision on june.in their deposition testimony,both teasdale and johnston denied that vereecke lawsuit against the district played any role in this decision.although this decision had no effect on his tenure status,vereecke contends that the loss of pay amounting to per year could affect his pension benefits,which are calculated using the salary of the individual three years of the last five of his employment.
the pepsi refrigerator incident and larceny charges 
on june,the day after receiving the notice,vereecke cleaned out his belongings from the athletic coordinator office,including a pepsi.vereecke concedes that he took the refrigerator without permission,but claims that he did so because he believed it had been given to him by a pepsi representative a few years earlier.the refrigerator was one of six loaned to milford for use,but the pepsi representative had not given anyone permission to take the refrigerators off the premises.several milford employees saw vereecke remove the pepsi refrigerator from the school and reported the removal to krystyniak.
the next day,krystyniak asked police deputy steve dooley,the school liaison deputy from the oakland county sheriff department,to investigate.with detective chris miller from the sheriff office,dooley went to vereecke house to investigate and saw the refrigerator sitting in plain view in vereecke garage.after speaking with vereecke,who admitted he took the refrigerator but asserted his belief that it belonged to him,the officers confiscated the refrigerator and brought it back to milford.the officers also issued vereecke a ticket for larceny.the case was referred to the oakland county prosecutor office,which,on august,elected not to prosecute due to questions of vereecke intent at the time of the incident.
teasdale testified at his deposition that any time it is reported that a school employee has removed school property from the premises,the school district proceeds with the investigation by involving the police,and allowing them to investigate,prepare a report,and take the matter to the prosecutor who decides whether to proceed further.the teachers union president,mike macgregor,qualified this assertion,explaining that he had never experienced any situation where a school reported an incident to the police without first notifying a union representative.teasdale did contact macgregor sometime in the evening on june,after the investigation had already been completed and the ticket issued.the investigation did not cause vereecke to lose his job or tenure.
on august,shortly after kelly vereecke underlying suit settled,charles vereecke filed the present action in federal court.vereecke brought the action under,alleging that the actions taken against him discussed above were in retaliation for the underlying lawsuit that he filed on behalf of his daughter.he alleged that because the underlying lawsuit was speech protected under the first amendment,the adverse employment actions taken by the defendants violated his first amendment rights.vereecke claimed compensatory damages for loss of income,loss of reputation,mortification,embarrassment,humiliation,degradation,and anxiety and mental anguish,and he also sought punitive damages.the defendants collectively moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted the motion on july.vereecke timely appealed.

he engaged in constitutionally protected speech or conduct an adverse action was taken against him that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct and there is a causal connection between elements one and is,the adverse action was motivated at least in part by his protected conduct.
