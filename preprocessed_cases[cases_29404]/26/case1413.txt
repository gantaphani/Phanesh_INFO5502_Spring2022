individuals with learning disabilities and other conditions affecting their ability to read may,when taking a standardized test,seek reasonable testing accommodations under the americans with disabilities act ada.et.this case presents the question of whether persons taking such tests in california are additionally entitled to accommodations under the state unruh civil rights act the act and disabled persons act dpa.we conclude these state law provisions do not require testing accommodations for disabilities.
background 
the association of american medical colleges aamc is a nonprofit organization whose members include medical schools and teaching hospitals throughout the country.its mission is to improve public health by enhancing the effectiveness of academic medicine.among other things,aamc develops and administers the medical college admission test mcat,a nationwide standardized test designed to assess a medical school applicant knowledge of basic science concepts,writing skills and facility in problem solving and critical thinking 
the mcat is designed to predict success during medical school.it consists of questions and a writing section and is assigned a scaled score when it is graded.the mcat is useful to medical schools because it allows them to compare an applicant performance to that of others under standardized conditions.admissions departments consider the mcat along with other factors such as a student grades in undergraduate school when evaluating a medical school applicant.the spaces in medical schools are limited and the application process is highly competitive.
although it is a timed examination,the mcat is not designed to measure reading speed per se.the time limits on the mcat have not been correlated with the reading or problem solving speed necessary for success in medical school or the practice of medicine.applicants with learning disabilities such as dyslexia or conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd may have difficulty completing the test in the allotted time.in such cases,aamc entertains requests for accommodations such as additional time to complete the examination or a separate room to minimize distractions.aamc puts a notation or flag on any test taken under nonstandard conditions to alert medical schools that the score should carry less weight relative to other factors in the admissions process.
individuals who have difficulty reading as a result of their disability may,nonetheless,possess superior intelligence and reasoning skills.the accommodation of applicants with learning and disabilities on a standardized test is designed to level the playing field,not to give those individuals an advantage.nonetheless,accommodating such disabilities creates an inherent tension between the various interests at stake.on the one hand,when a test is not designed to measure reading speed,time limits can compromise its ability to accurately measure the skills and knowledge of applicants with such disabilities.in such cases,applicants may possess the ability to solve a particular problem,but be unable to do so because the time constraint placed by the testing agency does not allow them sufficient time to decode the question asked.on the other hand,the value of standardized tests lies in the ability to compare the relative scores of different applicants.if accommodations alter what is being tested,the comparability of scores may be compromised and the person receiving the accommodations may receive a benefit not given to a person taking the test under standard conditions.
when aamc is presented with a request for accommodations on the mcat,it reviews that request under the standards set by the ada.under the ada,a person claiming a right to reasonable accommodations for a disability must demonstrate a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.a,italics added.thus,an mcat applicant with a learning disability or adhd would have to demonstrate that the disability or condition substantially limits the major life activities of reading or test taking.
plaintiffs andres turner,anne cashmore,brendan pierce and david lebovitz are california residents with learning disabilities adhd who applied to take the mcat in california in.they each requested more time a private room in which to take the test.aamc denied plaintiffs requests,after which they filed this class action lawsuit alleging state law violations of the unruh act and dpa,the complaint alleged that plaintiffs requests for accommodations should have been considered under these state laws,which define disability more broadly than the ada to include a mental,psychological or physical condition that limits a major life activity,that makes the achievement of the major life activity difficult,subd.e,subd.b,subds.i b k b ii.
aamc did not dispute that that the california definition of disability as one that limits a major life activity by making it difficult is more inclusive than the ada substantially limits standard.see colmenares braemar country club,cal th,d.instead,aamc took the position that application of the california standard was not appropriate because the mcat was a nationwide test and accommodation requests had to be evaluated under the same standard throughout the country.as an affirmative defense,aamc claimed the unruh act and dpa did not apply because the use of the state law standard of disability for california residents taking the mcat in california would violate the commerce clause of the federal constitution.aamc also took the position that aamc was not a business establishment within the meaning of the unruh act,that an unruh act claim could not succeed absent a showing of intentional discrimination,that the dpa only guaranteed access to physical facilities,and that neither the unruh act nor the dpa required reasonable accommodations on a standardized test.
the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the commerce clause defense,concluding the application of the california standard of disability to mcat applicants would not unduly burden interstate commerce relative to the important public interest served by the state civil rights statutes.it denied a motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by aamc,ruling that the unruh act and dpa applied to the administration of the mcat and required aamc to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals who were disabled under their provisions.the court also granted plaintiff motion for class certification for the limited purpose of determining whether aamc must apply california law to the members of the defined class.the court declined to resolve the individual claims of any class member or to specify the accommodations necessary on a classwide basis 
following a bench trial to determine appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief,the court issued a detailed statement of decision including the following orders aamc must apply the unruh act and dpa to california residents applying for testing accommodations on the mcat aamc must provide reasonable accommodations that do not otherwise fundamentally alter the mcat to persons with established disabilities as defined under the unruh act and dpa and aamc must submit to the court within days a report reflecting its development of internal procedures for considering accommodation requests under the unruh act and dpa.plaintiffs were designated the prevailing parties under civil code section and code of civil procedure section for the purpose of seeking attorney fees and costs.
the court later awarded plaintiffs approximately in attorneys fees and costs under civil code section in prejudgment legal fees based on a lodestar award of times a multiplier of,in fees for their work preparing the motion for legal fees,and in costs.aamc appeals.
ii.discussion 
introduction and standard of review 
aamc argues that neither the unruh act nor the dpa require it to provide testing accommodations to disabled individuals taking a standardized test such as the mcat.the trial court ruling that the unruh act and dpa applied to the mcat was made in the context of an order denying aamc motion for judgment on the pleadings.such an order would not,typically,amount to a final resolution of this issue,but it was reiterated in the statement of decision following the court trial and was treated by the court and the parties as dispositive.in any event,because the relevant facts are not in dispute and because the interpretation of the unruh act and dpa is an issue of law,we review de novo the court ruling that those statutes apply to the administration of the mcat in california.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.as explained below,we conclude that neither statute applies to aamc consideration of accommodation requests for learning and disabilities.
b.the unruh act does not require the alteration of standardized testing conditions to accommodate applicants with learning and disabilities 
the unruh act prohibits discrimination based on a person membership in a particular group all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,subd.b.whoever denies,aids or incites a denial,or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to the unruh act is liable for damages and penalties,subd.a.injunctive relief is also available and may extend to all persons similarly situated to the plaintiff.vargas hampson cal d,burks poppy construction cal d.
despite its broad application,the unruh act does not extend to practices and policies that apply equally to all persons this section shall not be construed to confer any right or privilege on a person that is conditioned or limited by law or that is applicable alike to persons of every sex,color,race,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation,subd.c harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,harris.a policy that is neutral on its face is not actionable under the unruh act,even when it has a disproportionate impact on a protected class.harris,at,belton comcast cable holdings,llc th,d belton.
in harris,the plaintiffs were prospective tenants who brought an action under the unruh act against a landlord who required that they have a minimum income of three times the amount of rent.harris,supra,cal d at.after rejecting the argument that economic discrimination was cognizable under the unruh act,our supreme court considered the alternative claim of gender discrimination based on a theory that the minimum income requirement had a disproportionate effect on women,who made less money on average than did men.harris,at.it noted that the language of the damages provision of section referred to denying,aiding and inciting the denial of access to public accommodations point ed to an emphasis on intentional discrimination and implied the need for willful,affirmative misconduct on the part of those who violate the act.harris,at.moreover,the act explicitly exempts standards that are applicable alike to persons of every sex,color,race.by its nature,an adverse impact claim challenges a standard that is applicable alike to all such persons based on the premise that,notwithstanding its universal applicability,its actual impact demands scrutiny.if the legislature had intended to include adverse impact claims,it would have omitted or at least qualified this language in section.harris,at.
in koebke bernardo heights country club cal th,d,the lesbian partner of a woman who belonged to a private country club was denied club privileges available to members spouses.id.at,d.she filed a lawsuit claiming that this policy amounted to discrimination based on sexual orientation because same sex couples could not legally marry at that time.id.at,d.the court reaffirmed that that an unruh act violation requires more than a disparate impact on a particular group and concluded the plaintiff could not state a claim under this theory when the policy extended to all unmarried couples,regardless of their sexual orientation 
a disparate impact claim predicated on disability was rejected in belton,in which plaintiffs who were blind complained that a cable company policy of packaging its music services with television programming was discriminatory because sighted persons could fully use the television whereas blind persons could not.belton,supra,th at,d.citing harris and koebke,the court concluded the challenged policy did not violate the unruh act because it applied equally to all customers and did not target those with visual disabilities,even if it had a disparate effect on the latter group.belton,at,d.
in this case,aamc has established certain standards for the administration of the mcat,including a time limit for each section of the test.these standards are neutral and extend to all applicants regardless of their membership in a particular group.plaintiffs claim under the unruh act is effectively an argument that these general policies are discriminatory because they have a disparate impact on those with learning and disabilities,who have a more difficult time taking tests under standard conditions.under harris,koebke and belton,this disparate impact analysis can not be the basis for an unruh act claim.whatever entitlements the plaintiffs may have to testing accommodations under other civil rights statutes,the trial court erred in concluding that aamc standardized procedures implicate the unruh act,at least as applied to individuals with learning and disabilities seeking additional time or similar accommodations when taking the mcat.
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish harris,koebke and belton on the ground that their claim is based on aamc failure to provide reasonable accommodations,rather than on the disparate impact of its policies.they rely primarily on two federal decisions holding that a claim based on failure to provide reasonable accommodations as required by the ada did not additionally require proof of disparate treatment or disparate impact.mcgary city of portland cir,and henrietta bloomberg cir.
these cases are inapposite because they were decided under the ada,which not only protects against disparate treatment,but also creates an affirmative duty in some circumstances to provide special,preferred treatment,or reasonable accommodation.dunlap association of bay area governments.while it is true that plaintiffs are seeking reasonable accommodations for their learning and disabilities,it does not follow that such preferred treatment or accommodations are required under unruh act in the face of the language in civil code section,subdivision c.
this does not mean that disabled persons in california may not seek reasonable accommodations for their learning and disabilities when taking a standardized test.the unruh act does indirectly penalize a failure to grant reasonable accommodations in civil code section,subdivision f,which incorporates otherwise relevant ada standards as a floor under state law a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of public law shall also constitute a violation of this section.see bass county of butte cir.the ada requires reasonable accommodations on standardized tests for those with qualifying disabilities any person that offers examinations or courses related to applications,licensing,certification,or credentialing for secondary or education,professional,or trade purposes shall offer such examinations or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons with disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for such individuals.see agranoff law school admission council,d.any violation of this ada requirement would also be a violation of the unruh act by virtue of civil code section,subdivision f.
in the context of this case,civil code section,subdivision c and the cases construing it can be readily harmonized with section,subdivision f and the ada provisions it incorporates.simply put,in addressing a claim that a facially neutral testing policy has a disparate impact on persons with learning
