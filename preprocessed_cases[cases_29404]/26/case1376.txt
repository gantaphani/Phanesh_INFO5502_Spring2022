rejecting statutory terms,such as immorality,unprofessional conduct,or moral turpitude as overly broad to use as grounds for discipline of public school teachers,the california supreme court created its own test to assess whether a misbehaving teacher is fit to teach.morrison state board of education cal d,morrison.we must apply that test here.
plaintiff shirley marie broney is an elementary school teacher.between and,she was convicted of three drunken driving offenses.defendant california commission on teacher credentialing the commission took note,held a hearing,found plaintiff was unfit to teach,and suspended her teaching credential for days.it stayed that suspension subject to plaintiff successfully completing a probation.
plaintiff petitioned for extraordinary relief from the commission decision,but the trial court denied her petition.it found her latest conviction rendered her unfit to teach per se.it also determined upon weighing the evidence under the morrison test that the commission discipline was not arbitrary or unreasonable.
plaintiff appeals,claiming the trial court erred by applying a per se rule.she also asserts no substantial evidence could support the commission decision.we agree with plaintiff that the trial court applied the wrong test.however,its error was not prejudicial.it is not reasonably probable that the court would have reached a different result had it applied the morrison test to the issue of fitness to teach instead of a per se test,as its analysis of the commission discipline under the morrison test demonstrates plaintiff was unfit to teach.we thus affirm the judgment.

credentialing history 
plaintiff first applied to the commission in for character and identification clearance.in this application,plaintiff disclosed to the commission her conviction.
in,shortly after her second dui conviction,plaintiff applied to the commission for a teaching credential.in this application,plaintiff disclosed her conviction and sentence.
the commission granted plaintiff her credential effective may.the credential authorized plaintiff to teach multiple subject matter classes in a classroom in grades and below.this credential was valid until june.subsequently,the commission renewed plaintiff credential effective june,until june.plaintiff also holds a,language and academic development certificate authorizing her to teach students.
at the time of her third arrest and conviction in,plaintiff was employed by the westminster school district in orange county as a grade teacher.she had worked for the district since.
commission disciplinary accusation,hearing and decision 
nearly two years after her conviction,plaintiff was notified by letter dated june,that the commission had begun an investigation into her fitness to hold a credential as a result of her three dui convictions.ultimately,the commission found cause to recommend a suspension of her credential.on november,plaintiff requested an administrative hearing to challenge the recommendation.
another two years passed until november,when plaintiff was served with an accusation issued by the commission executive director.the accusation alleged plaintiff arrest and conviction constituted unprofessional conduct and subjected her to discipline.it asked for plaintiff credential to be suspended for a minimum of days.
evidence presented at hearing 
the matter was heard by administrative law judge alj joseph montoya on june.the commission evidence of unprofessional conduct and unfitness to teach consisted solely of police and government reports attesting to plaintiff three prior convictions and documentation of her credentials.
plaintiff case consisted of her testimony,the testimony and report of a licensed substance abuse counselor,dan cronin,and the testimony and evaluations of plaintiff school principal,linda reed.in her testimony,plaintiff admitted her three dui convictions she denied being an alcoholic,missing school because of drinking,working with a hangover,or showing up to school drunk.she acknowledged she had made some really bad choices,and stated she will never,ever drink and drive again because i have too much to lose.
on,plaintiff agreed that maintaining the integrity of the teaching profession was important,and that teachers acted as role models.she stated only two other people knew of her conviction a fellow teacher and her principal.she stated she drinks on occasion,such as having a glass of wine when she goes out to dinner at a nice restaurant,but she does not drink and drive,even if all she has had is a glass of wine.
counselor cronin was hired by plaintiff to determine if she had a substance abuse problem and,if she did,the most appropriate level of treatment for her.cronin concluded plaintiff was not an alcoholic,had a low probability of substance dependence,and that she did not need any kind of therapy for alcohol abuse.his conclusion was based on an assessment of her he performed by telephone,an assessment performed by one of his staff members,another assessment performed by a second substance abuse counselor,and on an evaluation of her performed by a psychologist,jerry brown.
brown had found plaintiff to be psychologically normal and high functioning.he found plaintiff had some probability of acting out,but was of the opinion plaintiff was fit to teach.plaintiff does not drink during the week and limits her drinking to the weekend,usually with dinner.in a period of time,she drinks from one to three drinks of alcohol.the largest amount she consumed on any particular day was four drinks.cronin attached brown report to his report.
under,cronin explained that a probability of acting out was similar to someone who might speed,or who might make the mistake of drinking and driving,you know,somebody that more extroverted.
the administrative law judge asked cronin why he did not think plaintiff was likely to drink and drive again if she has a propensity for acting out.cronin stated he believed she learned her lesson,that she is remorseful,and that she consistent enough in all of her answers,and all of her testing show that she has learned her lesson.
principal reed described plaintiff as a very dedicated and talented teacher who works well with children.plaintiff holds her students accountable to high standards,and most of her students will meet grade level expectations before the end of the year.she works very hard and is passionate about what she does.if anything,her flaw is caring too much about her work.
reed,whose father was an alcoholic and who had experience dismissing employees because of alcoholism,was familiar with the signs of alcoholism and its adverse effects on a person employment.in her experience,alcoholic employees missed fridays and mondays,came in late,left early,took naps during the day,had red bloodshot eyes,staggered around,were ill prepared and angry,and took inappropriate actions with children.reed saw nothing remotely close to these traits in plaintiff work ethic.and,no student or parent had ever asked about plaintiff dui convictions.
each time reed had formally evaluated plaintiff as a teacher,she determined plaintiff performed satisfactorily in every area.reed continued to stand by her evaluations of plaintiff at the hearing.indeed,in many of the reviewed areas of performance,reed would have graded plaintiff as exemplary,but the form used for evaluations allowed the reviewer to state only that the teacher performance was satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
on,reed agreed that teachers acted as role models.reed believed plaintiff had made three very poor choices,but she did not see how they impacted the teaching and learning of children.she did agree,however,it was important how a teacher acted outside of school,and that a teacher who drank and drove,and who was arrested and convicted of dui,engaged in unprofessional conduct.
alj and commission decisions 
upon reviewing the evidence,the alj determined the commission had failed to prove unprofessional conduct,and he recommended the accusation be dismissed.the alj stated that discipline may not be imposed unless the conduct is substantially related to the person fitness to teach,citing morrison,supra,cal d.he also cited the seven factors set out in morrison and at title,section,of the california code of regulations which the commission is to use to determine whether a sufficient nexus exists between the teacher conduct and her fitness to teach.however,the alj did not reach the issue of whether a sufficient nexus had been shown in this case.he determined the commission evidence,consisting only of the fact of plaintiff convictions,failed to show how her actions constituted unprofessional conduct because it did not establish that her conduct violated any rules or ethical codes of the teaching profession 
the commission rejected the alj proposed decision.at its march,meeting,the commission adopted its own decision and order,and it determined plaintiff had committed unprofessional conduct and her conduct indicated she was unfit to teach.unlike the alj,the commission relied upon the morrison factors set out in greater detail below to determine whether plaintiff misconduct rendered her unfit to teach.it concluded her conduct did,in fact,render her unfit to teach.the commission suspended plaintiff credentials for days,and it stayed the suspension subject to plaintiff successful completion of a probationary period.
the conditions of probation required plaintiff to undergo a psychiatric evaluation and,if needed,continuing therapy leading to a positive evaluation to obey all federal,state,and local laws and to submit quarterly reports to the commission certifying under penalty of perjury her compliance with all probation conditions.
trial court proceedings 
plaintiff petitioned the sacramento county superior court for a writ of administrative mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.she claimed the commission abused its discretion mainly in that its findings were not supported by the weight of the evidence.in particular,she challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the commission finding under the morrison factors that plaintiff conduct rendered her unfit to teach.plaintiff also sought attorney fees pursuant to government code section and code of civil procedure sections et and et.
the trial court denied plaintiff petition.it determined plaintiff convictions demonstrated unfitness to teach as a matter of law,or per se,under the rule of watson state bd.of education d,watson.thus,it found it unnecessary to reach plaintiff argument that no evidence supported the commission findings under the morrison factors.
nevertheless,the trial court stated the morrison factors were relevant for reviewing the propriety of the discipline imposed by the commission.it reviewed the commission findings under the morrison factors and determined the findings were supported by the weight of the evidence.it thus concluded the penalty imposed by the commission did not constitute an abuse of discretion.the court entered judgment against plaintiff and denied her requests for attorney fees.
plaintiff appeals the judgment against her.she claims the trial court erred by adopting a per se test for determining fitness to teach in lieu of applying the morrison factors,and by limiting the morrison factors to its review of the reasonableness of the penalty.she also asserts that when the morrison factors are properly applied to her case,no substantial evidence supports a finding of unfitness to teach.
discussion 
istandard of review 
when a trial court rules on a petition for writ of mandate following a license revocation or suspension,it must exercise its independent judgment to determine whether the weight of the evidence supported the administrative decision.citations.after the trial court has exercised its independent judgment upon the weight of the evidence,an appellate court function is solely to decide whether credible,competent evidence supports the trial court judgment.yakov board of medical examiners cal d,the question before this court turns upon whether the evidence reveals substantial support,contradicted or uncontradicted,for the trial court conclusion.finnerty board of registered nursing th.

use of per se rule of unfitness to teach 
plaintiff claims the trial court erred when it adopted a per se rule of unfitness to teach.she asserts supreme court case law prohibits the application of a per se rule in a matter such as this,and watson at best established rebuttable inferences a court could consider in addition to the morrison factors.we agree with plaintiff on this point,but we ultimately conclude any error was not prejudicial.
legal background 
the commission is authorized to revoke or suspend a teacher credentials for immoral or unprofessional conduct or for any cause that would have warranted the denial of an application for a credential or the renewal thereof,or for evident unfitness for service.
however,i n order to satisfy constitutional due process,t he state power to regulate a profession can not be used arbitrarily to penalize conduct having no demonstrable bearing upon fitness for its practice.cartwright board of chiropractic examiners cal d.thus,conduct used as a basis for revocation or suspension of a professional license must demonstrate unfitness to practice that profession.ibid.
in morrison,supra,cal d,a public school teacher resigned after it became known he engaged in a homosexual relationship with another teacher.thereafter the state board of education revoked his life diplomas pursuant to education code former section,which authorized discipline for immoral or unprofessional conduct.morrison,at,fn.see also id.at.the supreme court concluded terms such as immoral,unprofessional,or involving moral turpitude are too broad and amorphous to be used as a basis for the termination of a professional license.rather,it must be shown the conduct in question indicates an unfitness to engage in the profession.
the court explained terms such as immoral or unprofessional conduct or moral turpitude stretch over so wide a range that they embrace an unlimited area of conduct.in using them the legislature surely did not mean to endow the employing agency with the power to dismiss any employee whose personal,private conduct incurred its disapproval.hence the courts have consistently related the terms to the issue of whether,when applied to the performance of the employee on the job,the employee has disqualified himself.morrison,supra,cal d at.the court concluded the state board of education could not abstractly characterize the conduct in the case as immoral,unprofessional,or involving moral turpitude within the meaning of education code former section unless that conduct indicated the petitioner was unfit to teach.morrison,at.watson superior court th.
the morrison court went on to establish seven factors an administrative agency such as the commission should utilize to determine whether the unprofessional conduct demonstrated unfitness to teach in determining whether the teacher conduct thus indicates unfitness to teach the board may consider such matters as the likelihood that the conduct may have adversely affected students or fellow teachers,and the degree of such adversity anticipated,the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct,the type of teaching certificate held by the party involved,the extenuating or aggravating circumstances,if any,surrounding the conduct,the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct,the likelihood of the recurrence of the questioned conduct,and the extent to which disciplinary action may inflict an adverse impact or chilling effect upon the constitutional rights of the teacher involved or other teachers.these factors are relevant to the extent that they assist the board in determining whether the teacher fitness to teach,in determining whether the teacher future classroom performance and overall impact on his students are likely to meet the board standards.morrison,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.
the commission may also take into account the notoriety and publicity accorded a teacher conduct.board of education jack cal d,fn.jack.moreover,if the teacher conduct is sufficiently notorious that the students know or are likely to learn of it,and if the teacher continues to model his past conduct,the commission may infer that the teacher conduct may result in student emulation,but such an inference is disputable,at and fn.
as explained above,the trial court was to determine whether the weight of the evidence supported the commission findings.here,the trial court concluded it was not necessary in this case to weigh the evidence under the morrison factors to determine if plaintiff actions rendered her unfit to teach.rather,it concluded under watson that plaintiff convictions rendered her unfit to teach per se.this was incorrect.
a teacher whose credential is being investigated for possible adverse action is per se unfit to teach only when the teacher has been convicted of a crime which the legislature has declared requires the imposition of automatic sanctions on that teacher credentials.jack,supra,cal d at,fn.pettit state board of education cal d.in all other circumstances,fitness to teach is a question of ultimate fact.jack,supra,cal d at,fn.west community college dist.concepcion cal.app th.
driving under the influence is not an offense specified by the legislature as sufficient per se to justify suspension or revocation of teaching credentials.see,subd.a conviction of listed serious felonies requires automatic revocation,subd.a conviction of certain sex offenses and controlled substance offenses requires automatic suspension.
thus,the trial court erred in concluding plaintiff driving under the influence convictions rendered her unfit to teach per se.plaintiff was entitled to a fitness hearing where the trier of fact weighed the morrison factors to determine whether she was unfit to teach on account of her unprofessional conduct.jack,supra,cal d at.
the trial court reliance on watson as the basis for imposing a per se rule of unfitness based upon plaintiff convictions is misplaced.in watson,the second appellate district court of appeal affirmed a trial court determination that an applicant for a teaching credential who had six alcohol convictions over a period,and a seventh while his application was pending,was unfit to teach.watson,supra,d at.the only evidence of unfitness to teach was the applicant convictions,and the appellate court held they were sufficient evidence to demonstrate unfitness.id.at.
the watson court holding was based in part on its belief that morrison was a narrow decision,limited to its facts watson,supra,d at.more than five years after watson was decided,however,the supreme court reaffirmed its morrison ruling and expanded its application.in jack,the high court stated morrison applied not only to a credential revocation but also to a proceeding for dismissal of a credentialed teacher on the basis of immoral or unprofessional conduct.jack,supra,cal d at,fn.in addition,the court stated that morrison made it clear that the fitness hearing could not be limited to the single question whether the teacher committed the charged criminal act.id.at,fn.omitted.a person convicted of a crime not listed as requiring automatic sanction is entitled to a fitness hearing that determines fitness based on the morrison factors.ibid.to the extent watson holds otherwise,we decline to follow it.
having now concluded the trial court erred in applying a per se rule,we must determine whether the error was prejudicial.as we will explain,it was not.
lack of prejudicial error 
a judgment may not be reversed on appeal unless after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,it appears the error caused a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.when the error is one of state law only,it generally does not warrant reversal unless there is a reasonable probability that in the absence of the error,a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached.citation.soule general motors cal th.
to apply this standard,we review the record to determine if an error of law was prejudicial when considered in light of the weight of the evidence.and the process is,in a sense,a review of facts.witkin,cal.procedure,supra.
in this matter,we can say without hesitation there is not a reasonable probability plaintiff would have received a more favorable judgment had the trial court not applied a per se rule to determine her fitness to teach.we know this because the trial court,in addition to applying a per se rule,weighed the evidence under the morrison factors.although it did this in the context of determining the reasonableness of the penalty,it weighed all of the evidence and performed the same analysis it would have performed had it applied the morrison factors to the issue of plaintiff fitness to teach.it determined the weight of the evidence supported the commission findings of fact under the morrison factors.we reach the same conclusion.
only the pertinent morrison factors need to be analyzed.west community college dist.concepcion,supra,th at.the trial court reviewed six of the seven.we will do the same.
factor likelihood that plaintiff conduct may have adversely affected students or teachers.the evidence supports the trial court finding that plaintiff behavior and conviction may have adversely affected students or teachers.there is conflicting evidence on this point.plaintiff testified that only a coworker and her principal knew of the conviction.the principal also stated plaintiff was an excellent teacher who had never exhibited traits of alcoholism at work.however,plaintiff was required to wear an ankle bracelet at school to fulfill her sentence.students may have seen her wearing the bracelet.morrison asks us to focus on the likelihood that this conduct may have adversely affected students and other teachers.morrison,supra,cal d at.we agree
