the university of hawaii denied secondary education candidate mark oyama application to become a student teacher,a prerequisite for recommendation to the state of hawaii teacher certification board.this appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment to the university implicates the constitutional balance between two prerogatives of a public university professional certification program promoting open discourse among its students and limiting certification to candidates suitable for entry into a particular profession.we must delineate the scope of the university authority to deny a teaching candidate student teaching application on the basis of the candidate speech.we conclude that the university did not violate oyama first amendment rights because its decision related directly to defined and established professional standards,was narrowly tailored to serve the university core mission of evaluating oyama suitability for teaching,and reflected reasonable professional judgment.in addition,because the university provided adequate procedural protections in denying oyama application,neither it nor its agents violated oyama procedural due process rights.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the university.
mark oyama earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the california institute of technology,followed by a master degree in physics from the university of hawaii.he then enrolled in the university of hawaii secondary education certification program at manoa.
hawaii post baccalaureate certificate in secondary education program 
under hawaii law,n o person shall serve as a or teacher in a public school without first having obtained a license.the purpose of teacher licensing,or certification,is to ensure that education professionals possess the appropriate training,preparation,and competencies for teaching.of haw.at manoa,secondary teacher education program handbook handbook.
the university of hawaii at manoa is hawaii only nationally accredited institution that recommends students for certification as secondary school teachers.id.at i.the university offers a post baccalaureate certificate in secondary education pbcse program the program to students who have bachelor degrees and wish to obtain certification as secondary school teachers according to the program handbook,the program goal is to employ and prepare educators who are knowledgeable,effective,and caring professionals.id.at.the caring component seeks to advanc e social justice and overcom e both discrimination and oppression and requires a high level of professionalism demonstrated through ethical behavior,competence,reflection,fairness,respect for diversity,and a commitment to inclusion and social responsibility.id.at.the program requirements include coursework and one semester of student teaching.admission to the program does not guarantee admission to student teaching.rather,students must submit a student teaching application and must meet all student teaching requirements set forth in the program handbook.for example,a student teacher must a ct,speak,and dress like a teacher.
the program student teaching requirements reflect the many regulations and policies governing admission to the teaching profession in hawaii.first,the university must comply with the hawaii department of education policies and regulations.pursuant to department of education policy,for example,the university may approve candidates for student teaching only upon verification of their ability to function effectively in department classrooms.second,the university must comply with the hawaii teacher standards board htsb teacher licensing and ethical standards.htsb standards require teachers to,among other things,protect student safety,create an inclusive learning environment for all students,and demonstrate professionalism.finally,the university is required to uphold the standards of its accrediting organization,the national council for accreditation of teacher education ncate.see council for accreditation of teacher,standards for professional development schools explaining that accredited institutions must develop criteria consistent with state and national standards for candidates admission to and completion of the preparation program and make recommendations for candidate certification based on the standards.
oyama performance in the pbcse program 
in the summer of,oyama enrolled in the university pbcse program.oyama began his coursework and completed a field experience practicum at a local middle school.during this period,several faculty members separately contacted program administrators to express their concerns about oyama suitability for the teaching profession.
oyama statements concerning sexual relationships between adults and children were of central concern to the faculty.while taking ratliffe class on educational psychology adolescence and education,oyama was assigned to write a reflection about a video entitled growing up online.oyama wrote 
personally,i think that online child predation should be legal,and find it ridiculous that one could be arrested for comments they make on the internet.i even think that real life child predation should be legal,provided that the child is consentual sic.basically from my point of view,the age of consent should be either,or whatever age a child is when puberty begins.
when ratliffe discussed these statements with oyama,he said that it would be fine for a student to have a consensual relationship with a teacher.when ratliffe explained that state law would require oyama to report such conduct,oyama stated that he would obey the law and report the relationship,but still believed that such a consensual relationship was not wrong.ratliffe contacted the director of the secondary program,moniz,about these statements,explaining that,while she did not mind that oyama has opinions that are different from other people,she was concerned that oyama may not be aware of and in agreement with safety issues about the adolescents who will be in his care.she cautioned that,because of his lack of sensitivity to and empathy with others and lack of at this time,we should be very careful about accepting him as a teacher candidate.
another concern stemmed from oyama comments about teaching students with disabilities.for example,in his class on educating exceptional students in regular classrooms secondary,oyama expressed the belief that if the disability is sufficiently severe and not of a physical nature there is little benefit to inclusion for the disabled student in the classroom environment.oyama also wrote that it is not reasonable to expect secondary school teachers to have the extremely diverse skillset needed to teach the range of grade levels presented in a mainstream classroom that includes students with learning disabilities.in another assignment,oyama asserted that nine of ten special education students he encountered were fakers and explained that he was not convinced that many disabilities are actual disabilities or neurological conditions,but are rather the crude opinions of psychologists and psychiatrists.siegel,oyama professor,informed moniz of his serious concerns regarding mark oyama entering the teaching profession.siegel also noted his concern to oyama,clarifying that his concern was not based on siegel opinion,but rather on legal standards and his understanding,based on his years as an educator,of the criteria schools consider in evaluating prospective teachers 
oyama performance in a field experience program at a nearby middle school corroborated many of his professors concerns.in the field experience evaluation form,several dispositions are listed,which are evaluated as unacceptable,acceptable,or target,the highest rating oyama received multiple ratings of unacceptable and no ratings of target.in the accompanying evaluation,oyama received an unacceptable rating as to the ability to teach effectively,work collaboratively with colleagues,respond to suggestions from supervisors,and demonstrate the level of professionalism expected of middle school teachers.oyama supervising instructor,irv king,concluded,my overall impression is that mark would not do well as a middle school teacher.
denial of admission to the student teaching program 
in january,oyama applied to the pbcse student teaching program.in a letter dated july,moniz informed oyama his application had been denied.while noting that oyama had clearly met the minimum academic requirements,moniz explained the university duty,pursuant to department of education policy,to verify your overall ability to function effectively as a teacher in a hawaii department of education school.moniz noted that a number of factors raised the college of education concern,specifying several bases for the university decision.he explained 
t he views you have expressed regarding students with disabilities and the appropriateness of sexual relations with minors were deemed not in alignment with standards set by the hawaii department of education,the national council for the accreditation of teachers ncate and the hawaii teacher standards board htsb.
moniz further explained that oyama endorsement of sexual relationship s between adults and minors,as well as between teachers and students was in tension with hawaii department of education rules expressly prohibiting sexual contact between teachers and students or minors,see haw.admin.rules,and with the htsb requirement that teachers protect students safety,see htsb code of ethics,principle i.in sum,moniz found that oyama understanding of sexual relationships between adults and minors,as well as between teachers and students,was contrary to the legal and ethical guidelines imposed by the state.moniz wrote that s uch a matter is serious enough in nature that,taken alone,it warrants a denial of you sic student teaching application emphasis added.
moniz added,however,that other issues support the denial of your application.he recounted several comments by oyama that demonstrated a lack of empathy and understanding of students with disabilities.he noted that these comments,along with your professor assessment that you have been unable to demonstrate any sort of willingness to accommodate students with disabilities,were in opposition to htsb and ncate standards.moniz specifically discussed the inconsistency between,for example,oyama expressed view that if a disability is sufficiently severe and not of a physical nature there is little benefit to inclusion for the disabled student and both an htsb standard requiring teachers to p rovide services to students in a nondiscriminatory manner and an ncate standard requiring teachers to demonstrate professional dispositions necessary to teach all students,including those with exceptionalities.oyama had therefore been unable to demonstrate the requisite professional disposition to enter the teaching profession.
finally,citing the htsb right to deny licensing to teachers who exhibit any behavior that is in opposition to the standards and ethics imposed by the state,moniz noted the unacceptable ratings in oyama field experience evaluation,which corroborated oyama professors concerns.moniz concluded,w e are not able to verify your overall ability to function effectively in a school setting at this time,we do not feel that you meet basic htsb standards or standards for the profession set by our accreditors.
oyama administrative appeal 
oyama first responded to moniz denial letter in a july,letter to moniz and the academic grievance committee seeking an amicable remedy.while disputing moniz conclusions based on his statements,oyama noted that any statements he had made were in an academic,intellectual setting.he argued that the university had violated his right of free speech and violated its own rules by failing to give him timely notice and not obtaining his signature on the field evaluation form.nevertheless,oyama proposed that the college of education refund all tuition payments in exchange for his forfeiting all credits grades,and he would not become a classroom teacher.moniz rejected this offer and advised oyama of his right to appeal in writing via the office of the dean of students.
oyama next timely appealed the denial of his student teaching application by filing an academic grievance complaint with the dean of the college of education,christine sorensen.dean sorensen reviewed the decision and convened a committee,including officials from within and outside the college of education,to investigate and review oyama academic grievance complaint.the committee interviewed oyama and three professors of oyama choice.
on november,the grievance committee issued its report and findings to dean sorensen for her consideration.the report concluded that oyama should not be allowed to student teach since dispositions as well as comments and statements made during classes and our interview are serious matters of concern.it also found that the university committed two violations of its own procedures it failed to timely notify oyama of the standards for advancement in the academic program,and it failed to provide oyama with his field experience evaluations.
in a letter dated december,dean sorensen informed oyama of her final decision.citing the standards approved by the state for hawaii teachers and the ncate standards under which the licensing programs operate,dean sorensen concluded that i the department had provided a proper basis for rejecting oyama application to student teach ii the university provided oyama notice of the applicable standards in the program handbook and other documents and iii the university should have notified oyama about its dispositional concerns in a timely manner to allow him to make an informed decision about his future in the program and avoid incurring additional expenses.dean sorensen accordingly proposed reimbursing oyama for certain expenses and allowing him to withdraw from certain courses,on the condition that oyama release all claims related to his participation in the program dean sorensen emphasized the university responsibility to ensure that candidates in the teacher education program meet all standards and to recommend an individual to the licensing agency only when we feel a candidate meets these expectations.
district court proceedings 
oyama rejected that offer.instead,he filed a complaint against the university of hawaii and university officials alleging violations of the first amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment 
granting the university motion for summary judgment,the district court concluded that because the individual did not violate oyama first and fourteenth amendment rights,the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity to analyze oyama first amendment claim,the district court relied upon student speech cases,including the supreme court decision in hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,and judge graber opinion in brown li,cir,which extended hazelwood to the university setting applying these cases,the district court concluded that university administrators had made an academic decision based on professional judgment that was reasonably related to a legitimate pedagogical purpose meeting the hawaii and national teacher standards.echoing judge graber statement that the first amendment does not require an educator to change the assignment to suit the student opinion or to approve the work of a student that,in his or her judgment,fails to meet a legitimate academic standard,brown,at,the district court reasoned that the first amendment does not require defendants to accept plaintiff in a student teaching program if in their judgment he did not meet state and national teaching standards.the district court also concluded that the university afforded oyama adequate procedural due process.oyama timely appeals.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.nigro sears,roebuck,cir.w e may affirm based on any ground supported by the record.johnson riverside healthcare,lp,cir.
first amendment claim 
oyama argues that the university decision to deny his student teaching application violated his first amendment right to freedom of speech.oyama equivocates,however,on the question of which first amendment doctrine applies to his claim.oyama first characterizes the university decision as retaliation for his personal opinions,a characterization evocative of the public employee speech doctrine first recognized in pickering board of education.see id.at addressing the balance between the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.oyama then invokes student speech doctrine,quoting the supreme court classic observation that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines cmty.sch.
we understand the hybrid nature of oyama first amendment claim.on the one hand,oyama was a student in an academic setting.on the other hand,oyama was a candidate for a certification that would allow him to work as a public school teacher.oyama claim defies easy categorization because his position at the university combined the characteristics of both a student and a public employee.
in light of the mixed characteristics of oyama claim,we employee speech doctrines.while both doctrines illuminate certain principles that guide our analysis,we conclude that neither,standing alone,provides an adequate framework for evaluating oyama claim.drawing from both student speech and public employee speech doctrines and from the few decisions of other courts that have confronted free speech claims in the certification context,we conclude that the university did not violate oyama first amendment rights because its decision related directly to defined and established professional standards,was narrowly tailored to serve the university core mission of evaluating oyama suitability for teaching,and reflected reasonable professional judgment.
student speech doctrine 
because oyama was a student when the university denied his student teaching application,we begin by examining the supreme court student speech jurisprudence.as oyama correctly notes,it is clear that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.morse frederick,quoting tinker,at.at the same time,however,a school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission,even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.hazelwood,u.at citation omitted quoting bethel school dist.fraser.
in the seminal student speech case,tinker,the court held that a high school may not suppress its students speech unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.at.tinker involved a group of students who wore black armbands to school in protest of the vietnam war.at.the court held that neither the high school mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,nor its urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression was sufficient to justify a ban on the students silent,passive expression of opinion,unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance.id.at.
since tinker,however,the court has identified several circumstances in which a high school may restrict its students speech.in fraser,the court held that a school district acted entirely within its permissible authority in suspending a high school student for giving a lewd speech at a school assembly.at.in hazelwood,the court held that high school officials may delete potentially inappropriate material from a student newspaper so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.at.most recently,in morse,the court allowed the suspension of a student who held up a banner reading bong hits jesus as the olympic torch passed by,reasoning that schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use.at.all of these cases involved the speech of high school students at school or events.beyond that context,the court has noted only that t here is some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school speech precedents.wynar douglas cty.sch,cir alteration in original quoting morse,at.
the district court evaluated oyama claim within the student speech framework and rejected it under hazelwood,finding that the university action was reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.student speech doctrine does identify certain principles that inform our analysis here.first,the court student speech precedents recognize,to some extent,an institutional rationale for a school decision to regulate its students speech.in morse,for example,the court held that a high school could confiscate the bong hits jesus banner and suspend the student who held it because of the school congressional mandate to prevent illegal drug use among its students.see at.in this case,the university similarly bears an institutional responsibility under state policy and national accreditation standards,it must limit certification recommendations to individuals suitable to enter the teaching profession.this institutional responsibility,like the governmental interest in stopping student drug abuse in morse,may allow the university to deny a student teaching application based on speech demonstrating that the applicant lacks the professional skills and disposition to enter a classroom,even as a student teacher.id.
second,student speech doctrine recognizes a school interest in managing how it lend s its name or its imprimatur to student expression.hazelwood,at.here,this imprimatur concept resonates not because the views of a certification candidate may be erroneously attributed to the school,id.at,but rather because the act of certification forces the university to speak.when the university recommends a student for certification,it communicates to the world that,in its view,that student is fit to practice the profession as a result,the university places its imprimatur on each student it approves to teach.the consequences of that imprimatur are substantial.with the university recommendation,a candidate is eligible to apply for a state teaching license and,so long as he or she satisfies other minimal requirements,to enter the classroom.because the certification process necessarily implicates the university imprimatur,the university is entitled to deference in determining how to lend its name to certification candidates.id.at.
while aspects of student speech doctrine are relevant here,the supreme court has yet to extend this doctrine to the public university setting.see id.at expressly reserving the question of whether the same degree of deference is appropriate with respect to expressive activities at the college and university level.in the years since hazelwood,we too have declined to apply its deferential standard in the university setting.in brown,which involved a university decision not to approve a graduate student thesis because it contained an unprofessional disacknowledgements section,judge graber concluded that hazelwood appears to be the most analogous supreme court case and provides a workable standard for evaluating a university student claim stemming from curricular speech.at.but judge graber approach failed to command a majority of the brown panel.see id.at ferguson,concurring agreeing that brown first amendment claim fails,but not for the reasons expressed by judge graber id.at reinhardt,concurring in part and dissenting in part vehemently disagree ing with judge graber conclusion that hazelwood provides the appropriate first amendment standard for college and graduate student speech.nor has judge graber reasoning been adopted by our precedents since.see,flint dennison,cir w e need not consider whether the principles of hazelwood apply with full force in a university question neither we nor the supreme court have definitively answered.citations omitted.our sister circuits are split on the question of whether hazelwood applies in the university setting.id.at 
this case presents no occasion to extend student speech doctrine to the university setting.under that doctrine,the key rationales for restricting students speech are to ensure that students are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity and learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach.hazelwood,at.neither of these rationales is relevant here.concerns about student maturity can not justify restrictions on speech in this context because certification candidates are adults indeed,a prerequisite for enrollment in the program is graduation from a institution of higher education.see widmar vincent,explaining that u niversity students are young adults and are less impressionable than younger students.mccauley of the,cir considerations of maturity are not nearly as important for university students,most of whom are already over the age of and entrusted with a panoply of rights and responsibilities as legal adults.nor do pedagogical concerns explain why the university denied oyama application on the basis of his speech.hazelwood,at.the university purpose was not to teach oyama any lesson rather,it was to fulfill the university own mandate of limiting certification recommendations to students who meet the standards for the teaching profession.hawaii entrusts the university with the task of verifying a candidate ability to function effectively as an educator in public schools.this institutional responsibility,and not the pedagogical concerns of student speech doctrine,is the reason that the university evaluated or regulated oyama speech.therefore,student speech doctrine does not adequately address the governmental purposes at stake in this context.
furthermore,student speech doctrine fails to account for the vital importance of academic freedom at public colleges and universities.as the supreme court has explained,
the essentiality of freedom in the community of american universities is almost to impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our nation teachers and students must always remain free to inquire,to study and to evaluate,to gain new maturity and understanding otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die.
sweezy new hampshire,see also rodriguez maricopa cty.cmty.coll,cir.the importance of academic freedom at a public university does not disappear when one walks down the hall from a political philosophy seminar to a professional certification program like the university of hawaii.indeed,the progress of our professions,including secondary education,may depend upon the discord and dissent of students training to enter them it is by challenging the inherited wisdom of their respective fields that the next generation of professionals may develop solutions to the problems that vexed their predecessors.rodriguez,at.thus,our analysis of oyama claim would be constitutionally deficient if it did not reflect the special niche universities occupy in our constitutional tradition.grutter bollinger.the court student speech cases provide no basis for doing so 
public employee speech doctrine 
oyama alternatively suggests that the university denial of his student teaching application was analogous to an employer act of retaliation,which is governed by pickering and its progeny.pickering requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employee speech to balance the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.city of san diego roe,per curiam alteration in original quoting pickering,at.in unraveling the case law since pickering,we have further refined the court balancing test into a inquiry.dahlia rodriguez,cir en banc.we ask 
whether the plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern whether the plaintiff spoke as a private citizen or public employee whether the plaintiff protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action whether the state had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from other members of the general public and whether the state would have taken the adverse employment action even absent the protected speech.
eng cooley,cir the pickering framework give s public employers wide discretion and control over the management of their personnel and internal affairs,nichols dancer,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted,and mandates substantial deference to the government reasonable view of its legitimate interests,bd.of cty.comm rs umbehr.
more explicitly than student speech doctrine,public employee speech doctrine clarifies the university rationale for regulating oyama speech like a government employer,the university must protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission of limiting teacher certification to qualified professionals.johnson poway unified sch,cir quoting roe,at.the pickering balance requires full consideration of the government interest in the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public.connick myers.the court has explained that because g overnment agencies are charged by law with doing particular tasks,the government interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.waters churchill.in its certification role,the university,like a government employer,is charged by law with a particular task here,that of ensuring that licensed teachers have the appropriate training,preparation,and competencies for teaching.id.as the public employee speech cases recognize,the university may constitutionally evaluate or restrict the candidate speech to fulfill its responsibilities to the public and to achieve its institutional objectives.
further,cases addressing the claims of public teachers provide a wealth of wisdom about the standards to which teachers and school officials are held.for example,in melzer board of education,cir,a teacher was an active member of nambla,whose stated goal was to change the laws and attitudes governing sexual activity between men and boys.when his membership became public,many parents and students were outraged.id.at.the second circuit affirmed the school termination of the teacher,concluding that the disruption likely to result from his continued employment would interrupt the children education,impair the school reputation,and impair educationally desirable interdependency and cooperation among parents,teachers,and administrators.id.at.similarly,in craig rich township high school district,cir,a high school guidance counselor wrote a book entitled it her fault,which,among other things,urged women to engage in a certain level of promiscuity before marriage and delved into a comparative analysis of the female genitalia of various races.id.at.the seventh circuit upheld the school termination of the counselor,concluding that the counseling position required the employee to maintain a safe space for his students in order to ensure they remain ed willing to come to him for advice,and that without that environment,the students would not approach him and he could not do his job.id.at.the similarities between the circumstances at issue in these cases and those presented here make public employee speech doctrine an attractive means of analysis for oyama first amendment claim.
however useful public employee speech doctrine may appear,however,it can not control our analysis of oyama first amendment claim.the first and most basic problem is that oyama was not a government employee.in fact,oyama was two steps removed from government employment he was an applicant to a university program that could,in turn,permit him to teach at a secondary school under the supervision of a mentor teacher.even then,only if oyama satisfactorily performed as a student teacher,and met other requirements,would the university recommend him for certification and actual employment by the state.characterizing oyama as a public employee for first amendment purposes would thus require us to extend this doctrine to those who do not yet work for the government but may wish to do so a move we have not yet made.see johnson,at explaining that when a first amendment plaintiff is not a government employee,pickering absence is not only unsurprising,but necessary given oyama status as a student and the attenuated nature of his relationship to government employment,this appeal makes a poor candidate for taking such a fateful step.
the second problem,as with student speech doctrine,is that public employee speech doctrine provides no basis for considering the role of academic freedom at public universities.public employee speech doctrine permits the government to regulate speech that might limit the efficiency of its operations,pickering,at it does not require the government to promote,or even consider,its employees freedom to inquire,to study and to evaluate,to gain new maturity and understanding,sweezy,at.as a student at the university of hawaii,oyama enjoyed greater freedom to test his ideas,critique professional conventions,and develop into a more mature professional than he would as a government employee.to hold oyama to the same standard as we hold public employees would deprive him of rights the first amendment guarantees him as a public university student 
the certification cases 
a third framework for analysis more aptly suits oyama claim a set of decisions of other courts that have considered free speech claims in the certification context.see generally emily gold waldman,university imprimaturs on student speech the certification cases,first amend.the doctrinal bases for these decisions differ some invoke student speech doctrine,some rest on public employee speech doctrine,and at least one presents a new test altogether.though these cases are analyzed under different first amendment doctrines,their substance echoes a common theme the upshot is some deference to the certifying institution,but with significant limitations.
courts generally defer to certification decisions based on defined professional standards.in keeton anderson wiley,cir,for example,the eleventh circuit applied hazelwood to uphold a university decision to sanction a student in a school counseling program for stating that she intended to attempt to convert students from being homosexual to heterosexual.id.at.the university concluded that these statements implied a course of conduct that would violate several provisions of the american counseling association aca code of ethics,which the university must adopt and follow in order to offer an accredited program.id.at.similarly,in hennessy city of melrose,cir,the first circuit applied pickering to uphold the termination of a student teacher for repeatedly interrupting school events with religious proselytizing,such as showing a picture of an aborted fetus to another teacher and storming out of a presentation on art that he considered obscene.id.at.the first circuit noted that the candidate religious outbursts were incompatible with general professional standards for preserving collegiality and respect in the school and,more specifically,with four common teaching competencies required for state certification.id.at.
by contrast,courts are more reluctant to defer to certification decisions based on officials personal disagreement with a student views.in ward polite,cir,for example,the sixth circuit,applying hazelwood,ruled in favor of a student expelled from a counseling degree program for asking her supervisor to refer a gay client to another student counselor.unlike in keeton or hennessy,the university decision appeared to rest on officials personal views,not on professional standards,which instead supported the referral the student requested.id.at.in axson flynn johnson,cir,the tenth circuit adopted a similar methodology to evaluate the first amendment claim of a mormon student who withdrew from the university of utah actor training program after faculty members faulted her for refusing to use obscene language in theatrical performances.the university cited professional acting standards to justify its decision,but record evidence showed that faculty members had expressed their personal disapproval of the student interest in being a good mormon girl.id.at.the tenth circuit held that the university was not entitled to summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the university justification was truly pedagogical or whether it was a pretext for religious discrimination.id.at thus,while these decisions lack a common doctrinal foundation,they appear to provide a rule we find instructive here universities may consider students speech in making certification decisions,so long as their decisions are based on defined professional standards,and not on officials personal disagreement with students views.
application 
drawing from the supreme court student speech and public employee speech precedents and from the decisions of other courts in the certification context,we hold that the university of hawaii decision to deny oyama student teaching application did not offend the first amendment because it related directly to defined and established professional standards,was narrowly tailored to serve the university foundational mission of evaluating oyama suitability for teaching,and reflected reasonable professional judgment.
i directly related to defined and established professional standards 
the university decision was directly related to defined and established professional standards.two sets of professional standards provided the foundation for the university decision one governing sexual relationships with children and another governing the education of disabled students.oyama stated that it would be fine for a year old girl to have a consensual relationship with her teacher,that the age of consent should be either,or whatever age a child is when puberty begins,and that real life child predation should be legal.as the university explained to oyama,however,hawaii department of education rules prohibit sexual contact between teachers and students or minors.see haw.admin.rules.furthermore,the htsb requires all teachers to take all reasonable precautions to protect student safety.see htsb code of ethics,principle to protect a student safety,a secondary school teacher must protect underage students from sexual contact with adults,which may qualify as sexual assault under hawaii law.see.
these standards are established not only in hawaii but also at a national level.according to one study,the laws of over half the states address sexual relationships between educators and students.see caroline hendrie,states target sexual abuse by educators,educ.many states also require school teachers to report suspected sexual abuse of their students.see jason nance philip daniel,protecting students from abuse public school district liability for student sexual abuse under state child abuse reporting laws,educ.the department of education has specifically identified state educator certification regulations as a means to combat the problem of sexual abuse of children.see dep t of,educator sexual misconduct a synthesis of existing literature.
the university decision was also directly related to defined and established professional standards for teaching students with disabilities.oyama characterized special education students as fakers,asserted that it is not reasonable to expect secondary school teachers to teach the students with learning disabilities,and voiced his opposition to the goal of inclusion for the disabled student.as the university explained,however,its national accreditation body mandates that student teachers demonstrate professional dispositions necessary to help all students learn,including students with disabilities.see also professional development schools,supra,at explaining that accredited programs must reflect issues of equity and access to knowledge by diverse learners.moreover,the htsb requires all student teachers to p rovide services to students in a nondiscriminatory manner and a dapt instruction to students differences in development,learning styles,strengths and needs.finally,the public schools of every state must comply with the individuals with disabilities education act idea,which entitles all disabled children to a free public education tailored to their needs.see ex rel.dep t of,cir citing,stat,codified at et.the idea ensures that disabled children will be integrated into society and enhance their personal and their important societal contributions.jg douglas cty.sch,cir.the university correctly identified the clear tension between these standards and oyama statements.
the first amendment does not prevent the university from denying oyama student teaching application after determining that his statements reflected a failure to absorb these defined and established professional standards.both student speech and public employee speech doctrine recognize that the scope of the government authority to regulate speech within its institutions depends upon the objectives those institutions are designed to achieve.see,fraser,at explaining that a high school may regulate speech that would undermine the school basic educational mission roe,at explaining that a public employer may regulate speech to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission connick,at the pickering balance requires full consideration of the government interest in the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public.here,the people of hawaii enacted a law providing that n o person shall serve as a or teacher in a public school without first having obtained a license.hawaii thus established a certification program at the university of hawaii to ensure that education professionals possess the appropriate training,preparation,and competencies for teaching,to limit teacher licenses to knowledgeable,effective,and caring professionals,and to confirm that student teachers a ct,speak,and dress like teachers.to fulfill its responsibilities to the public,the university may evaluate a candidate suitability for teaching based,in part,on his or her speech.specifically,the university evaluation of whether oyama statements are consistent with defined and established professional standards is entirely compatible with the university institutional purpose of evaluating a candidate suitability for the teaching profession.
by focusing on the relationship between the university decision and the standards of the profession in which oyama sought certification,we join the other courts that have considered free speech claims in the certification context,even as we part from most of them in declining to squeeze this case into an existing doctrinal framework that does not quite fit.see,keeton,at upholding a university decision to sanction a graduate student in a school counseling program where the student statements suggested that she would violate several provisions of the american counseling association aca code of ethics,which the university was required to adopt and teach to offer an accredited counseling program ward,at ruling in favor of a student expelled from a counseling degree program where professional standards of ethics did not,as the university argued,prohibit the course of conduct the student proposed to her supervisors tatro,at upholding a university decision to sanction a mortuary sciences program student whose facebook posts conflicted with an established professional conduct standard for mortuary science professionals.these courts have emphasized,as we do,that certification programs are designed to ensure that their students meet the professional standards of their chosen fields.see,keeton,at t he entire mission of the university counseling program is to produce ethical and effective counselors in accordance with the professional requirements of the aca.tatro,at t he primary purpose of the program its mission is to prepare students to be licensed funeral directors and morticians.here,the university certification program is designed for students who possess a baccalaureate degree and wish to obtain eligibility for a license to teach.thus,while we take a different view of the applicability of first amendment doctrine to the certification context,the certification cases further support our conclusion that the university could deny oyama student teaching application where his statements indicated that he had not absorbed,and likely would not comply with,defined and established standards for the teaching profession.
we emphasize that the university did not establish or define these professional standards by fiat.its decision was not,in other words,based on school policies untethered to any external standards,regulations,or statutes governing the profession.instead,the university relied upon standards established by state and federal law,the hawaii department of education,the htsb,and the university national accreditation agency,the ncate.from ratliffe initial conversation with oyama to dean sorensen letter affirming the denial of oyama application,the university framed its concerns about oyama statements by reference to professional standards set beyond the walls of its own institution.the university thus compared oyama speech not to its own idiosyncratic view of what makes a good teacher,but rather to external guideposts that establish the skills and disposition a secondary school teacher must possess.
that oyama did not in fact consummate the acts proscribed by these professional standards does not mean that the university decision to deny his application was not directly related to them.state policy required the university to v erify oyama ability to function effectively in department classrooms before approving his student teaching application.therefore,the university decision was,by necessity,prospective in nature.oyama stood in the doorway of the teaching profession he was not at liberty to step inside and break the house rules.but that does not mean that the university was obligated to invite him in.rather,the university could look to what oyama said as an indication of what he would do once certified.connick,at explaining that a public employer need not wait to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption to the office is manifest before taking action.oyama statements concerning child predation and inclusion of disabled students suggest that he had not internalized basic concepts embodied in the relevant external standards the nature of sexual predation on children,for example,or the importance of including and supporting disabled students.the university need not and,consistent with its mandate under state policy,could not have approved oyama application and sat idly by while his failure to accept basic professional standards led to results these standards were designed to prevent.
for example,with regard to the sexual abuse of children,oyama belief that young children can meaningfully consent to sexual activity with adults,and failure to appreciate the lifelong impact on victims of child sexual abuse,could well impede him from recognizing signs of such abuse in his students or evidence of such abuse by school personnel.his promise to report illegal abuse is therefore beside the point he can only report what he perceives,and his attitudes could well stand in the way of his perception.similarly,with regard to teaching disabled children,the university was entitled to regard oyama insistence that most disabilities are feigned and that requiring high school teachers to educate disabled students is unreasonable as indicators that he would not make the effort to identify students with disabilities or adjust his lessons for individual students whose disabilities require special accommodations.given these legitimate concerns,the university could tak e action and deny oyama application before permitting him to enter the classroom as a student teacher.id.
ii narrowly tailored 
we next ask whether the university decision was narrowly tailored to serve the university purpose of evaluating oyama suitability for the teaching profession.in a variety of contexts,the first amendment requires that restrictions on protected speech be narrowly drawn.see,ward rock against racism,in the context of the government time,place,or manner restrictions,the restriction must be narrowly tailored to serve the government legitimate interests cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,in the commercial speech context,t he regulatory technique may extend only so far as the interest it serves butler michigan,explaining that an overbroad restriction on speech amounts to burn ing the house to roast the pig.b y demanding a close fit between ends and means,the tailoring requirement prevents the government from too readily sacrific ing speech for efficiency.mccullen coakley,quoting riley fed.of blind of.we find such a requirement appropriate in this university setting,which provides the backdrop not only for some speech that the government may legitimately regulate,but also for much of the discord and dissent the first amendment seeks to promote.rodriguez,at.adopting a narrow tailoring requirement in this context,we ensure that the university does not transform its limited discretion to evaluate a certification candidate professional fitness into a license to inhibit the free flow of ideas at public universities.
the university decision was narrowly tailored to serve its goal of employ ing and prepar ing educators who are knowledgeable,effective,and caring professionals.handbook,supra,at.the university decision primarily rested on oyama statements endorsing sexual relationships between children and adults,online and in real life,and his statements expressing apathy towards disabled students and an unwillingness to accommodate their classroom needs.these statements related directly to his suitability for teaching.by contrast,the record does not suggest that the university based its decision on speech unrelated to teaching.the university did not,for example,rely upon several of oyama statements that may seem bizarre but have no relationship to the teaching profession such as his statements that he came from outer space or thinks about suicide every day.nor did the university,based on the record before us,rely on statements addressing social,political,esthetic,moral,and other ideas and experiences that are unrelated to teaching but essential to the marketplace of ideas.sorrell ims health,quoting red lion broad.fcc.thus,rather than relying on any statement,no matter the subject,as a basis for its certification decision,the university limited its focus to oyama statements that directly addressed the roles and responsibilities of aspiring secondary school teachers.
furthermore,the university based its decision only upon statements oyama made in the context of the certification program in the classroom,in written assignments,and directly to the instructors responsible for evaluating his suitability for teaching.for example,oyama asserted that real life child predation should be legal in a written assignment in ratliffe class on educational psychology adolescence and education.when ratliffe spoke to oyama after class,oyama explained that a consensual relationship between a year old girl and another teacher would be fine.similarly,oyama stated that it is not reasonable to expect a secondary school teacher to teach the students with learning disabilities in a written communication to siegel,oyama instructor in educating exceptional students in regular classrooms secondary.there is no evidence that the university relied upon any statements oyama may have made outside this context or communicated to a broader audience.nor is there any evidence that the university attempted to restrict or take any adverse action in response to oyama expressive activities in other contexts,such as meetings with other students or protests to university officials.beyond the limited context in which oyama made the statements that supported the university decision,oyama was free to express his opinions on any subject he wished.accordingly,the university decision did not impose any restriction broader than necessary to achieve its goal of evaluating oyama suitability for teaching.
iii reasonable professional judgment 
we conclude that the first amendment also requires us to ask whether the university decision reflects reasonable professional judgment about oyama suitability for the teaching profession.a reasonableness inquiry is,of course,a common feature of first amendment doctrine.see hazelwood,at student speech connick,at public employee speech see also int l soc.for krishna consciousness,lee,analysis.here,this inquiry is critical because not all inconsistencies between a candidate statements and defined and established professional standards provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the candidate is not suitable to enter the profession.for example,the statement,i hate cleaning my office may be in tension with a professional standard to keep the office tidy but may not be a reasonable basis to conclude that the speaker is not fit to enter the profession absent this inquiry,the university could use professional standards as a pretext for decisions based on officials personal disagreement with the candidate views.as the tenth circuit explained in axson flynn,we would be abdicating our judicial duty if we failed to investigate whether the professional standard was pretextual.at emphasis omitted.in this context,we may defer to the university decision because of its prerogative to evaluate professional competencies and dispositions,not because of a blind faith in the university sense of what views are right or wrong.consistent with this rationale for deference,we may uphold the university decision only if it reflects reasonable professional judgment about oyama suitability for teaching.
the university decision to deny oyama application satisfies this requirement.first,the university had every reason to conclude that oyama statements concerning sexual relationships between teachers and students were serious matters of concern.the supreme court has recognized that sexual abuse unfortunately is an all too common aspect of the educational experience.gebser lago vista indep.sch,see also,richard winton,ex marlborough school teacher admits sexually abusing students,times,martha irvine robert tanner,sexual misconduct plagues schools.post.according to a department of education study,more than million students are subject to sexual misconduct by an employee of a school sometime between kindergarten and grade.educator sexual misconduct,supra,at.the federal government has attributed this problem,in part,to school officials recommendations of teacher candidates despite warning signs of the candidate potential to abuse students.see gov t accountability,gao,k education selected cases of public and private schools that hired or retained individuals with histories of sexual misconduct.in one example highlighted by the government accountability office,school officials recommended a teacher for service despite complaints that he had accessed pornography on school computers the teacher was subsequently convicted of sexually assaulting two students.id.at.a perfectly reasonable way to prevent similar tragedies at hawaii schools is to decline certification to candidates who vocally support sex between teachers and their students.we put aside the risk that oyama would himself abuse a student his statements do not sufficiently support such a prediction,and we see no evidence that the university denied his application on the basis of this risk.rather,the university could reasonably conclude that oyama would fail to perceive,or to exercise the vigilance needed to identify and report,potential or actual sexual abuse of students by other adults.the university recognized these risks and appropriately made a decision,as dean sorensen put it,not to place young children in harm s way.
the university concern with oyama statements regarding disabled students was likewise.congress enacted the individuals with disabilities education act in response to the apparently widespread practice of relegating handicapped children to private institutions or warehousing them in special education classes.haw.dep t of,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.federal and state law mandate a commitment to providing disabled students the services they need and prom
