roderick jackson appeals the dismissal of his complaint alleging that the birmingham board of education the board retaliated against him in violation of title ix of the education amendments of title ix,et,and the regulations implementing it.while employed by the board as the coach of a girl basketball team,jackson complained about practices that he believed discriminated against his team in violation of title ix.the school,he maintains,retaliated against him by removing him from his coaching position.the question before us is whether title ix implies a private right of action in favor of individuals who,although not themselves the victims of gender discrimination,suffer retaliation because they have complained about gender discrimination suffered by others.after review of the text and structure of the statute,we can discern no congressional intent in title ix to create by implication such a private cause of action.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of jackson complaint.
we review de novo an order granting a motion to dismiss the complaint,see mcdonald farm bureau life ins,cir,taking the facts alleged in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see covad communications bellsouth,cir stephens dep t of health human,cir on a motion to dismiss,the facts stated in appellant complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom are taken as true.a motion to dismiss is only granted when the movant demonstrates beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.harper blockbuster entm t,cir quoting conley gibson,d.
according to his complaint,jackson was hired by the board as a physical education teacher and girls basketball coach on or about august.he was transferred to ensley high school in august,where his duties included coaching the girls basketball team.while coaching at ensley,jackson came to believe that the girls team was denied equal funding and equal access to sports facilities and equipment.he complained to his supervisors about the apparent differential treatment and,shortly thereafter,he began receiving negative work evaluations.jackson was ultimately relieved of his coaching duties in may,but remains employed as a tenured physical education teacher.
we assume for purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against jackson for complaining about perceived title ix violations.the only question before us today is whether title ix provides jackson a private right of action and a private remedy against the board for its allegedly retaliatory actions.conceding that title ix creates no private rights of action expressly,see cannon of chicago,d the statute does not expressly authorize a private right of action by a person injured by a violation of,jackson claims that such a right is impliedly created by and of title ix,in conjunction with e,an regulation promulgated by the department of education to enforce title ix.
section of title ix,with certain exceptions not at issue here,provides that n o person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance a 
in section,congress created and authorized an elaborate administrative enforcement scheme for title ix.see davis monroe county bd.of,d pursuant to,any federal department or agency that is empowered to extend federal financial assistance to any education program or activity is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of.to do so,agencies are required to issu e rules,regulations,or orders of general applicability,which do not become effective unless and until approved by the president.id.the primary enforcement mechanism that gives to agencies is cessation of federal funding c ompliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance id.
there are a number of procedural requirements that must be met,however,before an agency may cut off funding.first,an agency must attempt to obtain voluntary compliance with the requirements it has imposed to enforce no action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance can not be secured by voluntary means.id.second,if an agency fails to obtain voluntary compliance,it must hold a hearing regarding any alleged regulatory violation,because only a recipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the record,after opportunity for hearing,of a failure to comply with a regulation enacted pursuant to may have its funding cut off.id.third,even after making an express finding of noncompliance,an agency may not cut off funding unless it files a full written report to the committees of the house and senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved and waits until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.id 
using the authority vested in it by,the department of education promulgated e which prohibits retaliation against anyone who complains of a title ix violation 
no recipient of federal funds or other person shall intimidate,threaten,coerce,or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section of title ix of the act or this part,or because he has made a complaint,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding or hearing under this part.
e emphasis added.
jackson urges that a private right of action ought to be implied in his favor from the statute and,more particularly,from e.we are unpersuaded.for the reasons we make clear below,we hold that neither title ix itself nor e implies a private right of action for retaliation in jackson favor.
our analysis of jackson claim is governed in substantial measure by the supreme court recent decision in alexander sandoval,d,which we explicate fully for three reasons.first,sandoval distills and clarifies the approach we are obliged to follow in determining whether to imply a private right of action from a statute second,sandoval resolved a claim under title vi of the civil rights act of title vi,stat,as amended,et,which is the model for title ix and whose language title ix copies nearly verbatim.see cannon,at.at title ix was patterned after title vi except for the substitution of the word sex in title ix to replace the words race,color,or national origin in title vi,the two statutes use identical language to describe the benefited class.see also id.at nn.at nn.setting forth the legislative history of title ix,which,inter alia,notes that t his is identical language,specifically taken from title vi.because we therefore read titles vi and ix in pari materia,sandoval interpretation of title vi powerfully informs our reading of title ix.third,like jackson,the plaintiffs in sandoval relied on a regulation promulgated to enforce title vi as the basis for implying a private right of action.
in sandoval,the supreme court held that title vi does not imply a right of action for private litigants to sue recipients of federal funds for disparate impact violations.see sandoval,at.at.at issue in sandoval was the claim that the alabama department of public safety policy of administering all tests for drivers licenses in english only has a discriminatory effect on racial minorities.section of title vi provides that n o person in the united states shall,on the ground of race,color,or national origin,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.recognizing that title vi itself reaches only acts of intentional discrimination,see alexander choate,d,the plaintiff in sandoval alleged that alabama restriction violated b,a department of justice regulation promulgated pursuant to of title vi that forbids recipients of federal funding from utiliz ing criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race,color,or national origin b emphasis added 
the court in sandoval held that,although a private cause of action exists to enforce,see at.at private individuals may sue to enforce of title vi and obtain both injunctive relief and damages,that right plainly does not extend to the enforcement of disparate impact regulations promulgated under.see sandoval,at.at.
in reaching this decision,the supreme court stressed that legislative intent is the only basis upon which a private right of action may be inferred 
like substantive federal law itself,private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress.the judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.statutory intent on this latter point is determinative.without it,a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one,no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter,or how compatible with the statute.raising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for courts,but not for federal tribunals.
id.at.at citations and quotations omitted and emphasis added see also gonzaga university doe,d the inquiry simply require s a determination as to whether or not congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries.
sandoval also clearly delimits the sources that are relevant to our search for legislative intent.first and foremost,we look to the statutory text for language.sandoval,at.at see also gonzaga university.at where a statute does not include this sort of explicit right or language we rarely impute to congress an intent to create a private right of action.cannon,at.at not surprisingly,the right or language of the statute has generally been the most accurate indicator of the propriety of implication of a cause of action.language is language explicitly conferr ing a right directly on a class of persons that include s the plaintiff in a case,cannon,at.at,or language identifying the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted.pac.ry.rigsby,quoted in cannon,at.at.by contrast,statutory language customarily found in criminal statutes and other laws enacted for the protection of the general public,or a statute written simply as a ban on discriminatory conduct by recipients of federal funds,provides far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons.cannon,at.at.
second,we examine the statutory structure within which the provision in question is embedded.if the statutory structure provides a discernible enforcement mechanism,sandoval teaches that we ought not imply a private right of action because t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.sandoval,at.at 
third,if and only if statutory text and structure have not conclusively resolved whether a private right of action should be implied,we turn to the legislative history and context within which a statute was passed.see sandoval,at.at in determining whether statutes create private rights of action,as in interpreting statutes generally,legal context matters only to the extent it clarifies text.citation omitted we examine legislative history with a skeptical eye,however,because t he bar for showing legislative intent is high.congressional intent to create a private right of action will not be presumed.there must be clear evidence of congress intent to create a cause of action.mcdonald,at quoting baggett first bank of gainesville,cir.moreover,the legislative history of a statute that is itself unclear about whether a private right of action is implied is unlikely to provide much useful guidance.see cannon,at.at t he legislative history of a statute that does not expressly create or deny a private remedy will typically be equally silent or ambiguous on the question.
relying exclusively on the text and structure of title vi,see sandoval,at.at we begin and find that we can end our search for congress intent with the text and structure of title vi,the court in sandoval concluded that title vi implies no private right to sue for actions not motivated by discriminatory intent that result in a disparate impact.see id.at.at.examining,the court determined that it does not imply a private right of action for disparate impact claims,because,as noted above,prohibits only intentional discrimination.id.at.at.
the court turned next to,which,like of title ix,authorizes federal agencies to effectuate the provisions of by issuing rules,regulations,or orders of general applicability.the court concluded that this provision does not imply a private right of action.it first observed that language is completely absent from.sandoval,at.at.indeed,f ar from displaying congressional intent to create new rights,limits agencies to effectuat ing rights already created by.id.at.at second alteration in original citation omitted.further,the court noted,
the focus of is twice removed from the individuals who will ultimately benefit from title vi protection.statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.section is yet a step further removed it focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated,but on the agencies that will do the regulating.
id.quoting california sierra club,d see also touche ross redington,d the question whether congress intended to create a private right of action is definitely answered in the negative where a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class.the court thus concluded that,s o far as we can tell,this authorizing portion of reveals no congressional intent to create a private right of action.sandoval,at.at.
the court also found that the methods provide s for enforcing its authorized regulations suggest an intent not to create a private right of action.id.section provides for extensive administrative enforcement,as well as elaborate restrictions of that enforcement,which tend s to contradict a congressional intent to create privately enforceable rights through itself.id.at.at.in fact,the court continued,t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.id.at.at 
having determined that does not imply a private right of action for disparate impact claims and that does not imply any private right of action at all,the court concluded that the regulations promulgated by agencies with the power granted to them by to enforce the provisions of also can not be the basis of an implied private right of action for disparate impact claims 
language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that congress through statutory text created,but it may not create a right that congress has not.thus,when a statute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement of regulations,it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in each regulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable.but it is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by congress.agencies may play the sorcerer apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.
id.at.at citations and quotations omitted see also touche ross,at.at t he language of the statute and not the rules must control.thus,while regulations that merely interpret a statute may provide evidence of what private rights congress intended to create,see sandoval,at.at a congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well,regulations that go beyond what the statute itself requires are not enforceable through a private right of action.id.at.at.sandoval thus concluded there is no private right of action to pursue disparate impact claims under title vi.
with this template in front of us,we turn to jackson contention that title ix,in conjunction with e,implies a private right of action to remedy the type of retaliation he claims to have suffered.
as noted above,title ix does not expressly provide any private right of action.see supra at.in cannon of chicago,d,however,the supreme court held that title ix implies a private right of action in favor of direct victims of gender discrimination.a woman who was denied admission by two medical schools brought suit against the schools under title ix,alleging that their admissions policies discriminated against women.carefully applying the test set out in cort ash,d,see supra note the court found that title ix implies a private right of action in favor of private victims of discrimination.id.at.at emphasis added.the court implied this private right of action in the plaintiff favor based not on or the regulations promulgated pursuant to it,but exclusively on the text,structure,and legislative history of.
the supreme court has plainly receded from the cort analysis that animated cannon,focusing instead only on congressional intent to create a private right of action.see supra note.but the court has not overturned the specific holding of cannon,and so a direct victim of gender discrimination still may pursue a private right of action under title ix to remedy the discrimination she has suffered.
in cannon,however,the supreme court had no occasion to address the questions before us today whether title ix implies a private right of action to redress retaliation resulting from title ix complaints or whether individuals other than direct victims of gender discrimination have any private rights under title ix at all.nor has any subsequent decision of the supreme court or this court resolved these questions.we therefore face the basic question of whether to imply a private right of action and a private remedy for retaliation in favor of an individual who is not himself a direct victim of gender discrimination.after reading title ix in the manner required by sandoval,we can find nothing in the language or structure of title ix creating a private cause of action for retaliation,let alone a private cause of action for retaliation against individuals other than direct victims of gender discrimination.
we begin with the text of.see supra at.section aims to prevent and redress gender discrimination and does so by requiring that n o person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a see also cannon,at.at.nothing in the text indicates any congressional concern with retaliation that might be visited on those who complain of title ix violations.indeed,the statute makes no mention of retaliation at all our task,as sandoval makes clear,is to interpret what congress actually said,not to guess from congressional silence what it might have meant.the absence of any mention of retaliation in title ix therefore weighs powerfully against a finding that congress intended title ix to reach retaliatory conduct.see litman george mason,d,congress was aware that it could create a right of action for retaliatory treatment,and it did so in title vii it did not do so in title ix.
section of title ix,see supra note,does not vary our conclusion that congress did not intend title ix to prohibit retaliation.section,like its twin,is devoid of language of any against gender discrimination,retaliation,or any other kind of harm.instead,again like,it explicitly directs and authorizes federal agencies to regulate recipients of federal funding to effectuate the provisions of.as detailed above,see supra at,it provides an enforcement cessation of federal imposes elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement.sandoval,at.at.these restrictions include requirements that agencies first attempt to attain voluntary compliance,that agencies hold a hearing and make express findings of noncompliance before cutting off funding,and that agencies provide congress thirty days to consider any proposed funding cut off.see.that is thus concerned exclusively with the power of federal agencies to regulate recipients of federal funds renders its focus,like,twice removed from any consideration of what harm title ix is meant to remedy.sandoval,at.at.section plainly does not disclose any congressional intent to imply a private right of action of any kind,let alone against retaliation.
moreover,as sandoval teaches,section provision of an administrative enforcement mechanism,coupled with provision of judicial review,strongly counsels against inferring a private right of action against retaliation,because t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.sandoval,at.at.
we conclude,much like the supreme court did in sandoval,that nothing in the text or structure of and yields the conclusion that congress intended to imply a private cause of action for retaliation.while we have a measure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the statute when determining the scope of a judicially implied right and the remedies it makes available,gebser lago vista indep.sch,d,we are not free to craft a right that there is no evidence congress intended to create.see id.w e generally examine the relevant statute to ensure that we do not fashion the scope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the statutory structure and purpose.see also sandoval,at.at statutory intent is determinative.gebser,at.at we must attempt to infer from all available indicia how the congress would have addressed the issue had the action been included as an express provision in the statute.alterations in original quoting central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.our review of and unearths absolutely no indication that congress intended title ix to prevent or redress retaliation.because the text thus evinces no concern with retaliation,we are not free to imply a private right of action to redress it.
nor does e prohibition on retaliation,see supra at,imply such a private right of action or create a private remedy.it is true,as jackson asserts,that e identifies a class to which it extends its protection any individual retaliated against for complain ing,testif ying,assist ing,or participat ing in any manner in an investigation,proceeding or hearing undertaken to enforce title ix.this regulatory identification of a protected class can not be taken,however,as,for the simple reason that l anguage in a regulation may not create a right that congress has not.sandoval,at.at.quite simply,if congress did not enact a statute creating a private cause of action,we can not find its intent to do so in this regulation.because congress has not created a right through title ix to redress harms resulting from retaliation,e may not be read to create one either 
moreover,even if title ix did aim to prevent and remedy retaliation for complaining about gender discrimination,jackson is plainly is not within the class meant to be protected by title ix.as cannon held,identifies victims of gender discrimination as the class it aims to benefit,and so implies a private right of action in their favor.nowhere in the text,however,is any mention made of individuals other than victims of gender discrimination.gender discrimination affects not only its direct victims,but also those who care for,instruct,or are affiliated with,teachers,coaches,friends,significant others,and coworkers.congress could easily have provided some protection or form of relief to these other interested individuals had it chosen to do for a harm as plainly predictable as the retaliation here at issue but it did not do so expressly.nor does any language in evince an intent to protect anyone other than direct victims of gender discrimination.indeed,as with of title vi,the focus of is twice removed from victims of gender discrimination,sandoval,at.at,and,consequently,from individuals like jackson who are not themselves the victims of gender discrimination.here,there is quite simply no indication of any kind that congress meant to extend title ix coverage to individuals other than direct victims of gender discrimination.we are not free to extend the scope of title ix protection beyond the boundaries congress meant to establish,and we thus may not read title ix so broadly as to cover anyone other than direct victims of gender discrimination.
we thus hold that title ix does not imply a private right of action in favor of individuals who,although not themselves the victims of gender discrimination,suffer retaliation because they have complained about gender discrimination suffered by others statutory intent remains the touchstone of our analysis.without the mandate of sandoval is crystal clear on this simply can not imply a private right of action,no matter how desirable the result may be.and our review of both the text and structure of title ix yields no congressional intent to create a cause of action for retaliation,particularly for a plaintiff who is not a direct victim of gender discrimination.congress is,of course,free to create a private right of action for retaliation under title ix and may extend its protection beyond direct victims of gender discrimination.until it does so,however,sandoval plainly precludes a federal court from implying such a right or expanding the class benefitted by title ix.the district court was therefore correct to dismiss jackson complaint 
in relevant part,stat,as amended,as set forth in,provides a prohibition against discrimination exceptionsno person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance b preferential or disparate treatment because of imbalance in participation or receipt of federal benefits statistical evidence of imbalancenothing contained in subsection a of this section shall be interpreted to require any educational institution to grant preferential or disparate treatment to the members of one sex on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of that sex participating in or receiving the benefits of any federally supported program or activity,in comparison with the total number or percentage of persons of that sex in any community,state,section,or other area provided,that this subsection shall not be construed to prevent the consideration in any hearing or proceeding under this chapter of statistical evidence tending to show that such an imbalance exists with respect to the participation in,or receipt of the benefits of,any such program or activity by the members of one sex.c educational institution definedfor purposes of this chapter an educational institution means any public or private preschool,elementary,or secondary school,or any institution of vocational,professional,or higher education,except that in the case of an educational institution composed of more than one school,college,or department which are administratively separate units,such term means each such school,college,or department.
section,stat,as set forth in,titled federal administrative enforcement report to congressional committees,provides in relevant part each federal department and agency which is empowered to extend federal financial assistance to any education program or activity is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of section of this title with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules,regulations,or orders of general applicability no such rule,regulation,or order shall become effective unless and until approved by the president.compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the record,after opportunity for hearing,of a failure to comply with such requirement,or by any other means authorized by law provided,however,that no such action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance can not be secured by voluntary means.in the case of any action terminating,or refusing to grant or continue,assistance because of failure to comply with a requirement imposed pursuant to this section,the head of the federal department or agency shall file with the committees of the house and senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.no such action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.
in addition to the congressional review required by,of title ix,stat,as set forth in,provides for judicial review of a ny department or agency action taken pursuant to section.section provides in full that any department or agency action taken pursuant to section of this title shall be subject to such judicial review as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by such department or agency on other grounds.in the case of action,not otherwise subject to judicial review,terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement imposed pursuant to section of this title,any person aggrieved including any state or political subdivision thereof and any agency of either may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance with chapter of title,and such action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section of that title.
e was originally promulgated by the department of justice to enforce title vi of the civil rights act of title vi,stat,as amended,et.the department of education has incorporated by reference e and other regulations enforcing title vi to enforce title ix.see.
the supreme court implied private rights of action with a relatively free hand,see case borak,d,until its decision in cort ash,d.in cort,the court articulated four factors that must be considered before a private right of action may be implied first,is the plaintiff one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted that is,does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff second,is there any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one third,is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff and finally,is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law,in an area basically the concern of the states,so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law at.at quoting texas pac.ry.rigsby.additional citations omitted.since the late,the court has gradually receded from reliance on three of these four factors,focusing more and more exclusively on legislative intent alone.see,transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d while some opinions of the court have placed considerable emphasis upon the desirability of implying private rights of action in order to provide remedies thought to effectuate the purposes of a given statute,what must ultimately be determined is whether congress intended to create the private remedy asserted citations omitted touche ross redington,d the central inquiry is whether congress intended to create,either expressly or by implication,a private cause of action thompson thompson,d the intent of congress remains the ultimate issue.sandoval is the culmination of this trend,announcing that s tatutory intent is determinative.at.at see also gonzaga doe,d applying sandoval mode of analysis.the other three cort factors remain relevant only insofar as they provide evidence of congress intent.see thompson,at.at scalia,concurring in the judgment the court has convert ed one of the cort test four factors congressional intent into the determinative factor,with the other three me
