comprehensive community solutions,ccs,submitted a charter school proposal to the rockford board of education board.the board rejected the proposal,and the illinois state board of education state board or isbe refused to disturb that decision.the circuit court of sangamon county confirmed the state board decision,and the appellate court affirmed the trial court decision.d.ccs appealed.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
in,faced with mounting calls for public education reform,the general assembly adopted the charter schools law.see ilcs et west.the legislature acknowledged,there are educators,community members,and parents in illinois who can offer flexible and innovative educational techniques and programs,but who lack an avenue through which to provide them within the public school system.ilcs a west.the charter schools law seeks to expand educational opportunities for pupils pupils who,because of physical,emotional,socioeconomic,or cultural factors,are less likely to succeed in a conventional educational environment.ilcs west.to ensure this purpose is met,the general assembly indicated that the statute should be interpreted liberally to support the findings and goals of this section and to advance a renewed commitment by the state of illinois to the mission,goals,and diversity of public education.ilcs c west.
a charter school is a public school organized and operated as a nonprofit entity independent of,but funded by,the school district in which it operates.a party seeking to establish a charter school must submit a proposal to both the state board and the local school board in the form of a proposed contract.ilcs a west.there are requirements for a charter school proposal,including e vidence that the terms of the charter as proposed are economically sound for both the charter school and the school district.ilcs a west.
as part of the contract,the party proposing the charter school and the local school board must agree on funding and any services that the school district will provide to the charter school.ilcs b west.a major source of this funding is per capita student provided from the state to school districts according to the number of students and their average daily attendance.see ilcs c west.the charter schools law provides in no event shall the funding be less than or more than of the school district per capita student tuition multiplied by the number of students residing in the district who are enrolled in the charter school.ilcs b west.the legislature,however,intended that such funding and service agreements shall be neither a financial incentive nor a financial disincentive to the establishment of a charter school.ilcs b west.financial incentives instead come from the state the statute offers transition impact aid to school districts that have approved charter schools ilcs west,as well as grants ilcs west and loans ilcs west to charter schools for educational materials and facilities.
after receiving a charter school proposal,the local school board must convene a public meeting to obtain information relevant to the proposal.ilcs c west.within days of that meeting,the local school board must convene another public meeting and vote to either grant or deny the proposal.ilcs e west.in evaluating a charter school proposal,the local school board must give preference to proposals that demonstrate a high level of local pupil,parental,community,business,and school personnel support set rigorous levels of expected pupil achievement and demonstrate feasible plans for attaining those levels of achievement and are designed to enroll and serve a substantial proportion of children.ilcs a through a west.
the local school board must then report its decision to the state board.ilcs f west.if the local board grants the proposal,and the state board determines that the proposal complies with statutory requirements,the state board must certify the proposal,creating the charter school.ilcs f west.a.if the local board denies the proposal,the party proposing the charter school may appeal that decision to the state board.a.the state board may reverse a local board decision if the state board finds that the charter school or charter school proposal is i in compliance with this article,and ii is in the best interests of the students it is designed to serve.ilcs e west.if the state board reverses the local school board decision to deny a proposal,the state board shall act as the authorized chartering entity for the charter school and perform all the functions that the local school district would perform with respect to the charter school.ilcs f west.
ccs,a community change agent,operates youthbuild rockford,a branch of the national youthbuild program and a part of the americorps national service movement.youthbuild rockford offers to unemployed high school dropouts a chance to earn a high school degree while they acquire vocational skills.participants in this program alternate their time between school and jobsites,where they rehabilitate or construct housing for low income and homeless people in the rockford area.
in,ccs submitted a proposal for a youthbuild rockford charter school.ccs sought a charter to serve students between the ages and in and as many as students by.the proposed charter school would help and students make the transition from street to school and street to work with educational,vocational,and social support.according to ccs,the proposed charter school differed from an alternative high school because it would provide both academic instruction and job training.under the proposal,the charter school also would provide a stipend of per student in,depending on the availability of funding.the stipend would increase to by.
the total budget for the charter school first year was million.part of the charter school revenues would be provided by the board in an amount equal to the current fiscal year per capita student expenditure,in,multiplied by the number of students.ccs assumed average daily attendance.the proposal further stated 
the proposed charter school is considered economically sound for both the charter school and the district,since the district is not presently serving the students proposed to be served by the charter school,and is therefore not receiving per pupil revenue for those students.this proposal contemplates that the charter school will receive of the district per pupil expenditure for each student enrolled.further,the charter school will negotiate other services separately.
the proposal indicated that the board would provide special education services to students of the charter school on the same basis it does for rockford school district students.
the proposal was referred to the board charter school advisory committee.thomas hoffman,finance director for the district,advised the committee that the district had cash flow problems and that it would need to borrow money to support the proposal.the committee report of its august,meeting states 
committee members expressed concerns about the economic feasibility of the proposal.this was due in part to the negative impact on the school district budget.the school board has adopted a balanced budget policy.the charter school proposal if recommended as submitted would cause a deficit.a decision on this aspect of the proposal was delayed until further negotiations could be held.
the committee felt a responsibility to make sure that they do not saddle the school district with a liability,and its august,executive summary reflected these concerns 
the applicant and members of the committee are still discussing the financial plan for the proposed charter school.a recommendation from the committee to enter into a contract is dependant upon the successful conclusion of those discussions and a financial plan that will minimize any adverse fiscal impact on both organizations.
during these discussions ccs stated that the proposed charter school would provide equal access for nondropout students and asked that the district pay for special education services.in an august,memo to joyce price,chief education officer for the district,ccs clarified other modifications it would make to its original proposal.ccs assumed that it would receive transition impact aid from the state and that it would maintain average daily attendance,which would correspondingly increase its per capita funding over the funding it would receive at average daily attendance.as an alternative to its demand for per capita funding,ccs proposed a variable funding rate starting at in the first year and moving to in the fifth year of the charter.ccs never backed away from its original demand,however if this proposal is not accepted and recommended to the school board,then it is withdrawn and our original proposal stands.
the proposal was next discussed at two public meetings of the board.the minutes of the august,meeting indicate 
the charter school committee has exercised due diligence in the review of this application however,the financial section of the application is still in negotiation.the committee has evaluated the application against the fifteen requirements of state law and,based upon that evaluation,the committee will recommend approval at the next board meeting,pending a successful outcome of the outstanding issue of economic feasibility.
the committee ultimately recommended that the board approve the proposal at per capita funding,which ccs later labeled an inadequate financing plan to which it never agreed.on august,the board discussed and denied the proposal by a vote.
the local board sent a report to the state board,which noted the following deficiencies in the charter school proposal 
youthbuild would target the type of student now being served at the roosevelt alternative high school and would be duplicative of services provided therein 
adults who have dropped out can not be considered to be pupils as defined in of the school code.this section implies that charter schools are intended to serve children who are currently enrolled 
youthbuild will offer another program for people who have failed,in some cases repeatedly,and dropped out.indeed,the youthbuild program may be an incentive to drop out in order to receive the weekly stipend rather than enrolling in the adult education program at roosevelt alternative high school 
curriculum and its implementation have not been set forth with adequate specificity 
there was no showing what the rate of success,diploma or ged,was for this type of program and 
even at the minimal funding level,rockford school district would sustain a loss of which would not include the cost of special education services for which it would be responsible.given the dire financial situation,the rockford school district can not take on more debt.
in a september,letter announcing its decision to appeal the board decision,ccs asked the state board to review the recordings of the two applicable board meetings at which discussion was held.a review of these proceedings will demonstrate that the vote to deny this application was primarily reflective of one.
the state board appeal panel reviewed the local board decision.at a november,hearing,ccs executive director kerry knodle stated that if the local board had accepted the proposal recommended by its charter school advisory committee,ccs would have declined to proceed simply because the budget they would have approved at percent would not have worked for us.knodle clarified,what technically on the table in our proposal as far as we concerned at this point is the percent number.at that hearing,board attorney james hess acknowledged that because of his school district financial difficulties,the local school board could not approve this or any other charter school proposal i f it results in a deficit.hess bluntly stated,we are trying to put our house in order.we do need this proposal right now.even at the variable funding rate,the board would still encounter a deficit.hess asked,from whom do we take it where do we get it must we borrow it so knodle can have his school 
on february,the appeal panel issued its recommendation to the state superintendent of education.see.d.the appeal panel initially discussed the charter schools law,then turned to the reasons enunciated by the board in denying the proposal.the appeal panel disagreed with the local board on each of the six grounds it mentioned in denying the charter,particularly on the issue of funding.
the appeal panel noted,if youthbuild rockford agreed to a per capita tuition rate,the cumulative effect over the first five years of the charter would be more paid to the charter school than would be received by the district from general state aid and transition impact aid payments,which represented less than of one percent of the amount budgeted by the district for educational expenditures in.the appeal panel further noted that its staff found possible errors in the figures used by the local board to determine the proposal impact.using the enrollment numbers provided in the proposal,and assuming that state aid payments and the district budget remained constant and that the legislature would provide for transition impact aid,the staff determined that the net deficits created by a youthbuild rockford charter school would range from million at a per capita funding rate to million at an per capita funding rate.according to the appeal panel,these figures represent and respectively of the cumulative educational budgets proposed by rockford.
the appeal panel asserted that it did not 
minimize the impact of any potential loss of revenue from rockford educational fund.however,a revenue loss to the district is inescapable under the charter schools law,but is necessary to serve the law goal to provide parents and pupils with expanded choices within the public school system.citation.by funding charter schools through per capita payments from the district,the charter schools law recognizes that the funding in essence belongs to the student and the student parents,and may be spent in a charter school rather than in the district schools if the parents see fit.so viewed,the creation of a charter school costs a district nothing.it is only when individual parents decide that the charter school can offer a better education and choose to enroll their children in the charter school that the funding flows from the district to the charter school.if the parents of rockford students decide to exercise this option,they should have the right to do so.
the appeal panel found that the proposal complied with the charter schools law and that the proposal would clearly be in the best interests of rockford students.the panel concluded that the state board should reverse the local board decision and grant a charter to youthbuild rockford.the state superintendent seconded this recommendation,and sent it to the state board for a final decision.see.d.
the state board requested additional information from both ccs and the local board.see.b.specifically,the state board asked the local board to identify the specific hardships placed on the school district should this charter be approved and specific programs at the school district that will be in jeopardy should this charter be approved.in its february,response,the board stated it would incur a deficit of at a per capita funding rate,a deficit of at the variable to funding rate once advanced by ccs,and a deficit of at a funding rate.the board indicated that the district deficit stood at million,which,according to an independent audit,cast substantial doubt about the district ability to continue as an ongoing concern.the board reported that it was considering million in budget cuts,pending a vote on a referendum to repay million to tax objectors by issuing bonds over a period.if the referendum failed,the local board would be considering an additional million in budget cuts.the additional cuts would include closing three schools,implementing a day for secondary schools,and eliminating various administrative positions and unspecified athletic programs,as well as funding for tutorials,textbooks,and computers.according to the board,these proposed cuts will adversely affect the education of all students especially those enrolled in the schools on the academic watch list.
at a special meeting on the charter school proposal,the state board again requested additional information from the parties.in its march,response,ccs indicated that its stipends historically came from federal grants.ccs anticipated that these grants would continue.in its march,response,the local board again stated that at per capita funding,it would encounter a deficit of plus in special education services.thus,the board projected that its total deficit as a result of the charter school would be million.in light of the million in budget cuts that the local board had just approved,as well as outstanding obligations to repay million in tax anticipation warrants and million in tax objections,the board asserted that it is apparent that the local board can not take on new debt.that is,to pay for the charter school,the local board would have to cut million in existing programs.according to the board,to require further sacrifices,to fund youthbuild is not economically or educationally sound.
on may,the state board upheld the local board decision by a vote.the minutes of this meeting contain comments from each board member who voted no 
rogers commented that she voted no because she believes that most charter schools fail because of lack of financing and she does not want students put in jeopardy because of this problem.
sandsmark commented that he voted no because to him this is an economic issue.he said that the rockford school district has had financial problems for as long as the thirty years that he has lived in the area.he stated that the school district is starting to move in the right direction and he believes that they do need one more issue to deal with at this time.
steiner commented that she voted no because of the financial issue and she believes that the state board should not go against the local board control.
turkal commented that she voted no because of the current economic problems that the rockford school district has and she noted that she believes the district has adequate programs in place to meet the needs of students.
the state board memorialized its decision in a short final decision denying ccs appeal because t he proposed charter school is not economically sound for rockford school district in view of the serious financial problems that currently exist in the district.
ccs filed a judicial review complaint.on january,the trial court remanded this matter,ordering the state board to set forth in its decision what evidence the board accepted,what evidence it may have rejected and what evidence may or may not have been contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.the trial court stated,the appeal panel in this matter did make findings,but this court is unable to determine to what extent those findings were accepted or rejected by the board,and if rejected by the board,why they were rejected by the board.
on june,the state board specified that it denied ccs appeal for three reasons 
board members were concerned that the charter school proposal had not adequately shown that it was economically sound for the charter school and the school district 
board members reviewed additional material such as an independent financial analysis by isbe staff of costs and budget impact and 
board members expressed reservations that the charter school was in the best interests of the students it was designed to serve.
the state board accepted evidence that the district was in grave financial condition,but rejected evidence that the charter school proposal was fiscally sound for itself and the district.the parties had presented varying figures regarding the impact of the proposal on the district,but 
e ven despite the isbe staff additional review and analysis of the financial soundness of the proposal,there remained considerable confusion over which figures apply to which funding level whether at the minimum level,a variable level ranging from in the first year to in the fifth year,or at the maximum level,and indeed which funding level was being sought by ccs.finally,based on the uncertain impact of an insufficiently clear charter school proposal upon a school district already in grave financial condition and in turn upon the proposed charter school itself,the board members found that the charter school proposal was not in the best interests of the students it was designed to serve.
the trial court confirmed the decision of the state board,and ccs appealed.
the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court.the appellate court initially stated that under the administrative review law,a reviewing court considers the decision of the agency,not the trial court.d.further,contrary to ccs argument,a reviewing court considers the decision of the agency,not a subordinate hearing body of the agency.d at.
here,isbe is the final decisionmaker on the issue of whether to grant or deny a proposal.although isbe may delegate to staff to hear oral presentations and submit recommendations to the state superintendent of education,it is isbe duty to take the findings and recommendations and make a final decision.it is that decision that is subject to judicial review under the administrative review law.d at.
the appellate court then sketched the mechanics of the charter schools law and noted that a charter school proposal must include evidence that the proposal is economically sound for the school and the school district.d at.the appellate court continued 
ccs appears to argue that if other relevant factors outweigh the financial impact on the school district,the proposal must be accepted.however,the charter schools law does not require such blanket acceptance of proposals.instead,evidence must be shown that the proposal is economically sound for both the charter school and the school district.such evidence must realistically require consideration of the school district finances.we find isbe focus on the school district finances was a valid factor to consider and did not violate the express goals of the charter schools law.d at.
because the state board considered the economic impact the proposal would have on the charter school and the school district,and it considered the best interests of the district students,it had examined the statutory factors.d at.the appellate court outlined the financial information produced by the school district.d at.the appellate court then observed that the state board found that the proposal was not economically sound for the school district,a necessary requirement considering the large expenditure of public funds and the state of education spending in illinois,and consequently not in the best interests of the students.d at.the appellate court could not conclude that the state board decision was clearly erroneous.d at.
we allowed ccs petition for leave to appeal.see a.we granted the illinois network of charter schools leave to file a brief in support of ccs.see.
the charter schools law provides that the state board may reverse a local school board decision to deny a charter school proposal if the state board finds that the charter school proposal i is in compliance with this article,and ii is in the best interests of the students it is designed to serve.ilcs e west.the state board decision is subject to judicial review under the administrative review law.ilcs e west.
the administrative review law provides that judicial review of an administrative agency decision shall extend to all questions of law and fact presented by the entire record before the court.ilcs west.the standard of review,which determines the degree of deference given to the agency decision,turns on whether the issue presented is a question of fact,a question of law,or a mixed question of law and fact.afm messenger service,department of employment security.an agency conclusion on a question of law is reviewed de novo.branson department of revenue.a reviewing court is not bound by an agency interpretation of a statute envirite illinois environmental protection agency,but the agency interpretation remains relevant where there is a reasonable debate about the meaning of the statute harrisonville telephone illinois commerce comm n.an agency conclusion on a question of fact is reviewed with more deference.see ilcs west the findings and conclusions of the administrative agency on questions of fact shall be held to be prima facie true and correct.a reviewing court does not reweigh the evidence before the agency instead,it simply determines whether the agency decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence.abrahamson illinois department of professional regulation.
a mixed question of law and fact asks the legal effect of a given set of facts.see city of belvidere illinois state labor relations board.that is,in resolving a mixed question of law and fact,a reviewing court must determine whether established facts satisfy applicable legal rules.see afm messenger,at,quoting swint,d.an agency conclusion on a mixed question of law and fact is reviewed for clear error.city of belvidere,at,carpetland,illinois department of employment security.such review is significantly deferential to an agency experience in construing and applying the statutes that it administers.see afm messenger,at.thus,when the decision of an administrative agency presents a mixed question of law and fact,the agency decision will be deemed clearly erroneous only where the reviewing court,on the entire record,is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.afm messenger,at,quoting united states united states gypsum.
ccs argues that this case involves a question of law the question of the relative importance of a district finances in determining whether or not a charter school proposal is in compliance with the charter school sic law requires a pure consideration of the terms of the law itself.thus,ccs asserts,our review is de novo.the state board argues that its decision presents a mixed question of law and fact and that the clearly erroneous standard of review applies.the local board argues that the clearly erroneous standard is inappropriate because certain facts remain disputed.accordingly,the board contends,our review is de novo on issues of law on issues of fact,we must determine simply if the agency decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence.
the central issue in this case involves the state board decision to uphold the local board decision to deny ccs charter proposal.in reviewing a local school board decision to deny a charter proposal,the state board must determine,in part,whether the proposal was in compliance with the charter schools law,including the requirements listed in section.the parties do not dispute that ccs proposal met of the statutory requirements of that section.the remaining requirement provides that a proposal must present e vidence that the terms of the charter as proposed are economically sound for both the charter school and the school district.ilcs a west.before we can decide whether the state board decision that ccs proposal did not satisfy this requirement was clearly erroneous,we must first decide what it means.on this question,our standard of review is de novo.
the fundamental rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature intent.see hamilton industrial comm n,kraft,edgar.the plain language of a statute remains the best indication of this intent.see people alexander,citing opyt amoco,village of south holland.where the language of a statute is clear,we may not read into it exceptions that the legislature did not express,and we will give it effect as written.see metzger darosa,petersen wallach.we also will give undefined statutory terms their ordinary meanings.service pipeline mcgaw,advincula united blood services.
the parties all agree that the plain language of the charter schools law is unambiguous,but they offer different readings of section a.ccs contends that the state board misconstrued section a in relying solely upon a school district financial condition to deny a charter school proposal.ccs asserts that the state board interpretation improperly reduces the statutory inquiry into the single question of whether the district can afford the charter.according to ccs,section a clearly addresses the economics of the terms of the charter,not the economics of the district independent from the terms of the charter.that is,the statute focuses on the quality of the bargain posed by the charter section a is simply a way to make sure that the charter proposal terms do not seek more funding than what the district should be paying for the educational services provided.it anticipates,and imposes discipline on,the negotiations over funding between the parties.indeed,the charter schools law provides that any agreement over funding shall be neither a financial incentive nor a financial disincentive to the establishment of a charter school.ilcs b west.ccs claims that this means that an agreement,which may depend on the district financial condition,should have no bearing on the success of a charter school proposal.
in fact,ccs argues,considering the district finances conflicts with the statute.ccs notes that many school districts face deficits unrelated to charter schools,but the legislature made no reference to such deficits in the statute.the funding of a charter school does not increase the cost of education,though it does shift or reallocate resources from the school district to the charter school and consequently decreases revenues for the district.amicus describes this adverse financial impact on the district as a desirable corollary to the charter schools law,that is both inevitable and legally irrelevant.it is inevitable because the purpose of the statute is to create choices for students,and thus competition for funding between public schools and charter schools.because money follows students,schools have a financial stimulus to improve their performances.it is irrelevant because the list of charter school proposal requirements do not include lack of adverse financial impact.to allow a local school board to deny a charter proposal because it may have an adverse financial impact on the district budget would defeat the purpose of the statute,which is to create choice and thus competition.
the state board and the local board respond that ccs misreads the plain language of section a.relying upon dictionary definitions,the state board and the local board contend that the economic soundness requirement means that the terms of the charter school proposal must be financially stable and secure for both the charter school and the school district.thus,the district financial condition is a relevant consideration because there is no way to make this determination without looking at the impact of the proposal on the district bottom line.according to the state board and the local board,ccs interpretation would write the words both and school district out of the statute.the local board acknowledges that section a touches upon financial discipline,but points to its decision to reject a proposal that would have either added more debt to an budget deficit or necessitated cuts to existing programs as an example of such discipline.
the local board also notes that the charter schools law is replete with provisions showing the legislature was concerned about funding and its impact on district finances.the state board states that when the legislature provided the charter school and the local school board shall agree on funding and any services to be provided by the school district to the charter school ilcs b west,it intimated that the impact of a charter school proposal upon the district finances is a legitimate concern.when the legislature provided that such agreements should not be an incentive or a disincentive to establishing a charter school see ilcs b west,it did not mean that the financial condition of the district is irrelevant.instead,it is the prohibition against using funding as either an incentive or a disincentive which is irrelevant if the charter school proposal,on which the parties have yet to agree,is not economically sound.that is,the local board argues,this prohibition did not nullify the requirement of section a.
the board asserts that ccs reference to negotiation is ironic because it flatly refused to budge from its demand for per capita funding.further,the board as
