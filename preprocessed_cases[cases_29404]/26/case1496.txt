the academic senates of irvine valley college and saddleback college the senates or appellants appeal from the denial of a writ of mandate in favor of the board of trustees of the south orange county community college district the trustees and chancellor raghu mathur collectively respondents.the dispute relates to the interpretation of education code section governing the process by which faculty hiring procedures are developed.we agree with appellants that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the relevant statute.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
irvine valley college and saddleback college are the two colleges in the south orange county community college district the district.the senates represent the faculty with respect to academic and administrative matters.see,tit,subd.b.the trustees are the governing board of the district,responsible for maintaining and operating the colleges according to the law.
in april,appellants sought a writ of mandate against respondents pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and.the petition alleged respondents violated subdivisions b and c of education code section section by adopting revised hiring policies that had not been agreed upon jointly.the court agreed and stayed implementation of the policies until the senates were given a real and meaningful opportunity to participate 
after the trial court initial ruling,representatives of the district and the senates set to work on a new hiring policy.the trial court later found this process was undertaken in good faith and with diligence.although agreement could be reached on some issues,some could not be resolved 
the parties returned to court in december.at that time,the trial court concluded that true agreement may not be possible and could not be statutorily required.the court read section to require the senates to have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the process,but not to give them a de facto veto or the ability to frustrate reform.thus,the trial court denied the petition for a writ of mandate and entered judgment in favor of respondents.the senates now appeal.
discussionstanding 
as a threshold matter,respondents argue appellants lack standing.first,they claim,appellants lack authority to sue or be sued because they have no legal existence separate from the districts of which they are a part.a body need not be a formally organized to have standing unincorporated associations may sue and be sued.code civ.academic senates are recognized by statute and have been given specific responsibilities by the legislature.in addition to section,academic senates are explicitly recognized in education code sections and,among other statutes.we find this statutory recognition,along with the coordinate rights and responsibilities conferred by the legislature,sufficient to create a legal existence separate from the district.
respondents also characterize the senates as merely advisory bodies pursuant to the california code of regulations.although the primary function of an academic senate is to make recommendations on a variety of matters,it is not the exclusive function.section,subdivision a of title of the california code of regulations states the governing board of a community college district shall adopt policies for appropriate delegation of authority and responsibility to its college district academic senate.among other matters,said policies,at a minimum,shall provide that the governing board or its designees will consult collegially with the academic senate when adopting policies and procedures on academic and professional matters.this requirement to consult collegially shall not limit other rights and responsibilities of the academic senate which are specifically provided in statute or other board of governors regulations.
in addition to consulting and advising,an academic senate may have other rights and responsibilities which are specifically provided in statute,tit,subd.a.thus,we disagree with respondents that the decision to consult with the senates on hiring policy is a matter requiring the district agreement or is otherwise beyond the scope of the senates legal authority.section specifically grants the senates a role in the process of developing a hiring policy.
notwithstanding the responsibilities granted academic senates by section,respondents claim the lack of express statutory standing demonstrates a clear indication that the legislature did not intend academic senates to have independent standing.we disagree,and respondents offer no authority for the proposition that a lack of express statutory standing is fatal if the common law requirements of standing are otherwise present.
respondents next assert that the senates lack the necessary beneficial interest to obtain a writ because they are merely advisory agencies that do not exercise the sovereign function of government.respondents rely on laidlaw environmental services,local assessment com.county of kern th,d.the petitioner in laidlaw was a local assessment committee lac formed by the county board of supervisors pursuant to health and safety code section.id.at,d.the committee sought a writ of mandate after the board of supervisors issued a conditional use permit to a waste management company.id.at,d.
the court held that the lac did not have sufficient independence from the county to confer the beneficial interest necessary to confer standing.laidlaw environmental services,local assessment com.county of kern,supra,th at,d.the court found the lac lacked permanence and continuity as well as the lack of authorization to exercise sovereign power.id.at,d.because the lac acted on an ad hoc basis and in a purely advisory role,they lacked the necessary beneficial interest.
unlike the lac in laidlaw,academic senates are not appointed by the district.they are independently elected by the faculty of the community colleges they represent,tit.further,they are not created on an ad hoc basis,but have permanence and continuity.finally,academic senates have more than the extremely limited advisory role of an lac.the statute at issue in this case demonstrates that academic senate is one of two bodies which must jointly agree on a faculty hiring policy under section.thus,we find laidlaw inapposite.
the requirement that a petitioner be beneficially interested has been generally interpreted to mean that one may obtain the writ only if the person has some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citations.carsten psychology examining com.cal d.a beneficial interest is some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citations.ibid.section explicitly states academic senates have a key role in developing and adopting faculty hiring procedures,and this is a special right sufficient to confer a beneficial interest.if academic senates do not have sufficient standing to challenge a district failure to comply with section,it is difficult to envision who does.given the specific attention the legislature paid to the issue of developing faculty hiring policies,it is untenable to suggest nobody has standing to seek redress if a district violates this statute.thus,we find the senates have standing and proceed to address the substantive issue.
the parties agree that interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to de novo review.sutco construction modesto high school dist.d.the trial court construed section to mean that actual agreement between the senates and the district was not required,holding this would result in an absurd interpretation of the statute.
we follow rules of statutory construction.first,a court should examine the actual language of the statute.citations.judges,lawyers and laypeople all have far readier access to the actual laws enacted by the legislature than the various and sometimes fragmentary documents shedding light on legislative intent.more significantly,it is the language of the statute itself that
