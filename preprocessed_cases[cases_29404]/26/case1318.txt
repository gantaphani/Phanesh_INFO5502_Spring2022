plaintiffs are a group of cities in their municipal capacities and the successor agencies to several redevelopment agencies that have since been dissolved,multiple community development commissions,a private nonprofit housing corporation,and an individual taxpayer.specifically,plaintiffs are the city of cerritos,city of carson,city of cypress,city of lakewood,city of paramount,city of placentia and city of signal hill,each in their municipal capacities and as the successor agencies to their respective former redevelopment agencies,as well as the city of commerce,commerce community development commission,city of downey,community development commission of the city of downey,city of santa fe springs,community development commission of the city of santa fe springs,cuesta villas housing corporation,and bruce barrows.

facts and proceedings 
redevelopment agencies and tax increment financing generally 
the historical underpinnings of california redevelopment agencies were discussed in matosantos i and several cases since the supreme court landmark decision and need no further exposition here.see generally matosantos i,supra,cal th at see also california redevelopment matosantos th,matosantos ii.briefly summarized,since the,the community redevelopment law allowed sponsoring cities and counties to establish redevelopment agencies to address urban blight.see legis.analyst,governor redevelopment proposal,see also stats,ch,et.community redevelopment act stats,ch,et codifying and renaming the community redevelopment law,health,et unless otherwise stated,statutory references that follow are to the health and safety code.a redevelopment agency was a separate legal entity from the city or county that established it.county of solano vallejo redevelopment agency th,a redevelopment agency is a public body,corporate and politic,which may sue,be sued,and make contracts,and is a separate legal entity from its sponsoring agency.
redevelopment agencies generally could not levy taxes,and,instead,relied primarily on tax increment financing as a funding source as authorized by article xvi,section of the california constitution and health and safety code section.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.under that funding mechanism,redevelopment agencies received the growth in property taxes from a designated redevelopment plan area,known as the property tax increment,while the other public entities entitled to receive property tax revenue in the redevelopment area were allocated a portion based on the assessed value of the property prior to the effective date of the redevelopment plan known as the frozen base.cal,art.xvi,subds.a,b.
by,california redevelopment agencies were receiving approximately percent of statewide property tax revenues.see legis.analyst,governor redevelopment proposal.it was further estimated that redevelopment agencies would divert approximately billion of property tax revenue annually that would otherwise fund school districts,cities,counties,and special districts.under negotiated agreements and state statute,redevelopment agencies pass ed through about billion to local agencies a portion of this amount was passed to schools.the state general fund,however,had to backfill the remaining property tax revenues diverted from k schools,at a cost of over billion annually.
b.the fiscal crisis 
faced with a budget gap of more than billion,on january,incoming governor jerry brown renewed a previously declared state fiscal emergency and convened a special session of the legislature to address the state budget crisis.matosantos i,supra,cal th at citing legis.counsel digest,assem.bill and professional engineers in california government schwarzenegger cal th,detailing the ongoing crisis professional engineers.to partially close the state projected billion operating deficit,governor brown proposed eliminating redevelopment agencies entirely.see legis.analyst,the budget should california end redevelopment agencies,the governor budget includes a plan for dissolving redevelopment agencies and distributing their funds above the amounts necessary to pay outstanding debt to other local agencies see also governor budget summary,the budget prohibits existing redevelopment agencies from creating new contracts or obligations effective upon enactment of urgency legislation.by july,existing agencies would be disestablished and successor local agencies would be required to use the property tax that rdas would otherwise have received to retire rda debts and contractual obligations in accordance with existing payment schedules.
it was projected that dissolving redevelopment agencies would produce approximately billion in revenue to offset state general fund costs for the fiscal year.
assembly bill and assembly bill 
responding to the declared fiscal emergency,the legislature passed assembly bill and assembly bill during the special legislative session.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.among other things,assembly bill barred redevelopment agencies from incurring new or expanding existing monetary or legal obligations.see health,part to the freeze component restricting redevelopment agency powers.it also provided for their windup and dissolution.see health,part to the dissolution component dissolving redevelopment agencies and transferring control of their assets to successor agencies.we address relevant portions of assembly bill in more detail below.
assembly bill offered an exemption from dissolution for sponsoring agencies that agreed to make specified payments to both the applicable county educational revenue augmentation funds eraf and a new county special district augmentation fund on behalf of their redevelopment agencies.see health,part to.if the payments were timely made,the sponsoring agency redevelopment agency would be permitted to continue operating under the community redevelopment law,subd.a.failure to make timely payments resulted in a redevelopment agency dissolution.
d.the supreme court holds assembly bill does not violate the california constitution 
the california redevelopment association,the league of california cities and other affected parties challenged the constitutionality of assembly bill and assembly bill.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.the supreme court upheld assembly bill as a valid exercise of the legislature power but struck down assembly bill as unconstitutional.id.at.regarding assembly bill,the supreme court specifically found it did not violate either article xvi,section,or proposition,which added article xiii,section,subdivision a to the california constitution.ibid.
plaintiffs filed an amicus brief in matosantos i,but did not intervene in the action.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.plaintiffs amicus brief generally raised the same constitutional infirmities plaintiffs allege here.the supreme court declined to consider their arguments.id.at,fn.
plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction 
shortly after the supreme court decided matosantos i,plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to stay the enforcement of assembly bill in the present proceedings.plaintiffs argued assembly bill was unconstitutional under the following provisions of the state constitution article xiii,section,subdivision a hereafter article xiii,section a or proposition article iv,section,subdivisions d and e hereafter article iv,section d and article iv,section e or proposition article iv,section hereafter article iv,section or the single subject rule article iv,section,subdivision b hereafter article iv,section b article iv,section,subdivision c hereafter article iv,section c and that it violated the contracts clauses of both the federal and state constitutions.
following expedited briefing,the trial court denied the motion.in so doing,the court found plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the merits of their claims.plaintiffs appealed and also sought writ relief in this court,which we denied.
on appeal,plaintiffs renew their constitutional claims except those under the federal and state contracts clauses.they also assert a new argument that assembly bill violates the doctrine found in article xi,section hereafter article xi,section.
plaintiffs requests for judicial notice filed in support of their opening and reply briefs are denied.
discussion 
ithe appeal is not moot 
we begin by addressing the effect,if any,of the dissolution of redevelopment agencies under assembly bill on february.we must decide whether this moots plaintiffs appeal.
generally,courts decide only actual controversies which will result in a judgment that offers relief to the parties.ebensteiner,chadmar group th.thus,appellate courts as a rule will not render opinions on moot questions.id.at.a case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical impact or can not provide the parties with effective relief.simi garamendi th.an appeal from an order denying an injunction may be dismissed as moot if the act sought to be enjoined is performed while the appeal is pending.finnie town of tiburon d,appeal moot where special election sought to be enjoined occurred while appeal pending.but,where a court can afford the party at least some relief,even if not all the relief originally requested,the court should not dismiss a case as moot.hartke abbott,where there is left any material or vital question for determination the court should not dismiss the appeal but should permit it to be heard on the merits sahlolbei providence healthcare,th,injunctive relief is still available where a defendant completed act causes ongoing harm or is part of a continuing course of conduct.
in this case,the parties dispute the effect of dissolving redevelopment agencies.because the event plaintiffs sought to enjoin redevelopment agency dissolution has occurred and redevelopment agencies have ceased to exist,the state argues the appeal is now moot.the state points to plaintiffs own dire prognostications in the court below as evidence that passage of the dissolution deadline moots the matter.plaintiffs claimed at the preliminary injunction hearing,w e gone.once our the agencies dissolve.once their assets are stripped from them and sent to the county,there is no way to undo that.so our harm is total and permanent.they made similar concessions in their written papers in the trial court.
retreating from their earlier predictions,plaintiffs now contend this court can provide them with relief even though redevelopment agencies have been dissolved.equity lies,they argue,to reinstate the status quo ante,meaning before assembly bill was enacted.according to plaintiffs,redevelopment agencies can be reactivated and their powers restored by the stroke of a court pen.
but,plaintiffs argue,even if such an undertaking is impossible as a practical matter given the passage of time and given the fact that redevelopment agency assets and monies have already been disbursed to other entities not joined as parties to this appeal save our bay,san diego unified port dist.th,a party is indispensable where the plaintiff seeks some type of affirmative relief which,if granted,would injure or affect the interest of a third party not joined washington mutual bank blechman th,a n indispensable party is not bound by a judgment in an action in which he was not joined,plaintiffs argue other relief is nonetheless available.noting that the waterfall payment provisions contained in health and safety code sections and,which plaintiffs allege improperly reallocate ad valorem property taxes to local agencies on something other than a pro rata basis,are intended to operate in the future,plaintiffs contend the court could conceivably reform the provisions to provide them with more money going forward.
because the redevelopment agency procedures in assembly bill will occur over the course of many years,we could theoretically craft a remedy to provide plaintiffs with at least some relief if certain challenged provisions are deemed unconstitutional.see,kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,a court may reform,rewrite a statute in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution,when we can say with confidence that i it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body,and ii the enacting body would have preferred the reformed construction to invalidation of the statute.the appeal,then,is not moot even though the dissolution deadline has passed and redevelopment agencies were dissolved under the terms of assembly bill on february.see matosantos ii,supra,th at action not moot even though scheduled fund transfers from redevelopment agencies had already occurred and redevelopment agencies had since been dissolved under assembly bill since potential money judgment against legislature would inure to the benefit of successor agencies.
standard of review 
before considering the merits of plaintiffs claims,we identify the applicable standard governing our review of the order denying plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction.ordinarily,in ruling on a preliminary injunction request a trial court must consider the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and weigh the interim harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is denied against the harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted.miller city of hermosa beach th,miller.the appropriate standard of review depends on whether the trial court engaged in both prongs of the analysis.ibid.
when the trial court addresses both the likelihood of success and the relative harms,an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction will be reversed only for abuse of discretion.miller,supra,th at.where,however,the trial court considers only the legal issue of likelihood of success on the merits,the appeal presents a question of law which we review de novo.ibid.
while the parties argued both the likelihood of success on the merits and the relative harms at the preliminary injunction hearing,the trial court ruling focused solely on plaintiffs likelihood of prevailing at trial.our review,then,is de novo.
turning now to the merits,we are mindful that all intendments favor the exercise of the legislature plenary authority if there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.such restrictions and limitations imposed by the constitution are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.citations.matosantos i,supra,cal th at citing methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d.
article xiii,section a pro rata share of ad valorem property taxes 
plaintiffs primary contention on appeal is that assembly bill violates proposition,which the electorate approved at the general election in november.stats,res.ch.proposition added article xiii,section a to the state constitution.matosantos ii,supra,th at.that section generally prohibits the legislature from raiding local property tax allocations to help balance the budget.ibid.it provides in relevant part a on or after november,the legislature shall not enact a statute chang ing for any fiscal year the pro rata shares in which ad valorem property tax revenues are allocated among local agencies in a county other than pursuant to a bill passed in each house of the legislature by rollcall vote entered in the journal,of the membership concurring.cal,art.xiii,subd.a.its protections,however,do not apply to redevelopment agencies.matosantos i,supra,cal th at cal,art.xiii,subd.b,subds.a omitting redevelopment agencies from the definition of local agency subd.m excluding from the definition of special district any agency that is not authorized by statute to levy a property tax rate.
despite this,plaintiffs claim assembly bill,which governs the dissolution and wind down of redevelopment agencies,allocates ad valorem property taxes to local agencies on a rata basis without having been passed by a supermajority as article xiii,section a requires.whether assembly bill violates proposition requires us to interpret not only the constitutional provision,but also the statutory framework enacted by the bill.
principles of statutory construction 
the rules governing statutory construction are well established.our objective is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent.city of huntington beach board of administration cal th,see also mejia reed cal th,mejia.the same rules of construction apply when interpreting a voter initiative.robert superior court cal th,as modified,robert.

general overview of assembly bill 
to understand the parties competing arguments,an overview of assembly bill complex statutory framework is first in order.as previously noted,the bill contained two components a freeze component part,and a dissolution component part.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.the freeze component subjects redevelopment agencies to restrictions on new bonds or other indebtedness new plans or changes to existing plans and new partnerships,including joint powers authorities.the purpose of the freeze component was to preserve redevelopment agency assets.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.
the dissolution component dissolved redevelopment agencies and transferred control of redevelopment agency property and assets to successor agencies,subd.a dissolving development agencies,subd.b transferring former redevelopment agency assets to successor agencies.with limited exceptions,the city or county that created the redevelopment agency serves as the successor agency,subd.j defining successor agency,subd.a designating successor agencies as successor entities for the former redevelopment agencies.
a successor agency is a distinct legal entity from the city or county that provides for its governance,subd.g assem.bill,stats,ch,clarifying that a successor agency is a separate public entity from the city or county that provides for its governance.except for those provisions of the community redevelopment law that assembly bill repealed,restricted,or revised pursuant to the act adding this part,all authority,rights,powers,duties,and obligations previously vested with the former redevelopment agencies,under the community redevelopment law,vest in the successor agencies,subd.b.
assembly bill sets forth detailed procedures for successor agencies to satisfy the former redevelopment agencies enforceable obligations and wind down their affairs,subds.d j.successor agencies,under the supervision and direction of newly formed oversight boards,subd.a,are required,among other things,to dispose of redevelopment agency assets,cease performing or terminate all agreements that do not qualify as enforceable obligations,terminate certain agreements if doing so would be in the best interest of the taxing entities,and determine whether private party agreements should be terminated or renegotiated to reduce liabilities and increase net revenues to the taxing entities.listing successor agency actions requiring oversight board approval oversight board required to direct successor agencies to conduct various actions.
county also play a role in the winding down process.they must create a redevelopment property tax trust fund,which constitutes a special fund for purposes of article xvi,section,for the property tax revenues related to each former redevelopment agency,subd.b,subd.c.revenues equivalent to those that would have been allocated to redevelopment agencies as tax increment under article xvi,section,subdivision b are allocated to the redevelopment property tax trust fund of each successor agency for making payments on the principal and interest on loans,and moneys advanced to or indebtedness incurred by dissolved redevelopment agencies,subds.c d.amounts in excess of those necessary to pay obligations of the former redevelopment agency shall be deemed property tax revenues within the meaning of subdivision a of section of article xiiia of the california constitution,subd.d successor agencies must remit unencumbered balances of redevelopment agency funds to the controller for distribution to the taxing entities in making the distribution,the county shall utilize the same methodology for allocation and distribution of property tax revenues provided in section.
revenues from the redevelopment property tax trust fund are disbursed as follows sometimes referred to as the waterfall payment provisions administrative costs hereafter priority payments statutory and contractual passthrough payments to taxing agencies that would have been entitled to them had the rda not been dissolved hereafter priority payments enforceable obligations,as defined in section,subdivision d hereafter priority payments successor agency administrative costs hereafter priority payments and to local agencies and school entities in accordance with their pro rata entitlements to property taxes hereafter priority payments,subds.c e.the state controller is entitled to reimbursement for its costs in auditing and overseeing the redevelopment property tax trust fund,and those amounts,if any,are paid before priority payments,subd.d.with this statutory overview,we turn to the dispute between plaintiffs and the state.
c.the constitutionality of assembly bill 
to determine whether assembly bill violates proposition,plaintiffs contend we must resolve a single legal question does redevelopment agency tax increment survive the dissolution of redevelopment agencies 
according to plaintiffs,if tax increment survives redevelopment agency dissolution,then assembly bill violates article xvi,section,which authorizes tax increment financing for redevelopment plans,and article xiii,section,subdivision a,which limits what the legislature may do with an operating redevelopment agency tax increment matosantos i,supra,cal th at.if redevelopment agency tax increment no longer exists after dissolution,which plaintiffs argue is apparent from several provisions in assembly bill,then,the argument goes,the law purportedly violates proposition because all taxes redevelopment agencies would have received are now ad valorem property taxes that must be allocated to local agencies on a pro rata basis.
plaintiffs,however,ask and answer the wrong question.even if redevelopment agency tax increment no longer exists after redevelopment agency dissolution,the proper inquiry,we believe,is whether assembly bill changed the pro rata shares of any taxing entities that receive ad valorem property taxes within the meaning of proposition.because we find that assembly bill did not affect any such change,we conclude the legislature statutory scheme to dissolve and wind down redevelopment agencies does not violate proposition.
proposition was born out of three major fiscal events that drastically changed california economic landscape.the first occurred in the when the california supreme court struck down the taxing scheme for school financing because it resulted in inherent inequities in school funding among the various jurisdictions throughout the state.matosantos i,supra,cal th at serrano priest cal d,serrano priest cal d.at the time,each local jurisdiction,such as cities,counties,special districts,and school districts,could levy its own property tax.matosantos i at.the supreme court decision threw the division of state and local responsibility for educational funding into a state of flux,and the state eventually became the principal financial backstop for local school districts.ibid.
the second event occurred in when the electorate adopted proposition,which added article xiii a to the state constitution.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.section,subdivision a of that article reads the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed one percent of the full cash value of such property.the one percent tax to be collected by the counties and apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.
proposition thus replaced the multiple property taxes levied by local governmental agencies and substituted a capped,single tax to be collected by the counties and thereafter apportioned among those entities.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.proposition,in effect,convert ed the property tax from a nominally local tax to a de facto tax subject to a complex system of intergovernmental grants.ibid.it also meant that the property tax pie to be apportioned shrunk considerably by more than half.id.at.
following proposition passage,the legislature adopted a property tax allocation system that ensured that in any fiscal year,a local government received property tax revenues in an amount equal to what it received in the prior fiscal year,base and its share of the growth in revenue resulting from growth in assessed value within its boundaries,increment.city of scotts valley county.of santa cruz th,city of alhambra county of los angeles cal th,city of alhambra.the sum of these two amounts the prior year base plus the current year proportional share of the tax increment becomes each jurisdiction new base amount for the following year calculations.city of alhambra at.named after the assembly bill that originally enacted the fundamental structure of this statutory scheme,this system is commonly referred to as the allocation system ibid.
the third fiscal event occurred in when voters approved proposition,which added article xvi,section to the constitution.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.that section established a constitutional minimum funding level for education and required the state to designate a portion of the general fund for public schools.ibid.the minimum funding levels were raised two years later.ibid.
the state ability to meet its increased financial obligation to schools under proposition was severely tested in fiscal year,when the state faced an unprecedented budgetary crisis with expenditures projected to exceed revenues by more than billion.los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles th.the legislature responded to this economic crisis by creating county educational revenue augmentation funds eraf.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.the legislature exercised its authority to apportion property taxes cal,art.xiii a,subd.a,by reducing the property tax allocation of cities,counties,and special districts,and shifting the amount of the reduction to the eraf.matosantos i at.the eraf were then deemed part of the state general fund for purposes of satisfying its proposition obligations,and the money was distributed to school districts.ibid.because local governments had no vested right to property taxes los angeles unified school dist.at,the legislature could require them to make the eraf payments.matosantos i at.eraf shifts were periodically mandated since the eraf legislation was first enacted in.ibid.
it is against this financial backdrop that the electorate passed proposition in.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.proposition began as an initiative sponsored by the legislature.see budget,assembly floor analysis of const.amend.reg.sess.as amended july,at places a constitutional amendment to protect local government revenues before the voters at the november,general election.
according to one assembly floor analysis,the measure would p rohibit the legislature from enacting any law on or after november,that would reduce local governments percentage share of the property tax revenue in any county below what that share would be under existing state law as of november.see budget,assembly floor analysis of const.amend.reg.sess.as amended july,at.an analysis by the senate rules committee similarly described the bill as mak ing it more difficult for the legislature and the governor to shift property tax revenues from local governments rules com.analysis of const.amen.reg.sess.as amended july,at.
the ballot materials provided to the voters characterized proposition as p rohibit ing the state from reducing local governments property tax proceeds.protection of local government revenues,legis.counsel analysis of const.amend.at.the arguments in favor of the proposed constitutional amendment said it was needed t o stop the state from taking local government funding,and that it simply ensure d that existing local tax dollars continue to be dedicated to local services.id.at,argument in favor of const.amend.
these materials confirm that proposition was intended to prevent the legislature from statutorily reducing the existing allocations of property taxes among cities,counties,and special districts.in essence,it was intended to stop the periodic eraf shifts of property tax revenues from local agencies to satisfy the state school funding obligations.
given the historical context of proposition and its intended purpose,it becomes readily apparent that assembly bill does not violate proposition.assembly does not shift property taxes away from local governments.it does the opposite.
assembly bill reallocates to successor agencies,which are not local agencies within the meaning of proposition,the property tax revenues that would have gone to redevelopment agencies had they not been dissolved in order to satisfy indebtedness previously incurred under article xvi,section assem.bill,subds.i,j,subds.c solely for purposes of section of article xvi of the california constitution,the redevelopment property tax trust fund shall be deemed to be a special fund of the dissolved redevelopment agency d revenues equivalent to those that would have been allocated pursuant to subdivision b of section of article xvi of the california constitution shall be allocated to the redevelopment property tax trust fund of each successor agency for making payments on the principal of and interest on loans,and moneys advanced to or indebtedness incurred by the dissolved redevelopment agencies.amounts in excess of those necessary to pay obligations of the former redevelopment agency shall be deemed to be property tax revenues within the meaning of subdivision a of section of article xiii a of the california constitution.once such obligations are satisfied,any excess revenues are then allocated to local agencies according to their ab allocations,subd.d,subd.a.thus,rather than take funds away from local agencies,which proposition was intended to halt,assembly bill provides local agencies with more money than they otherwise would have received.
the example plaintiffs provide in their opening brief to show that a local agency purportedly does not receive its pro rata share of property taxes after assembly bill reinforces our interpretation rather than undermines it.they surmise that if a local agency was allocated a percent pro rata share of a property tax pool before assembly bill,it would have received.if the redevelopment agency in that jurisdiction would have received in tax increment prior to dissolution,plaintiffs claim that the local agency should now receive,or percent of.this would represent a net gain of for the local agency.but,assuming it takes a successor agency to satisfy the former redevelopment agency prior obligations under the waterfall payment provisions,then the local agency would only receive,or percent of a property tax pool after former redevelopment agency indebtedness is satisfied.
rather than prove that local agencies have somehow been slighted by assembly bill in the manner proposition was intended to guard against,plaintiffs example demonstrates that the pro rata share of the agency has not changed.both before and after assembly bill,the local agency retains its percent pro rata share.the agency simply has more money than it otherwise would have had had the legislature not passed assembly bill.while plaintiffs may complain that the extra piece of the property tax pie that they received as a result of assembly bill is not as big as they would have liked,this hardly means the legislature violated proposition when it enacted the statutory scheme to dissolve redevelopment agencies and wind down their affairs.
plaintiffs argument implicitly rests on the false premise that because they did not receive a certain amount of money after assembly bill,that their pro rata share therefore changed within the meaning of proposition.it did not.
the phrase pro rata ordinarily means to apportion or divide something according to a certain rate,percentage,or share.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed centennial ins.united states fire ins.th,fn.in the above example,assembly bill did not change the agency percent share.it remained constant both before and after the legislation.
local agencies have no vested right to a certain amount of property taxes.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.nothing in proposition changes that.proposition simply protects an agency pro rata share of property taxes.because assembly bill does not change the pro rata shares of local agency property tax allocations,it does not run afoul of proposition.
were we to accept plaintiffs argument,the legislature would only be able to dissolve redevelopment agencies and to reallocate their former tax increment after obtaining a vote of its membership.this is because as soon as redevelopment agencies were dissolved and their funds disbursed,in plaintiffs view,pro rata shares of property tax allocations would be affected thereby requiring a vote under proposition.yet nothing in the plain language of proposition,or the ballot materials supporting the amendment reveal that the electorate intended such a result.
constitutional restrictions on the legislature power are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.citations.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.normally,the legislature needs only a majority vote to pass legislation.cal,art.iv,subd.b no bill may be passed unless,by rollcall vote entered in the journal,a majority of the membership of each house concurs.we see no reason to artificially impose a heightened voting requirement for dissolving redevelopment agencies,which is clearly within the purview of the legislature authority.matosantos i,supra,cal t at state constitution vests legislature with power to create entities,such as redevelopment agencies,to carry out the state ends and the corollary power to dissolve those same entities when the legislature deems it necessary and proper.
plaintiffs objections to the waterfall payment provisions are likewise without merit.prior redevelopment plans providing for tax increment funding,many including contracts with work pending at the time of redevelopment agency dissolution and successor agency take over,have outstanding obligations that must be satisfied,subd.d defining enforceable obligations,subd.i successor agency has duty to continue to oversee development of properties until the contracted work has been completed or obligations transferred to other parties see also county of sonoma cohen,supra,th at affirming successor agency ability under to reenter into agreements between former redevelopment agency and itself in its municipal capacity.allocating former tax increment funds to successor agencies under the special trust and directing that those monies be distributed according to the waterfall payment provisions to cover redevelopment agency obligations,including administrative costs,payments,and enforceable obligations as defined allows this to occur.
as the supreme court recognized in matosantos i,the legislature has plenary power to set the conditions under which its political subdivisions like redevelopment agencies are abolished.cal th at.assembly bill withdrew redevelopment agency tax increment and reallocated that property tax to the successor agencies charged with winding down their affairs before any remaining funds were disbursed to other taxing entities.in doing so,the legislature struck a necessary balance.dissolving a dollar program is,to say the least,an incredibly complex undertaking that can not realistically be accomplished instantaneously.the supreme court acknowledged as much in matosantos matosantos i at as a practical and perhaps constitutional matter,to require an existing entity that has entered into a web of current contractual and other obligations to dissolve instantaneously is not possible doing so would inevitably raise serious impairment of contract questions.
given the above,it makes sense that the statutory scheme would refer to former tax increment of redevelopment agencies in section,subdivision a or otherwise refer to redevelopment agencies in the past tense.the same is true for language in section,subdivision a that as of the effective date of assembly bill,all provisions of the community redevelopment law that depend on the allocation of tax increment to redevelopment agencies were inoperative.that redevelopment agencies were no longer allocated tax increment under assembly bill,does not mean that local agencies pro rata shares of property taxes were altered within the meaning of proposition.
plaintiffs attempt to parse the language of section,subdivision d is unavailing.as we understand their argument,plaintiffs claim that administrative costs for auditor controllers and successor agencies priority and payments,payments priority payments and enforceable obligations priority payments are not obligations within the meaning of section,subdivision d.
but,administrative costs have historically been recognized as a redevelopment agency obligation.see arcadia redevelopment agency ikemoto th,redevelopment agencies subject to administrative costs imposed by community redevelopment agency county of los angeles th,same.so,too,have payments.matosantos i,supra,cal th at noting that redevelopment agencies must make a graduated series of payments to local government taxing agencies such as cities,counties,and school districts from tax increment on projects adopted or expanded after see also.and enforceable obligations as defined by section,subdivision d,most certainly fall within the ambit of the broader term obligations as used in section,subdivision d.
plaintiffs argument that priority payments are somehow newly created obligations is belied by section itself,which provides in relevant part the amount of the payments made pursuant to this paragraph shall be calculated solely on the basis of passthrough payment obligations,existing prior to the effective date of this part and continuing as obligations of successor entities,subd.a italics added.the fact that payments were existing prior to assembly bill and now continue as successor agency obligations necessarily means they are not new as plaintiffs argue.
the claim that priority payments no longer serve any legitimate constitutional purpose post assembly bill likewise misses the mark.that would be true only if assembly bill made it as if redevelopment agencies had never existed.but they did exist.and many of the burdens the legislature sought to alleviate with mandatory payments will continue into the foreseeable future until all redevelopment agency debts and obligations have been retired even though redevelopment agencies have been dissolved.see,subd.c successor agencies must perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation,subd.i successor agencies must continue to oversee development of properties until the contracted work has been completed or the contractual obligations of the former redevelopment agency can be transferred to other parties oversight board approval required before successor agency action merging project areas.
interpreting assembly bill,as we have,carries out the legislative mandate to wind down redevelopment agency affairs expeditiously,but over time,rather than abruptly as plaintiffs interpretation requires,subd.h successor agencies shall e xpeditiously wind down the affairs of the redevelopment agency pursuant to the provisions of this part and in accordance with the direction of the oversight board.
plaintiffs themselves concede interpreting assembly bill in the manner they suggest would constitutionally impair numerous third parties contractual rights.to avoid this,plaintiffs acknowledge that monies from the redevelopment property trust fund would have to be disbursed to holders of former redevelopment agency enforceable obligations before the balance of the trust fund could be disbursed to affected taxing entities.yet,according to them,disbursing the funds in this manner would still constitute a proposition violation.interpreting assembly bill in light of the purpose of proposition as we have avoids unconstitutionally impairing third party contractual rights.
if any interpretation coheres with constitutional mandates,we are to interpret assembly bill accordingly.davenport,supra,cal d at united states ex rel delaware and hudson,supra,at where a statute is susceptible of two constructions,by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided,our duty is to adopt the latter.we believe such an interpretation exists assembly bill need not be read in the constitutionally infirm fashion plaintiffs suggest.our task is not to view the legislation through an unconstitutional lens as plaintiffs urge,but rather through a constitutional one as we have done.kraus,supra,cal th at we presume that the legislature understands the constitutional limits on its power and intends that legislation respect those limits.
when read in context,assembly bill simply dissolved redevelopment agencies,provided for their wind up,and disbursed any remaining funds to local agencies in accordance with their ab allocations.as a result of assembly bill,local agencies receive more revenue than they otherwise would have been entitled to had redevelopment agencies not been dissolved.cal,art.xvi,subd.b.their pro rata shares of property taxes were not changed under the statutory scheme,and,therefore,assembly bill does not violate proposition.
article xi,section home rule doctrine 
plaintiffs next argue that assembly bill violates article xi,section,the doctrine.under the home rule doctrine,california constitution reserves to charter cities the right to adopt and enforce ordinances that conflict with general state laws,provided the subject of the regulation is a municipal affair rather than one of statewide concern.barajas city of anaheim th,cal,art.xi,subd.a.
plaintiffs concede,however,that they failed to raise their home rule argument in the trial court.because appellants did not argue this theory below,we find the issue forfeited and decline to address it here.central pathology service medical clinic,superior court cal th,fn.appellate courts need not address theories that were not advanced in the trial court vikco ins.services,ohio indemnity th,as a general rule,issues or theories not properly raised or presented before the trial court will not be considered on appeal.
article iv,section c presentation to the governor 
we next consider plaintiffs claim that assembly bill is invalid as a act appropriation.assembly bill was enrolled and presented to the governor at on june.senate bill the budget bill was enrolled and presented to the governor at that same day.plaintiffs contend this order of events violates article iv,section c,even if only by a few hours and even in the absence of any proof that the governor actually considered assembly bill before the budget bill.they urge the court to adopt a bright line rule declaring the legislature action unconstitutional.we need not decide whether a bright line rule applies,however,because we conclude the circumstances of this case come within one of the constitutional provision stated exceptions.
article iv,section c provides in pertinent part until the budget bill has been enacted,the legislature shall not send to the governor for consideration any bill appropriating funds for expenditure during the fiscal year for which the budget bill is to be enacted,except emergency bills recommended by the governor or appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the legislature.cal,art.iv,subd.c.one purpose of article iv,section c,as identified by the supreme court,is to enable the governor to consider the budget bill without a clutter of appropriation measures for the upcoming fiscal year constantly crossing his desk.jarvis cory cal d,procedure by which salary appropriation bill was enacted did not violate article iv,section c even though bill became law before budget bill was adopted since the order of enactments was due to the governor veto and not the legislature actions.
the plain language of the constitutional provision demonstrates,however,that under certain circumstances,the legislature may send an appropriation bill to the governor before the budget bill is enacted.jarvis cory,supra,cal d at.here,the state argues the exception for emergency bills recommended by the governor applies.in a passing reference to limited exceptions not relevant here,plaintiffs summarily dismiss the exception without any further discussion.we agree the state contention has merit.
governor brown declared a fiscal emergency in as a result of a projected billion budgetary shortfall.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.as a partial means of addressing this fiscal emergency,the governor recommended dissolving redevelopment agencies entirely.matosantos i,supra,cal th at see also legis.analyst,the budget should california end redevelopment agencies,the governor budget includes a plan for dissolving redevelopment agencies and distributing their funds see also governor budget summary,by july,existing redevelopment agencies would be disestablished and successor local agencies would be required to use the property tax that rdas would otherwise have received to retire rda debts and contractual obligations.
that is precisely what assembly bill did.it dissolved redevelopment agencies like the governor recommended,thereby making revenue available to address the emergency fiscal situation confronting the state.see assembly bill,this act addresses the fiscal emergency declared and affirmed by the governor by proclamation on january.because assembly bill contained an appropriation see assembly bill,appropriating to the department of finance to cover administrative costs of the act id.at this act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the budget bill,and was a bill enacted to address an impending fiscal emergency as recommended by the governor,the legislature did not violate article iv,section c by sending assembly bill to the governor.under the circumstances,assembly bill falls within the ambit of one of the constitutional provision express exceptions.
article iv,section single subject rule 
plaintiffs next argue that assembly bill violates the single subject rule found in article iv,section.according to plaintiffs,assembly bill contains more than one subject an appropriation for to carry out the act,and substantive changes to the community redevelopment law.
article iv,section provides that a statute shall embrace but one subject,which shall be expressed in its title.cal,art.iv.the constitutional provision contains two independent aspects which serve separate purposes.harbor deukmejian cal d,deukmejian.a statute must comply with both the requirement that it be confined to one subject and with the command that this one subject be expressed in its title.id.at.
the single subject clause has as its primary and universally recognized purpose the prevention of by the legislature,combining several proposals in a single bill so that legislators,by combining their votes,obtain a majority for a measure which would not have been approved if divided into separate bills.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.the purpose of the title clause is to prevent legislators and the public from being entrapped by misleading titles to bills whereby legislation relating to one subject might be obtained under the title of another.planned parenthood affiliates swoap d,planned parenthood.
to minimize judicial interference in legislative branch activities,courts must construe the single subject rule liberally.planned parenthood,supra,d at.the rule was not designed as a loophole of escape from,or a means for the destruction of,legitimate legislation.id.at.
a measure complies with the rule if its provisions are either functionally related to one another or are reasonably germane to one another or the objects of the enactment.deukmejian,supra,cal d at planned parenthood,supra,d at pp.however numerous the provisions of an act may be,if they can be fairly considered as falling within the of legislation,or as proper methods for the attainment of the end sought by the act,there is no conflict with the constitutional provision.a provision is deemed germane if it is auxiliary to and promotive of the main purpose of the act or has a necessary and natural connection with that purpose planned parenthood at.the title of an act defines the subject to which the substance of its provisions must be germane.planned parenthood,supra,d at.
the supreme court decision in deukmejian addressing the single subject rule is instructive.the legislation there was enacted days after the budget and was described as a trailer bill which trails the budget bill and is closely related to it.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.the petitioners suggested the subject of the bill was fiscal affairs,as stated in its title,and its object was to make statutory adjustments which relate to the ongoing allocation of state funds appropriated annually in the budget bill,within the state programs so funded.id.at.the bill amended,repealed,or added approximately sections contained in more than codes and legislative acts.id.at.
in finding a single subject violation,the court noted that the bill provisions were not functionally related or germane to one another,and that they appeared only minimally germane to fiscal affairs,an excessively general topic like government or public welfare.deukmejian,supra,cal d at noting that fiscal affairs as the subject of the bill and statutory adjustments to the budget as its object were matters of excessive generality.the bill many disparate provisions covered such diverse subjects as amending the business and professions code to require that before transmitting a fiscal impact report to the legislature,agencies within the department of consumer affairs had to submit it to the director of the department,providing that the contractors state license board may disclose to the public general information regarding complaints against licensees,amending the military and veterans code to provide that a veterans home may be appointed guardian of the estate of a veteran,and permitting concession contracts for state parks to exceed years.id.at.and they were only tangentially related to fiscal affairs in the sense that they reduced expenditures or raised revenues.id.at.
here,by contrast,the provisions of assembly bill are reasonably germane to one another and to the object or purpose of the act.the title of assembly bill states that it is an act to amend certain code sections relating to redevelopment,and making an appropriation therefor,to take effect immediately,bill related to the budget.assembly bill,ch.viewed objectively,the purpose of the act was to address the state budget deficit during the declared fiscal crisis in and balance the budget in part by dissolving redevelopment agencies,winding down their affairs,and reallocating their assets as a means of relieving pressure on the state to backfill educational funding requirement shortfalls.assembly bill,ch,matosantos i,supra,cal th at responding to a declared state fiscal emergency,in the summer of the legislature enacted two measures intended to stabilize school funding by reducing or eliminating the diversion of property tax revenues from school districts to the state community redevelopment agencies.
examining assembly bill specific provisions reveals a functional relationship or germaneness between its parts.the act amends statutes dealing with redevelopment agency operations and adds new statutory provisions regarding their dissolution and windup.assembly bill,ch.the act appropriates funds for the purpose of covering administrative costs associated with the dissolution and windup process.assembly bill,ch.dissolving redevelopment agencies property tax revenues for local agencies to spend on core services,including education.the provisions of assembly bill,then,all relate to the subject of redevelopment and its impact on available funding sources to combat the declared fiscal crisis and balance the budget.see league of women voters eu th,distinguishing the subject of fiscal affairs under deukmejian from the sufficiently narrow subject of budget balancing for purposes of the single subject rule league of women voters.although league of women voters dealt with the single subject rule applicable to initiatives cal,art.ii,the same principles apply to the single subject rule relating to initiatives as to legislative enactments.league of women voters,supra,th at,fn.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
the provisions,moreover,are also reasonably germane to and promote assembly bill main purpose as described above,which we believe is a sufficiently narrow single subject.when enacted,redevelopment agencies were siphoning off billions in property taxes that otherwise would have gone to local agencies such as schools,counties,special districts,and cities.assembly bill,ch,subds.c,d e.redevelopment agencies were estimated to divert billion in property tax revenue from other taxing agencies in the fiscal year alone.assembly bill,ch,subd.g.the state was required to backfill school funds which otherwise would have been available in the absence of redevelopment agencies.matosantos i,supra,cal th at.
dissolving redevelopment agencies and reallocating the property taxes they would have received to first satisfy their obligations and wind down their affairs,with any remaining balances given to local agencies to spend on services such as schools and education,assembly bill,in a reasonably germane manner,helped alleviate the budget shortfall and balance the budget during a discrete fiscal crisis.league of women voters,supra,th at budget balancing purpose complies with single subject rule.rather than an amorphous and excessively general purpose such as fiscal affairs,the purpose of assembly bill was much more focused.in short,assembly bill was not a multifaceted measure of undue scope like the bill at issue in deukmejian.
the cases upon which plaintiffs rely for the proposition that budget bills can not be utilized to substantively amend and change existing statute law do not dictate a different result.california lab.federation occupational safety health stds.bd.th,planned parenthood,supra,d at,and tomra pacific,chiang th,all involved single subject challenges to the budget act itself.but assembly bill was not the budget bill.the fact that assembly bill was related to the budget bill for purposes of proposition does not automatically convert the bill into the budget bill for purposes of the single subject rule.
as the state notes,citing people wallace th,t railer bills are generally separated by subject area such as education,resources,or health,to minimize possible conflicts with single subject limitations that could occur if a general omnibus trailer bill were to be proposed.in other words,a trailer bill is not part of the budget act it is separate and remains subject to veto.professional engineers,supra,cal th at.
given the germaneness of assembly bill provisions to its sufficiently narrow subject and purpose,we find no constitutional violation of article iv,section.because we conclude assembly bill satisfies the single subject rule,there is no basis for plaintiffs claim that the legislation is an example of logrolling.league of women voters,supra,th at noting the single subject rule is designed to specifically guard against logrolling consequently,if proposed legislation conduces to a single subject,logrolling is not an issue.
article iv,section majority approval of a budget related appropriations bill 
plaintiffs next argue assembly bill does not constitute a bill providing for appropriations relat ing to the budget bill under amendments to article iv,section,which were added to the constitution following the voters approval of proposition.as amended,article iv,section provides that such bills may be passed by a majority vote of the legislature.cal,art.iv,d e.finding assembly bill falls within the constitutional language added by the amendments,we reject plaintiffs contention.
prior to proposition,a supermajority of the legislature was required to pass an annual budget.cal,art.iv,former.that changed in november when voters approved proposition,known as the on time budget act of.proposition added language to existing subdivision d and added new subdivision e to section of article iv.
article iv,section d now reads no bill except the budget bill may contain more than one item of appropriation,and that for one certain,express purpose.appropriations from the general fund of the state,except appropriations for the public schools and appropriations in the budget bill and in other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill,are void unless passed in each house by rollcall vote entered in the journal,of the membership concurring.cal,art.iv,subd.d language added by proposition amendment in italics.
article iv,section e further explains notwithstanding any other provision of law or of this constitution,the budget bill and other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill may be passed in each house by rollcall vote entered in the journal,a majority of the membership concurring,to take effect immediately upon being signed by the governor or upon a date specified in the legislation.cal,art.iv,subd.e.subdivision e,in turn,states for purposes of this section,other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill shall consist only of bills identified as related to the budget in the budget bill passed by the legislature.cal,art.iv,subd.e.
because we are tasked with construing the meaning of the constitution,as amended by the electorate in proposition,our overarching goal is to interpret the words so as to effectuate the electorate intent.people elliott cal th.the same general principles regarding statutory construction apply.ibid.we begin with the plain meaning of the words chosen,and if the plain meaning is not apparent,we look to extrinsic aids such as the purpose of the amendment,the evil to be remedied,the policy to be achieved,and analyses and arguments contained in official ballot materials.ibid.
in this case,proposition expressly defined the meaning of other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill.cal,art.iv,e.as defined,the phrase means only of bills identified as related to the budget in the budget bill passed by the legislature.here,assembly bill appropriates to the department of finance from the general fund for administrative costs associated with the act and declares that it is a budget related bill.stats,ch.section of the act provides this act is a bill providing for appropriations related to the budget bill within the meaning of subdivision e of section of article iv of the california constitution,has been identified as related to the budget in the budget bill,and shall take effect immediately.stats,ch.
senate bill,the budget bill for,specifically identifies assembly bill as one of many other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill.bill.enacted as stats,ch,the legislature hereby finds and declares that the following bills are other bills providing for appropriations related to the budget bill within the meaning of subdivision e of section of article iv of the california constitution.
assembly bill thus contains an appropriation and is identified as being related to the budget in the budget bill.under the plain language added by proposition,then,assembly bill qualifies as an other bill providing for appropriations related to the budget bill within the meaning of article iv,section e.matosantos i,supra,cal th at we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the legislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited county of riverside superior court cal th.
