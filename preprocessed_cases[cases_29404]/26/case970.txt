this appeal requires us to decide whether a private corporation that runs a charter in arizona was a state actor under when it took certain actions with respect to a former teacher,michael caviness.the district court held that horizon community learning center horizon and its executive director,lawrence pieratt,were not functioning as state actors in these circumstances because the allegations in caviness complaint are insufficient to raise a reasonable inference that horizon was a state actor and thus acted under color of state law in taking the alleged actions after caviness was terminated,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
horizon is a private,corporation that operates a charter school in arizona.because caviness argument is primarily based on the arizona statutes and regulations that authorize and regulate charter schools,we provide a brief description of the relevant provisions.
in arizona,charter schools are public school s established by contract with a district governing board,the state board of education,or the state board for charter schools to provide learning that will improve pupil achievement.footnote omitted.charter schools serve as alternatives to traditional public schools by provid ing additional academic choices for parents and pupils,and they are intended to provide a learning environment that will improve pupil achievement.id.a.by contrast,arizona defines a private school as a nonpublic institution where instruction is imparted.id.charter schools are publicly funded,although they are authorized to accept private grants and gifts.id.d.
a private or public entity seeking to create a charter school must submit an application and be sponsored by either a school district governing board,the state board of education or the state board for charter schools.id.c in turn,t he sponsor of a charter school may contract with a public body,private person or private organization for the purpose of establishing a charter school id.b.the sponsoring entity of a charter school has oversight and administrative responsibility for the charter schools that it sponsors.id.r.
each charter school must develop a plan for running the school on a largely autonomous basis.a school charter must specify a governing body for the charter school that is responsible for the policy decisions of the charter school.id.e.the charter must include a description of the charter school personnel policies,personnel qualifications and method of school governance and the specific role and duties of the sponsor of the charter school.id.f.
charter schools are subject to certain state regulations.the state department of education promulgates a list notifying charter schools of their obligations to comply with specified federal,state,and local statutes and rules relating to health,safety,civil rights,and insurance.id.e.charter schools are required to display a united states flag in each classroom and,for grades through,purchase copies of the constitution and bill of rights.id.according to arizona attorney general,charter schools are deemed to be political subdivisions of the state for purposes of complying with arizona open meetings act.see.op.atty,wl at.but see salt river indian cmty.sch.arizona,holding that the attorney general conclusion that charter schools were political subdivisions of the state for purposes of open meeting laws did not influence the court determination that charter schools were not political subdivisions of the state for purposes of a federal statute that limited the amount of federal funds such schools could receive.
several arizona statutes are applicable to charter school employees.charter school employees must undergo and background checks,and charter schools may not employ teachers who have been convicted of certain crimes.c.teachers at charter schools are also afforded certain benefits.among other things,a charter school that is sponsored by a school district governing board,the state board of education or the state board for charter schools is eligible to participate in the arizona state retirement system id.c.state retirement benefits are available to any person in the employ of a political subdivision of arizona,id,and charter schools are a political subdivision of th e state for purposes of employee retirement eligibility definitions in title,chapter,article,id.c.
except as otherwise specified in arizona statutes regulating charter schools,or in the school own charter,a charter school is exempt from all statutes and rules relating to schools,governing boards and school districts.id.e.charter schools are therefore exempt from state requirements,as well as the statutes governing dismissal of certified teachers.see id.et.
caviness was employed as a high school physical education teacher,health teacher,and track coach at horizon for six years in february,a female student filed a grievance against caviness alleging that the boundary had been crossed.horizon immediately put caviness on paid administrative leave and thereafter initiated an investigation.in march,the horizon board held a hearing regarding the student allegations,at which horizon,but not caviness,questioned the student.
evidence elicited at the hearing indicated that the female student and caviness had been communicating via telephone,and that the student had a crush on him.when the student learned that caviness had an adult girlfriend,the student became upset and retaliated against caviness by filing the grievance.the horizon board determined that caviness had exercised questionable judgment regarding the extent of his personal communications with the student,and therefore decided not to renew caviness teaching and coaching contract.the board decided to keep caviness on paid administrative leave until the end of his employment term,which was in june.
in april,pieratt wrote a letter to caviness and sent copies to the horizon board members and the arizona department of education.caviness alleges that the letter contained numerous false and defamatory statements and private information which pieratt misused to purposely place caviness in a bad light.in may,caviness asked pieratt for permission to attend the arizona state high school track championship to watch several horizon students compete,but pieratt refused to consent.
in july,after the end of his employment term with horizon,caviness applied for a position as a teacher and coach with mesa school district.mesa decided not to hire him after it asked pieratt to rate caviness ability and knowledge as a teacher,and pieratt declined to rate him since the horizon board had taken the action of his contract.caviness alleges that pieratt statement to mesa was purposely false and incomplete and was intended to harm caviness,since pieratt knew that caviness had an excellent record as a teacher and coach and it was reasonable and appropriate for pieratt to respond accordingly rather than decline to provide information.
in august,caviness attorney sent a letter to horizon informing it that a horizon employee had called caviness a pedophile.the letter demanded written representations from horizon that it had instructed all of its agents and employees to cease and desist from making any further false and defamatory statements to anyone.in his reply to this letter,pieratt did not address these demands,and caviness claims that another horizon teacher subsequently defamed him by also calling him a pedophile.
on december,caviness sent a request to pieratt for a hearing arising from defendant conduct failure to act subsequent to the march,hearing,and his right to freedom of association.horizon did not respond to this request.
in march,caviness filed a complaint under in district court against horizon.caviness alleged that horizon,acting under color of state law,deprived caviness of his liberty interest in finding and obtaining work without due process by making several false statements about him in connection with his employment,which cause d serious damage to caviness standing and associations in the community or,alternatively,imposed on caviness a stigma that has interfered with his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities,without providing caviness with notice or a hearing.caviness also alleged that horizon violated his first amendment right to freedom of association by ordering him not to freely associate at certain public events.
in an order issued august,the district court sua sponte raised the question whether horizon was a state actor for purposes of,and directed the parties to submit memoranda in support of federal subject matter jurisdiction.the district court subsequently granted horizon motion requesting that this briefing be treated as a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.
on december,the district court granted horizon motion to dismiss.in its order,the district court rejected caviness arguments that horizon was a state actor because of its statutory characterization as a public school,and because it performed a public function in providing public education.because there was no evidence,with respect to caviness specific employment claims,that horizon acted in concert or conspired with state actors,was subject to government coercion or encouragement,or was otherwise entwined or controlled by an agency of the state,the district court held that horizon was not functioning as a state actor in executing its employment decisions regarding caviness.
caviness brought this timely appeal from the district court order granting horizon motion to dismiss.

this case presents the special situation of a private nonprofit corporation running a charter school that is defined as a public school by state law.we therefore begin with the recognition that arizona has statutorily defined a charter school as a public school.however,because the conduct of a private corporation is at issue,our inquiry does not end there.rather,in answering the question whether there is a close nexus between the state and the challenged action,our inquiry begins by identifying the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.sullivan,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also blum,at.faithful adherence to the state action requirement requires careful attention to the gravamen of the plaintiff complaint.it is important to identify the function at issue because an entity may be a state actor for some purposes but not for others.lee,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
thus,in george work furlough,we considered the complaint by a custodial staff employee of a private entity,pacific,which had contracted with california to operate a correctional facility,cir.after the custodial employee was terminated,he sued the private company under,alleging that his first amendment rights were violated because he was terminated for speaking out about safety and security problems.in rejecting the employee theory that pacific was a state actor because it was performing and fulfilling a traditional state and government function,operating a correctional detention facility,we explained that t he relevant inquiry is whether pacific role as an employer was state action in the employee case,and noted that a n entity may be a state actor for some purposes but not for others.id.emphasis in original.we concluded that while pacific ha d been granted certain powers and privileges under the law to allow it to function adequately as a prison,the plaintiff failed to show state action because the complaint offer ed no indication pacific ha d become the government for employment purposes.id.internal citation,quotation marks,and alterations omitted see also cornish corr.servs,cir in suit by terminated employee of private prison contractor,question in determining state action is whether defendant acted under color of state law in terminating plaintiff employment,not whether its providing juvenile correctional services was state action.
in this case,caviness complaint objects to horizon failure to instruct its employees to cease making statements about caviness performance as a teacher,and its refusal to provide him with a hearing.the complaint also objects to horizon order forbidding caviness from having contact with students during the paid administrative leave period.all these actions were taken by horizon in connection with its role as caviness employer,and therefore the relevant inquiry in this case is whether horizon role as an employer was state action.george,at.
in determining whether caviness factual allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief,iqbal.at,we are limited to the pleadings in the complaint.with respect to caviness claim that horizon actions in its role as his employer constituted state action,caviness complaint alleges only that horizon is a corporation,an arizona charter school,and an arizona public school operating in maricopa county,and that pieratt was acting as president,ceo,or executive director of horizon.caviness does not argue that the facts alleged in his complaint render horizon a state actor.rather,he argues that under arizona statutory scheme,all charter schools are,as a matter of law,state actors.therefore,caviness appeal must fail unless being an arizona charter school is,by that fact alone,sufficient to make horizon the government for employment purposes.
caviness first argues that under the statutory and regulatory structure in arizona,a charter school is a state actor for all purposes,including employment purposes,as a matter of law.caviness first relies on the fact that arizona statutes designate charter schools as public schools,to argue that they provide public educational services as a matter of law.further,he notes that the arizona attorney general has concluded that charter school board meetings are subject to arizona open meetings act.see.op.atty,wl,at.
we disagree.under,a state statutory characterization of a private entity as a public actor for some purposes is not necessarily dispositive with respect to all of that entity conduct.see jackson met.edison,d statutory designation of utility as public utility
