michael massey and mickey mills,while employed at the vincennes university aircraft technology center,wrote letters to the indiana legislature complaining about their superiors.in the aftermath of the letters,both massey and mills were discharged.they then brought this federal civil rights action,see,against three university administrators,alleging that they were harassed and terminated in retaliation for exercising their first amendment rights.the defendants moved for and were awarded summary judgment.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
the aircraft technology center the atc,a branch of indiana vincennes university,opened in the to offer degrees in aviation science,technology and maintenance.built adjacent to the indianapolis international airport,the campus consists of classrooms in which students receive training in airplane repair.the defendants in this action were,at all times relevant to this appeal,atc and vincennes university administrators.mable johnson served as dean of the atc,commencing her tenure in.working out of an office at the atc campus,she was in charge of the atc faculty and operations staff.the other two defendants,gazella summitt and james messmer,are administrators at the vincennes university main campus,located approximately miles from the atc in vincennes,indiana.summitt is the human relations director of vincennes university messmer is the university vice president of statewide services.
until he was terminated,the plaintiff michael massey was employed by the atc as a janitor.he was hired in by the custodian supervisor mike hare,with the approval of dean johnson.by most accounts,massey was a dependable janitor he worked the night shift,rarely took sick leave and received positive performance evaluations from his superiors.the other plaintiff in this action,mickey mills,worked for the atc as an evening shift librarian until her termination.
the events of this controversy began in february,when massey authored a letter detailing a number of very personal and serious accusations against dean johnson.among the letter allegations were charges that dean johnson had hired her boyfriend and her daughter for positions within the atc,in violation of the university policy.in addition,the letter alleged that dean johnson had mistreated a disabled employee and had obtained her graduate degree through academic fraud.the letter also noted that internal grievances to summitt,the university human relations director,had gone ignored.massey mailed this letter to the president of vincennes university and to each member of the indiana legislature.
upon learning of the letter,messmer and summitt investigated massey complaints and concluded that they were unfounded they reported these findings to the university president.dean johnson,understandably upset by massey accusations,instructed massey supervisor to fire him,but the supervisor,mike hare,refused.shortly thereafter,steve laroche,a custodian supervisor at the main campus,became massey official supervisor.hare,who worked at the atc,evidently remained massey direct supervisor,but he took frequent telephone instructions from laroche concerning custodial operations at the atc.ultimately,two months after massey sent his letter,he was fired.according to laroche,who made the decision,he discharged massey for attempting to justify a period of sick leave by using what appeared to be falsified doctors notes.when laroche attempted to discuss these notes with massey,laroche was unable to locate him,and he concluded that massey was avoiding him.
after his termination,massey remained in contact with mickey mills,the other plaintiff in this action.prompted by her discussions with massey,mills authored a letter of her own supporting massey previous accusations against dean johnson and reporting that,in the aftermath of the massey letter,university officials conducted a sham investigation to cover up the wrongdoing.she mailed this and similar letters to indiana legislators and to the federal aviation administration her last letter was sent on september.mills also showed one of her letters to her supervisor,who in turn showed it to dean johnson.once dean johnson learned of the letter,mills allegedly was ostracized by her fellow employees and began to receive an unprecedented stream of reprimands,assignment changes and negative evaluations.in august,her evening shift position was cut to when the atc library changed its closing time from midnight to finally,in november,and approximately two months after the date of her last letter,mills was terminated.as its reason for discharging her,the atc cited reduced enrollment and elimination of the school evening program.notably,dean johnson,the accused wrongdoer in the plaintiffs letters,also had her position eliminated as a result of these factors.
district court proceedings 
on april,massey and mills joined in filing a complaint under,alleging that they were harassed and terminated in retaliation for exercising their first amendment right to free speech.after almost one year of discovery,dean johnson,messmer and summitt moved for summary judgment.in deciding the defendants motion,the district court first addressed the allegations related to massey termination.at the outset,the court noted that the decision to fire massey was made directly by steve laroche,a supervisor operating within a chain of command that did not include dean johnson.therefore,in the court view,even if there were direct evidence of retaliatory animus on the part of dean johnson,this evidence could not be attributed to laroche,the true decision maker involved in massey termination.as for circumstantial proof,the court concluded that massey had not presented anything other than his subjective belief that laroche reason for firing fake doctor pretext.according to the court,the undisputed evidence showed that the notes were indeed suspicious and that massey never had made himself available to provide laroche with an explanation.this,in the court view,was a valid reason for firing massey,and one that had not been rebutted as false.
similarly,the court determined that mills evidence did not suggest directly that the individuals involved in her termination were motivated by retaliation.most notably,the court discounted evidence of a meeting in which the defendant,messmer,became visibly angry at mills for writing her letters.according to the court,proof that messmer was angered by mills protected speech was insufficient to prove retaliation rather,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the challenged action would not have occurred but for his constitutionally protected conduct.at quoting love city of chicago bd,cir.alternatively,the court held that,even if retaliation was a partially motivating factor,the defendants had offered a legitimate and persuasive justification for firing enrollment and budget mills had not rebutted as pretext.
