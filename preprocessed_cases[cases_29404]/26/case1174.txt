subsequently,on december,vila learned the college had entered into a contract with zimmerman without her knowledge.the contract was not drafted or reviewed by vila or anyone else in legal affairs,and vila only learned of the contract because it appeared on the agenda of the board of trustees meeting for december.when vila and college attorney fleta stamen reviewed the agenda prior to the meeting,they became concerned that the wording of the agenda item would give the board the impression zimmerman was selected after a.vila and stamen sent jeffrey lukenbill,the college provost,an explaining that they believed the wording for the agenda item was misleading and that as a matter of law mdcc could not contract for over regardless of the contract between zimmerman and the foundation.in response to these concerns,padrón and the director of communications made a presentation to the board regarding the process by which zimmerman was hired and explained the terms of the contract between the foundation and zimmerman.
