plaintiff binyam gebremicael appeals from the trial court determination the reduction of his prior felony conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code section had no effect on his eligibility to apply for a teaching credential.we reverse.
facts and procedural history 
in,plaintiff pled no contest to one count of violating penal code section,discharge of a firearm in a grossly negligent manner,a felony.the trial court found defendant guilty as charged,but it suspended the imposition of sentence and admitted plaintiff to probation for three years,subject to plaintiff serving days in the county jail 
in,the trial court granted plaintiff petition to reduce the felony conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code section.in december and pursuant to penal code section,the trial court granted plaintiff petition to withdraw his plea and have the matter dismissed.
meanwhile,in december,plaintiff applied to defendant california commission on teacher credentialing commission for a teaching credential.as required by the application,plaintiff admitted he had been convicted in of violating penal code section.he also noted his conviction had been reduced to a misdemeanor in.court documents subsequently requested by the commission confirmed these facts.
in july,plaintiff filed another application with the commission,this one for an emergency substitute teaching credential.plaintiff again disclosed his prior conviction and its subsequent reduction to a misdemeanor.
by letter dated september,the commission denied both of plaintiff applications.the commission explained education code section mandated it to deny applications for credentials to any person who had been convicted of a serious felony,and plaintiff prior conviction was a serious felony for that purpose.
plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief against the commission.he argued the trial court reduction of his conviction to a misdemeanor for all purposes under penal code section included for purposes of teacher credentialing.the commission,he asserted,was not obligated to reject his applications where his felony had become a misdemeanor by the time he applied.he also sought attorneys fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section and government code section.
the trial court denied the petition and complaint.plaintiff timely appealed.
discussion 
plaintiff claims the mandatory denial provision of education code section does not apply to him because at the time of his applications he stood convicted of a misdemeanor,not a felony.we agree.
education code section reads in pertinent part 
a the commission shall deny any application for the issuance of a credential made by an applicant who has been convicted of a violent or serious felony 
b this section applies to any violent or serious offense which,if committed in this state,would have been punishable as a violent or serious felony.
c for purposes of this section,a violent felony is any felony listed in subdivision c of section of the penal code and a serious felony is any felony listed in subdivision c of section of the penal code.
d notwithstanding subdivision a,the commission may,but is not required to,grant a credential to an applicant who has been convicted of a violent or serious felony if the person is eligible for,and has obtained,a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the penal code.
plaintiff pled no contest to violating penal code section,a wobbler punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor and listed as a violent felony under penal code section,subdivision c,and a serious felony under penal code section,subdivision c.a wobbler offense stands as a felony unless and until one of the conditions listed in penal code section,subdivision b,is satisfied,subds.a,b in re trummer cal d.
here,the trial court,upon plaintiff petition,reduced plaintiff felony conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code section,subdivision b,which reads in relevant part 
b when a crime is punishable,in the discretion of the court,by imprisonment in the state prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail,it is a misdemeanor for all purposes under the following circumstances 
when the court grants probation to a defendant without imposition of sentence and on application of the defendant or probation officer thereafter,the court declares the offense to be a misdemeanor.italics added.
relief under penal code section,subdivision b,is not retroactive in operation.people marsh d.a crime subject to its provisions is regarded as a misdemeanor only for purposes subsequent to judgment.people weaver d.
however,once a court has reduced a wobbler to a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code section,the crime is thereafter regarded as a misdemeanor for all purposes.this unambiguous language means what it says,and unless the legislature states otherwise,a person such as plaintiff stands convicted of a misdemeanor,not a felony,for all purposes upon the court so declaring.
in people banks cal d,banks,the supreme court shed light on how penal code section operates.that case arose from a defendant conviction of unlawfully possessing a firearm by a felon under penal code section.the defendant contended he was not a previously convicted felon.he had earlier pled guilty to a vehicle code wobbler offense,but the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and ordered him to probation plus months in the county jail.defendant completed probation without violation,and argued these facts demonstrated he had been convicted only of a misdemeanor id.at.
the court disagreed,finding he remained convicted of a felony because he failed to take the available procedural steps to reduce his conviction to a misdemeanor.however,in reaching its conclusion,the court explained in dicta the operation and effect of a felony conviction to a wobbler offense that may subsequently be reduced to a misdemeanor.because of the discussion application here,we quote it at length 
an integral and important part of the penological plan of california is the discretionary retention in the trial court of jurisdiction over the defendant and the cause of action against him in a large area of crimes by virtue of the probation procedures.it is apparent from mere perusal of the pertinent legislation that a verdict or plea of guilty in a superior court criminal case is not ipso facto a final conviction.if judgment is pronounced it may be reversed on appeal and set completely at naught thereby,if there is not a new trial and a new conviction the defendant will be a person who has any purpose convicted of a felony.the conviction may also be set at nought,except for expressly defined purposes,when jurisdiction and control over the defendant and the cause of action have been retained in the court under the probation law with or without pronouncement of sentence and the probation procedures have been fully executed.if jurisdiction over the subject and res of the action ceases to exist in the court trial or appellate the judgment becomes final and the trial procedures have ended 
when the verdict or plea of guilty comes in,the trial court,if it chooses to retain jurisdiction under the probation statutes,may either pronounce judgment and suspend its execution,refrain from issuing a commitment of the defendant to the adult or other prison authority pending administration of the probation plan,or it may suspend refrain from the pronouncement of judgment,subject to administration of the probation laws.of course in the latter case,it does not suspend execution of the judgment and withhold commitment to the adult or other prison authority because without having pronounced judgment it has no power to commit the defendant to the prison authority 
upon pronouncement of sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for any term less than life,the defendant acquires the legal status of a person who has been both convicted of a felony and sentenced to such imprisonment 
by contrast,the defendant whose guilt has been established by plea,finding or verdict but who has not been sentenced to prison,where probation has been
