in order to reduce salary stagnation among mid to teachers and stay competitive with other area school districts,the stockton unified school district and the stockton teachers association sta entered into a collective bargaining agreement for a new,compressed salary schedule,allowing teachers to obtain merit increases in salary more quickly.
after the school district implemented the agreement by reassigning certain teachers to step levels that did not correspond with their years of experience,certain individual senior teachers and the sta collectively,the teachers filed a petition for writ of mandate against the stockton unified school district,its governing board and superintendent collectively,the district,claiming that the district actions violated education code section which requires that teacher salaries shall be classified on the salary schedule on the basis of uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience,subd.a.
the trial court agreed with the teachers that the district formulation of the compressed schedule constituted a uniformity violation.the court also ruled that no statutory exception to the uniformity requirement existed and that the teachers had not waived their right to relief by virtue of the sta ratification of the contract.the court ordered the district to restore the experience credit that the affected teachers had lost due to the implementation of the new schedule.
the district appeals,claiming the compressed schedule as adopted did not violate the uniformity requirement of section if the new system was not uniform,it fell within the other criteria exception to the uniformity requirement set forth in government code section.and assuming there was a uniformity violation and that no exception applied,the writ remedy exceeded the trial court mandate jurisdiction and unduly interfered with the right of contract.
we agree with the trial court that the district implementation of the salary schedule violated the uniformity requirement of section.we also conclude that no exception applied and that the trial court did not exceed its powers in remedying the violation.we shall affirm the judgment granting mandamus relief to the teachers.
factual and procedural background 
negotiations and agreement 
prior to july of,district teacher salaries were set according to a schedule featuring horizontal and vertical grid lines.the six classifications running horizontally across the grid classes a through f represented a teacher level of course work training.the numbered classifications running vertically down the grid represented the number of years of teaching experience.a teacher salary was determined by which step,or cell,a teacher fell into on the grid.see table a,post,at.
in the fall of,the district and the sta,the collective bargaining unit for district teachers,entered into negotiations for a new salary schedule.a chief objective for both sides was to make stockton more competitive with neighboring school districts such as modesto,tracy and lodi for teachers in the mid to high salary levels.the sta was also concerned about salary stagnation,since other districts allowed teachers to reach the high end of the salary scale much sooner than they did in stockton the idea of compressing the salary schedule was proposed by the sta as a means of enabling teachers to reach the high end of the salary ladder more quickly.
in addition to salary raises for all teachers,the parties agreed to eliminate steps,and,renumber step to step,step to step,and all subsequent steps accordingly so that the former schedule now consisted of steps.tables a b,post,at.
an agreement,which called for both a salary increase and a compressed salary schedule,retroactive to july,was signed in november after the agreement was signed,the district moved all teachers who had,and years of experience into step.as a result,the step number assigned to teachers with or more years of service no longer corresponded with their accrued years of experience.for example,a teacher with years of experience was moved back one step,to step a teacher with years of experience was moved back two steps,to step and a teacher with years of experience was moved back three steps,to step.the district continued to credit each teacher for the number of years of experience as far as benefits,seniority and retirement.the net effect of the district actions was to enable teachers with years of experience or less to move up the salary ladder faster.see tables a b,post,at.
the petition for writ of mandate 
in january,the teachers filed a petition for writ of mandate.the petition was predicated on section,which mandates that all teacher salary schedules be uniform when based on years of experience and training.petitioners alleged that the district violated the mandate by regressing teachers with,and years of experience on the salary schedule back to step.as a result,w hile teachers on steps through will progress through the schedule in years,petitioners at steps through will be required to work through years,or more,to attain the same years of credit.petitioners concluded that i n effect,one to three years of actual teaching experience were eliminated for the affected teachers,treating them disparately solely as to years of experience.
the petition prayed for reinstatement of all aggrieved teachers on the schedule according to a uniform credit for each year of experience,and restoration of all compensation and corresponding benefits of which the petitioners had been unlawfully deprived.
trial and judgment 
after extensive briefing and a hearing on the merits,the trial court granted the writ of mandate.the court ruled that by moving all teachers in steps through into step,the district deprived teachers who had been in steps through on the schedule of one to three years of experience credit.by contrast,teachers who were in steps through lost no experience credit.
the court concluded that this scheme lacked the uniformity mandated by education code section inasmuch as the parties never agreed to any factors,other than years of experience and training,as the criteria upon which the disputed salary schedule operated.
determining that the district regression of step levels deprived petitioners of the full compensation to which they were entitled,the trial court directed recalculation of their compensation based upon actual years of earned experience,without the one to three year regression.the court ordered that the district restore all such lost compensation as well as corresponding retirement contributions.
discussion 
principles of review and statutory backgrounda.general principles of review 
the question we face is whether the district implementation of the compressed salary schedule violated the uniformity requirement of section,and if so,whether any statutory exception to the requirement applies.where the facts are undisputed,an appellate court reviews issues of statutory interpretation de novo.california teachers governing bd.of hilmar unified school dist.th,d hilmar.as stated in hilmar,our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.id.at,d.
historical background of education code section and government code section 
in the,education code section then empowered school districts to adopt any salary schedule based on reasonable classifications.hilmar,supra,th at,d.salary schedules based on years of training and experience were permissible as long as they were not arbitrary,discriminatory or unreasonable.see rible hughes cal d,shoban board of trustees d.however,i n the legislature amended section then and greatly reduced the flexibility of school districts in fixing compensation of teachers.the amendment mandated that teachers be classified for salary purposes and required that the classification proceed wholly on a uniform basis of years of training and years of experience.hilmar,supra,th at,d,quoting palos verdes faculty palos verdes peninsula unified sch.dist.cal d,palos verdes.as amended,section was interpreted to mean that years of education and years of experience were the only criteria that could be used in setting teachers salaries.hilmar,supra,at,d,quoting california teachers livingston union school dist.d.livingston.
in the legislature added subdivision d to government code section stats,ch,thereby loosening the interpretation given education code section and allowing the parties to reach agreement for additional compensation on criteria that are separate from years of training and years of experience.hilmar,supra,th at,d,quoting livingston,supra,d at.
however,due to a series of court decisions imposing a restrictive interpretation of the amendment,the legislature amended the law again in.senate bill amended section by allowing a school district and a teacher union to agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience,subd.a.the legislative counsel digest indicates the exception added to section,together with the addition of government code section,subdivision e,changed then existing law by requiring a public school employer and the exclusive representative,upon the request of either party,to negotiate and mutually agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.stats,ch.hilmar,supra,th at,d,boldface added,fn.omitted.
thus,at the time the collective bargaining agreement here was negotiated,section read,in pertinent part,effective july,each person employed by a school district in a position requiring certification qualifications,shall be classified on the salary schedule on the basis of uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience,except if a public school employer and the exclusive representative negotiate and mutually agree to a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience pursuant to chapter commencing with section of the government code,subd.a,italics added.
government code section,subdivision e,enacted in,grants the following exception to the uniformity rule pursuant to section of the education code,the public school employer and the exclusive representative shall,upon the request of either party,meet and negotiate a salary schedule based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.if the public school employer and the exclusive representative do not reach mutual agreement,then the provisions of section of the education code requiring a salary schedule based upon a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience shall apply.a salary schedule established pursuant to this subdivision shall not result in the reduction of the salary of any teacher.italics added.
in hilmar,the appellate court construed the legislation to provide the most flexibility to school districts and teachers unions in the bargaining process while requiring one or more factors to justify disparate pay between teachers of equal training and experience.hilmar,supra,th at,d.in that case,the court held that a payment to teachers does not violate the uniform pay provisions of section or the legislative purposes underlying that section if at least one criterion upon which the payment is based is neither years of training nor years of experience.id.at,d.
ii.the district violated the uniformity requirement 
section mandates that when teacher salary schedules operate on the basis of education and experience,they must be wholly uniform.palos verdes,supra,cal d at.uniform means c onforming to one principle,standard,or rule consistent with or b eing the same as or consonant with another or others.american heritage dict.of the english language ed as of may.a uniform salary schedule means that teachers will be compensated invariably according to their seniority and education.such a rule forbids disparate treatment of groups of teachers with the same level of training and years of experience.thus,in palos verdes,a teacher with one year of public school experience and five years of private school experience was credited,according to rules,with only one year of experience.a year later,the standard was altered to allow full credit for teaching in any accredited school,whether public or private.the teacher requested reclassification according to the new rule.when the school district refused,he filed a petition for writ of mandate.palos verdes,supra,cal d at.the california supreme court upheld the issuance of a writ ordering the reclassification,holding that the district disparate treatment of teachers with private school teaching experience violated the uniformity requirement.id.at.
in san francisco classroom teachers san francisco unified school dist.d,the district imposed a rule which provided unequal credit for teachers with the same training and experience solely on the basis of the order in which their years of experience and education accrued.id.at.thus,a teacher failure to take additional education credits by the time he or she reached a certain level of seniority resulted in a denial of experience credit to which he or she otherwise would have been entitled.id.at.the appellate court held that a system which preclude d teachers from receiving credit for experience solely due to their seniority within the system ibid.was incompatible with the uniformity requirement of section san francisco,at.
while it is undisputed that the renumbering of steps increased the ability of teachers with years of experience or less to get merit pay increases more quickly,the district reassignment of all teachers in steps through to step unfairly penalized those teachers with to years experience,creating nonuniform treatment among teachers with equal levels of training.we illustrate this inequality by comparing tables c,d and e attached to this opinion,post,at.the tables show a hypothetical advancement up the salary scale of three teachers with the same level of training class f under the compressed system as formulated by the district.because we must compare apples with apples and not oranges,increases are not factored into these tables.
table c,post,at depicts the case of teacher x,who has years of experience before the new schedule.after the implementation of the new schedule,her step number still corresponds to her number of years of experience.thus,after years of experience,her pay is bumped up from to.the year after,she reaches step and gets a raise to annually.after her and years,she will achieve salaries of and,respectively.
table d,post,at reflects what happens to teacher y,who has years of experience before the adoption of the compressed schedule.although he has years of experience,he is now funneled into step.the next year,after years of experience,he reaches step and gets bumped up to.he reaches step after years of experience,thereby garnering a merit increase to.finally,after teaching for years,he reaches step and attains the highest salary of.
table e,post,at illustrates the case of teacher z,who has years of experience and who is earning at step,which is converted to step under the new schedule.after years of experience,she advances to step and gets a salary increase to.after completing her year,she reaches the highest step,step,and earns.
under the district version of the compressed system,teacher x will only need years to reach the highest salary level of table c.on the other hand,teacher y must teach for years to attain the same salary level table d,while teacher z must teach for years to get to the highest salary level table e.see tables c,d e,post.
by artificially limiting the more experienced teachers advancement up the salary ladder,the restructured schedule treats them as employees,requiring that they work longer than other teachers with the same training to obtain the same merit increases.as a consequence,multiple groups of teachers with the same training are accumulating experience credit and moving up the salary ladder at different rates.this is not uniform treatment.
without citation to authority,the district contends that its system does not violate the uniformity requirement because all teachers in a given step number having the same level of experience and same level of training receive the same salary.
however,it is illogical and myopic to focus on a single cell of the schedule and declare the entire schedule uniform simply because all members in a given cell receive the same salary and benefits.a system in which one class of teachers must work one,two or three years longer than another group with the same course training to obtain the same merit salary increases fails to grant credit for experience and training uniformly,and thus violates section requirement that teacher salaries be wholly commensurate with years of experience and training.palos verdes,supra,cal d at.
the situation of those teachers receiving the short end of the stick here is comparable to that in united teachers of ukiah board of education d.ukiah,where the ukiah school district had a rule granting teachers a maximum of five years credit for experience outside the district.in order to attract exceptionally gifted teachers from outside the district,the district accepted them into service with full credit for all years of outside experience.id.at.teachers who were already employed and limited by the rule sued,claiming that section entitled them to the same credit.ukiah,at.the court of appeal agreed,holding that the hiring policy violated section,since it resulted in some teachers receiving credit for all prior experience and others being subject to a limitation.ukiah,at.
even more on point is california teachers board of education d.whittier in which the whittier school board imposed a rule limiting a teacher to only one vertical step advancement in any period.when this rule is applied to a teacher who has been at the maximum step of a class for more than one year and who then moves to a higher class,it has the effect of placing that teacher at a step below her or his number of years of experience on the salary schedule.id.at,italics added.the appellate court held that the rule,which precludes teachers from receiving credit for experience solely due to their seniority within the system id.at,violated the uniformity mandate of section whittier,at.
here,the district action pushed some teachers but not others into step levels below their years of experience.thus,while less experienced teachers move up the salary ladder at a rate of one step per year,more experienced teachers were regressed to step levels below their number of years of experience.like the board rule in whittier,this policy had the effect of hindering the salary advancement of one group of teachers based solely on their seniority within the system see whittier,supra,d at.
we conclude that,by reassigning certain teachers to step levels below their years of experience in pursuit of the new,compressed schedule,the district violated the uniformity requirement of section.
iii.no exceptions to the uniformity mandate are present here 
the district claims that even if its system results in a uniformity violation,such a practice is justified by the other criteria exception found in government code section.as noted,subdivision e of section permits the parties to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.see,ante.
citing a variety of legislature materials indicating that the exception should be broadly interpreted to give school districts maximum flexibility in setting teacher compensation,the district asserts that the goal of encouraging teacher recruitment and retention permits a policy of allowing newer teachers to ascend the salary ladder faster than more experienced ones.the argument fails because the district rationale or motivation for adopting a nonuniform schedule is not a criterion upon which such a schedule is based.
a criterion denotes a standard or principle for evaluating or testing something.unabridged vol based on random house unabridged dict.as of may.under the new system,the only touchstones for determining into which step a teacher will be placed are years of experience and training.these two variables are the sole criteria upon which the salary schedule operates.this is not a case where the negotiated agreement provides that some criterion other than experience or training shall result in a different salary for those teachers who satisfy it.for example,the parties could have bargained for a schedule in which teachers assigned to children or who teach in economically depressed areas would be entitled to preferential salary treatment.that is not what occurred here.the district system is governed solely by length of experience and level of training.
a nonuniform salary structure is not permissible merely because one or both parties may be motivated by some external reason to make it so.the district accuses the sta and the trial court of imposing a strict rather than an expansive interpretation of the other criteria exception set forth in government code section.however,the statute only becomes relevant if the district scheme operated on criteria that did not consist of years of experience and training.where the parties do not bargain for other criteria,the law expressly provides that the uniformity mandate of section applies,subd.a,subd.e.accordingly,none of the legislative source materials,which the district claims support an expansive interpretation of government code section,are of any assistance to our inquiry 
because the salary structure imposed on the district after execution of the collective bargaining agreement did not operate on any criteria other than experience and training,the trial court properly held that the exceptions set forth in government code section did not apply.
iv.the trial court remedy was free from error 
the district contends that even if there was a uniformity violation and no exception applied,the trial court remedy exceeded its powers.
we find the judgment to be a bit murky.the peremptory writ commands the district to r estore all salary schedule experience credit lost by petitioners in the restoration of the s tep s chedule by restoration of the one to three year reduction suffered by such teachers in the implementation of that schedule.as we understand it,this means that the district must transfer all teachers with to years of experience out of step and into the step corresponding with their years of experience.hence,teachers with years of experience must be assigned to step,veterans must be assigned to step,and so on until the highest step,step,is reached.
the district protests that this gives petitioners salary increases of more than.it claims that the trial court effectively granted the teachers unbargained for relief that exceeded its mandate jurisdiction,violated the separation of powers and constituted an unwarranted interference with the right of contract.the district maintains that if its compressed schedule was unlawful,the proper remedy was to nullify the compressed schedule par.from the remainder of the collective bargaining agreement,thereby reinstating the old schedule.this argument overlooks the fact that paragraph is itself severable and that the trial court writ merely severed the illegal segment from the rest of the agreement.
paragraph of the ratified agreement between the sta and the district calls for elimination of steps,and effective july,and renumbering of steps see attachment b.italics added.attachment b contains a grid schedule which shows the reassignment of all teachers in steps through into step.
we perceive no illegality in the portion of paragraph that eliminates steps through and renumbers the steps.moreover,such a shortened schedule achieves the very goals that the district extols it allows teachers to earn salary raises more quickly,reduces salary stagnation and promotes comp
