this appeal concerns the willed body program wbp at ucla.plaintiffs are relatives of decedents.the complaint alleges that ucla mishandled the decedents remains after scientific uses were concluded.in a prior appeal,we determined that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged causes of action for negligence,fraud,and breach of contract.bennett regents of the university of california,nonpub.opn.
plaintiffs are now appealing the trial court denial of class certification,an order that we affirm here.plaintiffs common claims for their proposed class action are quite limited,and far narrower than those alleged in their complaints.given the narrowing of the issues and the evidence presented,it is necessary to refine the scope of plaintiffs viable claims.specifically,we conclude that the factual basis for plaintiffs class,simultaneous incineration of human not an actionable wrong in the context of a university willed body program.moreover,despite nine years of litigation,plaintiffs failed to present any admissible evidence of their common core fact that the decedents remains were improperly disposed of at a landfill.
plaintiffs claims 
as described in our prior opinion,plaintiffs are close family members of decedents who agreed to donate their bodies for teaching purposes and scientific research to the wbp at ucla.prospective donors were directed to disclose their bequest to their relatives.ucla written instructions advised the donors that their remains would be cremated and buried without record or scattered in a rose garden at a memorial park.
plaintiffs believe that ucla did not handle their relatives remains in a dignified manner after medical study and research was concluded.plaintiffs enumerated a number of offensive acts committed by the university while disposing of the bodies.these alleged acts included stuffing bodies full of medical waste such as needles,scalpels,gloves,etc incinerating bodies en masse or failing to fully incinerate the bodies mixing human remains with animal carcasses and dumping them all at a landfill like common refuse and using mass graves for commingled ashes.
plaintiffs moved for class certification based upon their sixth amended complaint.they seek recovery on various causes of action negligence breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and fraud.they have limited their claims to the close family members of donors whose remains were cremated on campus,then allegedly sent to an landfill.the proposed class members had to be aware of the donor death and the arrangements the donor made with the wbp.the relevant timeframe is to.plaintiffs seek certification for liability purposes only they concede that each member must independently prove his or her emotional distress damages.
plaintiffs identified the core fact pattern for establishing liability for ucla alleged wrongdoing.the core facts are that they are close family members of wbp donors when the donor died,plaintiffs notified the wbp of the death and surrendered the donor remains unembalmed,unautopsied and intact after medical research was conducted,the donated bodies were wrapped in shrouds and placed into an incinerator several at a time the ashes were scraped into a bin and taken to a landfill and ucla did not reveal during the class period that the cremains were being disposed of at a landfill 
evidence relating to the core class claims 
plaintiffs and defendants both presented deposition testimony from wbp laboratory technician bennie dudley,a wbp employee from to,who was in charge of handling the intake of wbp donor cadavers and their final disposition.dudley stated that to percent of the donated bodies were used for gross anatomy teaching purposes,they were dissected.whatever remained of the dissected bodies was gathered in bundles,wrapped in shrouds and cremated several at a time bodies that were intact not dissected were cremated individually.sometimes,bodies donated to ucla wbp were redonated by the program to other medical schools,including the university of california at irvine.
dudley testified that the cremains were removed from the incinerator and placed in a large metal wheeled container.he did not know where the bins were taken once they were filled.dudley assistants confirmed that multiple bundles of dissected remains were cremated together and that the crematory was not emptied until it was full of ashes.
during his tenure at ucla,dudley did not recall seeing any improperly or partially cremated remains.at times,the ashes left in the crematory might include a small amount of medical waste such as glass vials or the occasional surgical instrument.the waste may have come from the pathology department,which shared the crematory with the wbp.during the relevant class period,the instruction sheet that dudley sent to prospective donors stated that their remains would be cremated and buried without record unless the wbp was notified of any special burial or funeral arrangements the wbp returned the remains of donors to their families when private dispositions were requested.no family members ever complained about the manner in which bodies were handled.
some of the wbp cremains were delivered to a boat for burial at sea.the boat captain discovered nonorganic medical waste including syringes,glass vials and gauze mixed with the cremains when one of the boxes from the wbp burst.this event,and the ensuing furor,was reported in local newspapers and on the television news in november,february,and november.
the lead plaintiff,robert bennett,was not the person who notified the wbp of his mother death.he did not expect his mother cremains to be returned to him after her cadaver was studied by the wbp,though he was under the impression that they would be handled separately from other donors.bennett first learned of the alleged mishandling of the cremains in,when an attorney investigator came to his home and showed him some information.bennett did not recall what ucla promised to do with his mother cremains.
potential class member rita harris did not contact the wbp to retrieve her mother body.harris never considered that her mother body might be dismembered for study,when ucla received it in.harris did not expect the body to be returned rather,she expected the cremains to be scattered in a rose garden.harris does not know the ultimate disposition of her mother remains.at the time of her mother death,wbp donor remains were being handled by the county,which maintained a cemetery plot in a rose garden.harris father informed her of the alleged mishandling,which,as harris recalled,was detailed in a newspaper article within years of her mother death,by.
potential class member albert gladstone did not take any steps to have his mother body delivered to the wbp in and he did not read any of the paperwork involved in the donation.he did,however,contact the wbp to pick up his father body in.gladstone understood that his mother body might be dissected,but he expected the components to be gathered up and cremated together,then scattered at sea.he claims to have learned of the alleged mishandling from his brother in.his brother learned of the mishandling through media reports.gladstone former wife testified that she heard media reports about the wbp in,and discussed them with gladstone.despite knowing of the growing scandal,according to his,gladstone nevertheless delivered his father body to the wbp in.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court found that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the existence of common issues of fact and law with respect to ucla liability to them.the court concluded that there was a lack of commonality sufficient to warrant class certification because of the need to individually prove issues relating to emotional distress damages the statute of limitations,the alleged unilateral contract,and reliance on ucla alleged misrepresentations.
