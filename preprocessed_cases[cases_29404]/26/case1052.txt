the clash between land use regulations and landowners continues.in this case,the city of morgan hill the city denied a application submitted by san jose christian college college.because we conclude that the city determination did not violate college right to the free exercise of religion,or otherwise run afoul of the constitution,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city 
the city approved a conditional use permit authorizing the construction of louise hospital on a site designated and zoned for low density residential development.the city subsequently chang ed the land use designation on the louise property the property from low residential to public facilities.the city ultimately re zoned the property as a planned unit development pud,thereby eliminat ing the need for the use permit and allowing use of the property as a hospital,with fewer restrictions.
the property is the only location within morgan hill actually zoned for hospital use.under the city municipal code,however,a ll uses may be permitted in a pud district,provided such uses are shown on the development plan for a particular pud district as approved by the city council.mhmc.because the development plan for the pud district in which the property was located was directed solely at hospital use,college filed an application with the city seeking an approval of zoning amendment to change the allowable uses on the property from a hospital and supporting medical facilities to an educational facility.a cover letter detailed college intent to use the site and buildings as a private college,and to allow the addition of new facilities to serve the college.the cover letter further informed the city of anticipated new uses such as outdoor sports fields,a gymnasium,a,and student resident hall s.college later submitted a statement of operations,reiterating its hopes and expectations for future growth at this new facility with the ultimate goal to have around students attending the college,but that will be in a perhaps year.college also expressed its concern that its projections of growth during the timeframes indicated not become imbedded in the zoning approval.
upon receipt and review of the initial application for completeness and accuracy of filing,the city informed college that its application was incomplete,and outlined the additional information needed to make the application complete.in a subsequent communication,the city informed college of the need to submit the following information,pursuant to mhmc 
site plan indicate landscape areas,easements and storm water detention areas.please note that the pud ordinance requires a minimum of wide landscape buffer.
illustrative building elevations the illustrative elevations shall indicate the level of architectural detail and quality.
landscaping a conceptual landscape plan needs to indicate the areas of existing landscaping and areas of proposed landscaping.the plan shall also identify the major types of plant material to be used,the species of trees and parking lot trees to be used,species of shrubbery to be used to screen parking lots.
the city letter also requested further information regarding the use of the property,including the number of night classes college planned to provide the number and hours for its proposed evening sporting events as well as any large events,and whether these events would overlap with peak classroom use whether the people anticipated for sunday service in the gym would include the students residing on site,or reflected people coming in from proposed expansions the location and detail of the lighting proposed for the future outdoor sports field and the number of bleachers and how many seats college proposed would or.
some of this information was required by the california environmental quality act ceqa,which is designed to inform governmental decision makers and the public about the potential,significant environmental effects of proposed activities.san joaquin rescue center stanislaus county,th,d.the city has incorporated ceqa into its zoning code.see mhmc et.
in lieu of providing a second application describing more fully the intended uses of the property,and allegedly at the behest of the city manager,college presented a scaled back version of its initial application,encompassing the existing buildings only.the cover letter to the scaled back application indicated that college,at that time,did not have a clear enough picture of its future facility needs to provide the information the city requested.the revised statement of operations reflected only residents,and eliminated mention of the gymnasium,outdoor sports field,field house,and uses.a revised environmental initial study stated college intent to enroll a maximum of students,rather than the initially mentioned.
meanwhile,college circulated two editions of its broadcaster publication.the spring broadcaster communicated to its readers college goals to add a facility and additional housing.the spring broadcaster also indicated that there was adequate space for playing fields and future expansion.the winter broadcaster reiterated that the property would allow the college to grow to at least quadruple from its current size of about students.the planning commission took notice of these communications,and their apparent conflict with college representations.
sometime prior to the time college submitted its scaled back application,the city endorsed the concept of a community health care foundation,or some other mechanism,to provide an institutional focus on meeting the policy objectives for medical services.the city formed a blue ribbon task force on community health care,the purpose of which was to explore the medical care needs of the community of morgan hill,review proposals made to the city and discover how to meet the need.after considering testimony of community residents and several proposals regarding the establishment of a medical care facility in the city,the task force verified the urgent need for a hospital in the community and recommended that the property remain zoned for hospital use.
the city staff disagreed with the task force recommendation,observing that there are no specific policies that say that the property in question must be used exclusively for a hospital,and that the public facilities designation which is presently on the site would allow public,private educational facilities,and therefore,the use is consistent in that respect.despite these positive comments,the planning commission recommended denial of college application.
the city denied college application due to college failure to comply with the city application requirements.
college subsequently filed a complaint and requested injunctive relief on the basis that the city zoning process violated the first amendment and the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,et.after the district court denied college request for a preliminary injunction,the city filed a motion for summary judgment.
the district court granted the city motion,and college timely filed a notice of appeal to this court.on appeal,college contends that the district court grant of summary judgment was improper because the district court applied the wrong legal standard in determining the validity of college free exercise claim college successfully demonstrated the existence of a hybrid claim the district court applied old and inapplicable free exercise law to the rluipa analysis the application of ceqa regulations to college application substantially burdened its religious exercise and the city finding that college failed to comply with ceqa regulations was not supported by substantial evidence.

iii.discussion 
a.the city denial of college application did not deprive college of its first amendment right to the free exercise of religion.
the free exercise clause of the first amendment,which has been made applicable to the states by incorporation into the fourteenth amendment,provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,or prohibiting the free exercise thereof employment,oregon dep t of human resources smith,d citing const.amend.internal citation omitted emphasis in smith.
smith held that a neutral law of general application could prohibit conduct that was prescribed by an individual religion such a law did not have to be supported by a compelling governmental interest even though it had the incidental effect of burdening religion.see id.at.smith also rejected a requirement of a compelling interest when the burden on religion is substantial.id.at.
a few years after smith,the united states supreme court decided church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.in lukumi,the city of hialeah enacted an ordinance prohibiting the public sacrifice of animals.see id.at.the prohibition prevented participation in an integral part of the sect worship rituals.see id.at.prior to finding a free exercise violation,the supreme court first summarized the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.id.at.citation omitted.it is only if a law is not neutral or not of general applicability that we examine the compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored prongs of the inquiry.id.at.accordingly,a free exercise violation hinges on showing that the challenged law is either not neutral or not generally applicable.american family ass n,city and county of san francisco,cir,cert.denied,d citation omitted 
in city of boerne flores,d,the supreme court intimated that the neutrality and generally applicable inquiries are appropriate in cases involving zoning regulations.see id.at.w here a general prohibition is at issue,the sounder approach,and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents,is to hold the compelling interest test inapplicable to free exercise challenges.internal quotation marks and citations omitted final alteration in the original.
in miller reed,cir,we held that the rational basis test applies in ascertaining whether a neutral law of general applicability violate s the right to free exercise of religion even though the law incidentally burdens a particular religious belief or practice.citations omitted.see also guam guerrero,cir the supreme court has held that neutral,generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices,even when not supported by a compelling government interest.citation omitted.however,the first amendment still bars application of a neutral,generally applicable law to religiously motivated action if the law implicates not only the free exercise clause alone,but the free exercise clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,such as freedom of speech and of the press.smith,at.citations omitted.in such hybrid cases,the law or action must survive strict scrutiny.miller,at.
three principles of first amendment law may be distilled from the abovementioned authorities.if the zoning law is of general application and is not targeted at religion,it is subject only to rational basis scrutiny,even though it may have an incidental effect of burdening religion.if such a law burdens the free exercise of religion and some other activity,there is a first amendment violation unless the strict scrutiny test is satisfied,the law is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest.this type of first amendment claim is sometimes described as a hybrid rights claim.id.similarly,if the zoning law is not neutral or generally applicable,but is directed toward and burdens the free exercise of religion,it must meet the strict scrutiny test.see lukumi,at.finally,if the zoning law only incidentally burdens the free exercise of religion,with the law being both neutral and generally applicable,it passes constitutional muster unless the law is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.see miller,at.
the ordinance incidental burden on college free exercise right is lawful due to its neutrality and general applicability.
a law is one of neutrality and general applicability if it does not aim to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,and if it does not in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.lukumi,at.the ordinance and its application by the city fall within these parameters.the record reflects that the city zoning ordinance applies throughout the entire city,and there is not even a hint that college was targeted on the basis of religion for varying treatment in the city application of the ordinance.we are left,then,with the unavoidable conclusion that the incidental burden upon college free exercise of religion is not violative of the first amendment.
college has not asserted a viable hybrid rights claim.
we have previously observed that to assert a claim,a free exercise plaintiff must make out a colorable claim that a companion right has been is,a fair probability or a likelihood,but not a certitude,of success on the merits.miller,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.college contends that in addition to burdening its free exercise of religion,the city application of its zoning laws violated college rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
college has not asserted a colorable claim that the city application of its zoning laws abridged college freedom of speech.
citing city of renton playtime theatres,d for the proposition that l and use laws are subject to first amendment scrutiny,college argues that the city refusal to rezone the property for educational use violates its rights to free speech.specifically,college contends that the facilities comprising the property constitute symbolic speech,that the building itself is speech.college additionally asserts that its desire to use the facilities to educate persons concerning religion,to transmit ideas is undeniably speech protected by the first amendment.we note that free speech,arguably,is not even implicated by the pud ordinance.the city ordinance is materially dissimilar from that at issue in renton,where the ordinance did not allow a particular type of certain locales.see renton,at.in contrast,the city pud ordinance does not at all prohibit the establishment of educational institutions.indeed,under mhmc,a ll uses may be permitted in a pud district.emphasis added.moreover,as the city has previously noted,the corresponding zoning for the underlying public facilities land use designation would permit public or private educational facilities.see mhmc b.thus,it can not be said that the pud ordinance prohibits religious speech.
the record reflects no indication that the city action was motivated by the city disdain of college religious orientation,or by the message to be communicated to the at the property.thus,no viable impingement of speech claim has been asserted.
more importantly,in renton the supreme court ruled that zoning ordinances that do not ban speech,but merely designate where such speech may occur,should be properly analyzed as a form of time,place,and manner regulation.at.citations omitted.if the regulation is,it will be upheld against a first amendment challenge so long as it furthers a substantial governmental interest and does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.johnson city of pleasanton,cir,citing renton,at.
a zoning restriction on speech is only if the ordinance is shown to be a pretext for suppressing expression.renton,at.citation omitte
