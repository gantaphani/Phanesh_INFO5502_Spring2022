in this case of first impression,we decide whether redevelopment construction is exempt from the imposition of fees under education code section,subdivision a c i.the statutory provision does not expressly address redevelopment construction.however,the legislative history and the statutory exemptions given other types of construction under education code sections,subdivision a a,and convince us the legislature did not mean to provide for an exemption for redevelopment construction.
nonetheless,government code section,subdivision a and requires that a school district governing board,in imposing fees on redevelopment construction,must establish a reasonable relationship between the fee use and the need for the public facility,on the one hand,and on the other hand,the type of development project,the demolition and replacement of housing units.in the case before us,the school district governing board exercised its authority under education code section to impose fees on a redevelopment project,but failed to comply with the requirements of government code section in so doing.we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand.
as part of a redevelopment project,warmington old town associates,a california limited partnership warmington,demolished apartment units in the city of tustin and replaced them with single family homes the redevelopment project.the tustin unified school district the school district then imposed in fees on the redevelopment project,viewing the total square footage of the single family homes as new residential construction within the meaning of education code section,subdivision a b.
warmington paid the entire sum under protest.it then filed a petition for a writ of mandate and declaratory relief requesting that the school district be directed to refund the fees paid.warmington complained it should have received a credit with respect to the units that were replaced and also argued there was an insufficient nexus between the impact of the new residential units in terms of student generation and the facility fees imposed.
in response,the school district filed a demurrer,asserting there was no legal authority to support warmington argument it was entitled to a credit for demolished units.it maintained the newly constructed single family homes could only be construed as new residential construction within the meaning of education code section,subdivision a b,and it was entitled to levy the fees under that provision.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
thereafter,warmington filed an amended petition for a writ of mandate and declaratory relief.among other things,it stated the total number of dwelling units had been reduced by and there would be a corresponding decrease in the number of students attending school within the school district.warmington argued education code section did not permit the imposition of fees in this context.it also asserted the fees were imposed in violation of government code section,subdivision a and.
in its opposition to the first amended petition,the school district reiterated its arguments on the correct interpretation of education code section and also argued that a july developer fee justification and impact analysis fee study,undertaken before the fees were imposed,demonstrated the nexus warmington claimed was lacking.
the court granted the petition in part.in its minute order dated december,the court construed education code section,subdivision a as distinguishing between new construction and additions of more than square feet to existing residences.it found new construction of square feet and approved school fees to the extent of the additional square footage only.
in its formal order dated january,the court found the total square footage of the apartment units had been and the total square footage of the new single family homes was.it held the school district was only authorized to impose school fees on the redevelopment project on the resulting increase in assessable space in excess of square feet.because the increase in square footage was square feet,school fees could be imposed on only square feet square feet minus square feet.school fees were chargeable at the rate of per square foot.the court concluded the school district,having imposed school fees with respect to square feet instead of square feet,had overcharged warmington by.the court ordered a refund in that amount,plus interest at the rate of percent per annum.
discussiona.preliminary considerations 
the school district challenges the formal order filed on january.the notice of appeal was filed on june.this court questioned whether the order is an appealable order and whether the notice of appeal was timely filed,and requested supplemental briefing to address these issues.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides an appeal may be taken from an order entered after judgment.in this case,however,no judgment has been entered.nonetheless,in their supplemental briefing,the parties agree the january,order is appealable.see griset fair political practices com.cal th,d,order denying petition for writ of administrative mandate deemed an appealable judgment haight city of san diego d,fn.appeal proper even though no formal judgment entered on order denying petition for writ of mandate.
it is the substance and effect of the adjudication,not its form,which determines whether it is final and appealable.griset fair political practices,supra,cal th at,d.as a general test,which must be adapted to the particular circumstances of the individual case,it may be said that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree,that decree is final,but where anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties,the decree is interlocutory.citations.id.at,d.in this case,the parties agree no further judicial action is required to determine the rights of the parties.thus,the appeal is properly taken.
we turn next to the issue of the timeliness of the appeal.the formal order was filed january.the trial court records are unclear as to when and upon whom notice of that order was served.a minute order dated july,states notation in the court order log proposed order on motion for writ of mandate received date signed date returned mailed however original is not in file and input in court computer of said document on the register of action has not occurred.
the concern is with the indication the court may have served a copy of the signed order on january,when the notice of appeal was not filed until five months later.california rules of court,rule a,as in effect in the year,provided a notice of appeal had to be filed on or before the earliest of the following dates days after the date of mailing by the clerk of the court of a document entitled notice of entry of judgment days after the date of service of a document entitled notice of entry of judgment by any party upon the party filing the notice of appeal,or by the party filing the notice of appeal or days after the date of entry of the judgment.it further provided that a copy of the judgment could be used in place of the document entitled notice of entry.under the rule then in effect,the term judgment was defined to include an appealable order.former cal.rules of court,rule d,repealed eff.so,if the clerk had mailed the school district a copy of the order on january,the appeal would be untimely filed.indeed,warmington takes the position the july,minute order proves such mailing and the appeal is therefore untimely.
however,the minute order shows the order log and the register of action are in conflict as to whether the clerk effectuated service.the order log indicates the formal order was signed and mailed on january,but the register of action reflects that no such action was taken.at best,we have an indication that a copy of the order was served,but there is no indication of whether all parties were served,or only the prevailing party.
the school district has provided the declaration of attorney tiffany israel to the effect she has scoured the files of both the superior court and her own office,which represents the school district,and found no proof of service or other evidence of service of the january,order on the school district prior to april.that was the date on which warmington served the school district with a copy of the order.inasmuch as the only indicia of service on the school district in advance of april,is a trial court log directly contradicted by the register of action,the school district has filed a declaration to the effect there is no evidence to show service on it by the clerk,and warmington having provided no evidence at all,we resolve the doubt in favor of the school district.the appeal will be deemed timely filed under california rules of court,rule a.
this is consistent with the policy,based upon the remedial character of the right of appeal,of according that right in doubtful cases when such can be accomplished without doing violence to applicable rules.citations.montgomery ward imperial casualty indemnity th,d holding appeal timely when it appeared more likely than not the clerk had mailed a copy of the judgment to all parties,but the record contained no definitive evidence that this had been done.
issues framed and standard of review 
on appeal,the school district makes two primary arguments the trial court erred in its interpretation of education code section as a matter of law and the fee study showed that the fees imposed were reasonably related to the school district need for educational facilities and provided the required nexus between the fees and the school district needs.
the first issue,concerning the interpretation of education code section,is a question of statutory construction.as to that,we conduct a de novo review,dry creek joint elementary school dist.th,d.the second issue,having to do with whether the school district adhered to the requirements of government code section,subdivision a and in the imposition of fees,involves the action of the school district.id.at,d garrick development hayward unified school dist.th,d.in review of this matter,w e determine only whether the action taken was arbitrary,capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or whether it failed to conform to procedures required by law.garrick development hayward unified school,supra,th at,d.the inquiry into arbitrariness or capriciousness is like substantial evidence review in that both require a reasonable basis for the decision.citation.ibid.
education code section 
education code section,subdivision a permits the governing board of any school district to levy a fee against any construction within the boundaries of the district,for the purpose of funding the construction or reconstruction of school facilities,subject to any limitations set forth in chapter commencing with section of division of title of the government code government code section,subdivision b limits the amount of the fee that may be imposed under education code section to per square foot of assessable space with respect to residential construction.government code section,subdivision d defines the term construction to mean new construction and reconstruction of existing building the question before us is whether the fee may be properly applied to the type of construction at construction.
education code section,subdivision a provides the fee may be applied only a to new commercial and industrial construction.the chargeable covered and enclosed space of commercial or industrial construction shall not be deemed to include the square footage of any structure existing on the site of that construction as of the date the first building permit is issued for any portion of that construction.b to new residential construction.c i t o other residential construction,only if the resulting increase in assessable space exceeds square feet.the calculation of the resulting increase in assessable space for this purpose shall reflect any decrease in assessable space in the same residential structure that also results from that construction.where authorized under this paragraph,the fee is applicable to the total resulting increase in assessable space 
the parties dispute whether redevelopment is properly classified as new residential construction to which fees may be applied under education code section,subdivision a b or other residential construction to which fees may be applied under education code section,subdivision a c i only if the resulting increase in assessable space exceeds square feet.
in construing this statute,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.citation.loyola marymount university los angeles unified school dist.th,d.
wording of the statute new versus other residential construction 
in our first step,examining the words of education code section,subdivision a in the context before us,we find only ambiguity.the provision does not mention a word about redevelopment construction.rather,subparagraph b thereof applies to new residential construction,whereas subparagraph c thereof applies to other residential construction.other residential construction is not defined.
but as warmington points out,all construction,whether from the ground up or in the form of or reconstruction,is by definition new.the bricks and mortar and other building materials used for the reconstruction project are generally new,whether the building is being built where there was never one before,or whether it is being built in place of,or as reconstruction of or remodel of,an existing building.thus,the legislature,in using the word new in education code section,subdivision a b,may have meant to modify the term residential,not the term construction.so,instead of meaning new construction,in the sense of having been constructed with new materials,the legislature may have meant new residential construction,in the sense of no residential units having existed there previously.for example,houses built on vacant lots,or built in place of commercial or industrial buildings,would be new residential construction,there having been no residential buildings in that location previously.to interpret it differently,warmington says,would render the phrase other residential construction as used in education code section,subdivision a c i meaningless,since all construction is necessarily new.
legislative history 
a purpose of the statute 
warmington also argues its interpretation would further the intention of the legislature.former government code section,the predecessor to education code section,was enacted in,as part of assembly bill.assem.bill reg.sess.grupe development superior court cal th,d.dispelling any doubt as to its intent,the legislature declared in the subject bill that in many parts of california real property development was causing serious overcrowding in schools that traditional public financing was inadequate to relieve,and for these reasons,a comprehensive school facilities finance program based upon a partnership of state and local governments and the private sector is required to ensure the availability of school facilities to serve the population growth generated by new development.stats,ch,subd.d.grupe development superior court,supra,cal th at,d.thus,warmington concludes,the legislature was concerned with the extent to which the development generates new student population growth.
as warmington sees it,the legislature directly addressed this concern in education code section,subdivision a c i.that provision permits the imposition of fees on other residential construction,only if the resulting increase in assessable space exceeds square feet.the legislature clearly intended to give credit for existing structures.otherwise,it would not have spoken of increases in assessable space.but did it intend to give credit in the context before us did it intend to give credit any time existing residential housing was either expanded or replaced with new housing 
b exemption for remodeling projects 
to answer this question,the school district offers an extensive legislative history on education code section.as the school district contends,the legislative history tends to show the subdivision a c i reference to other residential construction was intended to refer to residential remodeling projects,not to total demolition and replacement.
the version of former government code section contained in assembly bill provided for the imposition of a fee against any development project for new construction within the boundaries of the school district assem.bill reg.sess.it made no qualification as to whether the construction was commercial,industrial,residential,new,or other,tending to indicate the fee could be imposed on any type of new construction at all.but senate bill,which became effective the same date as assembly bill,amended former government code section to provide that the fee could be applied only to new commercial and industrial construction,and,as to residential development,to new construction,and other construction to the extent of the resulting increase in habitable area.bill reg.sess.
at least two documents in the legislative history show the senate bill language regarding increased habitable area was intended to refer to remodeling projects.page of the senate rules committee,office of senate floor analyses,unfinished business analysis of senate bill reg.sess,as amended august,clarified that the residential fee only applie d when the construction produce d new habitable space,not kitchen remodel if no new space was added.in addition,the legislative bill file of the senate committee on education contains an analysis explaining that senate bill would modify the assembly bill terminology so that the r esidential construction against which developer fees could be levied would be new or remodeling which results in increasing habitable area.in other words,the intention was to permit the application of a fee either to new residential construction or to residential remodeling resulting in increased space.
assembly bill and senate bill were not the final word on former government code section,however.that statute was further amended in pertinent respects in,pursuant to assembly bill.assem.bill reg.sess.upon amendment,former government code section,subdivision a c came to read substantially the way education code section,subdivision a c i does presently.it permitted fees to be imposed on other residential construction,only if the resulting increase in assessable space,exceeds square feet assem.bill reg.sess.
the significance of this language was elucidated in the september,enrolled bill report prepared by the department of finance on assembly bill reg.sess.as amended september.page of the report stated the relevant provision of assembly bill would authorize school districts to impose developer fees on residential structure remodels,only if the resulting increase in assessable space exceeds square feet.page of the report explained in greater detail this provision would authorize a school district to impose a developer fee on residential construction,other than new construction remodels of existing residential homes,only if the resulting increase in assessable space,as defined,exceeds square feet.dof has no concerns with this provision because it authorizes a reasonable increased square footage allowance for remodels,and would discourage homeowners from not applying for a building permit to avoid paying a developer fee.this would tend to show the assembly bill amendment was intended to encourage individual homeowners interested in remodeling their homes to seek building permits without fear of being subjected to the fees imposed on developers.
further support for this interpretation is found in the legislative summary by the assembly committee on education pertaining to assembly bill reg.sess.page of that summary described assembly bill as limiting or exempting fees on residential additions italics added.we give this summary,prepared shortly after the bill was signed by the governor,due deference,yet recognize that it is only a post hoc expression of the opinion of the assembly committee on education as to what the legislature meant when it adopted former government code section.grupe development superior court,supra,cal th at,d,opinion issued after adoption of statute obviously not considered by legislature before passing bill.nonetheless,we find the summary to be persuasive,inasmuch as it is consistent with the department of finance september,enrolled bill report.
moreover,to interpret the legislative history as showing that current education code section,subdivision a c i was directed at remodeling projects is consistent with a critical reading of the language of that provision itself.subdivision a c i provides that t he calculation of the resulting increase in assessable space shall reflect any decrease in assessable space in the same residential structure that also results from that construction.the words same residential structure conjure up an image of a remodeling project,not a picture of a complete demolition of an apartment complex and replacement with a single family housing tract with new residential structures distinct from the ones they replace.
c exemption for redevelopment projects 
the school district also contends that the legislative history shows the legislature considered and rejected language that would have provided a statutory exemption for redevelopment the type of exemption warmington asks us to read into the statute now.as the school district observes,senate bill,as introduced on december,would have amended government code section,subdivision b,which established the dollar amount of fees to be levied per square foot of habitable area of residential development.the bill as introduced provided that the term residential development would exclude any publicly financed housing project that replaces existing housing units.bill reg.sess.however,this language was deleted from senate bill before it was sent to the governor.amend.to bill reg.sess.and may.
but the deletion of this language is not necessarily as telling as the school district would have us believe.in addition to amending government code section,senate bill would have amended former government code section to provide that a fee could be applied only to new commercial and industrial construction,and,as to residential development,to any construction or reconstruction to the extent of the resulting increase in habitable area.amend.to bill reg.sess.and may.that language could also be construed as providing the exemption warmington seeks,without limiting the exemption to publicly financed projects,but making it applicable to any construction or reconstruction,whether publicly or privately financed,to the extent it did not result in an increase in habitable area.ultimately,senate bill was vetoed by the governor,for reasons that may have had nothing whatsoever to do with this issue.bill,vetoed by governor,final hist.reg.sess.
as for the ultimate significance of the senate bill amendment the school district cites,very limited guidance can be drawn from a proposed amendment that is not enacted.grupe development superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
harmonization with other statutory provisions education code sections,subdivision a a,and 
we have other avenues of guidance,however.in construing education code section,we must keep in mind each of its provisions as well as other statutes relating to the same subject.we must harmonize all of them to the extent possible.loyola marymount university los angeles unified school,supra,th at,d.here,we need to consider both education code section,subdivision a a and education code section.
in education code section,subdivision a a,the legislature specifically provided that,the chargeable covered and enclosed space of commercial or industrial construction shall not be deemed to include the square footage of any structure existing on the site of that construction as of the date the first building permit is issued for any portion of that construction.thus,the legislature expressly provided a credit against existing square footage for commercial and industrial construction however,it did not do the same for residential construction,unless education code section,subdivision a c i,pertaining to increases in assessable space exceeding square feet,was intended to achieve the same result.if that was the legislature intention,it was inartfully stated.
however,it does not appear that was the intention.education code section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part a fee authorized under section,may not be applied to the reconstruction of any residential,commercial,or industrial structure that is damaged or destroyed as a result of a disaster,except to the extent the square footage of the reconstructed structure exceeds the square footage of the structure that was damaged or destroyed added by stats,ch,derived from former,added by stats,ch.education code section,subdivision b defines reconstruction as the construction of property that replaces,and is equivalent in kind to,the damaged or destroyed property.
it appears the legislature did not think it obvious that the destruction of existing residential units and replacement with newly constructed residential units was exempt under education code section,subdivision a c i,so it was necessary to create an exemption applicable when the destruction was caused by disaster.the legislature made no corresponding exemption when the residential units were destroyed in connection with redevelopment see grupe development superior court,supra,cal th at,d,the statutory exclusion of one class shows the intention to include all other classes,despite public policy favoring redevelopment see health.
we agree with warmington that to interpret education code section to include an exemption for redevelopment projects would be in keeping with the underlying purpose of the statutory scheme,to address the impact on the affected school district of the increase in student population generated by the development.grupe development superior court,supra,cal th at,d,dry creek joint elementary school,supra,th at,d.yet at the same time,when harmonizing section,subdivision a a and c i and education code section,we find it a strain to adopt warmington interpretation.if we were to construe section,subdivision a c i as providing an exemption for new residential structures that replace demolished ones,as opposed to providing an exemption for remodeling projects only,this would render section superfluous.we must avoid an interpretation that would make some of the words surplusage.victoria groves five chaffey joint union high sch.dist.d.we are constrained to conclude that the complete demolition of residential apartments and replacement with newly constructed houses was not intended to fall within the gambit of other residential construction entitled to an offset under section,subdivision a c i.
warmington would have us alter the statute so as to provide an exemption for redevelopment projects.yet c ourts may not rewrite statutes to supply omitted terms or to conform to an assumed,unexpressed legislative intent.citation.it is,of course,up to the legislature,and not the courts,to rewrite statutes.citation,dry creek joint elementary school,supra,th at,d.
this does not end our inquiry,however.
mitigation fee act 
government code section et.
we turn next to the mitigation fee act,et.the act sets forth procedures for protesting the imposition of fees and other monetary exactions imposed on a development by a local agency.as its legislative history evinces,the act was passed by the legislature in response to concerns among developers that local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to development projects.citations.ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d.warmington has raised the issue whether the fees in question were unrelated to the impact caused by the redevelopment project.
government code section,subdivision a provides as follows a in any action establishing,increasing,or imposing a fee as a condition of approval of a development project by a local agency,the local agency shall do all of the following identify the purpose of the fee.identify the use to which the fee is to be put determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee use and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed.determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facility and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed.
the question is whether the school district showed the reasonable relationship required under government code section,subdivision a and.to prove that it did,the school district offers the fee study,as it did at the trial level 
the fee study 
as the school district says,the fee study encompasses an analysis of historical and current enrollment and the enrollment capacity of the school district,a projection of the total amount of new housing expected to be built within the school district,a determination of how many students will be generated by the new housing,and estimates of what it would cost to provide the necessary school facilities for those students.the fee study culminates in the following finding t he amount of fees to be paid by new residential development in the district is reasonably related to the needs of the community for school facilities generated by that development,and does not exceed that development share of the cost of the facilities.as far as the school district is concerned,the required nexus has been shown and this is the end of the story.
it is not.while the fee study does indeed address student generation from new housing in general,and the cost to provide school facilities for new students in the school district,the fee study does not specifically address redevelopment.
according to the fee study,the portion thereof devoted to residential development determines the facilities cost impact of an average new home in the district.the fee study also states,in the portion thereof dedicated to the analysis,that i n order to assess the impact of new residential construction on the district,one of the required components of the nexus is to determine the cost of providing adequate facilities to house a new student within the district therefore,these project costs serve as the basis for this analysis.italics added.in the portion of the fee study on student generation factors,the fee study stated,the survey data reveals that the district must be prepared for the eventuality that each new occupied housing unit may,on the average,produce a peak load of students in public school grades.
the fee study on its face evaluates the impact of a new home and the housing of a new student within the school district.the obvious focus of attention is on a newly constructed home that creates an impact on the school district by housing a new student who did not attend school in the school district previously.but the fee study gives no thought to the extent of the impact of a tract of homes that are newly constructed in the place of older residential housing previously existing on the same site.it gives no consideration to whether those newly constructed replacement homes in fact generate additional numbers of students over and above those who occupied the previous homes at the site.it certainly gives no consideration to a context such as this,in which residential units were demolished and replaced with only.it suggests no method for estimating the impact of new construction in the redevelopment context,in which new homes may generate no more students than replaced homes did previously,or may even generate fewer students.
in support of the fee study,the school district filed the declaration of the analyst who had prepared it.her declaration contains no information whatsoever that would permit us to construe the fee study as having given consideration to the impact of redevelopment projects.
reasonable relationship 
under government code section,subdivision a and,the school district is charged with determining how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee use and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed and between the need for the public facility and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed.in this case,the school district made no such determination whatsoever with respect to the type of development project in question,replacement housing in the redevelopment context.it thus failed to meet its obligations under section.
as stated in shapell industries,governing board th,d,facilities fees are justified only to the extent that they are limited to the cost of increased services made necessary by virtue of the development.citations.the board imposing the fee must therefore show that a valid method was used for arriving at the fee in question,one which established a reasonable relationship between the fee charged and the burden posed by the development.citations.
the shapell court then enunciated the following test s uch a showing with respect to the fees must involve the interrelation of three elements.first,since the fee is to be assessed per square foot of development,there must be a projection of the total amount of new housing expected to be built within the district.second,in order to measure the extent of the burden imposed on schools by new development,the district must determine approximately how many students will be generated by the new housing.and finally,the district must estimate what it will cost to provide the necessary school facilities for that approximate number of new students.shapell industries,governing board,supra,th at,d.
the school district contends this is exactly what it did.yet in actuality,the school district,in using the fee study as a basis for imposing fees on redevelopment construction,failed to meet the first and second prongs of the shapell test.it failed to meet the first prong to the extent that the projection of the total amount of new housing failed to take into consideration the demolition of housing units for redevelopment.similarly,it failed to meet the second prong because the fee study did not approximate the number of students to be generated by redevelopment,the difference between the number of students that previously inhabited redevelopment sites and the number of students projected to subsequently inhabit those sites.
the court in shapell,in holding the residential fee study before it was flawed,stated that the court must be able to assure itself that before imposing the fee the district engaged in a reasoned analysis designed to establish the requisite connection between the amount of the fee imposed and the burden created.shapell industries,governing board,supra,th at,d.in the case before this court,as in shapell,no such showing was made.the fee study did not address the burden created by redevelopment construction,as opposed to new residential construction that did not displace existing housing,and thus did not show the requisite connection,or nexus between the amount of the fee imposed and the burden created.see also balch enterprises,new haven unified school dist.d.fee imposed on development thrown out because of insufficient analysis to support it.
questions of fact and law 
the school district asserts that to analyze the fee study now would require this court to make factual findings not made by the trial court.we reject this argument.
in this case,the consideration of a theory the trial court did not adopt does not involve impermissible appellate,as the school district contends.california state electronics zeos internat.th,d.in other words,consideration of whether the school district complied with the requirements of government code section does not involve impermissible just because the trial court did not base its decision on this ground.
the matter before us does not turn upon a question of fact.warmington position was based primarily on legal argument,that the school district had failed to adhere to the reasonable relationship requirements of government code section,in essence,because it treated redevelopment construction that displaced existing housing the same way it treated new residential construction that did not displace existing housing.to answer this charge,we need only review the fee study.
the adoption of the fee study was a act,dry creek joint elementary school,supra,th at,d.a court will uphold the agency action unless the action is arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.a court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.shapell industries,governing board,supra,th at,d.in a mandamus proceeding,the ultimate question,whether the agency action was arbitrary or capricious,is a question of law.citations.id.at,d.here,the fee study does not reflect that the school district adequately considered all relevant factors in imposing the fees on redevelopment construction that displaces existing residential housing.this we decide as a question of law,not a question of fact.
application of government code section to individual projects 
the school district also argues that the fee study did not need to address the impact on the school district created by individual development projects.in other words,it did not need to address the impact created by the redevelopment project in particular.the school district is correct.
the fact that government code section,subdivision a speaks of a relationship between the use and need on one hand and the type of development on the other defeats any argument that some nexus must be found between the fee and a particular project on which it is imposed.the subdivision clearly applies to decisions to impose fees on a class of development projects rather than particular ones.garrick development hayward unified school,supra,th at,d.however,the point of the matter is that the fee study did not undertake an analysis of the relationship between the use and need on the one hand and the class of redevelopment construction on the other hand.it addressed the class of new residential construction,but not the class of redevelopment construction that displaces existing residential housing on the same site.
as an aside,the school district mentions that no school facilities fees were previously paid in connection with the former housing units on the site because the units had been constructed before the legislation authorizing such fees took effect.however,the school district does not explain why this should affect the application of government code section,or suggest that an exception to the rule should be created depending upon when the demolished housing units were built.in fact,to take this into consideration here would require exactly the type of analysis the school district has urged is unnecessary.
trial court proceedings 
in a wholly untenable argument,the school district insists it is too late to address the adequacy of the fee study on appeal,because warmington never challenged the fee study and resolution was not before the trial court inasmuch as warmington never challenged the authority of the district to impose fees.see loyola marymount university los angeles unified school,supra,th at,d burden of establishing impropriety of fee not met when fee studies not challenged.
yet warmington trial court filings are replete with citations to government code section,subdivision a and,and argument to the effect there was no nexus between the fees imposed and the burden caused by the redevelopment project.both parties briefed the nexus issue as well as the significance of shapell industries,governing board,supra,th,d.the issue of government code section compliance was squarely before the court,and was one of warmington two primary arguments below.
the school district defended its actions with the fee study,a copy of which it filed with the trial court,an
