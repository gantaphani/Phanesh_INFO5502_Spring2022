california false claims act cfca,et permits the recovery of civil penalties and treble damages from any person who knowingly presents a false claim for payment to the state or a political subdivision.qui tam plaintiffs william padilla,manuel contreras,and the environmental law foundation plaintiffs sued defendant first student,defendant under the cfca,seeking to recover funds on behalf of the san francisco unified school district district.plaintiffs allege defendant violated the cfca by submitting claims for payment to the district at times when defendant knew it was in breach of various terms of its contract to provide student bus transportation services.in particular,plaintiffs allege defendant failed to maintain its buses as required under the contract.
in san francisco unified school dist.ex rel.contreras laidlaw transit,th contreras i,this court reversed the trial court orders sustaining defendant demurrer and dismissing the action.we concluded that,under the cfca,a vendor impliedly certifies compliance with express contractual requirements when it bills a public agency for providing goods or services.plaintiffs allegation that defendant implied certifications were false with respect to its maintenance obligations was sufficient to survive a demurrer.subsequently,the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment.the court concluded no reasonable trier of fact could find that the false implied certifications were material that it had a natural tendency to influence the district decision to pay defendant invoices or defendant acted with knowledge of or reckless disregard as to the falsity of its implied certifications.this appeal followed and we now reverse,concluding the evidence in the record raises triable issues of material fact on both elements of plaintiffs claim.
procedural background 
defendant is a provider of student bus transportation services.plaintiffs padilla and contreras are former employees of defendant.plaintiff environmental law foundation is a california nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of human health and the environment.in may,plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendant alleging violations of the cfca.as required by the cfca,the complaint was filed under seal to allow the district to investigate and decide whether to intervene in the action.see,subd.c.the district declined to intervene.
in july,plaintiffs filed their second amended and operative complaint complaint,seeking damages and civil penalties on behalf of the district for false claims,records,and statements presented by defendant in violation of the cfca.plaintiffs also sought for themselves an award,as well as payment of their attorney fees,expenses,and costs of suit.
plaintiffs alleged defendant transported district schoolchildren on buses that were unsafe,unhealthy,did not meet all federal,state and local safety standards,and were not properly maintained and repaired as needed.the complaint first cause of action alleged defendant violated section,subdivision a,by knowingly presenting false claims to the district for payment or approval.it asserted,w hen defendant submitted monthly invoices for payment,it impliedly certified that it had met each and every material term of the c ontract.the second cause of action alleged defendant violated the cfca by knowingly falsifying records statements the third cause of action alleged defendant used false records or statements to avoid a payment obligation to the district.defendant demurred to the complaint.the trial court sustained the demurrer as to the first two causes of action and overruled the demurrer on the third cause of action.plaintiffs dismissed the third cause of action and the court dismissed the remainder of the complaint.
plaintiffs appealed and,in contreras i,supra,th,this court reversed.as to the first cause of action,we concluded that,under the cfca,a vendor impliedly certifies compliance with its express contractual requirements when it bills a public agency for providing goods or services.contreras i,at.plaintiffs did not challenge the dismissal of their second cause of action.id.at,fn.
in march,defendant moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs first cause of action.plaintiffs opposed the motion.the trial court ruled in favor of defendant,concluding no reasonable trier of fact could find that defendant alleged false implied certifications were material or that defendant acted with the scienter required by the cfca.in september,the court entered judgment in favor of defendant.
this appeal followed.the california attorney general submitted an amicus curiae brief challenging the trial court analysis of the materiality issue.
factual background 
defendant contract with the district 
for over years,defendant has provided bus transportation for district students.a contract effective in and extended in contract imposed a number of requirements on defendant.those requirements included provisions that defendant provide school buses meeting state and federal standards relating to pupil transportation maintain its buses in excellent mechanical condition and appearance and replace all vehicles which are deemed to be unfit for providing the required service provide buses meeting or exceeding state and federal safety standards and employ a fleet maintenance supervisor to establish and maintain a complete and effective preventative maintenance program with complete and accurate records on each vehicle.the contract states that the district seeks buses with the highest standards of performance and safety for the educational and personal of the students.
the district agreed to pay defendant on a monthly basis for services satisfactorily performed by defendant after receipt of properly documented invoices.the contract authorized the district to terminate the contract without cause on days written notice,and to terminate or suspend the contract immediately for reasons including f ailure or refusal of defendant to perform or do any act herein required.
plaintiffs evidence of violations of the maintenance requirements 
in opposing defendant motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs presented evidence that defendant committed numerous violations of the maintenance requirements,including among other things disregarding a day inspection requirement operating buses with defective brake linings and placing buses into service with dangerously low tire tread 
day inspection requirement 
california law requires a preventative maintenance inspection pmi of a school bus every calendar days or miles whichever occurs first,or more often if necessary to ensure safe operation of the bus.of,tit,subd.b.the requirement is incorporated into defendant maintenance policies.nevertheless,defendant frequently kept buses in service beyond the day inspection time limit.alex ageev,a lead mechanic for defendant,was responsible for ensuring compliance with the pmi requirement.he testified at his deposition that defendant would intentionally operate buses that exceeded the day inspection interval when defendant got behind on maintenance.this occurred at least once a year for every bus as far back as 
brake linings 
plaintiffs,quoting from the motor vehicle safety compliance handbook published by the california highway patrol chp,points out the chp warns that a truck or bus operated daily on the steep hills of san francisco obviously will require much more frequent attention to both the service brakes and the parking brake than the same vehicle would need if operated exclusively in any of the level ground communities in california central valleys.see department of the california highway patrol,motor vehicle safety compliance handbook ed,chp handbook.a number of defendant buses are type d buses that are required by california and federal law to have a brake lining thickness of at least inch any less renders the brakes defective,tit,subd.b incorporating commercial vehicle safety alliance north american standard out of service criteria,subd.a,ch.iii,subch.b,appen,eff.defendant maintenance manual incorporates that standard and mandates that technicians s trictly adhere to brake repair standards.nevertheless,defendant maintenance records show repeated use of type d school buses with brake linings less than inch in thickness.plaintiffs assert,without dispute from defendant,their evidence shows there were inspections revealing illegal brake linings on type d buses between and.defendant records also show instances where an inspection revealed brake linings significantly below inch and yet defendant placed the bus back into service without the defective linings being replaced.furthermore,there were instances where defendant drivers complained about brakes problems on buses,but defendant failed to promptly inspect and repair the buses.
tire tread 
sections,subdivision b in combination with section of the vehicle code mandate that school bus tires have a tread depth of at least four of an inch on tires on the steering axle and at least two of an inch on other tires.defendant tire replacement policy is more stringent,requiring replacement of tires on the steering axle with less than five of an inch tread,and replacement of tires on the drive axle with less than three of an inch tread.nevertheless,there were a number of instances in which defendant kept buses in service after discovering in an inspection that tires violated either or both standards.
plaintiffs other evidence 
a.the november episode involving the day pmi requirement 
in september,defendant met with district officials to discuss plaintiffs allegations.defendant assured the district it was meeting its contractual obligations and all laws relating to student transportation.the district representative made it clear the district expected that from defendant.subsequently,defendant sent a letter to the district confirming that,starting on october,defendant would establish a reporting process to address the district questions related to our preventative maintenance program.among other things,defendant agreed to provide the district a monthly report on the day inspection program.
in november,defendant sent the district a report documenting the pmi interval for the buses used in october.although it turned out not to be the case,it appeared to the district that buses were operated out of compliance with the day pmi requirement.one of defendant employees internally described the district reaction as going nuts and freaking out.
on november,the district wrote defendant,stating 
first student agreed to provide the district with certain reports on a regular basis on the maintenance and servicing of the vehicles transporting district students.the purpose of the reports was,in part,to demonstrate that first student was performing all the necessary vehicle maintenance and review services mandated by state law and the contract.
recently,first student submitted the first day vehicle inspection report.upon review of the report by staff,it appears that first student has multiple vehicles in violation of the state mandated day vehicle safety inspection.the report indicates that percent of of the vehicles included in the report were overdue by from to days.besides being in violation of a state mandated safety inspection,first student is also exhibiting disregard for article,subsection of our contract.the district can not and will not accept this level of service from the contractor responsible for the safe transportation of its students.
therefore the district is directing first student to,immediately and without delay,remove from service any vehicle where the day inspection time is past and the district directs first student to have this situation corrected by the next day inspection report,and that in the report no bus shall indicate being in operation after its inspection due date.the district did not threaten to withhold payments or cancel the contract.
defendant responded in writing by assuring the district that first student is performing all the necessary vehicle maintenance and services mandated by state law and our contract.defendant letter explained that none of the overdue buses in the report had been placed into service past the day pmi interval.
defendant reckless disregard of compliance with maintenance requirements 
defendant policies require periodic audits of facilities and vehicles to ensure the adequacy of maintenance operations.for example,a monthly shop audit policy states that its goal is to ensure that all vehicles are maintained in a safe,reliable and clean condition.vehicles must be available to meet all operational requirements at optimum cost and in accordance with first student operating procedures and all relevant legislation.italics omitted.the policy requires the service in charge tic to perform a monthly audit to determine trends in servicing reoccurring repair issues.among other things,the monthly audit should include an audit of percent of the vehicles which received regularly scheduled pmi.the policy requires that any variances from the standards must be preapproved by defendant senior vice president of maintenance.
plaintiffs presented evidence that defendant failed to follow those policies.defendant region maintenance manager for san francisco admitted,we do,per se,do monthly shop audits.they would be done on an basis.he testified he did perform annual audits,but he admitted he did not have any related to those audits.he was not aware of anyone else performing an audit at the san francisco location.in a june deposition,he admitted he had not performed an audit of the san francisco facility in the last two years.defendant area general manager testified in her deposition that the way they audit is by having the drivers inspect the buses on a daily basis.she testified that,although she is responsible for ensuring compliance with defendant inspection policies,she does not receive any regular reporting regarding compliance with those policies.
defendant additional evidence 
defendant presented evidence the chp has subjected defendant san francisco facility and buses to annual inspections for over years.the primary purpose of the chp terminal inspections is to ensure compliance with federal and state laws,including the day pmi requirement.as explained in a declaration from the chp inspector of defendant facilities,the chp inspects a representative sample of the fleet regarding pmi compliance,daily vehicle inspection reports,and repair records.the chp then assigns a compliance rating of satisfactory,unsatisfactory,or conditional.defendant facilities were consistently rated as satisfactory,which meant the facilities were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and any deficiencies or defects were minor and did not jeopardize highway safety.a checklist provided to motor carriers to assist them in preparing for chp inspections lists c riteria for assignment of a satisfactory rating,including condition reflects effective preventive maintenance practices vehicle records reflect compliance with mandated inspection intervals drivers daily vehicle inspections are performed and documented and d efects noted are corrected promptly and vehicles are not operated with conditions or defects of a long standing nature.
defendant also presented evidence the district consistently paid defendant after receiving its monthly invoices,including in the years after plaintiffs sued defendant under the cfca.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in granting defendant motion for summary judgment on their first cause of action for violation of section,subdivision a.to obtain summary judgment,a defendant must establish there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar,supra,cal th at.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.id.at,fn.omitted.the trial court must view that evidence,and any reasonable inferences from that evidence,in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.at.we review the trial court ruling de novo.id.at.
introduction to the cfca 
in rothschild tyco internat.us,th,rothschild,the court described the cfca as follows 
in,the california legislature enacted the cfca,patterned on a similar federal statutory scheme citation,to supplement governmental efforts to identify and prosecute fraudulent claims made against state and local governmental entities.citation.as relevant here,the cfca permits the recovery of civil penalties and treble damages from any person who k nowingly presents or causes to be presented to the state or any political subdivision a false claim for payment or approval.citation.to be liable under the cfca,a person must have actual knowledge of the information,act in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information,act in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.citation.
the cfca authorizes the attorney general in the case of alleged violations involving state funds or the prosecuting authority of a political subdivision in the case of alleged violations relating to funds of the political subdivision to bring a civil action for violations of its provisions.citation.subject to certain limitations,the cfca permits a private person referred to as a qui tam plaintiff or a relator to bring such an action on behalf of a governmental agency.citation.
if a qui tam plaintiff files a cfca complaint,he or she must file the complaint under seal and serve it,as well as a written disclosure of the material evidence and information in support of his or her claims,on the attorney general.citation.the attorney general is required to notify local prosecuting authorities if local funds are involved.citation.the action remains sealed for up to days although the statutory period is subject to extension for good cause shown to permit the state local authorities to investigate and determine whether to proceed in the action.citation.
if the state a local prosecuting authority elects to proceed with the action,that agency or those agencies have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action,although the qui tam plaintiff has the right to continue as a party to the action.citation.if no prosecuting authority decides to proceed with the action,the qui tam plaintiff has the right to do so subject to the right of the state or political subdivision to intervene in certain circumstances.citation.regardless of who prosecutes the qui tam action,if it is successful,the qui tam plaintiff is entitled to a percentage of the recovery achieved in the case.citation.accord,contreras i,supra,th at.
the legislature designed the cfca to prevent fraud on the public treasury,and it should be given the broadest possible construction consistent with that purpose.citations.in other words,the cfca must be construed broadly so as to give the widest possible coverage and effect to the prohibitions and remedies it provides.citation.citations.the cfca is intended to supplement governmental efforts to identify and prosecute fraudulent claims made against state and local governmental entities.citation.given the very close similarity of the cfca to the federal fca,it is appropriate to turn to federal cases for guidance in interpreting the cfca.citations.contreras i,supra,th at.
ii.there are triable issues of material fact as to plaintiffs implied certification claim under the cfca 
the complaint alleges a fraud on the district,in that defendant sought payments from the district while knowingly failing to provide the services for which the district contracted to wit,student transportation on properly maintained buses.in contreras i,supra,th,we rejected defendant contention it was immune from liability under the cfca because its invoices did not expressly assert compliance with the requirements of the contract and because the contract did not require certification of compliance with contractual terms as a prerequisite to payment.contreras i,at.we concluded defendant invoices were claims within the meaning of the cfca the invoices did not need to contain an expressly false statement to be actionable and defendant requests for payment under the contract included an implied certification of compliance with contractual requirements that,if false and fraudulent,can form the basis for a cfca action.contreras i,at.
we discussed a number of state and federal decisions in upholding plaintiffs implied certification theory of violation of the cfca.contreras i,supra,th at.we also rejected defendant assertion that plaintiffs construction of the cfca would enable any private party to sue based on any purported breach of any public entity contract.contreras i,at.in doing so,we pointed out several limitations on liability under the cfca.among other things,we pointed out that the implied certification of compliance with the breached contract provision must be material to the government decision to pay out moneys to the claimant citations and the contractor must have the requisite knowledge,rendering the failure to disclose the contractual noncompliance fraudulent.contreras i,at.in granting defendant summary judgment motion,the trial court concluded that,as a matter of law,defendant alleged false implied certifications were not material and defendant did not have the requisite knowledge of the alleged falsity of the implied certifications.we consider each of those elements in turn.
materiality 
the cfca does not expressly require a showing of materiality to support the imposition of a statutory penalty for the submission of a false claim.under section,subdivision a,a person who k nowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval is liable to the state or political subdivision for a civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars for each violation.stats,ch.nevertheless,a number of courts have concluded that the federal fca contains an implicit materiality requirement,because it would not effectuate the intent of the statute to impose a penalty based on a falsity which would not have influenced the public entity payment decision.citations.contreras i,supra,th at.a n alleged falsity satisfies the materiality requirement where it has the natural tendency to influence agency action or is capable of influencing agency action.citation.citation.ibid.
in contreras i,we concluded plaintiffs allegations were sufficient to satisfy the materiality requirement because defendant implied certification that it had satisfactorily performed its material obligations under the contract,including provisions designed to protect the health and safety of the student population,had a natural tendency citation to cause the district to make payments it would not have made had it been aware of defendant noncompliance.contreras i,supra,th at.essentially,we concluded that defendant alleged falsities were material as a matter of common sense.dolphin mortg.wl,relying on common sense in materiality analysis ex rel.durcholz fkw,same.
we also noted in contreras i that plaintiffs materiality showing was strengthened by various provisions of the contract that reflect the district concern with bus maintenance and safety contreras i,supra,th at.for example,article d of the contract provides,all buses shall be in excellent mechanical condition and appearance at the beginning of the contract and shall be maintained in that condition at all times during the term of the contract.the superintendent his designees reserves the right to inspect motor vehicle equipment at any time during the term of the contract.article of the contract states,it is the intent of the district to obtain the best quality transportation available and which incorporates the highest standards of performance and safety for the educational and personal of the students.this connection between maintenance and student safety is also reflected in the chp handbook in the chp experience,public attitudes have always supported requirements for superior maintenance and more stringent maintenance regulations for s chool buses,school pupil activity buses,and general public paratransit vehicles 
although we concluded in contreras i that plaintiffs allegations were sufficient to survive defendant demurrer,we also pointed out that the issue of materiality was ultimately a mixed question of law and fact,and a showing in a motion for summary judgment or at trial that the alleged breach would not have affected the payment decision will defeat a cfca claim.contreras i,supra,th at.to exemplify the point,we discussed a federal decision,ex rel.berge trustees of of cir berge there,the defendants appealed from denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict finding them liable under the federal fca.citation.the defendants were funded by the national institutes of health nih to conduct research regarding a common cause of birth defects.citation.the qui tam plaintiff alleged the defendants had made false statements to the nih in annual progress reports including,among other things,assertions about the amount of data that had been computerized.citation.the fourth circuit reversed denial of the motion for judgment because there was no substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude the defendants errors and omissions were materially capable of influencing the government funding decision.citation.the court pointed out that the program officer with responsibility for the grant testified that the principal purpose of the project was the collection of data,not its computerization.citations.contreras i,at.
in the present appeal,defendant does not dispute that plaintiffs have presented evidence of a substantial number of maintenance failures and that the condition of defendant buses is a matter of great importance to the district.instead,defendant argues its evidence shows the alleged false implied certifications were not material because the district declined to intervene in the present action,declined to bring an action of its own for breach of contract,always paid defendant monthly invoices in full,and extended the contract in.defendant asserts,since the district in fact continued to pay,even though it knew of the alleged falsity of defendant claims,defendant established that any such alleged falsity did not have any natural tendency or capability to influence the district payment decision.the trial court accepted this argument below,stating it is undisputed that the district was aware of violations of contractual provisions via both the allegations in the lawsuit and the november letter and despite this knowledge continued to pay on defendant submitted invoices.this showing that the alleged breach did not affect the district payment decision defeats the cfca claim.defendant reasoning is misplaced for several reasons.
first,defendant has not established a critical factual predicate to giving any significance to the district reaction to the plaintiffs allegations that the district knew about the falsity of defendant implied certifications.instead,the evidence shows the district became aware of plaintiffs allegations,which defendant denied.accordingly,the present case is unlike the case upon which defendant relies,ex rel.yannacopoulos general dynamics cir,in which the governmental entity obtained actual knowledge of the defendants wrongdoing.in yannacopoulos,the defendant sold fighter jets to greece greece borrowed the funds for the purchase from the united states government,which paid the defendant directly.id.at.the plaintiff claimed the defendant made a number of false statements to the united states in obtaining payments.id.at.as relevant here,the plaintiff alleged the defendant failed to disclose promptly to the united states its decision to delete a certain clause from a draft contract for the aircraft sale.ibid.the seventh circuit concluded the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendant on the claim on the ground of materiality,because the government agency took no adverse action when it actually learned of omission of the clause.id.at.there was also evidence the clause was of no substantive importance id.at and unenforceably vague id.at,and the government approved the final contract without the clause at issue ibid.
in the present case,there is no evidence the district had actual knowledge of defendant wrongdoing as opposed to allegations of wrongdoing and there is no evidence the contractual maintenance requirements were unimportant to the district.accordingly,the present case is also distinguishable from berge,where the contracting entity determined that the information the plaintiff alleged was false or misrepresented was not material to its funding decisions.berge,supra,at.in sum,defendant cites no evidence suggesting the district would have considered the alleged maintenance failures immaterial,if the district knew the allegations were true.
second,as the attorney general argues in her amicus brief,even assuming the district were aware defendant had failed to comply with the contractual maintenance requirements,the district reaction would not be dispositive.the materiality determination turns on whether the alleged false statement was such that it had a natural tendency to influence or was capable of influencing government action.contreras i,supra,th at.we agree with the decisions under the federal fca that have concluded the materiality test focuses on the potential effect of the false statement when it is made,not on the actual effect of the false statement when it is discovered.ex rel.harrison westinghouse savannah river cir,harrison accord,ex rel.a homecare,medshares management group,cir,medshares see also rogan cir,ex rel.el amin george washington d,el amin states ex rel.oliver v.the parsons d.
thus,the government contracting entity actual reaction upon learning of a false claim is not dispositive of the issue of materiality.if a false statement was clearly material when it was made,the fact that the contracting entity did not treat the falsity as material upon discovering it would not preclude a claim under the cfca.this is consistent with the important remedial purposes of the cfca and our obligation to construe the law broadly.contreras i,supra,th at.as the materiality requirement itself is a restriction on the scope of the law application id.at,the requirement should not be construed as immunizing conduct the cfca sought to sanction.the cfca,like the federal fca,is intended to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the g overnment.citation.ex rel.hendow university of phoenix,hendow accord,contreras i,at see also state of california altus finance cal th,altus finance t he ultimate purpose of the cfca is to protect the public fisc.the standard of materiality adopted by the trial court would immunize certain instances of significant fraud and weaken the cfca effectiveness at policing the integrity of the government dealings with those to whom it pays money.harrison,supra,at.harrison conclusion with respect to the federal fca is equally applicable to the cfca courts best give effect to the law by holding a party liable if the false statement it makes in an attempt to obtain government funding has a natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the government funding decision,not whether it actually influenced the government not to pay a particular claim.harrison,at see also rivera cir,rivera the federal fca reflects a congressional judgment that fraud by government contractors is best prevented by attacking the activity that presents the risk of wrongful payment,and not by waiting until the public fisc is actually damaged.
this focus on materiality at the time a false claim was presented finds further support in the proposition that a party can be subject to liability under the cfca even if a false claim does not actually result in a loss to the government,for example,where the government discovers that a claim is false before it makes payment.mcveigh recology san francisco th,quoting ex rel.sanders american amicable life,tx cir,see also altus finance,supra,cal th at the cfca authorizes civil penalties for attempts to misappropriate public funds that were not in fact completed by payment from the treasury medshares,supra,at rivera,supra,at.if a violation of the cfca is complete with the submission of a false claim for payment,then the government actual response to the claim can not be dispositive on the issue of materiality.
third and finally,although defendant does not appear to dispute the general proposition that a contracting agency response is not legally dispositive of the issue of materiality,defendant nevertheless argues the district response constitutes evidence that determines the issue of materiality in its favor as a matter of law.we disagree.accepting that the district actual reaction has some relevance to the materiality determination,the trial court erred in concluding a reasonable trier of fact could only infer a lack of materiality from the district response to plaintiffs allegations including its decisions not to intervene,not to bring its own suit for breach of contract,to continue to make payments on the contract,and to extend the contract.
contrary to defendant view,the district decisions not to intervene or bring suit for breach of contract could simply reflect a judgment that plaintiffs claims should be resolved in the present action at minimal cost to the district.ex rel.chandler cook county,cir,fn.chandler.moreover,assuming the government looked unfavorably upon each qui tam action in which it did not intervene would seem antithetical to the purpose of the qui tam provision to encourage private parties to litigate on behalf of the government.el amin,supra,d at see also ex rel.atkins mcinteer cir,fn.ex rel.williams bell helicopter textron,cir,chandler,at,fn.berge,supra,at.
furthermore,the district decision to continue to make payments could reflect acceptance of defendant representations of compliance,the expense and difficulty of investigating the allegations of wrongdoing,fear of litigation with defendant,or concerns about the possibility of disrupting services.see harrison,supra,at we can foresee instances in which a government entity might choose to continue funding the contract despite earlier wrongdoing by the contractor ex rel.gillespie kaplan university wl,government continued payments did not defeat materiality showing where defendants entered into agreement to correct their noncompliance.finally,the district decision to extend the contract could reflect a judgment that,regardless of whatever past maintenance problems existed,defendant is now complying with its contractual obligations although none of those suggested inferences favorable to plaintiffs claims are supported by direct evidence,neither is defendant suggested inference that the district restrained response shows the implied false certification was not material.
in addition,a reasonable trier of fact could infer that the district reaction to what it believed to be an admission of noncompliance by defendant showed it considered the maintenance requirements in the contract to be of great importance.thus,when in november the district received information from defendant that it believed showed defendant had committed multiple violations of the day pmi requirement in october,the district immediately notified defendant in writing that the district can not and will not accept this level of service from the contractor responsible for the safe transportation of its students.the district directed defendant to immediately and without delay remove from service buses not in compliance with the inspection requirement and required that in the next report no bus shall indicate being in operation after its inspection due date.in internal communications,one of defendant employees described the district reaction as going nuts and freaking out.defendant argues the incident demonstrates a lack of materiality,because the district did not actually cease paying defendant,attempt to recover past payments,demand liquidated damages,or threaten to terminate the contract.however,that is not the only,or even the most,reasonable inference from the episode,because defendant promptly assured the district there were no pmi violations in october.more broadly,defendant had recently told the district it was in compliance with the contract and all applicable laws.that the district did not threaten to withhold payments or take other such steps without providing defendant an opportunity to respond does not necessarily show that the alleged implied false certifications regarding the maintenance requirements were not capable of influencing the district payment decisions.a more reasonable inference is that the episode shows the maintenance requirements were material,but the district decided to accept defendant assurances of compliance.
in sum,the record shows a triable issue of material fact as to materiality.a conclusion that the alleged false implied certification was material is supported by common sense,by the language of the contract,and by reasonable inferences from the district reaction when presented with evidence of potential violations of the pmi requirement in late.on the other hand,a conclusion that the alleged false implied certification was not material is supported by competing inferences from the district response to plaintiffs allegations and the late incident.the conflicting evidence and inferences precluded grant of summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs could not demonstrate materiality as a matter of law.cohen five brooks stable th,only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.
the trial court also concluded that,as a matter of law,defendant did not have the requisite knowledge of the falsity of its implied certifications of contract compliance.as noted previously,the cfca is violated by a person who k nowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,subd.a.the cfca provides that knowingly means that a person,with respect to the alleged false information at issue in the claim,h as actual knowledge of the information,a cts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information,or a cts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information,subd.b see also contreras i,supra,th at rothschild,supra,th at.proof of specific intent to defraud is not required,subd.b.
the definition of knowingly in the federal fca is the same as the definition in the cfca,and,in adopting the federal fca definition,congress attempted to reach what has become known as the ostrich type situation where an individual has buried his head in the sand and failed to make simple inquiries which would alert him that false claims are being submitted.citation.congress adopted the concept that individuals and contractors receiving public funds have some duty to make a limited inquiry so as to be reasonably certain they are entitled to the money they seek.citations.bourseau cir,see also gulf group general enterprises,the standard was designed to address the problem of the refusal to learn of information which an individual,in the exercise of prudent judgment,had reason to know.citation.thus,the federal fca covers not just those who set out to defraud the government,but also those who ignore obvious deficiencies in a claim.ex rel.ervin and associates,hamilton securities group,d,t he standard of reckless disregard was designed to address the refusal to learn of information which an individual,in the exercise of prudent judgment,should have discovered but see ex rel.hefner hackensack university medical center cir,congress specifically expressed its intention that the act not punish honest mistakes or incorrect claims submitted through mere negligence.among other things,a failure to make a minimal examination of records can constitute deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard,and a contractor that deliberately ignores false information submitted as part of a claim can be found liable under the federal fca.gulf group,at.the plain language of the cfca reflects similar legislative intent.see thompson pacific construction,v city of sunnyvale th,thompson reckless disregard standard in federal fca and cfca indistinguishable.
plaintiffs argue the payment claims at issue in the present case were presented in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of whether defendant was in compliance with the contract maintenance standards because defendant disregarded its
