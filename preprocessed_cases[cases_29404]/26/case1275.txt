responding to a declared state fiscal emergency,in the summer of the legislature enacted two measures intended to stabilize school funding by reducing or eliminating the diversion of property tax revenues from school districts to the state community redevelopment agencies.assem.bill.enacted as stats,chs.hereafter assembly bill and assembly bill see also assem.bill,subds.d i assem.bill,subds.b,c.assembly bill bars redevelopment agencies from engaging in new business and provides for their windup and dissolution.assembly bill offers an alternative redevelopment agencies can continue to operate if the cities and counties that created them agree to make payments into funds benefiting the state schools and special districts.
the california redevelopment association,the league of california cities,and other affected parties collectively the association promptly sought extraordinary writ relief from this court,arguing that each measure was unconstitutional.they contended the measures violate,inter alia,proposition,which amended the state constitution to place limits on the state ability to require payments from redevelopment agencies for the state benefit.see cal,art.xiii,subd.a,added by,as approved by voters.the state director of finance,respondent ana matosantos,opposed on the merits but agreed we should put to rest the significant constitutional questions concerning the validity of both measures we issued an order to show cause,partially stayed the two measures,and established an expedited briefing schedule.we also granted leave to the county of santa clara and its,vinod sharma collectively santa clara,to intervene as respondents.
we consider whether under the state constitution redevelopment agencies,once created and engaged in redevelopment plans,have a protected right to exist that immunizes them from statutory dissolution by the legislature and redevelopment agencies and their sponsoring communities have a protected right not to make payments to various funds benefiting schools and special districts as a condition of continued operation.answering the first question no and the second yes,we largely uphold assembly bill and invalidate assembly bill.
assembly bill,the dissolution measure,is a proper exercise of the legislative power vested in the legislature by the state constitution.that power includes the authority to create entities,such as redevelopment agencies,to carry out the state ends and the corollary power to dissolve those same entities when the legislature deems it necessary and proper.proposition,while it amended the state constitution to impose new limits on the legislature fiscal powers,neither explicitly nor implicitly rescinded the legislature power to dissolve redevelopment agencies.nor does article xvi,section of the state constitution,which authorizes the allocation of property tax revenues to redevelopment agencies,impair that power.
a different conclusion is required with respect to assembly bill,the measure conditioning further redevelopment agency operations on additional payments by an agency community sponsors to state funds benefiting schools and special districts.proposition specifically cal,art.xiii,subd.a expressly forbids the legislature from requiring such payments.matosantos argument that the payments are valid because technically voluntary can not be reconciled with the fact that the payments are a requirement of continued operation.because the flawed provisions of assembly bill are not severable from other parts of that measure,the measure is invalid in its entirety 
background 
government finance the integration of state,school,and municipal financing 
for much of the century,state and local governments were financed independently under the separation of sources doctrine.in,the legislature proposed,and the voters approved,a constitutional amendment granting local governments exclusive control over the property tax.cal,art.xiii,former,enacted by const.amend,see simmons,california tax collection time for reform santa clara,ehrman flavin,taxing cal.property ed.each jurisdiction city,county,special district,and school district could levy its own independent property tax.see,temescal water niemann,it is conceded that a municipality has the right to assess all real property found within its limits for the purpose of maintaining the municipal revenues,and that the county taxing officials have the right to levy upon the same property for county purposes.
this system of finance had significant consequences for education.under the state constitution,the legislature is obligated to provide for a public school system.cal,art.ix,wells learning foundation cal th,d.seeking to promote local involvement,the legislature established school districts as political subdivisions and delegated to them that duty.wells,at,d,butt state of california cal th,d,see also california teachers hayes th,d.historically,school districts were largely funded out of local property taxes.serrano priest cal d,serrano i serrano priest cal d,serrano ii see county of los angeles sasaki th,d.under the california system of financing as it existed until the,different school districts could levy taxes and generate vastly different revenues because of the difference in property values,the same property tax rate would yield widely differing sums in,for example,beverly hills and baldwin park.serrano i,at.

a second event of seismic significance followed shortly after,with the voters adoption of proposition.cal,art.xiii a,added by,as approved by voters,primary june.as noted,before cities and counties had been able to levy their own property taxes.proposition capped ad valorem real property taxes imposed by all local entities at percent cal,art.xiii a,subd.a,reducing the amount of revenue available by more than half stark,the right to vote on taxes.in place of multiple property taxes imposed by multiple political subdivisions,it substituted a single tax to be collected by counties and thereafter apportioned.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.significantly,proposition did not specify how that percent was to be divided,instead leaving the method of allocation to state law.see cal,art.xiii a,subd.a real property tax is to be apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,county of los angeles sasaki,supra,th at,d city of rancho cucamonga mackzum d,d.
proposition transformed the government financing landscape in at least three ways relevant to this case.first,by capping local property tax revenue,it greatly enhanced the responsibility the state would bear in funding government services,especially education.see county of los angeles sasaki,supra,th at,d california teachers hayes,supra,th at,d.second,by failing to specify a method of allocation,proposition largely transferred control over local government finances from the state many political subdivisions to the state,converting the property tax from a nominally local tax to a de facto tax subject to a complex system of intergovernmental grants.see,et amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d at,sasaki,at,d stark,the right to vote on taxes,supra.at.third,by imposing a unified,shared property tax,proposition created a game in which political subdivisions cities,counties,special districts,and school districts would have to compete against each other for their slices of a greatly shrunken pie.
in,the voters added another wrinkle with proposition,which established constitutional minimum funding levels for education and required the state to set aside a designated portion of the general fund for public schools.cal,art.xvi,see los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d california teachers hayes,supra,th at,d.two years later,the voters revised and effectively increased the minimum funding requirements for public schools,primary june,amending cal,art.xvi,see county of sonoma commission on state mandates th,d.
in response to these rising educational demands on the state treasury,the legislature in created county educational revenue augmentation funds eraf.stats,chs,see los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d city of el monte commission on state mandates th,d county of los angeles sasaki,supra,th at,d.it reduced the portion of property taxes allocated to local governments,deposited the difference in the eraf,deemed the balances part of the state general fund for purposes of satisfying proposition obligations,and distributed these amounts to school districts.county of sonoma commission on state mandates,supra,th at,d see los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d eraf are an accounting device for reallocating property taxes to school districts from other local government entities.periodically thereafter,the legislature through supplemental legislation required local government entities to further contribute to the eraf in order to defray the state proposition school funding obligations.los angeles unified school,at,d.local governments had no vested right to property taxes id.at,d accordingly,the legislature could require eraf payments as an exercise of its authority to apportion property tax revenues.city of el monte,at,d see cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.
redevelopment agencies 
in the aftermath of world war ii,the legislature authorized the formation of community redevelopment agencies in order to remediate urban decay.stats,ch,et community redevelopment act stats,ch,et codifying and renaming the community redevelopment law,health,et see cal,art.xvi.the community redevelopment law was intended to help local governments revitalize blighted communities.city of cerritos cerritos taxpayers th,d see marek napa community redevelopment agency cal d.it has since become a principal instrument of economic development,mostly for cities,with nearly redevelopment agencies now active in california.
a redevelopment agency may be and usually is governed by the sponsoring community own legislative body.coomes et,redevelopment in california ed.an agency is authorized to prepare and carry out plans for the improvement,rehabilitation,and redevelopment of blighted areas,subd.a.to carry out such redevelopment plans,agencies may acquire real property,including by the power of eminent domain,subd.b,dispose of property by lease or sale without public bidding,clear land and construct infrastructure necessary for building on project sites,and undertake certain improvements to other public facilities in the project area.while redevelopment agencies have used their powers in a wide variety of ways,in one common type of project the redevelopment agency buys and assembles parcels of land,builds or enhances the site infrastructure,and transfers the land to private parties on favorable terms for residential commercial development.coomes,see,marek napa community redevelopment agency,supra,cal d at.
redevelopment agencies generally can not levy taxes.huntington park redevelopment agency martin cal d,city of cerritos cerritos taxpayers,supra,th at,d city of el monte commission on state mandates,supra,th at,d.instead,they rely on tax increment financing,a funding method authorized by article xvi,section of the state constitution and section of the health and safety code.city of dinuba county of tulare cal th,d,city of el monte,at,d.under this method,those public entities entitled to receive property tax revenue in a redevelopment project area the cities,counties,special districts,and school districts containing territory in the area are allocated a portion based on the assessed value of the property prior to the effective date of the redevelopment plan.any tax revenue in excess of that amount the tax increment created by the increased value of project area property goes to the redevelopment agency for repayment of debt incurred to finance the project.cal,art.xvi,subds.a,b,subds.a,b city of dinuba,at,d.in essence,property tax revenues for entities other than the redevelopment agency are frozen,while revenue from any increase in value is awarded to the redevelopment agency on the theory that the increase is the result of redevelopment.city of cerritos,at,d.

a powerful and flexible tool for community economic development,tax increment financing nonetheless has sometimes been misused to subsidize a city economic development through the diversion of property tax revenues from other taxing entities lancaster redevelopment agency dibley th,d see regus city of baldwin park d.this practice became more common in the era of constricted local tax revenue that followed the passage of proposition.some small cities with blighted areas available for industrial redevelopment were able to shield virtually all of their property tax revenue from other government agencies,but e ven in ordinary cities the temptation to use redevelopment as a financial weapon was considerable.because it limited increases in property tax rates,proposition created a kind of shell game among local government agencies for property tax funds.the only way to obtain more funds was to take them from another agency.redevelopment proved to be one of the most powerful mechanisms for gaining an advantage in the shell game.fulton shigley,guide to california planning ed.today,redevelopment agencies receive percent of all property tax revenue in the state.see assem.bill,subd.f legis.analyst,the budget should california end redevelopment agencies,supra.
addressing these concerns,the legislature has required redevelopment agencies to make certain transfers of their tax increment revenue for other local needs.first,percent of the revenue generally must be deposited in a fund for provision of low and moderate income housing,see city of cerritos cerritos taxpayers,supra,th at,d.second,redevelopment agencies must make a graduated series of payments to local government taxing agencies such as cities,counties,and school districts from tax increment on projects adopted or expanded after,subd.a see los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.the payments are distributed according to the taxing agencies ordinary shares of property taxes.id.at,d.
of greatest relevance here,the legislature has often required redevelopment agencies,like cities and counties,to make eraf payments for the benefit of school and community college districts.see,to,to former stats,ch,former stats,ch,los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d city of el monte commission on state mandates,supra,th at,d.in each of the and fiscal years,redevelopment agencies were charged amounts intended to generate a combined million,subd.a.in the fiscal year,the legislature required a combined million or percent of the total statewide tax increment allocated to redevelopment agencies under section,whichever was greater,to be transferred to eraf,subd.a,although that revenue shift was ultimately invalidated in litigation.cal.redevelopment genest,cu wm gds.similar provisions for shifts of tax increment revenue in the and fiscal years,are the subjects of pending litigation.
tax increment financing remains a source of contention because of the financial advantage it provides redevelopment agencies and their community sponsors,primarily cities,over school districts and other local taxing agencies.additionally,because of the state obligations to equalize public school funding across districts,et and to fund all public schools at minimum levels set by proposition cal,art.xvi,the loss of property tax revenue by school and community college districts creates obligations for the state general fund.see los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d lefcoe,finding the blight that right for california redevelopment law hastings,w here cities and counties shift property taxes from schools to redevelopment projects,the state must make up the difference.the effect of tax increment financing on school districts property tax revenues has thus become a point of fiscal conflict between california community redevelopment agencies and the state itself,a conflict manifesting in the current dispute.

in november,following further legislative requirements that redevelopment agencies make eraf payments,the voters approved proposition.among the initiative many statutory and constitutional revisions,one is most central to the association argument the addition of section,subdivision a to article xiii of the state constitution.that provision limits what the legislature may do with respect to redevelopment agency tax increment a on or after november,the legislature shall not enact a statute to do any of the following require a community redevelopment agency a to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,taxes on ad valorem real property and tangible personal property allocated to the agency pursuant to section of article xvi to or for the benefit of the state,any agency of the state,or any jurisdiction or b to use,restrict,or assign a particular purpose for such taxes for the benefit of the state,any agency of the state,or any jurisdiction,with two exceptions not pertinent here.we address section,subdivision a in more detail below.see post,pts.

assembly bills and ix consist of three principal components,codified as new parts,both assem.bill and assem.bill of division of the health and safety code.part to is the freeze component it subjects redevelopment agencies to restrictions on new bonds or other indebtedness new plans or changes to existing plans and new partnerships,including joint powers authorities to.cities and counties are barred from creating any new redevelopment agencies.existing obligations are unaffected redevelopment agencies may continue to make payments and perform existing obligations until other agencies take over.part purpose is to preserve redevelopment agency assets and revenues for use by local governments to fund core governmental services such as fire protection,police,and schools,subd.a.
part to is the dissolution component.it dissolves all redevelopment agencies and transfers control of redevelopment agency assets to successor agencies,which are contemplated to be the city or county that created the redevelopment agency,subd.j,subd.b.part requires successor agencies to continue to make payments and perform existing obligations.however,unencumbered balances of redevelopment agency funds must be remitted to the county for distribution to cities,the county,special districts,and school districts in proportion to what each agency would have received absent the redevelopment agencies.see,subd.d,subd.a.proceeds from redevelopment agency asset sales likewise must go to the county for similar distribution,subd.e.finally,tax increment revenues that would have gone to redevelopment agencies must be deposited in a local trust fund each county is required to create and administer,subd.b,subd.c.all amounts necessary to satisfy administrative costs,payments,and enforceable obligations will be allocated for those purposes,while any excess will be deemed property tax revenue and distributed in the same fashion as balances and assets,subd.d,subd.a.

payments are due on january and may each year,subd.d.while remittances are nominally owed by cities and counties,the measure authorizes each community sponsor to contract with its redevelopment agency to receive tax increment in the amount owed,so that payments may effectively come from tax increment.finally,any lapse in payments will result in a redevelopment agency dissolution.

ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
santa clara pleads as an affirmative defense that we lack jurisdiction.though it does not further argue the point,we have an independent obligation in this as in every matter to confirm whether jurisdiction exists.see walker superior court cal d,abelleira district court of appeal cal d,linnick sedelmeier d.see also marbury madison cranch.assembly bill provides that n otwithstanding any other law,any action contesting the validity of this part or part or challenging acts taken pursuant to these parts shall be brought in the superior court of the county of sacramento,subd.a.we conclude this provision does not deprive us of jurisdiction.

b.the constitutionality of assembly bill 
we turn now to the merits.in assessing the validity of assembly bills and,we are mindful that all intendments favor the exercise of the legislature plenary authority if there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.such restrictions and limitations imposed by the constitution are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.citations.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d.
the dissolution of redevelopment agencies under part of division of the health and safety code 
in enacting assembly bill,the legislature asserted that r edevelopment agencies were created by statute and can therefore be dissolved by statute.assem.bill,subd.h.we conclude the legislature was correct.
at the core of the legislative power is the authority to make laws.nougues douglass cal,the legislative power is the creative element in the government it makes the laws.the state constitution vests that power,except as exercised by or reserved to the people themselves,in the legislature.cal,art.iv,mcclung employment development cal th,d,nougues,at i n all cases where not exercised and not reserved,all the legislative power of the people of the state is vested in the legislature italics omitted.
of significance,the legislative power the state constitution vests is plenary.under it,the entire authority of the state,except the people right of initiative and referendum,is vested in the legislature,and that body may exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the constitution.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at,see also marine forests society california coastal com.cal th,d,people tilton cal,under the state,f ull power exists when there is no limitation.
we thus start from the premise that the legislature possesses the full extent of the legislative power and its enactments are authorized exercises of that power.only where the state constitution withdraws legislative power will we conclude an enactment is invalid for want of authority.in other words,we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the legislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at,quoting fitts superior court cal d,accord,state personnel bd.department of personnel admin.cal th,d,county of riverside superior court cal th,d.

in particular,if a political entity has been created by the legislature,it can be dissolved by the legislature,barring some specific constitutional obstacle to a particular exercise of the legislative power.in our federal system the states are sovereign but cities and counties are not in california as elsewhere they are mere creatures of the state and exist only at the state sufferance.board of supervisors local agency formation com.cal th,d,see also city of el monte commission on state mandates,supra,th at,d only the state is sovereign and,in a broad sense,all local governments,districts,and the like are subdivisions of the state.it follows from the fundamental nature of this relationship between a state and its political subdivisions that states have extraordinarily wide latitude in creating various types of political subdivisions and conferring authority upon them.citation.board of supervisors,at.as the united states supreme court has recognized in the context of municipal corporations the number,nature and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the state the state,therefore,at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers,expand or contract the territorial area,unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality,or repeal the charter and destroy the corporation.hunter pittsburgh,quoted with approval in board of supervisors,at.the state and,in particular,the legislature has plenary power to set the conditions under which its political subdivisions are created board of supervisors,at equally so,it has plenary power to set the conditions under which its political subdivisions are abolished curtis board of supervisors cal d,petition east fruitvale sanitary dist.cal,

the association offers a twofold argument for why,notwithstanding the legislative authority over redevelopment agencies historically inherent in the state constitution,the dissolution provisions of assembly bill are invalid.first,the association posits that assembly bill is inconsistent with article xvi,section of the state constitution,governing tax increment revenue.second,the association argues that proposition as approved by voters,amended the state constitution to effectively withdraw from the legislature the power to dissolve community redevelopment agencies for the financial benefit of the state.
what is now article xvi,section was added by initiative in shortly after the legislature enacted the community redevelopment law it made express the legislature authority to authorize property tax increment financing of redevelopment agencies and projects.however,nothing in its text creates an absolute right to an allocation of property taxes.see cal,art.xvi,the legislature may provide that any redevelopment plan may contain a provision diverting tax increment to redevelopment agencies italics added.nor does anything in the text of the section mandate that redevelopment agencies,once created,must exist in perpetuity.on its face,the provision is not and conveys no rights rather,it authorizes the legislature to enact statutes,and local governments to adopt redevelopment plans,that are consistent with its scope.
what is apparent from the constitutional provision text is confirmed by its history.the ballot materials provided to the voters gave no hint that the proposed amendment was intended to make redevelopment agencies or tax increment financing a permanent part of the government landscape.rather,consistent with the text use of the permissive may,the legislative counsel explained that the proposed amendment was intended simply to authorize but not require the legislature to provide for tax increment financing for redevelopment.proposed amendments to constitution propositions and proposed laws,legis.counsel analysis of assem.const.amend.the arguments in favor of the proposed amendment similarly emphasized its nonmandatory character this constitutional amendment is in effect an enabling act to give the legislature authority to enact legislation which will provide for the handling of the proceeds of taxes levied upon property in a redevelopment project.it is permissive in character and can become effective in practice only by acts of the legislature and the local governing body,the city council or board of supervisors.it will make possible the passage of laws providing that tax revenues derived from any increase in the assessed value of property within a redevelopment area because of new improvements,shall be placed in a fund to defray all or part of the cost of the redevelopment project that would otherwise have to be advanced from public funds,argument in favor of assem.const.amend.
against these indicia of intent,the association emphasizes the final sentence of article xvi,section the legislature shall enact those laws as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this section.italics added.the word shall,however,depending on the context in which it is used,is not necessarily mandatory.people lara cal th,d,nunn state of california cal d,see garner dict.of legal usage ed.moreover,consistent with its character as an enabling act proposed amendments to constitution propositions and proposed laws,argument in favor of assem.const.amend,the final sentence directs only passage of those laws as may be necessary.this portion of the text confirms the legislature authority to pass legislation it deems necessary to carry out the ends of redevelopment,but imposes no obligation to enact any particular law.it does not mandate that redevelopment agencies,or the allocation of tax increment to them,be made permanent.
the association also looks to our decision in marek napa community redevelopment agency,supra,cal d.there,we determined that indebtedness,the term used to measure how much property tax increment should be allocated to a redevelopment agency see cal,art.xvi,subd.b,should be interpreted broadly marek,at.we cautioned that neither article xvi,section nor the community redevelopment law,as then written,contemplated that other tax entities would share in tax increment revenues at any time before the agency total indebtedness has been paid or the amount in its special fund is sufficient to pay its total indebtedness.marek,at.the association contends assembly bill is invalid because it fails to continue allocating tax increment for existing indebtedness as broadly as in the past,most notably by allocating tax increment for only some,but not all,obligations owed by redevelopment agencies to their community sponsors.see,subd.d,subd.b.
this argument misperceives both the role of article xvi,section of the state constitution and the nature of the issue we resolved in marek napa community redevelopment agency,supra,cal d.article xvi,section does not protect the receipt of tax increment funds up to the amount of a redevelopment agency total indebtedness,nor does it grant a constitutional right to continue to receive tax increment for as long as redevelopment agencies have debt rather,it authorizes the legislature to statutorily grant redevelopment agencies rights to tax increment up to the amount of their total indebtedness.as the legislature may extend that authorization and did,in the community redevelopment law,so it may limit or withdraw that authorization as it has,in assem.bill without violating article xvi,section.in marek,we addressed only the scope of the statutory term indebtedness and the corresponding scope of the constitutional authorization for redevelopment agencies to be granted statutory rights to tax increment that issue has no bearing on the question we face here whether article xvi,section limits the legislature power to dissolve existing redevelopment agencies in the midst of ongoing projects.marek thus is inapposite.
finally,the association draws our attention to the first two sentences of an uncodified section of proposition,which,it contends,confirms that article xvi,section is a guarantee of tax increment funding and a protection against dissolution.that section begins section of article xvi of the constitution requires that a specified portion of the taxes levied upon the taxable property in a redevelopment project each year be allocated to the redevelopment agency to repay indebtedness incurred for the purpose of eliminating blight within the redevelopment project area.section of article xvi prohibits the legislature from reallocating some or that entire specified portion of the taxes to the state,an agency of the state,or any other taxing jurisdiction,instead of to the redevelopment agency.whether or not article xvi,section originally required tax increment allocations to be made to redevelopment agencies,rather than simply authorizing the legislature to pass legislation approving such allocations,the association contends that after this statement,article xvi,section must now be read to so provide.
we reject this contention.the assertion in proposition,section that tax increment allocations to redevelopment agencies are constitutionally mandated,rather than constitutionally authorized and statutorily mandated,is a clear misstatement of the law as it stood prior to the passage of proposition.moreover,section of proposition does not purport to amend article xvi,section or to change existing law concerning the source of redevelopment agencies entitlement,if any,to tax increment accordingly,we decline to treat its immaterial misstatement of law as a basis for silently amending the state constitution.
the various ways in which the association contends assembly bill is inconsistent with article xvi,section of the state constitution all flow from the assumption that section establishes for redevelopment agencies an absolute right to continued existence.because we can find no such right in the constitutional provision,article xvi,section does not invalidate assembly bill.
the association alternate constitutional argument rests on article xiii,section,subdivision a of the state constitution,added in by proposition.examining both the text and the various ballot arguments in support of and against that initiative,we find nothing in them that would limit the legislature plenary authority over the existence vel non of redevelopment agencies.
article xiii,section,subdivision a a of the state constitution generally prohibits the legislature from requiring a redevelopment agency to pay property taxes allocated to the agency pursuant to section of article xvi to or for the benefit of the state or its agencies and jurisdictions or otherwise restricting or assigning such taxes for the state benefit.the provision,the association reasons,both presumes and protects the existence of redevelopment agencies.dissolving redevelopment agencies would entail an impermissible diversion of their tax increment to third parties,in contravention of section,subdivision a a.moreover,if the state can not assign tax increment to third parties,that increment must go to redevelopment agencies hence,redevelopment agencies must be entitled to exist to receive it.
this argument suffers from a surface implausibility.the constitutionalization of a political subdivision the alteration of a local government entity from a statutory creation existing only at the pleasure of the sovereign state to a constitutional creation with life and powers of independent origin and standing would represent a profound change in the structure of state government.municipal corporations,though of far more ancient standing than redevelopment agencies,have never achieved such status.see cal,art.xi,subd.a specifying the legislature authority over city formation and powers.proposition contains no express language constitutionalizing redevelopment agencies.cal,art.xxxv,added by initiative,creating the cal.institute for regenerative medicine as a constitutional entity,art.xxi,added by initiative,creating the citizens redistricting com.as a constitutional entity.it would be unusual in the extreme for the people,exercising legislative power by way of initiative,to adopt such a fundamental change only by way of implication,in an initiative facially dealing with purely fiscal matters,in a corner of the state constitution addressing taxation.as the united states supreme court has put it,the drafters of legislation do not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.whitman american trucking,d.
the principle of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius applies here.proposition expressly adds numerous limits to the legislature statutory powers,and in one instance withdraws from the legislature a preexisting constitutional power,repealing cal,art.xix,former,but makes no mention of any intent to divest the legislature of the power to dissolve redevelopment agencies.if the initiative proponents and voters had intended to strip the legislature of that power or to alter the legislature article xvi,section permissive authority,it stands to reason they would have said so expressly.
had the voters in fact intended to amend the constitution to fundamentally alter the relationship between the state and this class of political subdivision,we would,moreover,expect to find at least a single mention of such an intention in the various supporting and opposing ballot arguments.instead,we find silence.the legislative analyst review of the initiative identifies no such anticipated effect.voter information guide.indeed,the ballot argument in favor of proposition and the rebuttal to the argument against it do not even mention redevelopment.voter information guide,at.only the opposing arguments highlight redevelopment and then only to criticize the initiative for how it secretly channels tax dollars to redevelopment agencies.ibid.
the association suggests it is not asserting an absolute right to perpetual existence,only a right for some form of agency to exist to receive redevelopment funds for as long as there is an active redevelopment plan and indebtedness.this framing does not change the analysis or conclusions.it would mean the legislature power to dissolve vanished as soon as a redevelopment agency was created thereafter,an agency or its similarly tasked successor effectively could expire only of natural causes,after every project it might undertake in its jurisdiction had been completed and paid off.no hint of such a right is disclosed in the text or history of either article xvi,section or article xiii,section,subdivision a of the state constitution.
contrary to the association contention,declining to imply into article xiii,section,subdivision a a constitutional guarantee of continued existence for redevelopment agencies does not render the subdivision a nullity.though the legislature retains the broad power to dissolve redevelopment agencies,proposition strips it of the narrower power to insist on transfers to third parties of property tax revenue already allocated to redevelopment agencies,as it had done on numerous previous occasions.see,to,to former stats,ch,former stats,ch.it is precisely such raids the text of proposition and the arguments in support of it denounce.voter information guide,see,subds.e,g.the protection so granted is not insignificant simply because it is conditioned on redevelopment agencies existing and having property tax increment allocated to them.
accordingly,we discern no constitutional impediment to the legislature electing to dissolve the state redevelopment agencies under part of division of the health and safety code.
freezing redevelopment agency transactions under part of division of the health and safety code 
as a means of facilitating dissolution under division,part,the legislature in division,part has suspended redevelopment agencies ability to make free use of their funds.see,prohibiting new or expanded debts except as provided in pt,limiting new indebtedness,subd.a provisions of this part shall be construed as broadly as possible to restrict the expenditure of funds to the fullest extent possible.the purpose of these restrictions is to preserve,to the maximum extent possible,the revenues and assets of redevelopment agencies so that those assets and revenues that are not needed to pay for enforceable obligations may be used by local governments to fund core governmental services including police and fire protection services and schools,subd.a see also assem.bill,subd.j the intent of pt.is to bar new obligations pending dissolution.the association contends these limits violate article xiii,section,subdivision a b of the state constitution,prohibiting restrictions on the use of property taxes allocated to redevelopment agencies for the benefit of the state or its agencies we conclude this portion of assembly bill is valid as well.
the power to abolish an entity necessarily encompasses the incidental power to declare its ending point if proposition,as we have concluded,was not intended to strip the legislature of the power to terminate redevelopment agencies,then it could not have been intended to deprive the legislature of the ability to decide when redevelopment agencies could cease to exist as legal entities or at what point,as part of winding up and dissolving,they would be relieved of the ability to make new binding commitments and engage in new business.as a practical and perhaps constitutional matter,to require an existing entity that has entered into a web of current contractual and other obligations to dissolve instantaneously is not possible doing so would inevitably raise serious impairment of contract questions.see,art.i,cal,art.i.
as matosantos argues,and we agree,proposition limit on state restrictions of redevelopment agencies use of their funds is best read as limiting the legislature powers during the operation,rather than the dissolution,of redevelopment agencies.article xiii,section,subdivision a b prohibits,with minor exceptions,further legislative restrictions on the use of property taxes allocated to redevelopment agencies under article xvi,section.article xvi,section,in turn,creates no absolute right to an allocation of property taxes.see cal,art.xvi,the legislature may provide that any redevelopment plan may contain a provision diverting tax increment to redevelopment agencies italics added.thus,if the legislature exercises its constitutional power to authorize allocation of property taxes to redevelopment agencies,and if a redevelopment plan so provides,then those taxes so allocated to an operating redevelopment agency may not be restricted to benefit the state by further legislative action.
the legislature in fact exercised that constitutional power when adopting and subsequently amending the community redevelopment law see,but the right of redevelopment agencies to tax increment funding thereby created was statutory,not constitutional.in turn,assembly bill revises those statutory rights.the legislature has determined that tax increment should no longer be allocated to redevelopment agencies assem.bill,subd.i upon agencies dissolution,property taxes are no longer to be deemed tax increment and allocated to redevelopment agencies,except insofar as necessary to satisfy existing obligations.the measure exercises the legislature constitutional power to authorize property tax increment revenue for,or to withdraw that authorization from,redevelopment agencies.see cal,art.xvi.as such,the measure modifies the constitutional predicate for the operation of article xiii,section,subdivision a b of the state constitution.in the absence of property tax increment allocated under article xvi,the latter subdivision has no force or effect.
redevelopment agencies,moreover,have a conditional right to the allocation of tax increment only to the extent of any existing indebtedness,cal,art.xvi,subd.b marek napa community redevelopment agency,supra,cal d at,interpreting indebtedness to include all existing obligations,including executory ones.they have no particular right to incur additional future indebtedness.the provisions of part of division the health and safety code,which respect the need to satisfy existing indebtedness see while precluding the creation of additional indebtedness,invade no rights protected by article xiii,section,subdivision a b of the state constitution.
accordingly,we conclude proposition does not invalidate the freeze portions of assembly bill as they apply to dissolving redevelopment agencies 
c.the constitutionality of assembly bill 
we turn to assembly bill.the measure conditions the future operation of redevelopment agencies on continuation payments,subd.a,subd.a.analyzing its operation in light of the constitutional limitations adopted by proposition,we conclude the condition the measure imposes is unconstitutional and assembly bill is,accordingly,facially invalid.
the legislature may not r equire a community redevelopment agency a to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,taxes on ad valorem real property and tangible personal property allocated to the agency pursuant to section of article xvi to or for the benefit of the state,any agency of the state,or any jurisdiction cal,art.xiii,subd.a,added by.that the continuation payments called for by assembly bill will benefit the state and its jurisdictions,special districts and school districts,is uncontested for fiscal year,they replace funding the state otherwise would have to supply under proposition see,subd.b,and in this and future years they go to funds supporting school districts and special districts,subd.a,subd.e.
moreover,as we shall explain,assembly bill continuation payments involve the direct or indirect payment,remittance,loan,or transfer of tax increment allocated to community redevelopment agencies.cal,art.xiii,subd.a.in interpreting the scope of that constitutional provision,added by initiative,we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction,beginning with the text as the best indicator of intent.professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d.where the text is ambiguous we must turn to extrinsic sources,such as the context of adoption and the ballot materials presented to the voters.ibid.here,the text of article xiii,section,subdivision a does not define clearly the intended scope of its prohibition against requiring direct or indirect payment,transfer,of tax revenue.presented with an ambiguity,we examine the historical backdrop against which the provision was drafted and adopted to discern its meaning.
in the two decades preceding passage of proposition,redevelopment agencies were the subject of repeated eraf shifts directives to transfer money to county eraf.each eraf shift calculated the amount every redevelopment agency owed as a fraction of the tax increment it received,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a former,subd.a stats,ch,former,subd.a stats,ch.notably,however,the shifts did not require payments to come specifically from tax increment rather,they provided,in language the legislature copied from year to year to make the allocation required by this section,an agency may use any funds that are legally available and not legally obligated for other uses,including,but not limited to,reserve funds,proceeds of land sales,proceeds of bonds or other indebtedness,lease revenues,interest,and other earned income,subd.b,italics added eraf legislation accord,subd.c,subd.c,subd.c,subd.c,subd.b same language in,and eraf legislation former,subd.c stats,ch,same language in eraf legislation former,subd.c stats,ch,same language in and eraf legislation see los angeles unified school dist.county of los angeles,supra,th at fn,d.thus,although eraf remittances were calculated as a portion of redevelopment agency tax increment,the legislature was not particular about the source of funds actually used to make the payments.
nor was the legislature concerned with whether it was the redevelopment agencies or their community sponsors that actually made the payments.beginning with the fiscal year eraf legislation,the legislature included in each annual measure a provision allowing city councils and county boards of supervisors to agree to make the payments on behalf of their redevelopment agencies,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a,subds.a,b see,budget fiscal revenue,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,the eraf legislation a llows any sponsor city or county to pay their rda eraf contribution in lieu of the rda.here,too,the legislature did not specify the source of the funds to be used a legislative body could apply any funds that are legally available for this purpose,subd.b,subd.b,subd.b,subd.c see,budget fiscal revenue,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.
as enacted in the years preceding proposition,then,state eraf legislation had at least two consistent and defining features each payment was calculated in proportion to the amount of net and gross tax increment received by a redevelopment agency,operating in effect as a levy on the receipt of tax increment funds,and the legislation was indifferent as to the actual source of payment,be it from the tax increment itself,other assets a redevelopment agency might have,or any available funds a community sponsor might have.
this indifference made a certain practical sense.redevelopment agencies and their community sponsors are conjoined to the extent that,in virtually all instances,the same individuals constitute both the redevelopment agency governing board and the city council or county board of supervisors that created the agency.the legislature had no particular reason to care where eraf payments might come from,and no reason to preclude local governments and redevelopment agencies from deciding in a given year whether the agency or its community sponsor might be better positioned to make payment.
this,then,was the historical context in which the backers of proposition drafted article xiii,section,subdivision a of the state constitution.proposition passage in curtailed eraf shifts aimed at cities and counties,but redevelopment agencies remained subject to them.consequently,proposition was drafted with the specific intent of ending further eraf shifts of the sort previously imposed on the agencies,and restricting the state ability to demand back,for schools or other state purposes,a percentage of the money county auditors allocated to redevelopment agencies.section of proposition identified among the past practices targeted by the initiative constitutional amendments eraf shifts from redevelopment agencies to schools,subd.d see also voter information guide,legis.analyst analysis of.section of the initiative declared the intent to end such shifts,subd.g,see also,voter information guide,legis.analyst analysis of,reduces state authority.this measure prohibits the state from enacting new laws that require redevelopment agencies to shift funds to schools or other agencies.
the text of proposition mandates that t he provisions of this act shall be liberally construed in order to effectuate its purposes.accordingly,we must interpret article xiii,section,subdivision a of the state constitution in light of the declared intent to end further shifts.clearly the drafters meant the provision to be at least broad enough to foreclose eraf legislation of the sort previously enacted,or else the new constitutional protection would amount to an empty gesture,as the legislature could continue to enact the same legislation.as the voters were explicitly apprised of this intent in both the legislative analyst analysis of the initiative and in the initiative text,they can be regarded as having approved a constitutional prohibition against eraf shifts like those enacted before.
given the directive that we adopt a liberal construction as necessary to ensure the purposes of proposition are carried out,it follows that the constitutional prohibition against directly or indirectly requiring transfers of tax increment cal,art.xiii,subd.a must extend to legislation that imposes a levy on the receipt of tax increment funds,even if the legislation does not specify that payment must come directly from the redevelopment agency or from its tax increment funds.the prohibition against even indirect transfers must reasonably be read to extend to legislation that,like the eraf shifts proposition was intended to prohibit,gives redevelopment agencies and their community sponsors latitude to decide the source of any payment.
assembly bill is such legislation.like all prior eraf legislation,it operates as a levy on the receipt of tax increment funds.that is,for each dollar a redevelopment agency receives,a set percentage must be paid back into eraf.see calculating continuation payment as a fraction of the net and gross tax increment each redevelopment agency receives.in,the levy rate is roughly percent billion out of billion in tax increment in future years,it is substantially lower million out of billion equates to percent.
that assembly bill allows payment to come either from community sponsors,subd.a,or from redevelopment agencies pursuant to reimbursement agreements,does not distinguish it from past eraf legislation.nor does the leeway assembly bill grants redevelopment agencies and community sponsors to decide the source from which to make payments diminish the payments character as a levy on tax increment funds.reasoning by analogy,income tax is income tax,even if a taxpayer may pay the government out of nonincome assets rather than directly return a portion of his or her income so too,section is a levy on the receipt of tax increment for the benefit of the state subdivisions,whether the levy is paid directly out of the tax increment the redevelopment agency receives,or indirectly out of other assets it or its community sponsor may possess.the source of payment is a distinction without a difference in light of the legislature historic indifference to eraf payment sources and proposition broad prohibition on even direct or indirect transfers 
as construed by the dissent,however,proposition would prohibit only funding schemes the legislature has not employed for nearly a decade,while permitting the very schemes its adoption history plainly demonstrates the initiative was intended to prohibit.the dissent identifies as the saving grace of assembly bill the provision allowing community sponsors to make continuation payments.conc.dis,post,at,d see.but every eraf scheme since has included that feature.ante,at,d consequently,every such eraf scheme would,under the dissent construction,remain valid in its entirety even after proposition and the legislature could simply have reenacted without change scheme such an interpretation can not be squared with the available evidence of the drafters and voters intent,which was to prohibit these modern raids.see voter information guide,legis.analyst analysis of,singling out recent eraf shifts as the sort of raid on tax increment was intended to foreclose,subd.d,same.
the dissent justifies this rejection of expressed intent by relying on the grammar and syntax of proposition.conc.dis,post,at,d.however,t he rules of grammar and canons of construction are but tools,guides to help courts determine likely legislative intent.citations.and that intent is critical.those who write statutes seek to solve human problems.fidelity to their aims requires us to approach an interpretive problem not as if it were a purely logical game,like a rubik cube,but as an effort to divine the human intent that underlies the statute.burris superior court cal th,d.grammar and syntax thus are a means of gleaning intent,not a basis for preventing its effectuation.where,as here,ballot materials clearly demonstrate the drafters and voters intent,syntax is not dispositive.
moreover,nothing in the grammar of article xiii,section,subdivision a of the state constitution precludes giving the provision its intended effect.a required indirect transfer of tax increment by a redevelopment agency may include circumstances where the redevelopment agency,governed by the same people as its community sponsor see ante,fn,d,must persuade that sponsor to pay,with or without reimbursement,a specified percentage of the tax increment the agency receives as the price for that receipt.
in her briefing,matosantos does not focus on whether assembly bill involves direct or indirect payments of tax increment funds,but instead on the argument that assembly bill does not r equire payment within the meaning of article xiii,section,subdivision a she acknowledges that proposition forbids the legislature from directly requiring payment to special districts and school districts on the state behalf.she contends,however,that the payments provided for under assembly bill are not required but are voluntary and constitutional,because the measure affords local governments an option between payment and dissolution.
this is indeed the way in which assembly bill is most distinct from the past eraf legislation proposition specifically targeted.effectively,however,the difference is only a change in the sanction for nonpayment.before,nonpayment resulted in a range of limitations on a redevelopment agency operations see,subd.e,subd.e now,it will result in dissolution.
this is another distinction without a difference.assembly bill on its face imposes not an optional condition but an absolute requirement going forward,every redevelopment agency must have its community sponsor annually pay the portion of its tax increment assessed by the state under assembly bill.cities and counties operating redevelopment agencies,whether agencies that existed before assembly bill or agencies they establish for the first time to address new blight,must pay without exception in this and every future year.see.a condition that must be satisfied in order for any redevelopment agency to operate is not an option but a requirement such absolute requirements proposition forbids.see cal,art.xiii,subd.a a.
the association argues that this conclusion is sufficient to invalidate not only assembly bill,but also the dissolution provisions of assembly bill.not necessarily.how broadly the taint of the invalid exercise of legislative power extends is a question of severability.see,sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma cal d,preserving the state bailout of local governments notwithstanding an unconstitutional condition placed on that bailout because the one could be severed from the other.accordingly,we turn to an analysis of severability and the impact of the invalid continuation payment program assem.bill,health,div,pt.on the remaining provisions of assembly bill and on assembly bill.
severability 
we conclude assembly bill is invalid in its entirety,while assembly bill may be severed and enforced independently.
in determining whether the invalid portions of a statute can be severed,we look first to any severability clause.the presence of such a clause establishes a presumption in favor of severance.santa barbara sch.dist.superior court cal d,although not conclusive,a severability clause normally calls for sustaining the valid part of the enactment.we will,however,consider three additional criteria t he invalid provision must be grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d.grammatical separability,also known as mechanical separability,depends on whether the invalid parts can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording or coherence of what remains.id.at,see also santa barbara,at.functional separability depends on whether the remainder of the statute is complete in itself sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d at.volitional separability depends on whether the remainder would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.santa barbara,at,accord,gerken fair political practices com.cal th,d.
with respect to the portions of assembly bill apart from the section continuation payment program,the legislature in section included a nonseverability clause if section of this act,or the application thereof,is held invalid in a court of competent jurisdiction,the remaining provisions of this act are not severable and shall not be given,or otherwise have,any force or effect.assem.bill.such a clause conclusively negates the possibility of volitional separability the legislature would not have enacted the rest of assembly bill without the invalid section.accordingly,the remaining provisions of assembly bill can not be severed and are unenforceable as well.
in direct contrast,the legislature in section of assembly bill expressed in a severability clause its intent to preserve assembly bill the provisions of section of this act assem.bill are distinct and severable from the provisions of part commencing with section and part commencing with section of division of the health and safety code enacted by assem.bill and those provisions shall continue in effect if any of the provisions of this act are held invalid.assem.bill.grammatically and mechanically,assembly bill can be separated from assembly bill it was passed as a distinct measure and is codified in a different portion of the health and safety code.functionally as well,it is separate the freeze pt.and dissolution pt.procedures can be implemented whether or not the continuation payment program pt.is valid.indeed,invalidating pt.alone would produce a result no different than if each redevelopment agency and sponsoring local government entity had elected not to make payments and had instead chosen to dissolve.
the association concedes grammatical separability but contends assembly bills and are neither functionally nor volitionally separable.as to functional separability,the association posits that the legislature likely expected assembly bill to be upheld and assembly bill thus to come into play only for those redevelopment agencies that elected to dissolve.speculation as to what the legislature may have expected is immaterial here the issue under this prong is simply whether assembly bill is complete in itself such that it can be enforced notwithstanding assembly bill invalidity.assembly bill outlines an independent mechanism for redevelopment agency dissolution that does not depend in any way on assembly bill.
alternatively,the association identifies a small handful of provisions in assembly bill that are meaningful only if assembly bill is valid.see,subd.a permitting communities to create new redevelopment agencies provided they make assem.bill continuation payments,subd.a governing redevelopment agencies that fail to keep up with continuation payments.the provision allowing communities to establish new redevelopment agencies subject to continuation payments under assembly bill is invalid for precisely the same reasons applicable generally to assembly bill.its invalidity does not,however,affect the rest of assembly bill,as the provision is grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable from the rest of assembly bill.see assem.bill,providing for internal severability for assem.bill.those provisions applicable only to redevelopment agencies that start but then cease continuation payments are not invalid,but are simply irrelevant in light of assembly bill invalidity,no redevelopment agency will ever become subject to them.neither set of provisions impairs assembly bill functional separability.
as for volitional separability,the association points to evidence that the legislature rejected governor brown proposal simply to end redevelopment agencies in favor of the package it ultimately passed.the association further quotes statements from various individual legislators during the june,floor debates suggesting they viewed assembly bills and as a package deal remarks of steinberg remarks of assemblyman blumenfield and preferred to mend redevelopment rather than end it remarks of hancock.
we may accept that the legislature treated assembly bills and as a package,and accept as that the legislature preferred dissolution with an option to buy a reprieve over dissolution without any such option after all,it passed assembly bill in addition to assembly bill,when it could have opted for some variation of governor brown outright dissolution proposal.we need not further consider what weight,if any,to accord the statements of individual legislators because this evidence goes to answering the wrong question.the issue,when assessing volitional separability,is not whether a legislative body would have preferred the whole to the part surely it would have,and the legislative history the association points to tells us no more than that.instead,the issue is whether a legislative body,knowing that only part of its enactment would be valid,would have preferred that part to nothing,or would instead have declined to enact the valid without the invalid.see,gerken fair political practices,supra,cal th at,d,calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at,sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma,supra,cal d at.
as to that question,the interstatutory severability clause the legislature enacted is conclusive.see assem.bill.it is no generic severability clause,providing nonspecifically that if any provision of a measure is invalidated the remaining portions of an act should remain in force,subd.b.rather,it deals with the precise severability question we face whether,if section of assembly bill were to be invalidated,the legislature would have wanted the provisions of assembly bill to remain in force.the interstatutory severability clause answers that question unequivocally in the affirmative assembly bill,section is severable from assembly bill,and the legislature intended the freeze and dissolution provisions to continue in effect notwithstanding the invalidation of the continuation payment program.assem.bill,see also assem.budget,conc.in,analysis of assem.bill.as amended june,highlighting that while most provisions of assem.bill were not severable,the bill was severable from assem.bill,which eliminates redevelopment.thus,if provisions of this bill are found invalid,the provisions of the first bill could remain in effect.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill.as amended june,same.accordingly,whatever individual legislators may have said at one point or another,what the legislature actually did establishes it would have passed assembly bill irrespective of the passage of assembly bill,and that assembly bill is volitionally separable.consequently,it is severable.
we summarize our conclusions concerning the constitutional landscape.the legislature,pursuant to its plenary power to establish or dissolve local agencies and subdivisions as it sees fit,may,but need not,authorize redevelopment agencies.cal,art.iv.if it does choose to authorize such agencies,it may,but need not,authorize their receipt of property tax increment,art.xvi.however,if it authorizes such agencies and,moreover,authorizes their receipt of tax increment,it may not thereafter require that such allocated tax increment be remitted for the benefit of schools or other local agencies,art.xiii,subd.a a.assembly bill respects these narrow limits on the legislature power assembly bill does not.
e.the future implementation of assembly bill 
when we accepted jurisdiction over the association petition,we stayed implementation of the provisions of part of division of the health and safety code.numerous critical deadlines contained in that part have passed and can no longer be met.see,subd.a all provisions in pt.are operative on,unless otherwise specified,subd.a dissolving redevelopment agencies,creating successor agencies,subd.b transferring redevelopment agency assets to successor agencies,subd.l a requiring successor agency to prepare a draft obligation payment schedule by.
this impossibility ought not to prevent the legislature valid enactment from taking effect.as matosantos urges,and the association does not contest,we have the power to reform a statute so as to effectuate the legislature intent where the statute would otherwise be invalid.kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d.here,the problem is not invalidity but impossibility the need,recognized by both sides,to put to rest constitutional questions concerning these measures,when combined with a stay issued to preserve the court jurisdiction to issue meaningful relief,has rendered it impossible for the parties and others affected to comply with the legislation literal terms.by exercising the power of reform,however,we may as closely as possible effectuate the legislature intent and allow its valid enactment to have its intended effect.reformation is proper when it is feasible to do so in a manner that carries out those policy choices clearly expressed in the original legislation,and when the legislative body would have preferred reform to ineffectuality.id.at,d.we think it clear that the legislature would have preferred assembly bill to take effect on a delayed basis,rather than not at all,and the timeline provided for in assembly bill can be reformed in a fashion that cleaves sufficiently to legislative intent.
in recognition of the eventuality that upholding any part of assembly bill or would require us to address the impact of our stay on their statutory deadlines,we solicited input from the parties as to appropriate new deadlines.because we have invalidated assembly bill,we need consider only the extent to which deadlines in part must be extended to account for the stay,while taking effect as promptly as the legislature intended.
the parties proposals involve elaborate schedules shifting each deadline in part by a varying number of days.we decline to adopt any of the proposed schedules,whose implementation would overly complicate future compliance.instead,we note that our stay of part has been in place for four months and has delayed operation of that part of assembly bill by a like amount.by reforming assembly bill to extend each of its deadlines by the duration of our stay,we retain the relative spacing of events originally intended by the legislature and simplify compliance for all affected parties.
accordingly,we exercise our power of reformation and revise each effective date or deadline for performance of an obligation in part of division of the health and safety code arising before may,to take effect four months later by way of example,under section,subdivision a,all provisions in part were to be operative on october,unless otherwise specified our reformation makes them operative on february.the draft obligation payment schedules due on november,under section,subdivision l a,are now due march,successorship agency board membership,required to be determined by january,subd.a,must be complete by may.similar reformations apply to all other imminent obligations throughout part.in contrast,no reformation is needed for future obligations to be carried out in subsequent fiscal years,subds.j l provisions for successorship agency boards in and later,subd.c ongoing county obligation to prepare estimates of allocations and distributions every and may.
where a provision imposes obligations in both this and subsequent fiscal years,we reform the provision only as it relates to obligations arising before may.thus,for example,section requires certain calculations from county by january,and june,for this fiscal year,and on january and june in subsequent years,subd.a.we reform the january,deadline by extending it to may,and leave the remaining deadlines unchanged.likewise,section provides for distributions on each january and june we reform the first distribution deadline by extending it to may,and leave all subsequent deadlines unchanged,so that future distributions may occur on the schedule,and in the same fiscal year,originally contemplated by the legislature.
iii.disposition 
for the foregoing reasons,we discharge the order to show cause,deny the association petition for a peremptory writ of mandate with respect to assembly bill,except for health and safety code section,subdivision a,and grant its petition with respect to assembly bill.we direct issuance of a peremptory writ compelling the state director of finance and state controller not to implement health and safety code sections,subdivision a and.we extend all statutory deadlines contained in health and safety code,division,part and arising before may,by four months.given the urgency of the matters addressed by the association petition,our judgment is final forthwith.see,senate of the state of cal.jones cal th,d.
concurring dissenting opinion 
i concur in parts,and.of the majority opinion,but respectfully dissent from the remainder of the opinion concerning the constitutionality of assembly bill the majority concludes that assembly bill is unconstitutional because it violates article xiii,section,subdivision a a of the california constitution added by,approved by voters.i part with the majority on this point because,although it may be possible that assembly bill may cause some community to utilize funds otherwise protected by proposition,petitioners have not met their burden of supporting this contention.in fact,they provide documentation that suggests quite the opposite.moreover,on its face,nothing in assembly bill compels community sponsors to violate proposition.ultimately,the majority conclusion rests on an impermissibly broad reading of proposition plain language,on unsupported assumptions concerning the intent behind proposition,and on speculation that constitutional problems could result from the implementation of assembly bill.in doing so,the majority does not apply rules of statutory and constitutional construction.
facial challenges and the rules of statutory and constitutional construction 
i first address the applicable rules concerning petitioners facial challenge of assembly bill and the interpretative framework governing challenges to the constitutionality of the statutes enacted by this bill.
facial challenges versus as applied challenges 
generally,a facial challenge to the constitutionality of legislation considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.in contrast,an as applied challenge to the constitutionality of legislation involves an otherwise facially valid measure that has been applied in a constitutionally impermissible manner.this type of challenge contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the measure has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right.ibid.
petitioner california redevelopment association concedes that it is making a facial challenge to assembly bill a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.united states salerno,d.the circumstance that an act might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid under a facial challenge.ibid.
petitioners burden under a facial challenge 
in describing petitioners burden,we have sometimes articulated differing standards.under the strictest standard,t o support a determination of facial unconstitutionality,voiding the statute as a whole,petitioners can not prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute rather,petitioners must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.arcadia unified school dist.state of education cal th,d,quoting pacific legal foundation brown cal d.under the more lenient standard,petitioners need only demonstrate that the measure conflicts with the constitution in the generality or great majority of cases.citations.guardianship of ann cal th,d.
it is unclear which standard the majority employs,but,as i will explain,i believe petitioners have not met their burden under either standard concerning the alleged unconstitutionality of the statutes enacted by assembly bill.
c.the applicable interpretative rules of constitutional and statutory construction 
in assessing the merits of petitioners facial challenge,we are governed by a specific interpretative framework that constrains how we must view the interaction between the statutes enacted by assembly bill and proposition.
as the majority notes,proposition,which added subdivision a a to section of article xiii of the california constitution,limits what the legislature may do with respect to redevelopment agency tax increment funds.respondent matosantos correctly argues that proposition imposes a constitutionally based limitation on the powers of the legislature,and we must construe such limits strictly.white davis cal th,d,pacific legal foundation,supra,cal d at.this strict construction of the constitutional limits on legislative power is required because we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the legislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited.citation.white davis,supra,at,d,quoting methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d.given that legislative power is practically absolute,any constitutional limitations on this power are strictly construed and may not be given effect as against the general power of the legislature unless such limitations clearly inhibit the act in question.amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d,amwest.accordingly,in the face of a constitutionally based limitation on its power,i f there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.white davis,supra,at,d,quoting methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,at.
furthermore,although t he judiciary traditional role of interpreting ambiguous statutory language or filling in the gaps of statutory schemes is as applicable to initiative measures as it is to measures adopted by the legislature,we have warned that the initiative power is strongest when courts give effect to the voters formally expressed intent,without speculating about how they might have felt concerning subjects on which they were not asked to vote.ross ragingwire telecommunications,cal th,d,quoting evangelatos superior court cal d.therefore,unless the text is ambiguous and supports multiple interpretations,our court must rely upon the text as the first and best indicator of intent.kwikset superior court cal th,d.even a command that a constitutional provision or a statute be liberally construed does not license either enlargement or restriction of its evident meaning because unambiguous language requires no need for engaging in liberal construction apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,d,quoting people cruz cal d.
as for our interpretation of the statutes enacted by assembly bill,we presume the constitutionality of a legislative act,resolving all doubts in its favor,and we must uphold it unless a conflict with a provision of the state or federal constitution is clear and unquestionable.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.this presumption is particularly appropriate when,as here,the statute represents a considered legislative judgment as to the appropriate reach of the constitutional provision.pacific legal foundation brown,supra,cal d at,see legis.analyst,the budget should california end redevelopment agencies,warning the legislature that and other measures limit the state authority to shift property taxes redirect tax increment revenues and that d rafting a plan for local governments to carefully unwind their redevelopment programs and successfully navigate the many legal,administrative,and financial factors will be complex.
from these principles,i conclude that our analysis must begin with the presumption that assembly bill is constitutionally valid unless it conflicts with the state constitution in a clear and unquestionable manner.because proposition restricts the legislature power,it must be strictly construed.but even though proposition contains a demand that it be liberally construed,as with any statute,we can not give proposition an interpretation beyond its formally expressed intent if its language is clear.
ii.interpreting proposition 
i conclude that,even assuming the circumstances most favorable to petitioners applying the more lenient standard for facial challenges and broadly construing proposition petitioners have failed to sustain their burden to show that assembly bill is unconstitutional.
proposition and assembly bill generally 
proposition prohibits the legislature from requiring a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,taxes on ad valorem real property and tangible personal property allocated to the agency pursuant to section of article xvi,its tax increment funds.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a.given the rules of interpretation described ante,it is important to note what,exactly,this constitutional provision expressly prohibits the legislature can not require a redevelopment agency to directly or indirectly reallocate its tax increment funds.
in contrast,assembly bill does not require or compel any redevelopment agency to make any payment.it specifically provides that the community sponsor,whether it be a city,county,or other local government entity,may use any available funds not otherwise obligated for other uses to make a payment.health,subd.a.the payments required by assembly bill to establish or continue redevelopment agencies are to be made by community sponsors,not redevelopment agencies.although assembly bill,through the enactment of section,permits a community sponsor to enter into an agreement with its redevelopment agency to use its tax increment to fund the payment,such agreements are not compelled or required by assembly bill moreover,nothing in assembly bill requires that a redevelopment agency tax increment be reallocated,either directly or indirectly,to satisfy the payments.instead,the measure is neutral as to the source of funds for the assembly bill payments 
b.the applicable language of proposition does not require a liberal construction 
the majority asserts that california constitution article xiii,section,subdivision a as added by is ambiguous,thereby requiring an examination of its history to ascertain its intended meaning.the majority identifies as ambiguous proposition use of the words indirectly and directly,especially in view of prior statutory shifts involving eraf pursuant to which the legislature diverted redevelopment agency tax increment revenue to fund schools.
the majority notes that a distinct provision in each of those prior eraf shifts,going back to,allowed the shift to be funded in a and manner and without necessarily using tax increment funds.for instance,in the legislation enacting the last eraf shift,which directly led to proposition placement on the november ballot,the legislature included statute that did not require the eraf shift payment to come specifically from tax increment funds,but instead provided that in order t o make the allocation required by this section,an agency may use any funds that are legally available and not legally obligated for other uses,including,but not limited to,reserve funds,proceeds of land sales,proceeds of bonds or other indebtedness,lease revenues,interest,and other earned income.health,subd.b,italics added.it also included a statute that allowed a local legislative body,in lieu of the redevelopment agency,to make the eraf payments from any funds that are legally available for this purpose.health,subd.c,italics added.accordingly,the majority reasons that proposition language,prohibiting the direct or indirect transfer of tax increment funds,is specifically intended to stop the kind of payments described by assembly bill.
however,proposition plain language simply does not prohibit the kind of payments described by assembly bill.
proposition prohibits the legislature from requiring a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a,italics added.as previously described,however,the assembly bill payments must be made by community sponsors,not redevelopment agencies.nothing in assembly bill requires a redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds.if proposition intended to prohibit the payments described by assembly bill,it could have been written to prohibit the legislature from requiring a local government body or community sponsor to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds.but it was not drafted that way.
additionally,nothing in proposition restricts the legislature from using tax increment funds as the basis for a particular calculation.certainly,assembly bill uses the size of tax increment funds as a yardstick or,as the majority characterizes it a levy,to determine the size of the described payments,but such use is not prohibited by proposition plain language.
pointedly,the word levy appears nowhere in proposition.instead,the drafters of proposition listed a very specific catalog of actions,prohibiting the legislature from requiring a redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer its tax increment funds.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a,italics added.w hen a statute contains a list or catalogue of items,a court should determine the meaning of each by reference to the others,giving preference to an interpretation that uniformly treats items similar in nature and scope.citations.in accordance with this principle of construction,a court will adopt a restrictive meaning of a listed item if acceptance of a more expansive meaning would make other items in the list unnecessary or redundant,or would otherwise make the item markedly dissimilar to the other items in the list.citations.commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,d,quoting moore california state bd.of accountancy cal th,d.placing aside the problem that the list of verbs applies only to redevelopment agencies,expansively reading the word levy into the list of prohibited actions would conflict with the other words in the list describing actions that otherwise transfer tax increment funds,making the remaining words unnecessary or redundant.if proposition truly intended to prevent the legislature from using tax increment funds as the basis for calculating certain payments or as the basis of a levy,it could have been written to prohibit the legislature from requiring a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds or to levy such revenues or use them as the basis for certain remittances.but again,it was not drafted that way.
c.a liberal construction of proposition does not render assembly bill facially unconstitutional 
even if proposition use of the words directly or indirectly is ambiguous and raises colorable questions of whether proposition might apply to community sponsors or whether it might prohibit the use of tax increment funds as a yardstick or levy,i still can not agree with the majority conclusion that assembly bill is unconstitutional.
a broad construction of the word indirectly 
the express obligation to make the payments to establish or continue redevelopment agencies rests on community sponsors,and not on redevelopment agencies themselves and assembly bill does not expressly compel the use of tax increment funds to make the assembly bill payments.however,the majority relies on the history of prior eraf legislation and apparently infers that proposition intended its use of the word indirectly to cover the entire scenario posed by the assembly bill payments.but a careful dissection of the eraf legislation,much of which was the immediate trigger for proposition,illustrates why this reasoning is erroneous.
as relevant here,the eraf shift legislation covered two fiscal years and was comprised of four different statutes.assem.bill.enacted as stats,ch,for fiscal year,for fiscal year,and.a review of the first three of these statutes reveals that the legislature clearly targeted redevelopment agencies and their tax increments as the funding source for the eraf shifts.but the fourth statute,section,was a,provision that,unlike the other three statutes,expressed a stance as to the money used to fund the eraf shifts.as i will explain,no liberal construction of proposition can stretch to prohibit similar provisions enacted by assembly bill.
the first two statutes specify that a redevelopment agency shall remit the eraf shifts,and that payments were to be based directly on a proportion of the redevelopment agency net tax increment,subd.a,subd.a,italics added.both statutes state that the eraf remittance for each fiscal year is declared to be an indebtedness of the redevelopment project to which they relate,payable from tax increment funds,subd.e,subd.e.each statute also states,however,that the redevelopment agency could make the payment by using any of the redevelopment agency other available revenue sources,subd.b,subd.b.each further declares,i t is the intent of the legislature,in enacting this section,that these allocations directly or indirectly assist in the financing or refinancing,in whole or in part,of the community redevelopment project pursuant to section of article xvi of the california constitution,subd.f,subd.f,italics added.
under both the plain language of proposition and a liberal construction of its use of the word indirectly,the legislature is clearly prohibited from enacting future legislation identical to these first two statutes.because these first two statutes,sections and,compelled redevelopment agencies to make the eraf remittances and defined the revenue shifts,whether from tax increment funding or other available revenue,as part of the redevelopment agency indebtedness,payable from tax increment funds,the drafters of proposition responded by including language that would prohibit the legislature from enacting future legislation requiring a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a,italics added.
to the extent that sections and also provide that the redevelopment agency could make the eraf remittances by using any of the agency other revenue sources not related to tax increment funds,a liberal construction of proposition also would forbid similar measures in the future.although a redevelopment agency use of otherwise available,revenue can not be a compelled direct remittance of its tax increment funds,such use may constitute an indirect remittance of its tax increment funds by imposing an additional,immediate financial obligation on the redevelopment agency otherwise fixed budget.thus,the provisions in these first two statutes allowing the eraf remittance to be funded by other redevelopment agency revenue would be prohibited by proposition because such a provision would require a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a,italics added.
a third statute from the eraf legislation allows a redevelopment agency to make partial eraf remittances if its existing indebtedness made it impossible for the agency to fund the entire eraf shift.existing indebtedness is defined in this section as a financial obligation incurred by the redevelopment agency that required the payment of which is to be made in whole or in part,directly or indirectly,out of tax increment funds,subd.a,italics added.this section contains a provision allowing the redevelopment agency to obtain a loan from its local government for the eraf payment,but it also specifies that this loan becomes part of the agency indebtedness that shall be payable from tax revenues apportioned to the agency pursuant to section,tax increment funds,and any other funds received by the agency,subd.d,italics added.
again,both the plain language of proposition and a liberal construction of it would prohibit this kind of statute in the future.the loan anticipated by section must be directly tied into a redevelopment agency tax increment funds,and the loan also is indirectly tied to tax increment funding by virtue of continued reliance on other funds received by the agency,subd.d.pointedly,proposition mirrors the same directly or indirectly language used by section,subdivision a.a future version of this third statute,therefore,would be prohibited under proposition because it would require a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,its tax increment funds.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a,italics added.
finally,a fourth statute from the eraf legislation is markedly different from its sister statutes.this fourth statute contains a phrase allowing a local legislative body to make the eraf remittances on behalf of the redevelopment agency using any funds that are legally available for this purpose,subd.c.the statute revenue source is neutral and allows payment with no strings attached,in the sense that it contains no provision,unlike section,subdivision d,that converts the payment into an redevelopment agency debt that is payable,either directly or indirectly,through its tax increment funds.to use the majority terminology,this fourth statute acts as a kind of levy on tax increment funds that can be paid by a local government body using any available revenue source.
here,i expose the achilles heel of the majority reasoning concerning the unconstitutionality of assembly bill.proposition plain language simply says nothing about the yardstick or levy scenario posed by this fourth statute in section.the language of proposition constrains the legislature from requiring a community redevelopment agency from making certain allocations of its tax increment,either directly or indirectly.cal,art.xiii,subd.a a.proposition does not address a local legislative body nor does it address in any respect the use of otherwise unrelated local revenue to pay a levy on tax increment funds.
even a liberal construction of proposition yields no different conclusion.the only possible ambiguity in the relevant language concerns the use of the word indirectly,but that word is bound to the otherwise precise transitive verbs,pay,remit,loan,and transfer,all of which are bound to the subject,a community redevelopment agency,and the constitutionally protected object,tax increment funds.simple rules of grammar,therefore,necessarily limit how liberally we may construe the word indirectly,busching superior court cal d,ordinary rules of grammar normally must be applied unless they lead to an absurd result.therefore,the word indirectly in plain language prohibits any compulsion being placed on a redevelopment agency to make certain reallocations not levies of its tax increment funds but not other sources of local revenue.
as petitioner california redevelopment association conceded at oral argument,there are several sources of local revenues not protected by either proposition or proposition,including,among other things,rental income,lease income,interest income,sales of assets,sales of bonds,investment income,and fines,fees,and penalties.given that such revenues bear no relation to any financing received by a redevelopment agency,it seems impossible to conclude on a facial challenge,as the majority does,that assembly bill payments funded by these revenues could ever cause a redevelopment agency to indirectly transfer tax increment funds already allocated to it.
certainly,as previously described,a liberal construction of the word indirectly can be applied to prohibit the first three statutes of the eraf legislation because they each contained mandates directed at redevelopment agencies and either directly targeted agencies tax increment funds or indirectly targeted their tax increment funds by assigning the eraf shift as indebtedness payable from the redevelopment agency revenue sources.sections through express the premise that the eraf remittances must come from the redevelopment agency,and,to the extent they do not,the nonpayment becomes part of the redevelopment agency debt.in fact,the legislation specifically defines a redevelopment agency preexisting debt as redevelopment agency payments that have to be made,directly or indirectly,out of tax increment funds.further,the eraf legislation asserts that the eraf remittances were intended to directly or indirectly further redevelopment projects within the meaning of article xvi of the constitution.accordingly,article xvi,section,subdivision a a of the constitution,as enacted by proposition,is completely responsive to the circumstances contemplated by sections through by prohibiting the legislature from requiring a community redevelopment agency to pay,remit,loan,or otherwise transfer,directly or indirectly,taxes on ad valorem real property and tangible personal property allocated to the agency pursuant to section of article xvi,its tax increment funds.
but the fourth statute section poses an entirely different scenario,one that does not require a redevelopment agency to do anything,let alone require it to reallocate its tax increment funds,either directly or indirectly.it contemplates a situation not addressed by proposition,even under a broad construction of that measure.nevertheless,simply because section has an analog in assembly bill in the form of section.l the majority hastily concludes that pro
