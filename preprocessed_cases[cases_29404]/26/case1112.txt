edward burlbaw and donald bustamante relators challenge the district court grant of summary judgment on their claims under the false claims act fca.relators alleged that defendants,past and present administrators of new mexico state university nmsu,falsely certified that nmsu was a minority institution eligible for department of defense dod contract grants.after concluding that qualified immunity was a viable defense under the fca,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants under the first prong of the qualified immunity test.see united states ex rel.burlbaw orenduff,d.the district court held that relators failed to put forward evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that defendants violated the fca.
defendants timely filed a,but expressly conditioned their request for relief on our resolution of relators appeal.specifically,defendants have taken the position that if we affirm the district court rulings against relators and in their favor,there is no need for us to resolve the issues presented in their appeal they challenge the district court decision to permit relators to amend their complaint to bring claims against defendants in their individual capacity.defendants first argue that,pursuant to the logic of vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,d,state officials are not persons within the meaning of a of the fca.defendants further contend that the eleventh amendment bars these particular claims,since nmsu is the real party in interest.
we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on relators fca claims.like the district court,we hold that relators failed to introduce sufficient evidence for a jury to find that any defendant knowingly misrepresented nmsu eligibility as a minority institution.our holding,however,is narrower than that of the district court.because no reasonable jury could find an fca violation,we need not decide whether qualified immunity functions as a defense.we also have no need to reach the scabrous issues presented in defendants conditional,such as whether state officials are persons within the meaning of the fca or whether the eleventh amendment bars the instant action against defendants in their individual capacity.
background 
nmsu created a division called the physical sciences laboratory psl.between and,nmsu,through the psl,applied for and obtained grants and contracts from the dod under its historically black colleges and institutions contract program dod program or program.
statutory and regulatory framework 
since,congress has instructed the dod to award of certain contracts to historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions,as the latter is defined in the higher education act of hea.see national defense authorization act for fiscal year,a,stat,originally appearing as note repealed and recodified as amended at by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year,a,h,stat.the standards of eligibility for the dod program have changed several times since.prior to,minority institutions were eligible for contracts if they met various requirements prescribed by the secretary of education soe for the strengthening institutions program under title iii of the hea.see note.under the standards,an educational institution qualified as a minority institution if it met the definition of eligible institution under b,which covered institutions that,inter alia,retained a enrollment of mexican american,puerto rican,cuban,or other hispanic students,or some combination thereof.id.in practice,the department of education doe provided the dod with lists of title institutions with a breakdown of minority enrollment data.
in november,congress strengthened the criteria for eligibility for the dod program.see national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,codified at a c.the amended statutory criteria redefined minority institutions according to.a c.it also grouped institutions,as defined by b,under the heading of minority institutions.id.
under this new criteria,an institution of higher education satisfied the definition of a minority institution if,inter alia,it possessed an enrollment of a single minority or a combination of minorities in excess of of the total enrollment.an institution was a institution hence a minority institution if,inter alia,it possessed an undergraduate enrollment of at least hispanic students not less than of its hispanic students were individuals who were college students and another of its hispanic students were either individuals or college students.id.b.
in october,congress broadened the eligibility requirements to qualify as a institution.see higher education amendments of,a,stat,originally codified at a.under the criteria,an institution qualified as a institution if,inter alia,its enrollment of undergraduate equivalent students was at least hispanic and it provided assurances that not less than of its hispanic students were individuals.a 
between and,the hea required the soe to verify status from enrollment data furnished by the institution to the doe.see recodified at.the dod regulatory scheme during this time continued to rely on the soe verification of status for dod program eligibility.the dod permitted applicants,prior to receiving an award under the program,to evidence their eligibility by showing that the secretary of education has determined the offeror to be a historically black college or university or minority institution.c.
factual history 
the dod assurances of nmsu eligibility 
prior to december,nmsu met the definition of a minority institution under the strengthening institutions program of title iii.the doe designated nmsu a minority institution under this criteria,thereby making nmsu eligible to apply for dod contracts.
in march,the dod sent the doe a request for a list of schools that meet the new minority institution criteria contained in section of,the fy dod authorization act,including institutions.app.at.the doe told the dod that it publishes a list of accredited minority institutions meeting this statutory criteria,b.id.at.the doe further explained that this list was the product of a census conducted by the doe office of civil rights,in collaboration with the national center for educational statistics,of all universities biannually in even numbered years.id.this list included nmsu.
on april,the dod sent nmsu a memorandum attaching the doe list.the dod memorandum stated that this list was effective immediately,and further authorized nmsu to distribute the list to the appropriate contracting activities.app.at.it also stated that an institution contending that they sic meet s the eligibility criteria but is not on the list,must contact the office of civil r ights with the department of education to obtain information on how to be included on the updated list.id.
in fact,despite the various changes in eligibility criteria,nmsu regularly appeared on the doe lists of minority institutions during the time period relevant to this litigation.for instance,in january,the dod sent nmsu a broad agency announcement of a grant for minority institutions.the announcement cited the statutory criteria for eligibility,including a c,and then stated that t he most recent lists of certified minority institutions which meet the above criteria are provided in appendix app.at.nmsu appeared in appendix a,on a list covering all united states department of education accredited postsecondary minority institutions.app.at.the announcement acknowledged that the list was compiled by the doe in accordance with,based upon data reported by the institutions through enrollment surveys.the announcement further stated that if an institution name did not appear in appendix a,its proposal for a would not be accepted.
in august,the dod solicited grant proposals from minority institutions,including nmsu.the solicitation confirmed that the doe maintains the list of accredited postsecondary institutions that currently meet the statutory criteria for identification as minority institutions.app.at.shortly thereafter,nmsu received the doe updated list for the year.again,nmsu appeared on the list.
in november,the dod sent a letter to the united states attorney for the district of new mexico.once more,the dod affirmed that it has used and continues to use the mi list provided by the department of education as the official list of institutions eligible to participate in the programs.app.at.the dod further affirmed that the list is based upon data submitted by responding institutions to the doe.id.at.
false certifications 
defendants in this action are current and former nmsu administrators between and,each of the defendants,with the exception of meyer signed various documents,including proposals,contracts,and solicitations from the dod,on behalf of nmsu.these documents certified that nmsu qualified for status under the dod program.such certifications,in turn,became the basis for contractual awards to nmsu under the program.
despite these certifications,relators introduced evidence at the summary judgment stage that nmsu may not have collected or maintained information about their hispanic students income levels or whether they were first generation college students.relators also introduced evidence to suggest that minority students did not constitute or more of nmsu undergraduate enrollment.
thus,drawing all inferences in favor of relators,as we must for purposes of reviewing the grant of summary judgment,see selenke med.imaging of,cir w e view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we resolve the issues in this case under the view that nmsu never met the statutory criteria for a minority institution under the dod program during the relevant time period and both the dod and the doe incorrectly identified nmsu as a minority institution under this criteria.
investigation and may,certification 
on april,a federal investigator from the army criminal investigation command cid,kirby rogers,met with birx,the director of the psl,and barbara pritchard,nmsu contract administrator.rogers informed birx and pritchard of the statutory criteria governing eligibility for qualifying as a minority institution under the dod program.rogers also emphasized the apparent difference between this statutory criteria and that used by the doe to furnish its lists.
in response,birx acknowledged that he learned through recent conversations with miriam meyer that nmsu has not tracked individuals hispanic who are first generation college students.app.at.and,according to rogers report,birx further admitted that the evidence presented to him raised significant doubts in his mind that nmsu correctly certified itself as a minority institution.id.
on may,less than two weeks after the meeting,pritchard sent a letter to a dod contracting officer certifying nmsu status as a minority institution.the may,letter averred that we were notified of the possible difference in eligibility criteria between the doe and the dod programs.app.at.pritchard then certified that nmsu has qualified for minority institution status under cfr chapter,part and cfr through and has been placed on the department of education list of title iii eligible institutions for fy.id.the certification did not identify or discuss the statutory provisions governing the definition of a minority institution for purposes of the dod program.
on february,the army procurement fraud division sent a letter to nmsu.it asserted that nmsu may have falsely certified itself as an mi.app.at.the letter further explained that,a ccording to cid investigation results,nmsu did not qualify as an mi under the above statutory criteria for the years.id.through this possibly fraudulent certification,nmsu received a grant from the dod army research office in the amount of.
nmsu contacted the doe for guidance.on august,peter mccabe,a representative of the doe office for civil rights,informed nmsu through email that it has been designated as a hispanic serving institution in the mino ri ty postsecondary institutions listing of the department of education.app.at.mccabe further confirmed that this listing was not subject to editing by other organizations.id.
procedural history 
on december,relators,former employees of the psl,filed a qui tam action against nmsu under the fca.the fca provides for liability for a ny person who,in various ways,knowingly presents a false or fraudulent claim to the united states.a.this liability may include up to treble damages.id.the rights of the united states under are enforceable through a qui tam action.id.b.
the complaint alleged that nmsu,through birx,his predecessors,and their designees,knowingly misrepresented nmsu eligibility as a minority institution to obtain dod contracts.relators served the complaint on the government under seal pursuant to b.during the government investigation of relators complaint,the supreme court decided stevens,which held that a state agency is not a person within the meaning of the fca.at.on july,the united states filed a notice of election to decline to intervene.relators filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on january,but failed to obtain the approval of the united states in accordance with b and later withdrew the notice of dismissal.
instead,relators filed a motion to amend their complaint to replace nmsu with the current defendants in their individual capacities and the psl,which was unsealed and served on defendants on march.defendants opposed relators motion to amend on futility grounds,arguing in part that a state officer,like a state agency,is not a person subject to suit under the fca and that the eleventh amendment bars a suit against state officers for performing conduct in the scope of their employment.
on may,the district court granted the motion to amend with respect to the individual defendants but denied the motion with respect to the psl.the district court found the psl,as a department of nmsu,to be an arm of the state.and,accordingly,it determined,inter alia,that relators lawsuit against the psl was barred by the eleventh amendment.however,the district court concluded that relators could sue defendants in their individual capacities under the fca,even though they acted in the scope of their employment and obtained no personal benefit from making the alleged false claims.
on may,in light of the first amended complaint and relators more definite statement,and subsequent to a brief period of discovery,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.on november,the district court granted summary judgment.first,the district court held that qualified immunity functions as a defense under the fca.second,applying this defense,the district court concluded that relators failed to produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could find an fca violation.
the district court divided relators fca claims into those arising prior to,and those arising after,april,when rogers met with birx and voiced his concerns about nmsu eligibility.with respect to the claims,the district court concluded that relators failed to introduce sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that any defendant engaged in a deliberate falsehood when certifying that nmsu qualified as an mi for purposes of dod contracting.d at.the district court then held that the only evidence in the summary judgment record of a certification after april,a may,letter to the dod,was not false,since it disclosed the possibility of a problem with nmsu prior mi certification and provided an accurate certification as to the regulations and list under which nmsu did qualify as an mi.id.at.
relators filed a timely notice of appeal on december.see fed.a a.defendants filed a timely on december.see fed.a.we exercise jurisdiction over both appeals pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
relators challenge two aspects of the district court order granting summary judgment.first,relators argue that the district court erred in recognizing the defense of qualified immunity for state officials who are sued in their individual capacity under the qui tam provisions of the fca.second,relators argue that the district court erred in holding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity under the first prong of this defense.relators contend that they introduced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that defendants knowingly misrepresented nmsu eligibility for the dod program.
defendants argues that the district court erred by permitting relators to amend their complaint to assert claims against defendants under the fca.defendants present two independent reasons for reversal state officials are not persons under a of the fca,based upon the logic of stevens and the eleventh amendment bars claims under the fca against state officials in their individual capacity where,as in this case,such claims are de facto is,the state,nmsu is the real defendant in interest defendants stress,however,that we only need to reach the merits of their in the event that we disturb the district court grant of summary judgment against relators.
we agree that relators failed to put forth sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that any defendant violated the fca.and because relators fca claims fail as a matter of law under a traditional summary judgment of whether qualified immunity operates as a viable defense under the leave that legal question,qualified immunity for another day.
w e may affirm the judgment of the district court on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court.oil means,cir see dubbs head start,cir the district court granted baker and strayhorn motions to dismiss based on qualified immunity grounds.however there is no need to reach the issue of qualified immunity because the nurses were objectively reasonable in believing that cap the defendant ultimately responsible for coordinating the medical examination at issue had obtained consent.gomes wood,cir affirming due process claim on the alternative ground of qualified immunity warner grand county,cir we affirm,but on the basis of qualified immunity rather than the common law.whether we analyze defendants motion under traditional summary judgment standards or under the standards unique to the qualified immunity context,the key issue remains the same whether the defendants acted with the requisite is,whether they acted knowingly in wrongly certifying nmsu eligibility for the dod program.the parties vigorously litigated that issue and there is an ample record for us to render a legal ruling on it,albeit under a different analytic framework than the district court 
thus,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants,but only on the ground that there is an absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to an fca violation and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.our resolution of relators appeal renders defendants defendants expressly conditioned on our reaching a result that would upset the district court rulings in their.consequently,we pass no judgment on the propriety of the district court analysis in ruling on relators motion to amend.
conditional eleventh amendment immunity 
before reaching the merits of relators appeal,we must address the propriety of declining to first resolve the eleventh amendment questions raised in defendants conditional.both the government as amicus curiae and the defendants contend that we only need address whether the eleventh amendment bars relators claims if and when we reach defendants conditional.
while q uestions of jurisdiction,of course,should be given priority,stevens,at,the supreme court,addressing the fca,recently declared appropriate the prior resolution of a statutory is,whether the statute itself permits the cause of action it creates to be asserted against states.id.at.in such a circumstance,there is no realistic possibility that addressing the statutory question will expand the court power beyond the limits that the jurisdictional restriction has imposed,and the statutory question is logically antecedent to the existence of the eleventh amendment question.id.quoting amchem,windsor,d choosing to first address the propriety of,because it was logically antecedent to the existence of any article iii issues.
however,the supreme court has not determined whether a federal court may reach a broader class of questions,beyond whether the statute text precludes invocation against a state,before resolving an assertion of immunity raised through a conditional.nor have we previously opined on the subject.we believe that,in such a unique procedural context,a federal court may address the question before reaching the eleventh amendment question.
we tackle this interesting procedural issue by first describing the relevant characteristics of the eleventh amendment and the immunity it offers eleventh amendment immunity doctrine is not easy to characterize.it shares features with affirmative defenses,while also containing traits more akin to jurisdiction.see fent.water res,cir.it is best understood according to its own unique identity,rather than through its similarities with other legal doctrines.in other words,the eleventh amendment occupies its own unique territory.floyd thompson,cir.
for purposes of our analysis,eleventh amendment immunity possesses three main features.first,it may be raised at any time,even on appeal for the first time.see,edelman jordan,d archuleta lacuesta,cir.second,like an affirmative defense,it may be waived by the affected party.see,idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d a state can waive its eleventh amendment protection and allow a federal court to hear and decide a case commenced or prosecuted against it.archuleta,at i t can be waived by the affected party.third,a court may raise the issue of immunity sua sponte but,unlike jurisdiction,it is not obligated to do so.see.dep t of corr.schacht,d nor need a court raise the defect on its own.nelson geringer,cir t he supreme court has stated that judicial consideration of eleventh amendment issues sua sponte is discretionary,not mandatory.the net effect of these characteristics is that a state defendant retains broad discretion over whether a court must hear an eleventh amendment argument that may end the litigation.as more succinctly stated by the supreme court,u nless the state raises the matter,a court can ignore it.schacht,at.
this is not a case in which the state defendant or those purportedly covered by the state immunity has directly asserted eleventh amendment immunity.if a state defendant had asserted it,addressing the threshold jurisdictional matter would be obligatory without such an assertion,we are not obligated to resolve the eleventh amendment issue.see fent,at o nce effectively asserted such immunity constitutes a bar to the exercise of federal subject matter jurisdiction.in filing their conditional,defendants have asked us expressly,as a first task,to resolve relators appeal.put differently,defendants have chosen not to assert eleventh amendment immunity unless we reverse the district court decision.see hartman duffey,wald,concurring noting that a conditional protects contingent interests of a party victorious before the district court under theory that as soon as the appellate court decides to modify the trial court judgment,that judgment may become adverse to the interests and thus qualify as fair game for an appeal.because we affirm the grant of summary judgment,defendants have not asserted eleventh amendment immunity on appeal 
this approach seems to be consistent with that taken by several other circuits.see,nair oakland county cmty.mental health,cir bypassing alternative assertion of eleventh amendment and affirming summary judgment based upon merits of claims under first amendment and michigan whistleblower protection act reasoning that under any circumstances in which the state or the united states declines to raise sovereign immunity as a threshold defense,we conclude that the federal courts have discretion to address the defense and the merits in whichever order they prefer strawser atkins,cir concluding that a state restricted use of eleventh amendment immunity permits a federal court to bypass the eleventh amendment question and affirm on the merits of the claim,independent of whether the statutory question related to the merits of the claim is logically antecedent to the eleventh amendment analysis 
most similar to the procedural context of this case is mcclendon georgia department of community health,cir.there,defendants presented two arguments to affirm the district court plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and that plaintiffs claims were barred by the eleventh amendment.id.at.the eleventh circuit interpreted defendants position as a conditional assertion of eleventh amendment sovereign insist upon that defense only if it is necessary to prevent judgment against them on the merits.id.at emphasis added.after describing the elective nature of the eleventh amendment jurisdictional bar,id.at,and after surveying the relevant caselaw,id.at,the mcclendon court held that the conditional assertion of the eleventh amendment gives a federal court the discretion to dispose of the merits favorably to the state or its officials if it chooses to do so.id.at emphasis added.it then chose to exercise this discretion,reasoning that the eleventh amendment issues were much more difficult than the merits of plaintiffs claim.id.
furthermore,this approach does not conflict with the supreme court prohibition of hypothetical jurisdiction.in steel citizens for a better environment,d,the supreme court rejected the practice of assuming article iii jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding a question.see id.at.the court reasoned that this approach offends fundamental principles of separation of powers,since it permits the judicial branch to act ultra vires by circumventing the requirement,grounded in article iii of the constitution,that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter.id.at.although the supreme court recognized that certain cases have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that article iii jurisdiction is always an antecedent question,id.at,it reaffirmed the general precept that a merits question can not be given priority over an article iii question.id.at.
we have extended steel prohibition against hypothetical jurisdiction to preclude requests to bypass an assertion of eleventh amendment immunity.specifically,we have concluded that o nce effectively raised,the eleventh amendment becomes a limitation on our jurisdiction,and we may not then assume hypothetical jurisdiction to reject a plaintiff claim on the merits.harris owens,cir emphasis added.whether immunity has been effectively raised is significant because the eleventh amendment,unlike article iii cases or controversies mandate,imposes no special obligation on a federal appellate court to ensure its own jurisdiction or that of the district court,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.steel,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also calderon ashmus,d recognizing that eleventh amendment is not coextensive with the limitations on judicial power in article iii.since eleventh amendment immunity necessarily becomes an antecedent question of jurisdictional proportions only when effectively raised,harris,at,the logic of steel and harris dictates that here,faced with a conditional,we may first resolve the merits of relators claims.see mcclendon,at betts rector and visitors of of,d,when the defendant expresses a willingness for the court to decide a case in its favor on the merits without deciding whether the defendant is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity,the court makes no assumptions of law declaring power that violates the principles underlying steel.
merits of fca claims 
the district court granted summary judgment to each defendant on each claim.after reasoning that the defense of qualified immunity is available under the qui tam provisions of the fca,the district court held that relators claims foundered on the first prong of the qualified immunity test.that is,the district court found no evidence to suggest that any defendant violated the fca.
we review this decision de novo.see selenke,at.summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.thus,the plain language of rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.in applying this standard,t he evidence of relators is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in their favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
we affirm the district court legal conclusion that no reasonable jury could find an fca violation from the evidence relators presented at the summary judgment stage like the district court,we separate relators allegations into two groups of allegedly false by rogers april,notification to birx about the differences between the doe standards for status and the statutory criteria of the dod program.
fca claims based upon conduct 
relators alleged that defendants false certifications violated a of the fca.to succeed on their qui tam claims,relators must prove that defendants knowingly presented a false claim to the government for payment or approval,a or that defendants knowingly utilized the false statement to get the government to pay a false claim,id.a or that defendants conspired to defraud the government by getting it to pay a false claim,id.a.the scienter requirement can be satisfied by reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.id.b.and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.id.
the district court held that relators provided sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants submitted false claims by misrepresenting their eligibility for the dod program.nonetheless,the district court concluded that,even if the claims were false,relators failed to provide sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that defendants knowingly made these false claims.
the district court offered a rationale to justify its conclusion.first,the district court reasoned that the undisputed evidence in the record established that a the dod had a policy of relying upon the doe lists of minority which nmsu determine eligibility for the dod program and b defendants relied upon this policy in certifying nmsu status.second,the district court concluded that defendants reliance upon the doe lists without independently verifying nmsu statutory eligibility was at most negligent and did not,as a matter of law,evince a reckless disregard for the truth.
relators challenge the district court reasoning.first,relators argue that the district court failed to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to them when it found to be undisputed the dod policy of relying on the doe lists and defendants reliance upon the dod documents reflecting that policy.second,even if the record unambiguously establishes these facts,relators argue that the district court erred when it held,as a matter of law,that the scienter requirement was negated by defendants reliance upon the dod possible misidentification of nmsu as a minority institution.
undisputed material facts 
relators contend that the evidence in the record does not suggest either that a the dod consistently deferred to the doe eligibility lists,on which nmsu consistently appeared,or b defendants knew about and relied upon any such policy in declaring nmsu to be a minority institution.at the very least,relators assert that the evidence in support of these facts was incomplete and ambiguous.we reject relators arguments.
dod policy 
the district court properly found as an undisputed fact that the dod,however mistakenly,determined eligibility for its program between and from the doe lists,on which nmsu regularly appeared.the evidence unambiguously supports this conclusion.for instance,an april,memorandum from the director of the dod office of small and disadvantaged business utilization attached a list of institutions provided to dod by the office of civil r ights within the department of education that qualify as minority institutions.app.at.according to that april memorandum,these schools were identified by the department of education in response to our request for a list of schools that meet the new minority institution criteria contained in section of this list is effective immediately.id.the april memorandum further stated that schools not appearing on the list should contact the office of civil r ights with the department of education and that the list should be distributed to the appropriate contracting activities.id.nmsu appeared on that list.
a announcement of dod grants highlighted a c,the statutory provision governing eligibility criteria,and then attached the most recent list of certified minority institutions meeting this criteria.app.at.the dod announcement explained that this and compiled by the office for civil rights,department of education,as specified in,using enrollment data reported by postsecondary institutions.id.again,nmsu appeared on the doe list 
an august dod announcement for university research grants encouraged proposals from minority institutions,noting that the department of education maintains the list of accredited postsecondary institutions that currently meet the statutory criteria for identification as minority institutions.app.at.once more,nmsu appeared on the doe list for.
in november,the director of the dod office of small and disadvantaged business utilization confirmed in a letter to the united states attorney for the district of new mexico that the dod h istorically has used and continues to use the mi list provided by the department of education as the official list of institutions eligible to participate in the programs.id.at.the november letter further identified the dod criteria,see,as the criteria the doe used to determine status.app.at.
the dod policy of relying upon the doe certification lists can be seen as an understandable,if unfortunate,byproduct of the relevant statutory scheme.from until,the definition of minority institutions for the dod program the definition of minority institutions under the hea.a c.the hea,in turn,imposed responsibility on the soe to verify status from data furnished by universities through enrollment surveys.recodified at.
this policy was then expressly enshrined in the regulations promulgated by the dod.to be sure,these regulations did not directly predicate the definition of a minority institution upon a certification from the soe,as they did for historically black colleges and universities.a historically black colleges and universities,as used in this clause,means institutions determined by the secretary of education to meet the requirements of cfr.id.b noting that a list of hbcus is published periodically by the department of education.however,they expressly permitted an offeror to demonstrate its status,prior to receiving a dod contract,by showing that the secretary of education has determined the offeror to be a historically black college or university or minority institution.c.
ii.defendants reliance 
the district court also found,as an undisputed fact,that defendants relied upon this dod ongoing confirmation that an institution was eligible if it appeared on the doe applying for dod contracts.because relators offer no evidence to suggest that defendants did not rely upon the dod policy,we agree.
with respect to birx,such reliance is asserted in his affidavit in support of defendants summary judgment motion.in this affidavit,birx averred that nmsu received the april memorandum,the dod announcement,and the doe list of minority institutions for.there is also no dispute that nmsu received the announcement,and that various dod solicitations in,which resulted in contractual awards to nmsu,expressly linked status with proof of soe certification.
birx then averred that,based at least upon the and documents he personally signed minority institution contracts on behalf of nmsu.he further professed reliance upon statements of eligibility repeated to me by numerous nmsu administrators and also by contracting officers from various agencies within the dod.app.at.relators point to no evidence in the record to dispute birx assertion of reliance.
the remaining defendants did not offer affidavits averring that they knew about or relied upon the dod policy of deferring to the doe eligibility lists.nonetheless,this is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the following undisputed facts nmsu received the relevant dod documents and doe lists nmsu was eligible for dod contracts prior to the changes,and the april memorandum reached nmsu before the issuance of all the false certifications either the dod policy or the doe designation of nmsu as a minority institution,or both,appeared in many of the dod solicitations to nmsu for proposals defendants,as administrators,were the primary recipients of the dod communications with nmsu and defendants submitted proposals to the dod on behalf of nmsu.again,relators offer no evidence to suggest that defendants did not rely upon the dod policy.
scienter element 
armed with these undisputed facts,the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that defendants acted with the requisite scienter in certifying nmsu as a minority institution.the district court reasoned that g iven this statutory and regulatory background apparently authorizing the dod to rely on the doe mi determinations and given the government assurances,defendants failure to research the statutes and investigate the facts themselves constituted at most only negligent behavior,rather than reckless or deliberate action.d at.
relators challenge this analysis.they claim that a reasonable jury could find that defendants reliance upon dod and doe documents in certifying nmsu status exceeded mere negligence.specifically,they argue that defendants acted with deliberate ignorance by relying blindly upon the doe lists,by ignoring signs that nmsu did not in fact meet the applicable statutory criteria,and by failing to verify independently whether nmsu satisfied these criteria.
as an initial matter,we agree that relators identified enough evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that defendants acted negligently.the primary support for finding negligence is the evidence suggesting that nmsu lacked the necessary data to determine whether it qualified as a minority institution under the relevant statutory criteria.for instance,defendants should have known from the dod april memorandum that nmsu contained a minority enrollment of,less than the required to qualify as a minority institution.see recodified at.other evidence in the record also suggests that nmsu did not meet the minority enrollment threshold for many,if not all,of the years during this period furthermore,birx admitted in april that nmsu had not adequately tracked,hispanic students,thereby lacking information as to whether nmsu qualified as a institution.see a.therefore,despite their obligation to know the law and to act with scrupulous regard for the requirements of law,heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford county,d,it appears that defendants breached this duty by never independently verifying whether nmsu satisfied the statutory criteria for eligibility.
nonetheless,numerous courts have observed that simple negligence does not violate the fca.see,united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,cir declaring that under b definition of knowingly,innocent mistakes or negligence are not actionable,cert.denied,d united states ex rel.ali daniel,mann,johnson mendenhall,cir negligence and innocent mistake are insufficient to meet the intent requirement under the fca.united states ex rel.quirk madonna towers,cir i nnocent mistakes and negligence are not offenses under the act.quotation marks omitted see also united states ex rel.hefner hackensack.med,cir citing wang fmc,cir,for the proposition that poor job performance and innocent mistakes are not actionable under the false claims act.we agree with their reading of the fca.and,after reviewing the summary judgment record as a whole,we believe that no reasonable jury could find that any of the defendants acted in more than a negligent manner.
three reasons support our conclusion the lack of evidence in the record the government knowledge inference and the text of the applicable statutory and regulatory scheme.
lack of evidence 
we are initially struck by what is not in the record.for instance,relators identify no deposition testimony from any defendant relevant to the issue of scienter.nor did relators submit any such testimony in response to defendants summary judgment motion moreover,although relators alleged that each defendant made at least one false certification,they adduced virtually no evidence of defendants to april.indeed,there is no evidence that defendants intentionally ignored the statutory criteria that they appreciated the significance of,yet disavowed,statistical data foreclosing nmsu eligibility as a minority institution or that they purposefully refused to verify the relevant demographics of nmsu student body.and there is certainly no evidence of a conspiracy to defraud.
we find these evidentiary failures to be particularly significant in light of relators obligation at the summary judgment phase to produce sufficient evidence that each individual the psl as an institutional whole knowingly submitted a false claim.see madonna towers,at affirming summary judgment for the operator of a nursing facility because relator sole evidence of scienter deposition testimony by facility officials that they did not seek legal advice concerning the propriety of their billing practices,failed to even suggest that anyone suspected something was wrong but deliberately avoided learning more so that a fraudulent scheme could continue.
relators cite several pieces of evidence that purportedly raise an inference of scienter as to all defendants the list attached to the april memorandum which identified nmsu as having a minority enrollment of a december,discussing nmsu capacity to track the and data of its student body and rogers report of his april,meeting with birx.none of these documents supports an inference of the requisite scienter.
the april,list was issued in conjunction with a memorandum that informed nmsu that,if it appeared on the doe list,it was eligible for the dod program.we fail to see how nmsu appearance on a list confirming dod eligibility generates avoidance of ineligibility.the record is also barren as to whether any of the defendants recognized the significance of the minority enrollment statistic in or in any subsequent year.more importantly,even if certain defendants should have known from the april,list that nmsu did not qualify under,which imposed the threshold,the list did not foreclose nmsu from qualifying under b.in fact,it revealed that nmsu had a hispanic enrollment of nearly,one of three relevant conditions for eligibility as a institution.see b b.
relators next cite a december,from an employee of nmsu to relator donald bustamante.the stated that because it was only in the past few years that a first generation question has appeared on the undergraduate admission application form,t he student file has no information regarding this status for students who were admitted to nmsu before this question was asked,nor for most graduate students.app.at.the further stated that the only method we have of determining low income status for students at nmsu is to review the student financial aid record for household income and size,and compare that to national low income guidelines.id.if no financial aid report was filed,then no determination was made.id.
no reasonable jury could infer actual knowledge,reckless disregard,or deliberate indifference from this.for starters,meyer was the only defendant copied on the,and relators present no evidence that any other defendant was aware of its content.nor is this content,on its own,particularly suggestive.by the time meyer received the the status of hispanic students was no longer a criterion in qualifying as a institution.a requiring of undergraduate students to be hispanic and at least of hispanic students to be individuals.and the does not concede that nmsu never collected information about status,but that nmsu had only one method,however partial,of doing so.id.
relators final piece of.rogers report memorializing birx comments in april fails to carry their burden of proof.according to rogers report,birx acknowledged that he learned through recent conversations with miriam meyer of nmsu failure to track statistics concerning,hispanic students.id.at emphasis added.he further admitted that the evidence presented to him raised significant doubts in his mind that nmsu correctly certified itself as a minority institution.id.
these comments,without more,offer no insight into birx state of his to his recent conversation of an undisclosed date with meyer.furthermore,birx comments say nothing about the scienter of the other defendants with the exception of meyer,nearly all of whose false claims were submitted prior to.and,with respect to meyer,rogers report attributes to her,through multiple levels of hearsay,no more than what she knew through the december.
in summary,we believe that the evidence cited by analyzed individually or to create a genuine issue of material fact as to scienter.but,even if this evidence somehow did raise a weak inference that a particular defendant,such as meyer or birx,knowingly misrepresented nmsu eligibility,this would not be enough to reach a jury.relators evidence can not be evaluated in a factual and legal vacuum.as we now explain,the government knowledge inference,coupled with the applicable statutory and regulatory scheme,preclude a reasonable jury from finding scienter.
ii.government knowledge inference 
the government knowledge inference helps distinguish,in fca cases,between the submission of a false claim and the knowing submission of a false is,between the presence and absence of scienter.see united states ex rel.becker westinghouse savannah river,cir collecting cases shaw aaa eng g drafting,cir united states southland mgmt,cir en banc jones,concurring noting that some courts have inaptly named this government knowledge theory a defense whereas it is not a statutory defense to fca liability.this inference arises when the government knows and approves of the facts underlying an allegedly false claim prior to presentment.see becker,at t he government knowledge of the facts underlying an allegedly false record or statement can negate the scienter for an fca violation.united states ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir holding that defendant argument that liability is precluded by the government knowledge is unpersuasive,in part because defendant neglected to disclose all the pertinent information in filing the claim.
a classic example is when the government,with knowledge of the facts underlying an allegedly false claim,authorizes the contractor to make that claim.see wang fmc,cir the government knew of all the deficiencies identified by wang,and discussed them with fmc.the fact that the government knew of fmc mistakes and limitations,and that fmc was open with the government about them,suggests that while fmc might have been groping for solutions,it was not cheating the government in the effort.in such a situation,an inference arises that the contractor has not knowingly presented a fraudulent or false claim.see becker,at united states ex rel.hagood sonoma county water agency,cir as the brief of the united states points out,the knowledge possessed by officials of the united states may show that the defendant did not submit its claim in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the truth john boese,civil false claims and qui tam actions e ed.supp.government knowledge is relevant to the element of intent.
it is only an inference.it does not automatically preclude a finding of scienter.united states ex rel.kreindler kreindler united tech,cir t he defendant knowledge of the falsity of its claim is not automatically exonerated by any overlapping knowledge by government officials.see southland mgmt,at jones,concurring courts have qualified the importance of government knowledge by stating that it may not always provide a conclusive defense to the claimant united states newport news shipbuilding,d,a contractor disclosure to the government is relevant,not because government knowledge of a misrepresentation shields a contractor from liability,but because evidence of disclosure may point persuasively away from any conclusion that the contractor made a knowing misrepresentation.quoting x doe.the proper focus of the scienter inquiry under a must always rest on the defendant knowledge of whether the claim is false,a knowledge which may certainly exist even when a government agency misinterprets its own regulations and full comprehension of the pay a false claim.see southland mgmt,at nn,jones,concurring noting that the government knowledge inference is simply a means by which the defendant can rebut the government assertion of the knowing presentation of a false claim and identifying a set of scenarios where the inference would not be effective hagood,at.
although we have never applied the government knowledge inference,we have acknowledged its viability.in shaw,we noted that the statutory government knowledge defense was removed from the fca in at.we quickly emphasized,however,that there may still be occasions when the government knowledge of or cooperation with a contractor actions is so extensive that the contractor could not as a matter of law possess the requisite state of mind to be liable under the fca.id.we then concluded that the facts of shaw did not present such an occasion,in part because the defendant was not forthcoming with the government about the contractual failures and billing inflations that formed the basis for the false claims.id.at.
by contrast,the government knowledge inference is to the facts of this case,where both governmental knowledge and governmental cooperation are present.here,the doe had access to nmsu enrollment data.consistent with its statutory obligation,the doe reviewed this data and repeatedly designated nmsu as a minority institution.based upon these designations,the dod invited nmsu to apply for contracts,confirming that nmsu satisfied the statutory criteria for its program so long as it appeared on doe minority institution lists.with no reason to distrust the very agency responsible for administering the program,defendants then relied upon the dod assurances and invitations in certifying nmsu as a minority institution.
it is true,as relators point out,that defendants never expressly informed the dod that nmsu did not meet,or did not have the data to determine whether it met,the criteria referenced in a c.however,the undisputed evidence in the record indicates that nmsu was completely forthcoming with the very agency on whose analysis the dod uncritically relied.for instance,nmsu submitted data to the doe on an annual basis.this data contained information about nmsu student enrollment,including information concerning total institutional enrollment,total minority enrollment,and financial assistance.tellingly,there is nothing in the record to suggest that this data,or any other data submitted on behalf of nmsu,was materially inaccurate.nor is there any evidence to suggest that nmsu deliberately withheld enrollment data in connection with its hea applications or other submissions,such as its higher education general information surveys.mandating that the soe shall verify minority institution status from data on enrollments in the higher education general information surveys hegis furnished by the institution id.same.
thus,it is undisputed that the doe had accurate data from which to verify whether nmsu met the definition of a minority institution under and,later,under.to the extent that this data was of limited relevance,or was simply incomplete,the doe certainly had the discretion not to place nmsu on its lists.and the dod had access to the doe lists,if not data,prior to mailing its solicitations.collectively,then,both agencies were aware of the same universe of facts of which defendants were aware when defendants certified nmsu minority institution eligibility.
we recognize that in most cases in which summary judgment has been granted on the basis of the government knowledge inference there has been more direct communication between the government and the contractors in the context of an existing contractual,where the governmental agency,possessing full knowledge of the relevant circumstances arising from such a relationship,authorizes the contractor to make a particular representation that ultimately proves to be false here,on the other hand,the interactions precede the relevant contracts and,consequently,are not.however,we conclude that neither the directness of the communications nor their nexus to an existing contractual relationship constitute an essential predicate for the government knowledge inference.instead,the focus properly rests upon the depth of the government knowledge of the facts underlying the allegedly false claim and the degree to which the government invites that claim.
this conclusion is not undercut by any of the cases to which relators turn.neither united states mackby,cir,nor united states krizek,present situations where the government had knowledge of the facts underlying the false statements or invited the claims containing such statements furthermore,heckler,although repeatedly stressed by relators,is distinguishable.
in heckler,the supreme court rejected a health care provider attempt to avoid administrative recoupment of overpayments made under the medicare program by asserting equitable estoppel against the government.at.the provider had obtained double reimbursement for certain costs,in violation of the applicable statutory and regulatory scheme,only after receiving oral verification of the propriety of seeking such reimbursement from the fiscal intermediary that acted as the government contractual agent.id.at.
in discussing the reasonableness of the provider reliance,a prerequisite for an estoppel claim,the supreme court declared that those who deal with the government are expected to know the law and may not rely on the conduct of government agents contrary to law.id.at.applying this principle,the supreme court then explained that the provider did not act reasonably in relying upon the informal and oral advice of the fiscal intermediary.id.at.instead,the provider should have obtained an interpretation of the applicable regulations from the overseeing agency,the department of health and human services,since the provider indisputably knew that this was a doubtful question not clearly covered by existing policy statements and that the intermediary lacked the power to resolve policy questions.id.
heckler is both legally and factually distinct from the instant case.as for the legal perspective,although heckler stressed in broad language that contractors may not rely upon the ultimately incorrect advice of government agents,it did so in the context of a contractor assertion of an equitable estoppel claim against the government yet,whether the government is estopped from bringing a claim because one of its agents assured the defendant that some action was legal presents a very different question than whether reliance on government assurances can be relevant to deciding if a defendant knowingly presented a false claim.moser united states.where petitioner conduct would have barred him statutorily from obtaining american citizenship but he relied in significant part upon contrary written assurances issued by the government,the court observed,t here is no need to evaluate these circumstances on the basis of any estoppel of the government petitioner did not knowingly and intelligently waive his rights to citizenship.under the fca,the relator or the government must prove scienter as an element it can not be presumed.see b.
to be sure,it is not difficult to understand that the the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to the rule of law,heckler,at,would be significantly undermined if parties could routinely circumvent administrative recoupment efforts by asserting reliance on the bad advice of government agents.in the context of recoupment,typically the party would not have suffered a detrimental change in its position in alleged reliance on the government assurances i ts detriment is the inability to retain money that it should never have received in the first place.id.at.however,where a statute,like the fca,seeks to sanction and deter wrongful conduct through the imposition of up to treble damages there is little or no reason to think that allowing evidence that is highly relevant to the question of whether the conduct is in fact wrongful,knowing that is,evidence of the government knowledge and have a comparable adverse impact on the citizenry perception of the rule of law indeed,the allowance of such evidence might bolster the citizenry perception of the system fairness.heckler,at.recognizing that some of its precedents seem to rest on the premise that when the government acts in misleading ways,it may not enforce the law if to do so would harm a private party as a result of governmental deception 
heckler also is factually distinguishable.while it may not be reasonable to rely upon the oral advice of a governmental intermediary without power to resolve the very legal question at issue,defendants in the instant appeal did no such thing.they were not satisfied with the policy judgment of a mere conduit.heckler,at.moser,at.rejecting application of estoppel principles and noting that p etitioner had sought information and guidance from the highest authority to which he could turn.nor did they accept oral advice.heckler,at.rather,defendants reasonably relied upon the written assurances of the governmental agency responsible for administering the program under which nmsu sought and obtained the contracts.
in summary,this case presents a proper application of the government knowledge inference.from nmsu enrollment data,the doe consistently placed nmsu on its annual list of minority institutions under the hea and,from these lists,the dod consistently sent nmsu solicitations for contracts,assuring nmsu that,if it was on doe list,it was eligible.not surprisingly,the defendants based their certifications upon these written assurances.thus,the government knowledge inference generates a strong illation that defendants did not knowingly submit false claims within the meaning of a of the fca.
iii.statutory and regulatory framework 
finally,we note that the texts of the applicable statutory and regulatory schemes help highlight the absence of scienter and confirm the reasonableness of defendants reliance upon the dod confirmation of nmsu eligibility.while relators repeatedly assert that defendants were required to know the applicable legal framework,defendants good faith belief in nmsu eligibility is both evidenced and justified by this very framework.
as discussed above,the statutory scheme governing eligibility for the dod program between and arguably made the soe responsible for verifying minority institution eligibility,based upon enrollment data provided by schools to the doe.see a c recodified at.more importantly,although the dod regulatory scheme was unambiguous in its definition of a minority institution,see a,it was equally unambiguous in identifying what may satisfy this definition proof of soe certification.see c declaring that prior to award,offeror need only,if requested,produce evidence of soe certification.
because defendants reliance upon nmsu appearance on the doe lists was welcomed by the regulatory scheme,no reasonable jury could conclude on the basis of the evidence in this summary judgment record that defendants failure to the dod assurances of eligibility exceeded mere negligence.defendants simply certified a position blessed by the dod and its own one apparently not supported by the statutory criteria.from the evidence provided,the worst that can be inferred is that defendants unwittingly took advantage of a legal paradox.see united states ex rel.siewick jamieson sci.eng g,finding that defendants did not knowingly violate the fca when they received payment for claims under an allegedly unenforceable contract because the law was uncertain as to whether the contract was actually unenforceable hagood sonoma county water agency,cir holding that signing a contract with an arguably false figure,based upon a disputed legal issue as to the requisite precision of this figure,does not amount to deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard see also southland mgmt,at jones,j,concurring w here disputed legal issues arise from vague provisions or regulations,a contractor decision to take advantage of a position can not result in his filing a knowingly false claim.
fca claims based upon conduct 
the district court also held that no defendant violated the fca after birx meeting with rogers.the district court reasoned that the only,may,letter to a dod contracting truthful.
relators present two challenges to this analysis.first,relators argue that the district court erroneously found only one,certification.second,relators contend that the may,certification was false because it failed to mention that nmsu did not qualify as a minority institution under the dod set aside program and failed to refer to the correct eligibility criteria.aplt.br.at.
initially,we reject relators contention that they presented more evidence than just the may,certification.although relators argue in their opening brief that there were at least two false certifications of status after april,see aplt.br.at,they identify only two the may,certification and an april,certification by conroy.moreover,the citation in their brief identifies no actual evidence of the april,certification,but only an allegation in their pleadings that conroy offered such a certification.this unverified allegation fails to meet relators burden at the summary judgment stage.see.e declaring that when motion for summary judgment is made and supported,an adverse party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading rather,its response must set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial behrens pelletier,d on summary judgment,however,the plaintiff can no longer rest on the pleadings.
as to the may,certification,we hold that no reasonable jury could find that it contained a false statement.this letter,arguably written on behalf of birx accurately and honestly alerted the dod to the possible conflict between the doe list and the dod requirements for eligibility regarding minority institution certification,this is to inform you that on april,we were notified that there apparently are differing requirements across agencies.app.at.after this disclosure,the letter then certified what was known to be true t hat new mexico state university has qualified for minority institution status under cfr chapter,part and cfr through and has been placed on the department of education list of title iii eligible institutions for fy.id.
put simply,there was nothing in the may,letter that was false.see united states ex rel.morton v.a plus benefits,cir at a minimum the fca requires proof of an objective falsehood.united states ex rel.lamers city of green bay,cir t he fca is not an appropriate vehicle for policing technical compliance with administrative regulations.the fca is a fraud prevention statute violations are not fraud unless the violator knowingly lies to the government about them.birx did not represent nmsu status under the statutory criteria governing the dod program.instead,he certified nmsu status pursuant to the regulations under which nmsu,without ambiguity,could claim status and hea eligibility.even relators concede that the may,letter accurately stated under what statutes and regulations nmsu did qualify as a minority institution.aplt.br.at.
nor did the may,letter omit sufficient material information to be actionable.see united states ex rel.berge bd.of trustees of of,cir recognizing that material omissions may constitute false claims under certain circumstances.birx alerted the dod that a designation might not satisfy the statutory requirements for the dod program.he further admitted that nmsu just became aware of this conflict.while it might have been better to provide the fullest disclosure by quoting the statutory requirements and explaining that nmsu had not kept the relevant statistics,the absence of such information does not give rise to a false claim.the dod was provided with enough facts to be able to reach that conclusion on its own.for that matter,birx may still have been unsure of how to sort out the apparent conflict between the regulations and the statute,and thus uncertain whether nmsu qualified under the appropriate dod criteria.explicitly conditioning nmsu certification upon those regulations that nmsu clearly did satisfy was logical under the circumstances and did not evince the filing of a false claim.
even if the may,certification was somehow false,nothing in the summary judgment record indicates it was knowingly so.at worst,a reasonable jury could find that birx was negligent in pressing nmsu eligibility shortly after his meeting with rogers.it is more likely,however,that the may,letter was birx attempt to resolve the confusion surrounding nmsu status.birx alerted the dod to a potential problem with nmsu prior certification,admitted that nmsu had been unaware of this potential problem,and then ventured to submit only a limited but accurate certification of nmsu status.no reasonable jury could find that the may,certification,absent other evidence of duplicitous intent,was made with the requisite scienter.see united states ex rel.costner united states,cir finding no intent under the fca,as matter of law,when a contractor communicates with the government regarding problems and engages in cooperative effort to find a solution wang,at the fact that the government knew of defendant mistakes and limitations,and that defendant was open with the government about them,suggests that while defendant might have been groping for solutions,it was not cheating the government in the effort.
iii.conclusion 
in conclusion,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on relators fca claims.because defendants are entitled to summary judgment regardless of whether qualified immunity applies,we do not decide whether qualified immunity functions as a viable defense against a qui tam action under the fca.and,based upon this affirmance,we dismiss defendants conditional as moot.
in particular,defendants stated if this court agrees that relators failed to produce evidence to support an essential element of their claim,then it need not consider the other issues raised on this appeal.the determination that relators can not prove their case under the fca renders moot the questions of whether qualified immunity is a recognized defense in an fca action,whether defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,and whether defendants were subject to suit in their individual capacities in the first.br.at.
in december,congress removed institutions from the definition of minority institutions under a c.see national defense authorization act for fiscal year,a c,stat.this amendment is not relevant to this litigation because,as the district court correctly observed,relators do not allege any violations of the fca after may.
the list of defendants includes the estate of thomas davidson,former director of the psl william conroy,former president of nmsu michael orenduff,former president of nmsu robert weigle,former director of the psl donald birx,current director of the psl miriam gerber meyer,current director of institutional research at nmsu.we acknowledge that the respective employment statuses of the defendants may have changed during the pendency of this appeal however,such changes if any would have no bearing on our resolution of this case.
meyer indicated on each application whether nmsu met the specified criteria and gathered statistics necessary to complete the application forms.
defendants emphasize the absence of allegations that they either received a personal benefit from the false claims or acted outside the scope of their employment.in short,defendants contend that the district court may,order undermines the supreme court decision in stevens,and allows qui tam plaintiffs to easily avoid the eleventh amendment protection that states the real parties in interest would otherwise enjoy.aplee.br.at.
lest we be misunderstood,we acknowledge our view that the task of district courts,and consequently appellate courts,is different in reviewing motions for summary judgment under traditional standards and qualified immunity principles.see,cortez mccauley,cir en banc because of the underlying purposes of qualified immunity,we review summary judgment orders deciding qualified immunity questions differently from other summary judgment decisions.internal quotation marks omitted vondrak city of las cruces,cir same.indeed,courts should exercise care not to confuse the two analytic frameworks.admittedly,at least in some instances,this apparently is easier said than done.see,alan chen,the facts about qualified immunity,emory,the legal system continues to struggle with qualified immunity charles wilson,location,location,location recent developments in the qualified immunity defense,ann.surv.am,circuit judge of eleventh circuit commenting,wading through the doctrine of qualified immunity is one of the most morally and conceptually challenging tasks federal appellate court judges routinely face.
the eleventh amendment provides the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.we recently had occasion to summarize some eleventh amendment immunity principles.see tarrant reg l water dist.sevenoaks,cir.
when a state raises such an argument on appeal,it must be decided and,almost always,it must be decided prior to reaching the merits of the underlying claim.see joseph ex rel.wolfe ingram,cir.as we stated in martin kansas,cir,overruled on other grounds by bd.of trustees of of garrett,d,b ecause the state assertion of eleventh amendment immunity challenges the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court,the issue must be resolved before a court may address the merits of plaintiff underlying claim.at see also ruiz mcdonnell,cir same.we have even applied this principle to a that challenged the denial of eleventh amendment immunity.see frazier simmons,cir.
see charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at and supp.a party who fully prevailed in the district court may have an equally obvious justification for,to protect interests that otherwise might be adversely affected by disposition of the appeal.courts readily understand this principle,and have applied it without difficulty,permitting the but deciding them only if disposition of the appeal makes it appropriate.emphasis added.
some circuits have endorsed,albeit in dicta,the logic underlying this approach.see bowers collegiate athletic ass n,cir reasoning that because the state defendant urges that the right of action question should be addressed first,prior to eleventh amendment questions,conceptually,at least,we could hold that it has waived its eleventh amendment immunity to that very limited extent united states ex rel.long scs bus.technical,observing that state defendant explicit request that we first decide the statutory question could therefore be seen as a kind of agreement to assert its eleventh amendment defense only if it loses on the statutory one and that it may well be that the state defendant approach amounts to a partial consent to suit on the statutory to a later eleventh amendment defense.
we assume arguendo that defendants are persons within the meaning of a of the fca.this assumption is appropriate because,again,defendants only challenge the district court resolution of this statutory question as part of their conditional.and,even if defendants had pressed this issue as their primary response to relators appeal,we would not be obligated to decide this question before resolving whether relators put forward enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the merits of their fca claims.see steel,at.confirming that a merits question can be given priority over a statutory standing question.
the fca prescribes three definitions of knowingly.b.a defendant acts knowingly when he has actual knowledge of the information or when he acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or when he acts in r
