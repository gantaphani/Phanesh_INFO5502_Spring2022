plaintiff,a columbia university student who is identified by the pseudonym john doe,appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york furman,dismissing his amended complaint the complaint under fed.civ.b for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.the complaint alleges that defendant columbia university violated title ix of the education amendments of,et title ix,and state law,by acting with sex bias in investigating him and suspending him for an alleged sexual assault.we conclude that the complaint meets the low standard described in littlejohn city of new york,cir,of alleging facts giving rise to a plausible minimal inference of bias sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss,which we hold applies in title ix cases.we therefore vacate the judgment and remand.
factual background 
on a motion under rule b to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim,the only facts to be considered are those alleged in the complaint,and the court must accept them,drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor,in deciding whether the complaint alleges sufficient facts to survive.see difolco msnbc cable,cir.furthermore,the plaintiff is at liberty to plead different theories,even if they are inconsistent with one another,and the court must accept each sufficiently pleaded theory at face value,without regard to its inconsistency with other parts of the complaint.see fed.civ.d a party may state as many separate claims as it has,regardless of consistency.gregory daly,cir.needless to say,the facts a plaintiff alleges in the complaint may turn out to be and untrue.but a court at this stage of our proceeding is not engaged in an effort to determine the true facts.the issue is simply whether the facts the plaintiff alleges,if true,are plausibly sufficient to state a legal claim.for that reason,the court,in judging the sufficiency of the complaint,must accept the facts alleged and construe ambiguities in the light most favorable to upholding the plaintiff claim.if the complaint is found to be sufficient to state a legal claim,the opposing party will then have ample opportunity to contest the truth of the plaintiff allegations and to offer its own version.in light of those rules,we set forth below facts alleged in plaintiff complaint in the light most favorable to him,drawing reasonable inferences in his favor.
a.the sexual encounter between plaintiff and jane doe 
on the night of may,plaintiff,a male columbia freshman who upon completing his freshman year became a varsity athlete,was studying for a final exam in his residence hall.at approximately a female classmate and member of the same circle of friends,identified in this litigation by the pseudonym jane doe,approached him and initiated a conversation.they took an walk together,and eventually began discussing the topic of hooking up.the complaint alleges that,in the interest of privacy for a sexual encounter,jane suggested using the bathroom of her dormitory suite.she insisted on using her suite rather than his because her was plaintiff roommate.she told plaintiff to wait in the bathroom while she went to her bedroom to retrieve a condom.she then undressed herself in the bathroom,and they proceeded to have sex.over the next two weeks,jane contacted plaintiff twice to express doubts about how their friends would react.
jane doe complaint and defendant investigation 
after the start of the next school year,on september,rosalie siler,defendant assistant director for and sexual misconduct,contacted plaintiff to inform him that a fellow student had made allegations of sexual assault against him,and advised him to come in for a meeting.the next day,plaintiff met with siler,who gave him a formal written notice that he was charged with sexual intercourse in violation of the school misconduct policies for students gbmps,which established procedures for responding to allegations of sexual assault on campus.he was told that,as a consequence of jane doe accusation,the university had issued an order barring him from contact with her and restricting his access to residence halls on campus.although plaintiff was advised that he was entitled to access the counseling psychological services,he was not advised of other sources of support during the disciplinary process.
plaintiff was summoned to meet on september,with the columbia title ix investigator,jilleian,who plaintiff alleges,referring to her prior experience,was not gender neutral.in her role as title ix investigator,was charged with creating the narrative account that is eventually adopted by the disciplinary panel.a.plaintiff told that the encounter had been consensual and that there had been witnesses at the residence hall lounge that night who could be helpful.the complaint alleges that response was hostile.she did not ask him about the witnesses,interview them,or follow up with them in any way according to plaintiff,a t all times,he was under the impression that would investigate and follow up on his account of the evening once he conveyed his side of the story but as it turns out,that never happened.a.
according to the complaint,questioning of plaintiff was akin to calculated to elicit a confession.she failed to tell him he could submit his own written statement to her or to the disciplinary panel,and failed also to advise him that he was entitled to seek the support of a student advocate.nor did she advise him of resources available to him to aid him in the process.
plaintiff alleges in contrast,upon information and belief,that,in meeting with jane doe,took a narrative account without leading questions and without hostility,giving jane thorough advice as to the resources available to her.the interviews conducted by were not recorded.she took handwritten notes.
on october,plaintiff reported to siler that jane doe friends had harassed and assaulted him on campus.siler did not take his complaint seriously.a.
on october,plaintiff met with to review her notes from their previous meeting.he observed that her notes inaccurately and inadequately paraphrased plaintiff verbal account of the events.a.on january,plaintiff met with interim assistant director,deputy title ix coordinator virginia ryan siler replacement to review report.
according to the complaint,the report falsely depicted plaintiff as having inflicted nonconsensual sex on jane doe,by virtue of having coercively pressured her over a period of weeks to have sex with him the report showed that sessions stackhouse had disregarded plaintiff account of jane doe clearly expressed consent,and failed to reconcile jane account with conflicting information provided to by india knight,who was a friend of jane,about jane motivation on may.the report also allegedly failed to include statements of persons,including jane roommate,who had occasion to witness jane doe in the weeks before the encounter as well as on that night.a.plaintiff attempted to correct mistakes.ryan gave plaintiff a form to state his response,which he completed and returned on january.
soon thereafter,ryan provided plaintiff with a hearing date of february and gave him a list of the panelists.according to plaintiff,at no point during the investigative process did,or any administrator,advise him that he was entitled to seek advice and counsel from his dean of students.
criticisms of columbia among students and in the press for its previous lenient handling of sexual assault complaints 
in the period preceding plaintiff disciplinary hearing,columbia students had expressed concern that the university did not take seriously the complaints of female students about sexual assaults by male students.various student organizations had alleged that the school was not being firm enough in the disciplinary process in cases involving accusations by female students of sexual misconduct by male students.a.this controversy reached the press.on december,a new york post article declared,columbia drops ball on jock rapist probe students.id.the article quoted several female students asserting that columbia had mishandled their sexual assault complaints,failing to act with expediency in investigating,giving lenient sanctions,and conveying an overall tenor of dismissal with regard to the serious nature of the complaints.the article stated that the university presidential advisory committee on sexual assault intended to schedule a meeting with the columbia university student democrats to learn more directly about student concerns and explore possible next steps.
on campus,the columbia university democrats had criticized the university handling of sexual assault complaints and called for reforms.sarah weinstein,the membership director of that student organization,had written opinion articles calling for increased transparency at the school,and had spearheaded a petition to request statistics on sanctions issued by defendant in sexual assault cases.referring to reports that yale university had given light punishments to male students found to have raped or assaulted female students,weinstein was quoted in articles as saying,w e want to make sure that what happening at yale is happening here at columbia.a.
on january,an independent,newspaper criticized columbia handling of sexual assault complaints,discussing the experiences of three alleged sexual assault victims in an effort to highlight how the university internal investigation allowed an accused student athlete to escape punishment.the articles particularly criticized for inadequate investigation s.a.in february close to the time of plaintiff hearing columbia university president lee bollinger promised to hold a town hall meeting on the school handling of sexual misconduct.columbia dean james valentini was scheduled to attend the meeting.
on april,students filed complaints with the united states department of education for violations of title ix and other laws,alleging that defendant mishandled incidents of sexual assault and misconduct on campus.
columbia policies for addressing sexual assault 
columbia policy on misconduct the gbmps provided that a student accused of sexual assault would be given notice of the complaint and written notice of the allegations,as well as an opportunity to meet with the assistant director for student services for and sexual misconduct to review the gbmps policy and procedures.a specially trained title ix investigator would then interview the complainant,respondent,and any witnesses,gather any pertinent documentation,and prepare a report detailing the relevant findings.a.if the investigator found reasonable suspicion,then the respondent and complainant would each have the opportunity to review the investigative report and documentation.a.if the respondent denied responsibility or did not respond,a hearing panel would be convened.
hearings were to be closed proceedings.the hearing panels,when practicable,would consist of two deans administrators and one student drawn from a specially trained pool.a party could challenge a panelist participation in writing.during the hearing,only the panel would call and question parties and witnesses,but parties could submit questions,which the panel would have discretion to decline to ask if it found them irrelevant or duplicative.panels were to base their decisions on a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof.a.decisions were to be made within five business days,and the dean of students would render a decision five business days later.sanctions could range from a warning to suspension to full dismissal.respondents had the right to an appeal.
e.the disciplinary hearing and plaintiff suspension 
plaintiff disciplinary hearing took place on february,before three panelists the director of the office of disability services at barnard college,the associate director for residential life and housing at barnard college,and a graduate student at the columbia school of public health.ryan and her assistant were also present.plaintiff brought his roommate.jane doe was accompanied by weinstein,who had been among the most vocal critics of the university prior handling of rape complaints.weinstein was not jane friend,and had no prior relationship with her.columbia rules did not allow the accused student legal representation.
there were three rooms set up for the hearing one for the panelists,one for plaintiff,and one for jane doe.in each room,a television was set up with a live video feed of the hearing so that each participant had the opportunity to watch at all times.
at the start of the hearing,the panelists asked plaintiff to make a statement.because allegedly had not told plaintiff he would be called on to make a statement,he had nothing prepared and merely stated that he did nothing wrong.a.
at the hearing,the panel considered report,which did not include reference to witnesses who could have supported plaintiff defense,allegedly because had declined to follow the leads plaintiff had given her.the panel did not call witnesses who could have supported plaintiff defense.plaintiff submitted questions to the panelists to be put to jane doe,but they did not allow him to exhaust his list,asserting that the questions were irrelevant.a.
the hearing lasted less than two hours.the panelists found plaintiff responsible for the charge of sexual assault sexual intercourse.a.although plaintiff denied having coerced jane doe and alleged that no evidence was presented in support of such coercion,the panel found that plaintiff had directed unreasonable pressure for sexual activity toward the complainant over a period of weeks and that this pressure constituted coercion so that the sexual intercourse was without consent.a.
on february,plaintiff was informed that columbia was issuing an order of suspension until fall.because the university refused to give plaintiff credit for his spring classes,the suspension was functionally equivalent to one and one half years.plaintiff stated that on the same day,he saw jane doe,who called out to him that she was sorry and that she was going to get his punishment lessened.a.
plaintiff was advised of his right to appeal within five business days.on march,plaintiff appealed,citing,among other things,failure to interview key student witnesses.jane doe also submitted an appeal to reduce the severity of plaintiff punishment.
on march,dean valentini denied plaintiff appeal,explaining in part that failure to interview key witnesses identified by plaintiff was within her discretion,that such witnesses were not raised with and were raised for the first time on appeal,and that plaintiff coercive behavior was committed outside the purview of other witnesses,and,thus,such witnesses testimonies were insufficient.a.the dean concluded that the sanction was appropriate because sexual assault is an egregious offense.dean valentini denial of plaintiff appeal occurred four days prior to the meeting for discussion of the school handling of such complaints,which the dean was scheduled to attend.
proceedings below 
plaintiff filed his suit on june,alleging that columbia subjected him to sex discrimination in violation of title ix and state law.the complaint seeks both damages and expungement of his disciplinary record.it alleges that,in the role of the university supposedly neutral title ix investigator,was motivated by sex bias,attributable in part to a desire to refute criticisms of herself and of the university for their past handling of similar complaints,to perform her duties in a manner that discriminated against the accused male.the complaint alleges that she conducted a and deficient investigation that was hostile to his claim,failed to carry out her duty to interview his witnesses and explore channels that could be helpful to him,failed to advise him of his rights,and drew unfair and incorrect conclusions against him in her report to the adjudicatory panel.the complaint alleges also that the university the panel and the dean,seeking to protect the university from criticism both among students and the public to the effect that it was not taking women sexual assault complaints seriously,took a,stance on jane doe allegations,leading them to decide against him,incorrectly and contrary to the weight of the evidence.
the district court granted columbia motion to dismiss the federal law claims.the court also declin ed to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff claims.a.plaintiff then brought this appeal.
discussion 
title ix relevant portion provides,no person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a emphases added.this provision,which is enforceable through an implied private right of action,was enacted to supplement the civil rights act of bans on racial discrimination in the workplace and in universities.yusuf vassar,cir.because title ix prohibits under covered circumstances subjecting a person to discrimination on account of sex,it is understood to bar the imposition of university discipline where gender is a motivating factor in the decision to discipline.id.at.
ii.standard of review 
a court of appeals reviews de novo a district court grant of a motion under rule b to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.littlejohn,at.
standard for judging the sufficiency of a complaint alleging discrimination under title ix 
in a series of cases beginning with mcdonnell douglas green,the supreme court ruled that,in suits alleging employment discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,as amended,et,and related statutes,until the defendant furnishes a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action it took against the plaintiff,the plaintiff needs to present only minimal evidence supporting an inference of discrimination in order to prevail.see mcdonnell douglas,at.
as set forth in our recent explanation of mcdonnell douglas standard,
i n the initial phase of the case,the plaintiff can establish a prima facie case without evidence sufficient to show discriminatory motivation if the plaintiff can show that she is a member of a protected class that she was qualified for employment in the position that she suffered an adverse employment action and,in addition,has some minimal evidence suggesting an inference that the employer acted with discriminatory motivation,such a showing will raise a temporary presumption of discriminatory motivation,shifting the burden of production to the employer and requiring the employer to come forward with its justification for the adverse employment action against the plaintiff.however,once the employer presents evidence of its justification for the adverse action,joining issue on plaintiff claim of discriminatory motivation,the presumption drops out of the picture and the mcdonnell douglas framework is no longer relevant.at this point,in the second phase of the case,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason or in any event not the sole reason for the employment decision,which merges with the plaintiff ultimate burden of showing that the defendant intentionally discriminated against her.
littlejohn,at internal citations omitted.
with respect to the sufficiency of federal complaints generally,the supreme court ruled in ashcroft iqbal,that a complaint must plead specific facts sufficient to support a plausible inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.at.while t he plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement,it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.id.
in littlejohn,we clarified that iqbal applies to complaints brought under title vii.to the same extent that the mcdonnell douglas temporary presumption reduces the facts a plaintiff would need to show to defeat a motion for summary judgment prior to the defendant furnishing of a motivation,that presumption also reduces the facts needed to be pleaded under iqbal.littlejohn,at.because t he discrimination complaint,by definition,occurs in the first stage of the litigation the complaint also benefits from the temporary presumption and must be viewed in light of the plaintiff minimal burden to show discriminatory intent.id.at.
in other words,at the b stage of a title vii suit,allegation of facts supporting a minimal plausible inference of discriminatory intent suffices as to this element of the claim because this entitles the plaintiff to the temporary presumption of mcdonnell douglas until the defendant furnishes its asserted reasons for its action against the plaintiff 
a further question we now face is whether the framework established by the mcdonnell douglas line of cases for claims of discrimination on account of race,religion,or national origin under title vii,and the associated pleading burden we articulated in littlejohn,apply also to title ix claims alleging discrimination on account of sex in education programs or activities that receive federal support.these claims have so much in common that,at least on certain sorts of facts,rules the supreme court established for title vii litigation appear to apply also to such similar claims of sex discrimination under title ix.see yusuf,at c ourts have interpreted title ix by looking to the caselaw interpreting title vii.in several prior cases,we have applied title vii framework and principles to title ix claims.see weinstock columbia,cir.explaining that the title vii framework applies to employment discrimination claims brought under title ix murray.coll.of dentistry,cir.stating that title vii standards should be applied in determining a university liability for a student claim of sexual harassment under title ix see also papelino albany coll.of pharmacy of union,cir.stating that i n certain respects,a title ix sex discrimination claim requires the same kind of proof required in a title vii sex discrimination claim,and applying title vii standards to two sexual harassment claims.
while we did not explicitly state in yusuf that we were incorporating mcdonnell douglas framework into title ix jurisprudence,we did state,after discussing the plaintiff allegations,that s imilar allegations,if based on race in employment decisions,would more than suffice in a title vii case,and we believe they easily meet the requirements of title ix.yusuf,at.we also adopted title vii requirement of proof of discriminatory intent,and stated that a llegations of a causal connection in the case of university disciplinary cases can be of the kind that are found in the familiar setting of title vii cases.id.at.yusuf made clear that title vii cases provide the proper framework for analyzing title ix discrimination claims we therefore hold that the temporary presumption afforded to plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases under title vii applies to sex discrimination plaintiffs under title ix as well.
thus,a complaint under title ix,alleging that the plaintiff was subjected to discrimination on account of sex in the imposition of university discipline,is sufficient with respect to the element of discriminatory intent,like a complaint under title vii,if it pleads specific facts that support a minimal plausible inference of such discrimination.because littlejohn was not decided until after the district court made its decision in this case,and it had not yet been decided that the title vii framework applies to title ix complaints,the district court might not have anticipated that temporary presumption in a plaintiff favor reduces the plaintiff pleading burden,so that the alleged facts need support only a minimal inference of bias.
plaintiff title ix claims 
plaintiff complaint pleads sufficient specific facts giving at least the necessary minimal support to a plausible inference of sex discrimination to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,if title ix other requirements are met.it alleges that columbia hearing panel which erroneously imposed discipline on the plaintiff,its dean who rejected his appeal,and its title ix investigator who influenced the panel and the dean by her report and recommendation,were all motivated in those actions by,bias.those alleged biased attitudes were,at least in part,adopted to refute criticisms circulating in the student body and in the public press that columbia was turning a blind eye to female students charges of sexual assaults by male students.
