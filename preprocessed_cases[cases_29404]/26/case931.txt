factual and procedural background 
statutory framework 
the idea ensures that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,employment,and independent living.d a.the idea primarily seeks to make public education available to handicapped children who were previously excluded from any form of public education.bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley.in particular,the idea aims to address concerns about the apparently widespread practice of relegating handicapped children to private institutions or warehousing them in special education classes.haw.dep t of,cir citing sch.comm.of the town of burlington.dep t of.on the other hand,the idea aims to ensure that handicapped children are provided public education appropriate for their needs,and are not left to fend for themselves in classrooms designed for education of their non handicapped peers.rowley,at.
a free and appropriate public education fape is defined as special education and related services that a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge b meet the standards of the state educational agency c include an appropriate,elementary school,or secondary school education in the state involved and d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section d of this title.in order to provide children with a fape,schools and parents work together to develop an individualized education program iep.schaffer weast.an iep is defined as a written statement for each child with a disability that is developed,reviewed,and revised in accordance with section d of this title.the iep is,in effect,a comprehensive statement of the educational needs of a handicapped child and the specially designed instruction and related services to be employed to meet those needs.burlington,at.
a state must comply both procedurally and substantively with the idea.amanda clark cnty.sch,cir.while the idea does not define the particular substantive level of education that must be provided to a child,the state must provide an education that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.rowley,at.the idea focuses on a set of extensive procedures that must be followed in formulating an iep for a particular child.see.in addition,the idea sets forth a set of procedural safeguards that help ensure that a child receives a fape.see id.a child may file a timely complaint and request a due process hearing for any violation of the idea.id.b,f.during the pendency of the due process hearing,the child is entitled to stay put at his educational placement,regardless of the eventual outcome of the hearing.id.j.
ii.factual background 
is a boy who has been diagnosed with moderate to severe autism.in november,mother,enrolled him at loveland,a private school,after he spent his kindergarten year in public school.subsequently,filed a request for a due process hearing with the doe.the doe and settled the due process request on march.as part of the settlement agreement,the doe agreed to pay tuition at loveland for the school year.in addition to the dismissal with prejudice of the hearing request,agreed to sign consent forms allowing doe employees to conduct observations of at loveland,and to obtain education records.the settlement agreement also required to participate in transition planning for to a department of education public school at the end of the school year,if appropriate.
accordingly,on april,the doe held the first iep meeting for for the school year,with both and the loveland placement director in attendance.at the meeting,the parties agreed to continue the meeting until july due to time constraints.after this initial meeting,the doe conducted one visit at loveland on april,to observe subsequently,sent a letter to the doe placing limitations on future observations of because she felt that the april,visit had been disruptive to him.the doe objected to limitations because they did not comply with the settlement agreement,and because it needed to perform assessments in order to prepare for the upcoming iep meeting.after several delays caused by cancellations of scheduled tests,the tests finally took place in july.
on june,the doe sent a letter proposing dates for the continued iep meeting,and stating that the meeting would be held on july,if failed to respond.having received no response to its june,letter,the doe sent another letter on july,informing her the meeting would be held on july.on july,the doe held the second iep meeting without either or loveland director being in attendance.the doe finalized the iep for for the school year,and sent it to on july,as the child fape,placing him at pearl harbor kai elementary school in a small classroom setting.
did not respond,and at loveland for the school year.the doe sent several letters between august and february regarding the iep developed for,and warned that continued enrollment at loveland was a unilateral decision made by her alone,and that the doe would not be responsible for any tuition payments or reimbursement for school year enrollment at loveland.on february,over seven months after the iep offer was made by the doe,finally responded that enrollment at loveland was not unilateral,and requested that the doe make tuition payments for and the doe exchanged several letters in which they disagreed concerning whether enrollment at loveland was unilateral.no due process hearing request was filed by at that time.
the doe subsequently began preparing for iep.the doe sent letters to requesting progress reports from loveland,and written consent to observe at loveland.no written consent was provided to the doe,though later testified that she gave the doe verbal consent.on july,the doe sent a letter proposing dates for the iep meeting,and stating that the meeting would be held on july,if failed to respond.due to another failure to respond,the iep meeting was held on july,without either or loveland director being in attendance.the doe sent the proposed iep to on august,offering placement at pearl harbor kai for the school year.on august,filed the request for a due process hearing that is at issue in this appeal.
iii.procedural history 
proceedings before the administrative hearing officer 
the administrative hearing officer issued a written decision on april,in which he concluded that the proposed iep was a fape.the hearing officer found that the iep offered the following services minutes of special education per week,minutes of therapy per quarter,minutes of occupational therapy services per quarter,and transportation services.supplemental services were also ordered for,including individualized instructional support during school of hours per week,behavioral instructional support services for four hours per week,and a paraprofessional support after school for two hours,five times a week.the hearing officer also concluded that the individualized instructional support during school and paraprofessional support after school met need for a trainer.
similarly,the hearing officer concluded that the was a fape.the iep offered the following services minutes per week of special education during school and minutes per week after school,minutes of occupational therapy per week,minutes of therapy per week,and transportation services.additional services offered included minutes of paraprofessional services per week during school and minutes per week after school,four hours of behavioral support services per week,and one hour of parent training per month.
the hearing officer also dismissed claims for tuition reimbursement for the loveland school year because enrollment at loveland after the school year had been a unilateral placement,and the reimbursement request,filed over a year after the placement,was untimely.
proceedings in district court 
filed a timely appeal of the administrative decision in the district court.the primary issues presented to the district court were whether the doe placement of at pearl harbor kai for the and school years was a denial of a fape,and whether idea stay put provision applied to keep at loveland during the and school years.the district court affirmed the hearing officer conclusion that the ieps offered in and were sufficient to constitute a fape.the district court also affirmed that the request for reimbursement for the school year was untimely because enrollment at loveland was unilateral.finally,the district court held that loveland was not stay put placement.

discussion 
stay put placement 
before evaluating the substance of the and ieps challenged by,we address argument that he is entitled to stay at loveland until the termination of these proceedings,pursuant to the stay put provision of the idea.the stay put provision provides that during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree,the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child.j.contends that the district court erred in determining that stay put placement was not at loveland.
pre august,effect 
we first hold that is not entitled to reimbursement based on the stay put provision for the school year.the stay put provision may only be invoked during the pendency of any proceedings.j.accordingly,the stay put provision does not apply unless and until a request for a due process hearing is filed.see zvi ambach,cir this provision is,in effect,an automatic preliminary injunction.request for a due process hearing was not filed until august.thus,the stay put provision can have no effect on enrollment at loveland during the school year or during the school year prior to august,during which no due process hearing was pending.
post august,effect 
whether the application of the stay put provision of the idea requires that remain at loveland academy after the filing of the august,due process hearing request depends on whether loveland is current educational placement.j.we have previously recognized that the term current educational placement is not defined within the idea,at.we have interpreted current educational placement to mean the placement set forth in the child last implemented iep.we have offered no additional guidance on the issue.id.internal citation omitted.
the dispute between the doe and centers on the effect,if any,of the march settlement on educational placement.argues that he was placed at loveland by the settlement agreement,and that loveland remained his current educational placement because he continued to attend school and he never accepted any of the subsequent ieps offered by the doe.in response,the doe contends that the settlement agreement only required the doe to pay loveland tuition for the school year and did not make loveland placement for purposes of the stay put provision.we agree with the doe.
we have previously held that a administrative or judicial determination can operate to define the current educational placement of a child.where a parent unilaterally changes the placement of a child,but a subsequent administrative or judicial decision confirms that the parental placement is appropriate,the decision constitute s an agreement by the state to the change of placement and the placement becomes the current educational placement for the purposes of the stay put provision.see clovis unified sch.dist.california office of admin.hearings,cir citing burlington,at see also capistrano unified sch.dist,cir where the agency or the court has ruled on the appropriateness of the educational placement in the parents favor,the school district is responsible for appropriate private education costs regardless of the outcome of an appeal.however,such a favorable decision for a parent must expressly find that the private placement was appropriate.see,at finding that there was no implied current educational placement because the district court ruling in favor of the parents was on procedural grounds and the court never adjudicated the appropriateness of the private placement.
the cited cases do not apply directly to this case because there was no favorable agency or district court decision agreeing with.initial unilateral placement at loveland.rather,urges us to construe the march settlement agreement as having the same effect.we have never determined whether a settlement agreement may have the same legal effect as an affirmative agency decision to define a student current educational placement.however,two cases that have addressed this issue neither of which is binding upon us provide helpful reasoning for our consideration.
in zvi,a student was transferred by his parents to a private school,different from the one in which he had been placed by the state.at.after his parents filed a due process hearing request,the board of education agreed to provide funding at the new private school for the school year through an agreement that also provided for a review of the student classification,to be conducted at the end of the school year with a a view toward placing him in an appropriate public program in september.id.the agency subsequently reevaluated the student and placed him for the school year at a public school.id.the second circuit concluded that the new private school was not the current educational placement because the agreement did not constitute public agency placement of the student at the school and no agency decision ever determined that the parent private placement was appropriate.id.at.thus,during review of his initial placement,the student has a right to a place in a public school or he may remain at the new private school at his parent expense.id.internal citations omitted.while agreeing that the agency would have been required to pay for the student private school education had the agency previously agreed to,or been ordered to provide private school placement,the court stated that p ayment and placement are two different matters.id.
in contrast,urges us to follow the outcome in bayonne board of education.in bayonne,an autistic student was originally placed in a public school,but his parents removed him from that school,placed him in a private school,and filed a request for a due process hearing.id.at.the due process hearing resulted in a settlement agreement wherein the board agreed to undertake the placement of the student at the private school effective march.id.the settlement agreement further stated that the student would return to public school starting september,subject to the satisfaction of fourteen conditions.id.at.the court found the factual situation in bayonne to be distinguishable from that in zvi because the bayonne settlement agreement specifically called for placement.id.at significantly,the child in zvi was never placed in the private school the board of education merely agreed to pay for his tuition until the review of his classification could be conducted.moreover,the bayonne court also recognized that the placement did not necessarily end in september because this transition was subject to the satisfaction of fourteen conditions,and the parties disputed whether these conditions had been met.id.
we do not find the reasoning in zvi and bayonne to be inconsistent.both cases involved settlement agreements,but only the bayonne agreement actually placed the student,whereas the zvi agreement only called for tuition reimbursement.furthermore,the zvi agreement clearly contemplated transition out of the school at the end of the school year,whereas transition to a public school under the bayonne agreement was subject to the satisfaction of fourteen conditions.
we find that case is more analogous to the facts in zvi than those in bayonne.settlement agreement never called for placement,and only required tuition reimbursement.this is not an insignificant semantic difference.rather,it was logical for the doe to settle the case by agreeing to pay tuition for a limited amount of time in order to avoid the costs associated with a full due process hearing.however,it does not follow that,by doing so,the doe had conducted the detailed evaluation required to determine whether loveland was the proper educational institution for under the idea.
moreover,settlement agreement also stated that would transition to a public school at the end of the school year.this fact stands in stark contrast to the conditions that had to be satisfied in the bayonne agreement prior to public school placement.although transition was subject to an if appropriate qualifier,the idea itself requires that any placement be appropriate and thus,the qualifier can not be understood as a negotiated limitation on transition.the settlement agreement could only be reasonably read to be to the school year.the settlement agreement specified in several places that it applied only to the school year tuition was to be reimbursed for the school year doe employees were to conduct evaluations of during the school year and was required to consent to observations of,and the release of his educational records at loveland for the school year.furthermore,the iep proposed by the doe clearly shows that the doe did not consider it appropriate for to remain at loveland.thus,the if appropriate language can not reasonably be read to give the power to unilaterally decide to keep at loveland,and expect the doe to continue paying tuition.accordingly,stay put placement is not at loveland because the march settlement agreement did not place him there,and was limited to the school year 
next refers us to a sixth circuit case,thomas cincinnati board of education,cir,for the proposition that where the dispute arises before any iep has been implemented,the current educational placement will be the operative placement under which the child is actually receiving instruction at the time the dispute arises.though this language,read in isolation,may appear helpful to position,a close examination of the case clearly shows that the case is not on point.thomas involved a child who suffered from severe psychomotor retardation,was prone to seizures,and was required to eat through a feeding tube and breathe through a tracheotomy.id.at.cincinnati public schools originally provided the child with one hour of home training per week,and changed it to one hour of training per day after a change in state funding regulations.id.at.the iep team proposed a placement for the child at an program in a nearby school.id.at.however,of necessity,the child had to be transported to school and,before the iep was implemented,a dispute arose over who would bear the cost of transportation,and whether it would be safe to transport the child in her condition.id.thus,at the time the request for a due process hearing was filed,the child was still receiving care.the court held that the child was to continue receiving care as her stay put placement during the pendency of the proceedings.id.at.thomas differs from situation because the care the child was receiving was provided by the state prior to the iep dispute,and there was no evidence that this prior agreement was.
we acknowledge that the purpose behind the stay put provision of the idea is to maintain the status quo.see,thomas,at.in this case,at the time the due process hearing was filed,had attended loveland for over a year without the doe permission and in spite of numerous letters from the doe stating that they would not pay for his continued attendance there.nothing in the stay put provision prevented from staying at loveland.rather,the issue is who is required to pay for the loveland tuition during the proceedings.were to succeed in this case,and were we to conclude that the doe denied him a fape,may be eligible to receive tuition reimbursement regardless of the stay put provision.see zvi,at.however,applying the reasoning of both zvi and bayonne,we hold that loveland academy is not stay put placement because the doe only agreed to pay tuition for the limited school year,and never affirmatively agreed to place at loveland.
ii.a free and appropriate public education 
next,we consider whether the district court erred in concluding that the and ieps were offers of a fape,and offered an actual placement.we conclude that tuition reimbursement claim for the school year is and that the district court did not err in finding that the and ieps comply with idea requirements.
timeliness of request for tuition reimbursement 
challenges the district court finding that his request for tuition reimbursement for the school year was.the idea provides an opportunity for any party to seek an impartial hearing,and permits a state to set the timeline for when such a request must be filed.b b.hawaii has set a timeline for the filing of a request seeking a due process hearing,in hawaii revised statutes section.the statute,in relevant part,read as follows during the school year 
a an impartial hearing may be requested by any parent or guardian of a child with a disability,or by the department,on any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,program,or placement of a child with a disability provided that the hearing is requested 
within two years of the date the parent,guardian,or department knew or should have known about the alleged action that formed the basis of the request for a hearing and 
notwithstanding paragraph,within ninety days of a unilateral special education placement,where the request is for reimbursement of the costs of the placement.
thus,whether the or day statute of limitations applies depends on whether a placement is a unilateral special education placement.id.
unilateral placement 
contends that a unilateral placement occurs only when a parent physically removes the child from public school and enrolls him or her in a private school,without doe agreement.also asserts that his placement at loveland was bilateral because it was agreed upon in the settlement agreement with the doe,and that settlement agreement was not.
the term unilateral placement is not defined by statute,and at least two courts have concluded that the legislative history of section is silent on the meaning of unilateral and placement.see dep t of,d,makiko hawaii,cv,wl,at haw.april.nevertheless,the makiko court defined the term as follows,based on its plain meaning a unilateral special education placement occurs when one party unilaterally,without consent or agreement of the other party enrolls the student in a special education program.id.at.for purposes of this opinion,and given the plain meaning of the statute,we adopt the definition of unilateral special education placement used in makiko d.as so defined,the term unilateral special education placement does not support contention that placement only occurs upon the physical removal of a student from one school to another.here,the agreement between the doe and ended after the school year,and the doe proposed a new iep placing at a different school.however,unilaterally decided to enroll at loveland for the school year.this enrollment thus occurred without consent or agreement of the other party.id.
contention that the settlement agreement is not is likewise without merit,as discussed supra at section,in our stay put provision analysis.also argues that the settlement agreement somehow modifies enrollment at loveland to be bilateral from that point forward.claims that the effect of the agreement is analogous to situations in which a hearing officer decision in favor of the parent changes a unilateral placement to a bilateral placement.to support this argument,cites department of education,which held that a favorable administrative ruling constituted the state agreement to the private placement and changed an otherwise unilateral placement to a bilateral placement.d at.however,in so holding,the court relied on the reasoning that we have applied to the stay put provision of the idea.id.citing burlington,at holding same in the context of the stay put provision of the idea and clover,at holding same also in the stay put context.thus,just as we found that loveland was not stay put placement based on the settlement agreement,we also conclude that the settlement agreement did not operate to change the placement from unilateral to bilateral.
ii.timeliness of the school year claim 
because enrollment at loveland for the school year is a unilateral placement,the day statute of limitation applies.filed his request for an impartial due process hearing challenging the iep on august.this was over a year after his enrollment at loveland for the school year.thus,claim requesting tuition reimbursement for the school year is barred by the statute of limitations in section.
b.the and ieps 
a state must comply both procedurally and substantively with the idea.fed.way sch,cir.the court must determine whether the state complied with procedures set forth in the idea and whether the state developed an iep that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.rowley,at.procedural violations may be harmless if they do not result in a loss of educational opportunity or significantly restrict parental participation.at.challenges the and ieps on several procedural and substantive grounds.
procedural requirements 
predetermined placement 
first procedural contention is that placement was determined prior to the iep meeting,in violation of the idea.asserts that the doe settled on pearl harbor kai as a placement for about three weeks after the settlement agreement was signed in march,and that the iep team did not consider any other placement options for 
a school district violates the idea if it predetermines placement for a student before the iep is developed or steers the iep to the predetermined placement.bd.of tr.of target range sch.dist,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,as recognized in napa valley unified sch,cir see also spielberg henrico cnty.pub,cir.predetermination violates the idea because the act requires that the placement be based on the iep,and not vice versa.spielberg,at.
here,the fact that the doe scouted out pearl harbor kai in march of as a place of potential placement for the iep is not conclusive evidence that the doe had decided to place there.see,doyle arlington cnty.sch,noting that school officials must come to an iep meeting with an open mind but may have given thought to placement.the first iep meeting was held on april,shortly after the doe visit to pearl harbor kai.however,a review of the prior written notices of placement from the and ieps indicates that other options were considered,including placement at loveland,at another private school setting at hauoli na kekei,and in a full inclusion class setting with same age peers without resource special education services.the doe rejected the full inclusion class setting because required a more distraction free environment with more specialized activities to target his learning style and rate of learning.the doe rejected hauoli na kekei because it only enrolls children with severe communication and behavioral needs,and it feared that might not develop his potential communication skills in that setting.finally,the doe rejected loveland because pearl harbor kai was a less restrictive environment where could receive similar services to those he was receiving at loveland and,in addition,have immediate access to peers in that community.thus,the record reveals that the doe considered other options besides pearl harbor kai,reasonably rejected them,and therefore did not predetermine placement.
parental participation in the iep process 
also argues that his parent,was deprived of an opportunity to participate in the iep process,and that the district court erred in blaming for not cooperating with the iep team,and missing both the july and july iep meetings.
parental participation in the iep process is an integral part of the idea.see amanda,at.the regulations require the doe to take steps to ensure that the parents of a disabled student is present at the iep meeting,or at least afforded the opportunity to participate.a.however,an iep meeting may take place without a parent in attendance if the agency is unable to convince the parent that they should attend.id.d.in such a situation,the agency must keep a record of its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed on time and place.d see also shapiro ex rel.shapiro paradise valley unified sch,cir t he school district must document phone calls,correspondence,and visits to the parents demonstrating attempts to reach a mutually agreed upon place and time for the meeting.we conclude that the record clearly reveals that the doe attempted to have participate in both the and iep meetings.
and the loveland director were in attendance at the first iep meeting held on april,which was continued to july due to time constraints.and the doe continued to correspond from may through july regarding the scheduling of tests for,in preparation for his iep.on june,the doe wrote a letter reminding her that the parties had agreed to continue the april iep meeting to july,and suggesting three possible dates for the meeting.the letter also indicated that if did not respond by july,the meeting would be held on july.signed for receipt of this letter on june.the doe did not receive a response to its june letter,and sent another letter on july,stating that because it had not heard from c,the meeting was scheduled for july.signed for receipt of this letter on july.
this meeting correspondence shows that the doe presented with several opportunities to raise any concerns with the proposed meeting date.the hearing officer and district court both found that,after the fact,gave conflicting stories about why she was not present at the meeting.originally testified that she was escorting her son to the mainland for the entire month of july,as required by a divorce decree,but later changed her testimony,and admitted that she was in hawaii,but contended that she could not attend the meeting because she had started a new job and needed money.the record is devoid of any evidence showing that attempted to contact the doe to reschedule the meeting.see shapiro,at finding that because the parents asked to reschedule the meeting,the school district violated the idea by prioritizing the schedule of its representatives over the parents.indeed,even after the iep meeting occurred,still failed to respond to several letters from the doe sent in july,august,october,december,and february,respectively asking whether she accepted the iep offered to,and encouraging her to contact the doe to discuss any concerns,changes,or issues regarding the iep.we conclude that this record clearly shows that the doe satisfied its duty to involve in the iep process,as required under the idea.
similarly,the record shows that the doe also attempted to find a mutually acceptable time and place for the july iep meetin
