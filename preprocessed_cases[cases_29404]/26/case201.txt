the cerras removed their daughter kathryn from pawling high school at the start of the school year after objecting to the district proposed plan for special education services for her year.they enrolled kathryn in the landmark school,an,private residential school,and requested an impartial due process hearing under idea to obtain tuition reimbursement.see f.after a lengthy hearing,an impartial hearing officer iho denied their claim and a state review officer sro affirmed the dismissal in a detailed opinion.the cerras then pursued their claim in district court.disregarding the findings below,the district court held that the district had violated both the procedural and substantive requirements of idea.accordingly,it granted the cerras summary judgment and awarded them full tuition reimbursement,as well as attorneys fees and costs.

background 
in january,midway through the school year,the cerras enrolled kathryn in pawling high school,where she completed the ninth grade in the regular education program in june,kathryn received a psychological evaluation by karen arnhold,a school psychologist.arnhold report indicated that kathryn had average overall intelligence,but that she was a remediated dyslexic whose r eading comprehension was seriously discrepant with grade expectations and whose verbal memory was mildly disordered.the report also indicated that she had an attention disorder.consequently,on june,the district classified kathryn as learning disabled and developed an individualized education program iep for her for the summer of,as required by idea.see d.
at the end of the summer,kathryn was given an iep for the school year.it placed her in the school regular education program,supplemented by weekly consultant teacher services sessions.see m defining consultant teacher services.these special sessions consisted of group instruction with a student to teacher ratio of up to to.the iep also required preferential seating in the classroom and gave kathryn twice the amount of time to take tests.
on october,the district committee on special education cse held a meeting with cerra in attendance to discuss and revise kathryn iep based on a report by ronda facchini,who had conducted a neuropsychological evaluation of kathryn at her parents request.facchini report concluded that kathryn would be most appropriately educated in a specialized school for children with learning issues and noted that she should be engaged in psychotherapy to aid her emotional development.the cse determined that kathryn could successfully progress in the regular classroom with modifications and support in skill development,but amended the iep to provide tutorials two days a week instead of consultant teacher services.the revised iep also added educational counseling sessions two days a week.
while kathryn availed herself of these services in november and early december,she did not attend the tutoring or counseling sessions from december,through march,consequently,members of the cse met with the cerras in march to develop a more workable program.without formally amending kathryn iep,it was decided that kathryn would stop attending tutoring and counseling sessions at the elementary school,and instead would resume consultant teacher services at the high school in a small group setting.kathryn attended the sessions through most of may,except during a short period when her mother told her not to go because of a dispute with her teacher.
on may,seventeen days before the school year ended,the district director of special education,althea schepperly,convened a meeting with cerra and some of kathryn teachers and counselors to make plans to help kathryn pass the regents exams.the group discussed kathryn reading comprehension difficulties and arranged for her to be tutored daily during lunch and.
on june,the cse held its annual review of kathryn educational program,with cerra in attendance.the group first discussed kathryn fourth quarter grades,all of which were passing,but very low.cerra expressed that she believed the poor grades showed that kathryn had regressed during the year and that the cse needed to come up with a better plan.the group then discussed kathryn iep.the cse proposed offering kathryn one period of resource room instruction and one period of a special reading class each day,both of which would have to ratios.see rr defining resource room program.the cse also recommended study guides,class notes,an additional set of textbooks,testing modifications,and preferential seating away from social peers.cerra requested that she and her husband be sent kathryn new iep early in the summer so that they would have an opportunity to review it.
near the end of the meeting,kathryn consultant teacher,schreiber,provided cerra with a draft copy of the goals and objectives for kathryn proposed iep.schreiber explained that she was providing the draft so that when you do get the iep over the summer,you can check it against what i submitted here today in june.the draft was apparently coded in a confusing way,leading cerra to say,i t all greek to me.schreiber explained that the final iep would not be coded and also reiterated that the draft was only intended to provide an advance copy of the objectives that she could compare with the iep when she received it.
over the summer,the cerras sent several letters to the school district requesting the iep and also asking for class profiles for the proposed reading class and resource room sessions,which would identify the other students in the classes.having not yet received the iep,on august and,appellees sent letters to the district requesting an impartial hearing pursuant to idea,informing the district that they were enrolling kathryn in the landmark school,a private residential school in massachusetts,and demanding reimbursement for tuition,legal fees,expenses,associated costs and transportation see f.
on august,the district advised the cerras that the cse had appointed an iho,but that in an effort to avert unnecessary litigation,it had scheduled a meeting on september,day before the first day of review and reconsider the cse recommendations for the iep.the district mailed kathryn iep to the cerras on august.cerra requested that the september meeting be rescheduled for september,at which time he informed the district that he would save his objections to the iep for the impartial hearing.
the impartial hearing began on september,and ultimately ended on march,ten days of testimony scatted sporadically throughout this nearly time period,eleven witnesses,and approximately transcript pages.the cerras argued that the school district had violated the procedural requirements of idea by failing to provide the iep in a timely fashion,disregarding their requests for class profiles,and generally failing to provide them a meaningful opportunity to participate in the formulation of the iep.they also argued that the iep was substantively inadequate for a variety of reasons.by contrast,they contended,the curriculum at landmark school met kathryn educational needs for a variety of reasons.
the iho rejected plaintiffs claims and found in favor of the district.first,the iho found that the district had not violated the procedural requirements of the idea because it had provided the cerras with kathryn iep and scheduled a meeting about the iep before the school year began.in addition,the iho found,the district had offered the parents of kathryn an adequate,free and appropriate public school placement for the school year.the iho also held that the cerras were not entitled to reimbursement because they had failed to demonstrate that landmark school,a residential school miles from the cerras home,would provide kathryn with an appropriate education in the least restrictive environment.
the sro affirmed in a lengthy,detailed opinion.citing the cerras participation at several planning meetings,the sro first found that their procedural rights under idea were adequately protected because the parents were significantly involved in developing kathryn educational program.the sro also found that the iep was both adequate and appropriate,that it was likely to produce progress,and that kathryn had made progress on her iep goals and objectives when she took advantage of the services offered to her.tellingly,the sro also noted that the student attendance at sessions designed to provide extra assistance was sporadic despite respondent efforts to accommodate student and parent preferences while addressing the student needs.
the cerras then appealed to the district court,which,on the record below,granted them summary judgment.the district court found that the district had violated idea procedural requirements by fail ing to provide plaintiffs with the requested documents concerning kathryn proposed classes,and failing to provide the iep in a timely fashion.the court also found that the iep was substantively inadequate because it was not likely to produce progress nor confer any meaningful benefit upon kathryn.because of the combination of procedural and substantive inadequacies in the iep,the district court concluded,it could not be sure that kathryn would have been provided with a free appropriate public education.the district court further found that the iho had erred in focusing on whether the landmark school was the least restrictive environment.accordingly,it awarded tuition reimbursement and attorneys fees and costs to the cerras.
the district appeals.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court award of summary judgment.see ex rel.bd.of,cir.whether the district court correctly applied the idea statutory and regulatory provisions to the facts of a particular case is a mixed question of law and fact,which we also review de novo.see ex rel.pawlet sch,cir.
in reviewing the administrative proceedings,it is critical to recall that idea statutory scheme requires substantial deference to state administrative bodies on matters of educational policy.see generally bd.of educ.rowley,d discussing the nature of federal judicial review of administrative decisions in idea cases.although the district court must engage in an independent review of the administrative record and make a determination based on a preponderance of the evidence,milford bd.of,cir,the supreme court has cautioned that such review is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.rowley,at.as our court has explained,w hile federal courts do not simply rubber stamp administrative decisions,they are expected to give due weight to these proceedings,mindful that the judiciary generally lacks the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.walczak.union free sch,cir quoting rowley,at.some internal quotations omitted.
to receive federal funding under idea,a state must,among other things,provide all children with disabilities with a free appropriate public education.a a.when a state receiving idea funding fails to give a disabled child such an education,the child parent may remove the child to an appropriate private school and then seek retroactive tuition reimbursement from the state,at citing sch.comm.of burlington dep t of,d.
to determine whether parents who sue under idea to challenge a proposed iep are entitled to private school tuition reimbursement,we engage in a three step process.the first two steps focus on whether the proposed iep was inadequate to afford the child an appropriate public education.walczak,at citing burlington,at.first,we examine whether the state has complied with the procedures set forth in the idea.see walczak,at.second,we consider whether the iep developed through the act procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.id.quoting rowley,at.if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.rowley,at.if,however,the iep is procedurally or substantively deficient,we proceed to the third step and ask whether the private schooling obtained by the parents is appropriate to the child needs.see walczak,at.
here,the district and amicus argue that the district court erred at each step of the analysis.because we conclude that the district complied with the idea procedural and substantive requirements,we need not reach the third step.
compliance with idea procedural requirements 
in considering whether the district fulfilled idea procedural obligations,we focus on whether the cerras had an adequate opportunity to participate in the development of kathryn iep.to ensure parental participation,the act requires,inter alia,
a n opportunity for the parents of a child with a disability to examine all records relating to such child and to participate in meetings with respect to the identification,evaluation,and educational placement of the child,and the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child,and to obtain an independent evaluation of the child.
b.the regulations governing parental participation provide that e ach public agency shall take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents of a child with a disability are present at each iep meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate.a.the regulations go on to state that t he public agency shall give the parent a copy of the child iep at no cost to the parent.f.t he importance congress attached to these procedural safeguards can not be gainsaid.rowley,at.
the district court concluded that the proposed iep for kathryn school year was procedurally inadequate because the district fail ed to provide plaintiffs with the requested documents concerning her proposed classes,and failed to provide the iep in a timely fashion which would have afforded plaintiffs an opportunity to evaluate the proposed program.by contrast,the sro found that idea procedural requirements were satisfied because the cerras were significantly involved in developing kathryn special education plans,as evidenced by cerra participation at the may,and june,meetings.the sro noted that the transcripts of the two meetings reflected that cerra actively participated in discussing kathryn needs,the goals of her and ieps,and her teachers concerns.
we agree with the sro that the district fulfilled the act procedural obligations.the cerras had numerous opportunities to participate in meetings with respect to the identification,evaluation,and educational placement of the child throughout the school year,as well as in preparation for the school year.b.in addition to attending meetings on october,march,and may,cerra participated actively in the june,cse meeting,which was specifically focused on developing kathryn iep.the transcript of that meeting shows that the group discussed kathryn educational progress,her health,and the goals and objectives she should be achieving,and that cerra was frequently consulted for input about the cse proposed plan.moreover,as soon as the district found out that the cerras intended to send kathryn to a private residential school,it scheduled another meeting to discuss the iep before the school year began.
although the district court acknowledged cerra participation in the june,meeting,it suggested that her participation in that meeting was not meaningful because she could not understand the coded document schreiber gave her toward the end of the meeting.the department of education has instructed that when a school district bring s drafts of some or all of the iep content to the iep meeting,the re
