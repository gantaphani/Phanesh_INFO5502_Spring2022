opinion of the court 
appellee francis dougherty,a former employee with the school district of philadelphia,was terminated after publicly disclosing the alleged misconduct of the school district superintendent in steering a prime contract to a business.dougherty filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,alleging first amendment retaliation and violations of the pennsylvania whistleblower law.appellants challenge the district court denial of their motions for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.we will affirm.
francis dougherty previously served as the deputy chief business officer for operations and acting chief of operations for the office of the deputy superintendent within the school district of philadelphia.in this role,dougherty was accountable for the school district operational departments,including the office of capital programs ocp.ocp developed projects and solicited bids for all capital works within the school district,subject to the school reform commission src approval.dougherty reported to deputy superintendent leroy nunery,who in turn reported to superintendent arlene ackerman.
on september,ackerman directed ocp to install new security cameras across the school district nineteen persistently dangerous schools.dougherty was instructed to lead the procurement process,which was to be completed within to days.due to the short time frame,ocp could not utilize its usual competitive bidding process.therefore,pursuant to school district policy,ocp was required to select a contractor,a contractor with an existing contract with the school district or another state agency that was obtained through a competitive bid.dougherty and his team identified security and data technologies,sdt as one such contractor.
after dougherty team prepared a proposal and drew up an implementation plan with sdt for the camera project,dougherty submitted a completed resolution to nunery for review.pursuant to school district policy,the superintendent is required to approve the resolution before it is presented to the src for consideration and final approval.in this instance,dougherty did not receive a response from either nunery or ackerman,nor was the resolution presented to the src at its next meeting.
rather,on september,ackerman convened a meeting with dougherty,nunery,and several other operations employees.ackerman allegedly rejected the sdt proposal for lack of minority participation and directed that ibs communications,ibs,a firm,be awarded the prime contract instead.ibs was not a contractor and was therefore ineligible for contracts.however,ackerman submitted ibs implementation plan to the src for review at its october meeting,and the src ratified the plan at its voting meeting on october.
at the september meeting,ackerman also transferred management responsibility for the camera project to the school district procurement director,whose department did not ordinarily handle this type of project.subsequently,dougherty was not included in a camera project personnel meeting called by nunery in november to discuss a complaint made by ibs.nunery criticized the staff and blamed dougherty for obstructing ibs work.an upset dougherty sent nunery an email rejecting his allegations and requesting to discuss the issue.
on november,dougherty met with reporters from the philadelphia inquirer concerning ackerman alleged wrongdoing in connection with the ibs contract.on november,the philadelphia inquirer published an article headlined,ackerman steered work,sources say.app.it was the first of several articles accusing ackerman of steering the contract to ibs in violation of state guidelines and school district policies and procedures.dougherty also submitted a report to the fbi tips and public leads website,contacted several state representatives,and submitted a hotline report to the office of inspector general for the department of education.
the day after the philadelphia inquirer article was published,dougherty was called to a meeting with ackerman and nunery.ackerman vowed to get to the bottom of who leaked the information and stated she could fire dougherty over this information getting to the press.on december,ackerman and her direct reports decided a investigation was needed,and,in an effort initiated by ackerman,placed dougherty and five others on administrative leave pending the investigation.when estelle matthews,the school district human resources executive,suspended dougherty,dougherty told matthews that he was in fact the leak and had already gone to federal law enforcement agencies.
several days later,ackerman hired michael schwartz of pepper hamilton llp pepper hamilton to conduct the investigation.there is a significant factual dispute as to the nature of the investigation.dougherty contends that ackerman specifically instructed schwartz to find the source of the leak.schwartz maintains,however,that the scope of the investigation was limited to discovering a ll of the facts surrounding the decision to award these contracts and whether anyone at the school district had violated school district policies or pennsylvania or federal laws.app.first alternation in original.the relevant confidentiality provision of the school district code of ethics provides a school district employee shall not disclose confidential information concerning property,personnel matters,or affairs of the school district or its employees,without proper authorization nothing in this provision shall be interpreted as prohibiting the practice of.app.
in march,pepper hamilton issued its report,concluding that there was no evidence of unlawful motive in the award of the ibs contract.pepper hamilton did find,however,that dougherty violated the code of ethics by emailing information about the sdt proposal to an unknown email before the september meeting.the investigation also revealed that dougherty emailed large volumes of confidential information related to the camera project to his personal email address which is not a violation of the code of ethics per se beginning on november.
following the investigation,dougherty was notified that the school district was recommending his termination to the src.it explained that dougherty had breached or,the school district alleged,attempted to breach the confidentiality section of the code of ethics when he forwarded emails to an unknown email address and to his personal email address.it also emphasized that dougherty refusal to cooperate in the investigation after he had been suspended and retained a lawyer prevented the school district from reaching any other conclusion.on april,the src terminated dougherty.
on february,dougherty filed a complaint against the school district of philadelphia,ackerman,nunery,matthews,the src,and four individual src in the eastern district of pennsylvania.he claimed that appellants terminated him in retaliation for his disclosure of ackerman alleged misconduct to the philadelphia inquirer and law enforcement agencies,in violation of the first amendment under and pennsylvania whistleblower law.stat.ann,et.
in august,the school district,nunery,and matthews filed a joint motion for summary judgment and asserted the defense of qualified immunity as to dougherty first amendment retaliation claim.anthony antognoli,on behalf of the estate of ackerman filed a motion for summary judgment one month later and asserted the same defense.the district court held that the summary judgment record was sufficient to show a violation of a clearly established constitutional right,and it denied both motions in an order submitted september.nunery,matthews,and antognoli filed this interlocutory appeal challenging the denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.the district court further elucidated its order with a supplemental opinion.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to dougherty,the district court explained that dougherty allegations were sufficient to establish a first amendment retaliation claim.first,it found no evidence suggesting dougherty speech fell within the scope of his duties to recognize the alleged misconduct as such and report it,app,and,therefore,concluded that dougherty spoke as a citizen under garcetti ceballos,d.second,it found no evidence compel ling a conclusion that dougherty and appellants had such close working relationships that his reports to the press would undermine their ability to work together,tipping the balancing test established in pickering board of education,d,in his favor.app.finally,the district court found that appellants motivation for firing dougherty was a disputed issue of material fact and concluded that dougherty made a sufficient showing of improper motivation to put the issue before a jury.
turning to whether the right was clearly established,the district court found that a reasonable governmental official would have been on notice that retaliating against dougherty speech was unlawful.thus,it concluded that appellants were not entitled to qualified immunity.the district court stayed its proceedings pending this appeal.
the district court properly exercised jurisdiction under,and this court has jurisdiction under pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.under the collateral order doctrine,an interlocutory order is immediately appealable as a final decision within the meaning of if it conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.johnson jones,d internal quotation marks omitted first,third,and fifth alternations in original.it is well established that an order denying summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds may qualify as an appealable final decision under the collateral order doctrine.see mitchell forsyth,d.however,appellate jurisdiction exists only to the extent that the order turns on an issue of law.id.at.
accordingly,for each of appellants claims,we possess jurisdiction to review whether the set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly established constitutional right however,we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is sufficient to prove.ziccardi city of,cir see also monteiro city of elizabeth,cir w hen qualified immunity depends on disputed issues of fact,those issues must be determined by the jury.
to the extent we have jurisdiction,this court exercises plenary review over an appeal from a denial of summary judgment based on a lack of qualified immunity.reilly city of atl.city,cir.a court may grant summary judgment only when the record shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in determining whether there is a genuine issue of fact for trial,w e must view the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion mcgreevy stroup,cir.
qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.reichle howards,d.the qualified immunity analysis is a process,which a court may address in either order according to its discretion.pearson callahan,d.here,we first decide whether the facts,taken in the light most favorable to dougherty,establish that the appellants conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.second,we determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.id.
under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis,we must decide whether a constitutional violation here,first amendment retaliation was established based on the facts identified by the district court.a state may not discharge an employee on a basis that infringes that employee constitutionally protected interest in freedom of speech.rankin mcpherson,d.to establish a first amendment retaliation claim,a public employee must show that his speech is protected by the first amendment and the speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged retaliatory action,which,if both are proved,shifts the burden to the employer to prove that the same action would have been taken even if the speech had not occurred.see gorum sessoms,cir.
we need not reach the second and third elements of dougherty first amendment retaliation claim,which present questions of fact and are not contested in this appeal.the district court concluded that dougherty adduced sufficient evidence to present these questions to a jury,and we do not have jurisdiction to review that conclusion under the collateral order doctrine.see reilly,at monteiro,at.
rather,central to the question presented here,we focus on whether the set of facts identified by the district court establishes that dougherty speech is entitled to protection by the first amendment.this is a question of law,appropriate for appellate review.connick myers,d.
as the supreme court has reiterated time and time again,free and unhindered debate on matters of public importance is the core value of the free speech clause of the first amendment.pickering,at.accordingly,public employees do not surrender all their first amendment rights by reason of their employment.garcetti,at.at the same time,the supreme court also aptly recognizes the government countervailing interest as an employer in maintaining control over their employees words and actions for the proper performance of the workplace.see id.at.thus,s o long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern,they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.id.at.
with this backdrop,we conduct a inquiry to determine whether a public employee speech is protected first,the employee must speak as a citizen,not as an employee,under the test established in garcetti and recently reiterated by the supreme court in lane franks,d second,the speech must involve a matter of public concern,which is here undisputed and third,the government must lack an adequate justification for treating the employee differently than the general public based on its needs as an employer under the pickering balancing test.gorum,at internal quotation marks omitted.we address the garcetti and pickering inquiries in turn.
garcetti establishes that when public employees speak pursuant to their official duties,that speech does not receive first amendment protection.at.this is because,when doing so,employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.id.the rationale underlying this distinction promote s the individual and societal interests that are served when employees speak as citizens on matters of public concern,while respect ing the needs of government employers attempting to perform their important public functions.id.at.
in garcetti,the supreme court held that a prosecutor internal memorandum advising his supervisors of the disposition of a pending case was speech made pursuant to his official duties.id.at.it reasoned that writing the memo was part of the prosecutor daily professional activities as a government employee,distinguishable from the kind of activity engaged in by citizens who do not work for the government.id.at.finding that the prosecutor did not speak as a citizen,therefore,simply reflect ed the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.id.at.
the garcetti court explicitly declined to advance a framework for defining when an employee speaks pursuant to his official duties,explaining that t he proper inquiry is a practical one.id.at.this reflects the enormous variety of fact situations in which a public employee claims first amendment protection.id.at quoting pickering,at.
this court has given contours to garcetti practical inquiry for defining the scope of an employee duties.we declined to extend first amendment protection to speech where public employees were required to take the speech up the chain of command,foraker chaffinch,cir holding that police officers statements concerning hazardous conditions at a firing range were made within their official duties since they were obligated to report that type of information up the chain of command,abrogated on other grounds by borough of duryea guarnieri,d,and where an employee speech related to special knowledge or experience acquired through his de facto job duties,gorum,at internal quotation marks omitted holding that a professor speech at a student disciplinary hearing was made within his official duties since the professor had special knowledge and experience with the university disciplinary code as a de facto advisor to students with disciplinary issues.w hether a particular incident of speech is made within a particular plaintiff job duties is a mixed question of fact and law.foraker,at.
applying garcetti test to the facts the district court identified in the light most favorable to dougherty,we agree that dougherty did not speak pursuant to his official duties when he disclosed details of ackerman alleged misconduct in awarding the prime contract to ibs.the district court found no evidence that dougherty communication with the philadelphia inquirer fell within the scope of his routine job responsibilities at the school district.unlike the employees in garcetti,foraker,and gorum,nothing about dougherty position compelled or called for him to provide or report this information,whether to the school district,the press,or any other source.app.to the contrary,the school district appears to discourage such speech through its code of ethics confidentiality provision,which is being used to justify dougherty termination in the instant case.dougherty report to the philadelphia inquirer,therefore,was made as a citizen for first amendment purposes and should not be foreclosed from constitutional protection.
faced with the district court application of garcetti,and precluded from challenging the factual sufficiency of the summary judgment record,see ziccardi,at,appellants instead allege that the district court failed to use the proper legal standard.they replace garcetti pursuant to official duties test with one that precludes first amendment protection for speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities.see appellants br.at quoting garcetti,at.after plucking garcetti language to canonize a new standard,appellants rely on gorum to argue that,because the content of dougherty speech was gained from special knowledge and experience with the camera project entrusted to dougherty,his speech owes its existence to his professional duties.
these arguments ask us to read garcetti far too broadly.this court has never applied the owes its existence to test that appellants wish to advance,and for good reason this nearly standard would eviscerate citizen speech by public employees simply because they learned the information in the course of their employment,which is at odds with the delicate balancing and policy rationales underlying garcetti.
to this end,it bears emphasis that whether an employee speech concern s the subject matter of his employment is nondispositive under garcetti.at.this is because the first amendment necessarily protects some expressions related to the speaker job.id.in fact,as the supreme court recently reiterated,speech by public employees holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.lane.at emphasis added see also city of san diego roe,d per curiam observing,in the public concern context,that public employees are uniquely qualified to comment on matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large pickering,at teachers are,as a class,the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operations of the schools should be spent.accordingly,it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.
moreover,appellants misread gorum holding.we reemphasized in gorum that garcetti pursuant to official duties test requires a practical inquiry.at see also foraker,at describing the nature of the practical inquiry as.we concluded that,although advising at disciplinary hearings was not listed in the professor formal job description,his extensive knowledge and experience with disciplinary actions as a de facto disciplinary advisor rendered that speech within his job duties nonetheless.gorum,at garcetti,at l isting of a given task in an employee written job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee professional duties for first amendment purposes.accordingly,appellants attempt to preclude first amendment protection from dougherty report a duty absent from both his de facto and de jure responsibilities is inapt.
in addition,taking this opportunity to respond to the parties differing interpretations of the supreme court recent decision in lane,we conclude that lane reinforces garcetti holding that a public employee may speak as a citizen even if his speech involves the subject matter of his employment.
in lane,the supreme court held that truthful sworn testimony,compelled by subpoena and made outside the scope of the employee ordinary job responsibilities,is protected under the first amendment.at.edward lane,a program director at a community college,was terminated after he was compelled to testify about a former employee misuse of state funds that he discovered in the course of a financial audit.id.at.the eleventh circuit held that lane acted pursuant to his official duties when he investigated and reported the fraud,and,therefore,concluded that his testimony owe d its existence to his official responsibilities,foreclosing first amendment protection.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court unanimously reversed this conclusion it reasoned,like we do,that the eleventh circuit read garcetti far too broadly by ignoring garcetti explicit qualification that its holding did not turn on the fact that the memo at issue concerned the subject matter of the prosecutor employment.id.at alternation in original quoting garcetti,at.after analyzing garcetti,the court emphasized t he mere fact that a citizen speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee rather than citizen speech.id.rather,t he critical question under garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee duties,not whether it merely concerns those duties.id.thus,lane rejects the very contention appellants advance.
while lane focused on speech in the context of compelled testimony,see id.at,appellants argument that its holding is limited to that context is misguided.mpoy rhee,applying lane to a teacher critical emails concerning classroom conditions.the supreme court focus on sworn testimony was in response to the short shrift the eleventh circuit gave to that speech,which presented a circuit split when compared to this court holding in reilly city of atlantic city,at.lane.at.even after recognizing that sworn testimony in this case is far removed from the speech at issue in garcetti,the court located its rule of decision in garcetti and applied the critical question under garcetti to the facts in lane.id.at.if anything,lane may broaden garcetti holding by including ordinary as a modifier to the scope of an employee job duties.see mpoy,at t he use of the adjective ordinary which the court repeated nine times could signal a narrowing of the realm of employee speech left unprotected by garcetti.however,that question is not before us today.
under lane,our determination stands that dougherty report to the philadelphia inquirer was not made pursuant to his official job duties.dougherty claim is not foreclosed merely because the subject matter of the speech concerns or relates to those duties.
even though we find that dougherty spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,his speech is protected only if the pickering balancing test tilts in
