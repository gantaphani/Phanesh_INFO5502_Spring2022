opinion of the court 
in this civil rights action,plaintiff,a third grade elementary school student,sued her teachers,school principal and school board for damages under for allegedly preventing her from circulating a petition objecting to a planned third grade outing to the circus.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.we will affirm.
plaintiff amanda was a third grade student at the lackawanna trail elementary school.third grade class planned a voluntary field trip to the shriner circus in on april.did not approve of the voluntary outing because she believed the circus was cruel to animals.as a result,she prepared a handwritten petition stating,we grade kids do want to go to the circus because they hurt animals.we want a better feild sic trip.on february,brought the petition to the playground at recess,where she persuaded more than thirty of her classmates to sign it.
the following day,february,was at her classroom desk during a class period of silent reading and independent work.a few students gathered at desk.the classroom teacher,elaine mercanti,while breaking up the gathering,observed the petition on desk and told her to put it away.
later that day,again brought her petition to the schoolyard at recess.defendant pat carpenter,one of the teachers supervising recess,observed a group of students around near a patch of ice on the playground.carpenter then noticed that one of the female students was had fallen on the ice and was bleeding.carpenter observed with a pencil or pen and the petition in the middle of the students and fearing that a student might be injured by the pencil or pen,instructed to put the objects away.contends that carpenter told her either put it away or you ca have that here.
was never punished for soliciting signatures for her petition or for possessing the petition.furthermore,attended the lackawanna school board meeting on february,in order to express her opposition to the scheduled circus field trip.
on april,the third grade class attended the shriner circus as planned.and her mother stood outside the circus and protested alleged cruelty to animals.local media covered the protest.
the day prior,april,to pass out coloring books and stickers which dealt with cruelty to animals at the circus to her fellow students at school.
there was also some interplay between walker and michael school officials.when returned home on february,she informed her mother that she was not permitted to circulate her petition.walker telephoned defendant nancy simon,principal of the lackawanna trail elementary school,and defendant donald leonard,president of the school board.
shortly thereafter,lisa walker and michael serrano retained an attorney,who sent the school district a letter raising concerns about possible violations of first amendment rights.the district solicitor,sandra boyle,responded that no rights were violated because was not prevented from expressing her views on the circus she was simply told to put the petition away when her activities briefly disrupted classroom instruction and may have contributed to a situation where another child fell down during recess.boyle also expressed the view that e lementary schools are not generally the environment for petition circulation.
on february,parents accompanied her to the school board meeting to raise their concerns about the handling of the petition.parents spoke,and the board and principal simon received copies of the petition,but no action was taken.three days later,solicitor boyle sent a letter to attorney noting a school policy that requires prior review of materials to be distributed by students.
counsel suggested that the presentation at the board meeting should satisfy the requirements of the policy and that,because the policy allows distribution after two days of inaction by the school,could circulate the petition.boyle responded that the petition had not been properly presented for review.no request to circulate the petition was made after this time.
by her parents,sued the president of the lackawanna school board,donald leonard the superintendent of the school district,clyde ellsworth principal nancy simon and teacher pat carpenter,all in their personal and official capacities.they seek damages from the defendants individually and from the school district for alleged violations of rights to freedom of speech and association,violations of her right to petition for redress of grievances,and also under several state constitutional and common law causes of action.
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding first amendment rights were not violated as a matter of law,and finding defendants entitled to qualified immunity.the district court also concluded the school the person of donald leonard in his official not be liable,as it lacked sufficient involvement in the actions complained of.plaintiff appealed.
the public school environment presents special challenges for determining the extent of the first amendment protections.that the first amendment protects student expression within schools is beyond challenge.see tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.but the first amendment has never been interpreted to interfere with the authority of schools to maintain an environment conducive to learning.the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the states and of school officials,consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards,to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.id.at.accordingly,conduct by the student,in class or out of it,which for any it stems from time,place,or type of disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is,of course,not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.id.at.
this framework has generally been used to assess the constitutionality of restrictions on speech in high schools and middle schools.in those contexts,we have required that the school demonstrate a expectation of disruption or of interference with the rights of others,before upholding the restriction.sypniewski warren hills reg l bd.of,cir saxe,at.
but any analysis of the students rights to expression on the one hand,and of schools need to control behavior and foster an environment conducive to learning on the other,must necessarily take into account the age and maturity of the student.fraser,at.muller by muller jefferson lighthouse,cir age is a critical factor in student speech cases baxter by baxter vigo county sch,cir a ge is a relevant factor in assessing the extent of a student free speech rights in school.the significance of age in this inquiry has called into question the appropriateness of employing the tinker framework to assess the constitutionality of restrictions on the expression of elementary school students.no other court of appeals has ruled on the applicability of tinker in this context.district courts engaging this issue have generally found that tinker provides an appropriate mode of analysis of elementary school students first amendment rights.distribution of religious literature jeglin ex rel.jeglin san jacinto unified sch.school dress code.
there can be little doubt that speech appropriate for high school students is not necessarily acceptable for grammar school students.human sexuality provides the most obvious example of matter,see fraser,at,but there are any number of topics that are more appropriate for older students than younger ones.peck upshur county bd.of,cir holding that a policy permitting distribution by of religious material constitutional in the high school setting,but unconstitutional in the elementary school setting because of the impressionability of young children slotterback ex rel.slotterback interboro sch,noting the impressionability of children at elementary school level is a factor in determining whether to uphold a school policy.furthermore,as students approach adulthood,their ability to form and express their own views becomes increasingly important.younger students are at a stage in which learning how to develop relationships and behave in society is as or even more important than their forming particular views on controversial topics.see muller,at the marketplace of ideas,an important theme in the high school student expression cases,is a less appropriate description of an elementary school,where children are just beginning to acquire the means of expression.opinion of manion.instilling appropriate values is a primary goal for our public schools,one that is especially important in the earlier grades.accordingly,young students demand a far greater level of that is fundamental to our public schools mission.
that age is a crucial factor in this calculus does not necessary mean that third graders do not have first amendment rights under tinker.tinker provides a flexible standard that arguably is able to incorporate these considerations.tinker permits school regulation of student speech whenever the school can show that the speech would be disruptive,or would interfere with the rights of other students.in essence,tinker requires that schools have a legitimate educational or disciplinary justification for regulating student expression.that elementary schools require a greater degree of control,or a different kind of control,over students might be accommodated within the tinker analysis.at the very least,anything that interferes with the legitimate educational and disciplinary functions of elementary schools could be regulated under tinker.
supporting recognition of a qualified tinker right is that elementary school students freedom of conscience has been constitutionally protected for decades.see,ex rel.mccollum board of.religious education in public school grades four through nine unconstitutional meyer nebraska.right to teach foreign language to.for over fifty years,the law has protected elementary students rights to refrain from reciting the pledge of allegiance to our flag.state bd.of ed.barnette.punishing a child for expressing her opposition to recitation of the pledge would seem to be as offensive to the first amendment as requiring its oration.
nonetheless,at a certain point,a school child is so young that it might reasonably be presumed the first amendment does not protect the kind of speech at issue here.where that point falls is subject to reasonable debate.
in any event,if third graders enjoy rights under tinker,those rights will necessarily be very limited.elementary school officials will undoubtedly be able to regulate the speech that is protected in higher grades.when officials have a legitimate educational grounded on the need to preserve order,to facilitate learning or social development,or to protect the interests of other may ordinarily regulate public elementary school children speech.
turning to this case,even if elementary school children are entitled to some protection under the first amendment,it might be argued that,under tinker,they have no right to seek signatures from their peers on a petition of the kind at issue here.
as a general matter,collecting petitions is a protected activity under the first amendment.meyer grant,d.it involves an encounter in which the petitioner advocates a position,seeking to persuade the listener to sign on to the cause.in response,the signer expresses his support for the position expressed.the petition creates an environment that encourages speech of a kind central to the first amendment concern.see id.t he circulation of a petition involves the type of interactive communication concerning political change that is appropriately described as core political speech.
nonetheless,a school setting,especially an elementary school setting,may require a different application.as judge greenberg elucidates in his concurring opinion,implicit in petitioning activity is that the young listener is capable of comprehending the advocated position.furthermore,whether or not the young petitioner is reflecting and acting on her parents views is relevant.when other legitimate factors are added to the mix,like the undoubtedly valid parental role and prerogatives with respect to other students,and the possibility of subtle coercion on the part of the petitioner,it is clear that school authorities must be given great leeway to regulate and restrict petitioning in elementary schools.
yet while circulating petitions is clearly not always appropriate for elementary school students,we see no reason to conclude at this juncture that it never is.plaintiff points out that one of textbooks contained a lesson in which the students are asked to circulate a petition on a matter of community concern.this confirms the assumption that,at least some of the time,elementary school students may be capable of circulating petitions in a manner consistent with educational goals,and that petitioning can be a significant learning experience for these children.but where signature gathering interferes with educational goals or interferes with the rights of other students,it can,of course,be restricted.in any event,we see no reason at this point to conclude that,as a general matter,these concerns can not be addressed under the approach specified in tinker.yet it bears noting that in an elementary school setting,the tinker proscription against interfering with the rights of other young students is especially important.
regardless of the extent the tinker analysis is properly employed in the elementary school context,the record here does not support a first amendment violation claim.there is no evidence that defendants acted outside of the permissible scope of their authority over third grade students,even if petition caused no disruption.
defendants contend they prevented from circulating the petition only when the petition appeared to cause disruption under tinker.that may be so.that they encouraged other expressions of opposition to the circus supports their view that their decisions were not based on animus to the position she expressed,but to the particular mode of expression in particular circumstances.contends her petition did not cause disruption either on the playground or in the classroom.she does not address whether her petition may have infringed on the rights of fellow students.but even if permitted,a school must be able to regulate the times and circumstances a petition may be circulated in order to fulfill its custodial and pedagogical roles.there can be no constitutional right,if any,to circulate a petition in an elementary school in class during a quiet reading period or on an icy playground.
it is undisputed that defendants did not discipline for circulating her petition,in which she collected over thirty signatures.because and her parents never petitioned the school for permission to circulate the petition even beyond the signatures already collected we can not know that she would not have been permitted to circulate the petition on other occasions.
but the school authorities did something more.they permitted to distribute other materials to her fellow books and her views about the circus alleged of animals.whatever rights of expression may have possessed,her teachers,with insight and flexibility,more than accommodated them.
in sum,not only did collect over thirty signatures on her petition,she was never punished for this activity.furthermore,the school authorities encouraged and permitted her to express her views in what they properly regarded as a pedagogically appropriate manner.as in fraser,t here is no suggestion that school officials attempted to regulate speech because they disagreed with the views she sought to express.nor does this case involve an attempt by school officials to ban written materials they consider inappropriate for elementary school students,or to limit what students should hear,read,or learn about.at.brennan,concurring.therefore,the record does not permit a finding that suffered an injury of constitutional dimension.
whether or not similar interference with expression may result in a first amendment violation in other contexts,the special responsibilities of elementary school educators,and our deference to the choices th
