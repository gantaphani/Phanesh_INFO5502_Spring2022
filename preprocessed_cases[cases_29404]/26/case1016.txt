we have jurisdiction under and a,and we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
the indian act the act requires the federal government,at the request of a tribe,to provide funding for certain tribal services traditionally the direct responsibility of the federal government.under the act,the fort peck tribes the tribes entered into a contract,whereby the united states agreed to provide for the tribes education department from october,to september,followed by an additional the next year.
lambert wife,desiree,was the director of the tribes education department and,as such,responsible for managing funds provided under the tribes contract.over a period,she and lambert conspired to submit fraudulent invoices,and receive payment from contract funds,for writing grant applications for the education department.although lambert received for ostensibly writing ten grant applications on the education department behalf,the applications were never the various corporations and agencies to which lambert purported to have applied.lambert admitted that a portion of the was used to pay his daughter college tuition,but claimed that he actually wrote all ten applications and provided them to desiree on a diskette.the diskette has never surfaced.
lambert pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of.his presentence report recommended a month sentence based on a total offense level of ten and lambert criminal history category i.the total offense level was calculated based on the base offense level of six for violation of,a increase based on the amount of loss under b c,a decrease for acceptance of responsibility,and a increase because the offense involved a misrepresentation that lambert was acting on behalf of an educational organization under b a.
at sentencing,lambert objected to the increase under b a,contending that,because he submitted the invoices under his own name,he did not act on behalf of an educational institution or as a representative of the education department.the district court received sentencing memoranda from both parties addressing lambert objection,heard argument,and concluded that the enhancement applied because the gravamen of the offense of conviction is that lambert wrote and indeed got paid for writing some ten grant applications on behalf of the t ribe education department he was acting or purporting to act on behalf of the t ribe and that clearly fits within the parameters of guideline b the court then heard additional argument concerning the appropriate sentence,including lambert allocution in which he apologize d to the tribes,stating they had faith in me and i wronged them.
the district court sentenced lambert to twelve months in prison.in this appeal,lambert challenges only the enhancement under b a.without the enhancement,lambert offense level would be eight and his guideline range months,though the statutory maximum for conviction under remains ten years.

discussion 
lambert raises two objections to the district court application of b a.relying on application notes and united states frazier,cir,he first argues that the enhancement does not apply to him because he did not exploit the generosity,charitable motives,or trusting impulses of his victim by misrepresenting his authority to act on behalf of a entity.
he also argues if b a can be applied regardless of the defendant appeal to the victim charitable impulses as several circuits have concluded it still requires a misrepresentation by the defendant as to his capacity to act on behalf of the qualifying entity and,because he submitted the invoices under his own name and only to his wife,no such misrepresentation occurred here.
we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that lambert conduct triggered the enhancement.
background b a 
a current version 
guideline b a states,in pertinent part 
if the offense involved a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable,educational,religious,or political organization,or a government agency,increase by levels.
the guideline application notes clarify that 
subsection b a applies in any case in which the defendant represented that the defendant was acting to obtain a benefit on behalf of a charitable,educational,religious,or political organization,or a government agency regardless of whether the defendant actually was associated with the organization or government agency when,in fact the defendant intended to divert all or part of that benefit,for the defendant personal gain.
subsection b a applies,for example,to the following 
i a defendant who solicited contributions for a famine relief organization.
ii a defendant who solicited donations from church members by falsely claiming to be a fundraiser for a religiously affiliated school.
iii a defendant,chief of a local fire department,who conducted a public fundraiser representing that the purpose of th e fundraiser was to procure sufficient funds for a new fire engine when,in fact,the defendant intended to divert some of the funds for the defendant personal benefit.
cmt.emphasis added.the guideline background note further explains that 
use of false pretenses involving charitable causes and government agencies enhances the sentences of defendants who take advantage of victims trust in government or law enforcement agencies or the generosity and charitable motives of victims.taking advantage of a victim does not mitigate the seriousness of fraudulent conduct rather,defendants who exploit victims charitable impulses or trust in government create particular social harm.

b previous versions 
because relevant precedent from our sister circuits analyzes prior versions of b a,it is useful to compare the various versions of the guideline.in november,was consolidated into,resulting in the addition of current subsection b a to.prior to this consolidation,the enhancement for misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable,educational,religious or political organization,or a government agency was located at b a although,the guideline language is identical in both versions,the commentary differs slightly.
the application notes to former stated 
subsection b a provides an adjustment for a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable,educational,religious or political organization,or a government agency.examples of conduct to which this factor applies would include a group of defendants who solicit contributions to a famine relief organization by mail,a defendant who diverts donations for a religiously affiliated school by telephone solicitations to church members in which the defendant falsely claims to be a for the school,or a defendant who poses as a federal collection agent in order to collect a delinquent student loan.

there are three primary differences between this note and the current version the current versio
