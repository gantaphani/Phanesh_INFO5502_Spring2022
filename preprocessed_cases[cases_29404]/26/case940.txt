order certifying a question to the supreme court of california 
this case requires us to decide,as a matter of california law,which california agency is responsible for funding a special education student placement in an residential treatment facility.we respectfully request that the california supreme court exercise its discretion and decide the certified question presented below.
question certified 
pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,we request that the california supreme court answer the following question 
whether under california law the school district responsible for the costs of a special education student education while the student is placed at an residential treatment facility is the district in which the student de facto parent,who is authorized to make educational decisions on behalf of the student,resides.
we understand that the court may reformulate our question,and we agree to accept and follow the court decision.see cal.b,f.the california supreme court decision on this question of california law could determine the outcome of this appeal and no controlling california precedent exists.see cal.a.
we certify this question because deciding it would require us to answer novel and difficult questions of california law about the relationships among multiple provisions of the california education code and among numerous california governmental entities.we acknowledge that the question raises issues of particular interest to california and its courts,and we note that three cases pending in our court may rely upon the answer to this question.unfortunately,the state administrative and federal judicial bodies that have addressed the certified question to date have reached conflicting and inconsistent conclusions.therefore,considerations of comity and federalism favor resolution of the certified question by california highest court.

in october,filed a request for a special education due process hearing.after mediation resolved all other issues,the only issue for the hearing was which public agency was responsible for funding placement at cinnamon hills.because of various placements orange county,los angeles unified school district,charter oaks unified school district and the california department of education cde were all identified as agencies possibly responsible for educational funding.in october,the california office of administrative hearings oah issued an administrative decision naming orange county the responsible agency.see student orange cnty.dep t of,at cal.office of admin.hearings,
orange county appealed that decision to district court for the central district of california,arguing that cde is responsible for education.the county argued that california law fails to make any public agency responsible for providing special education programs to children like,who have no parents and are placed in residential treatment centers outside california.the county therefore argued that cde should be held responsible by default.cde moved to dismiss the action under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied that motion in a published decision,orange cnty.dep t of educ,d,and then granted orange county motion for summary judgment.the court agreed with the county that california law failed to make any public agency responsible for education and therefore deemed cde responsible by default.cde timely appealed to this court.
iii.explanation of certification 
the resolution of this appeal turns on two issues of california law for which there is no controlling authority.
whether supplies a definition of parent for 
the first issue relates to which agency is responsible for funding placement.the parties agree that california education code section establishes the general rule that,under california law,the school district responsible for the education of a child between the ages of and is the district in which the child parent or legal guardian resides.see katz los gatos saratoga joint union high sch,d,section embodies the general rule that parental residence dictates a pupil proper school district.but the parties disagree about how california law defined parent for purposes of section while orange county was fronting the costs for placement in cinnamon hills.
in,when orange county began fronting those costs,no provision of the california education code specified that it provided the definition of parent for section,either for students as a whole or for special education students in particular.in january,the california legislature amended section of the california education code to provide that,i f a judicial decree or order identifies a specific person or persons under education code section a of part special education programs to act as the parent of a child or to make educational decisions on behalf of a child,then that person or persons shall be determined to be the parent for purposes of article commencing with section of chapter of part.cal.b.thus,beginning in,the definition of parent in section applies to section,at least under some circumstances.for purposes of this appeal,the parties appear to agree that,as of january,the agency responsible for funding placement was the school district in which parent resided,see cal,as parent was defined under section but the parties dispute whether section supplied a definition of parent for section before january.if section does not specify the governmental entity responsible for a special education student education,we must identify,under california law,the proper alternative method for determining the responsible entity 
we have found no controlling authority addressing this issue,and what authority exists is in conflict.in orange county department of education student,cal.office of admin.hearings may,the oah ruled that section does provide the definition of parent for section with respect to students enrolled in special education programs.see id.section,which is found in the section of the code regarding special education,sets forth definitions of parent that must be read in conjunction with section when there is a question regarding which agency is responsible for providing special education to a particular child.see also id.the oah has taken this position in a number of related proceedings,and cde urges its adoption here 
on the other hand,a federal district court in california has issued multiple decisions that have rejected,at least in part,the proposition that section supplies the definition of parent for purposes of section.in newport mesa unified school district,cv.may,the district court concluded that the current version of section applies to section,but fou
