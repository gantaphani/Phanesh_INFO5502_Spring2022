education code section,subdivision a prohibits the introduction of evidence relating to matters occurring more than four years before a school district files a notice of intention to dismiss a teacher.it also bars the dismissal of a teacher for events occurring more than four years before the notice was filed.we conclude,however,that the period in section,subdivision a section a is not absolute.its bar may be evaluated in the context of equitable estoppel when the basis of equitable relief is established.
albert truitt was a credentialed teacher employed by the atwater elementary school district the district.on july,the district filed and served an accusation and notice of dismissal and charges notice of intent or notice pursuant to sections and and government code section,alleging that truitt had engaged in sexual misconduct with five students between and.the district claimed that truitt,who was also a track coach,befriended young boys,encouraged their participation in track and field,and used his position of trust to sexually abuse them.it alleged that on numerous occasions,truitt improperly massaged and touched the buttocks and genitals of several male track participants.the conduct occurred in truitt home as well as on overnight trips when truitt shared accommodations with students.all of the incidents set out in the district notice of intent involved boys who were students or former students of the district.
truitt denied the allegations and asserted affirmative defenses.the district then filed an amended notice alleging he was dishonest and unfit for service.truitt again denied all charges raising the same defenses.
during subsequent administrative proceedings,truitt moved to dismiss all allegations based on incidents occurring more than four years before the district served its notice of intent and to exclude any evidence relating to such incidents.he relied on section a,which states in pertinent part no testimony shall be given or evidence introduced relating to matters which occurred more than four years prior to the date of the filing of the notice.evidence of records regularly kept by the governing board concerning the employee may be introduced,but no decision relating to the dismissal or suspension of any employee shall be made based on charges or evidence of any nature relating to matters occurring more than four years prior to the filing of the notice.
after the administrative law judge granted truitt motions,the district sought a writ of mandate to vacate the rulings.the trial court granted the petition and directed the administrative law judge to enter new orders denying the motions.the court of appeal reversed,holding that the section a time limit is absolute and can not be extended by the application of equitable doctrines such as delayed discovery,fraudulent concealment,equitable estoppel,and continuing course of conduct.
ii.discussion 
since we granted review the case has become moot.truitt resigned his teaching position,relinquished his teaching credential pursuant to a criminal plea bargain,and subsequently died.however,it is undisputed that this case involves a matter of statewide importance,so we have retained it for decision.state of california ex rel state lands com.superior court cal th,d.
under the education code,credentialed teachers may be disciplined by a local school district or by the commission on teacher credentialing ctc.regarding grounds for termination by a school district,section,subdivision a provides,as applicable here no permanent employee shall be dismissed except for one or more of the following causes immoral or unprofessional conduct.dishonesty.evident unfitness for service procedures for a dismissal of a credentialed teacher are detailed in section 
the question here is whether section a limitation is absolute or may be subject to equitable principles.the district argues that the time frame should be characterized as a statute of limitations,subject to equitable principles.it urges that the court of appeal incorrectly characterized subdivision a as an evidentiary bar or condition on a substantive right.we conclude that the distinction is immaterial.the courts have applied equitable principles to conditions on substantive rights as well as to statutes of limitation see,estate of caravas cal d,and where actual or practical access to the courts is prevented the distinction between substantive and procedural statutes of limitations may be disregarded.myers stevenson d.as one commentator has explained in some jurisdictions,circumstances or events that suspend the running of a statute of limitations do not delay the expiration of a right except as provided in the statute creating the right.citations.other jurisdictions reject this distinction as legalistic and unreasonable.citations.california is definitely committed to the second position.witkin,cal.procedure supp.actions.thus,the characterization of section a rule does not resolve whether equitable principles apply.witkin,supra,at people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,th,d.
the district invites us to individually address several equitable doctrines we decline to do so because consideration of individual doctrines is unnecessary.a conclusion that any one applies resolves whether the time limitation is absolute.in addition,the record does not facilitate consideration of individual doctrines.because of the procedural posture of this case,the parties have not adequately set forth the factual basis on which various equitable principles would rest.accordingly,for the purposes of this case,we narrow our focus to the one equitable doctrine that comes readily to mind in a section a context equitable estoppel.
our decision in lantzy centex homes cal th,d,lantzy provides guidance.there,we explained,equitable estoppel comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the applicable limitations period.equitable estoppel is wholly independent of the limitations period itself and takes its life from the equitable principle that no man may profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of justice.citations.lantzy,supra,at,d.because equitable estoppel is wholly independent of section a time limitation,it could be relied upon in some circumstances to prevent a defendant from asserting the statutory bar.to create an equitable estoppel,it is enough if the party has been induced to refrain from using such means or taking such action as lay in his power,by which he might have retrieved his position and saved himself from loss.where the delay in commencing action is induced by the conduct of the defendant it can not be availed of by him as a defense.benner industrial acc.com.cal d,italics and citation omitted.under this analysis,if the district were able to meet the requirements of equitable estoppel,it could have been allowed to introduce evidence of,and base its dismissal proceedings on,incidents falling outside the window.
we hold that equitable estoppel may apply to section a time limitation.we express no opinion on whether the district could have satisfied the doctrine requirements here.nor need we decide whether other equitable principles might apply.we simply conclude that the time limitation is not absolute our decision is also supported by the view that courts should not presume the legislature intended to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.citations.the legislature could have easily stated it intended to abrogate equitable principles such as equitable estoppel.it did not do so.juran epstein th,d.
in reaching a contrary result,the court of appeal referred to section which applies to disciplinary actions brought by the ctc against a credentialed teacher.section expressly exempts allegations of sexual misconduct from the requirement that allegations of wrongful acts be presented to the ctc within four years from the date o
