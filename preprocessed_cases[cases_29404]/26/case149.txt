the state of connecticut and the general assembly of the state of connecticut collectively the state allege in these proceedings that the secretary of education has misinterpreted the meaning of the no child left behind act nclba or the act,and has violated the administrative procedures act apa.the connecticut state conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people the naacp has intervened on behalf of the secretary.
the first two claims in the state second amended complaint hereinafter the complaint seek a declaratory judgment rejecting the secretary interpretation of the nclba.claim i alleges that the secretary interpretation is wrong as a matter of statutory interpretation,while claim ii alleges that the secretary interpretation violates the spending clause and tenth amendment of the constitution.the complaint remaining two claims assert that the secretary violated the apa.
the district court,in a thorough,thoughtful opinion,granted the secretary motion to dismiss in part,finding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the first three claims of the complaint.see connecticut spellings,d hereinafter spellings i.that opinion also dismissed as moot claim iv allegation that the secretary failed to provide the state a required hearing,but denied the secretary motion to dismiss the balance of claim iv.id.in a subsequent opinion,the district court granted the secretary motion for judgment on the administrative record with respect to claim iv remaining allegations,and also reiterated its dismissal of the state request for a hearing.see connecticut spellings,d hereinafter spellings ii.familiarity with spellings i and spellings ii is assumed.we affirm,with a small modification both the district court dismissal of the state claim for a hearing,and its grant of the secretary motion for judgment on the record as to count iv,are without prejudice.
the district court opinions discuss the relevant provisions of the act,and we need only briefly review it here.see spellings i,d at.the nclba,signed into law by president bush on january,provides for grants,known as title i funds,for states to use to fund public education.congress passed the act pursuant to its power under the spending clause of the constitution,article i,section.as with all spending clause legislation,congress was permitted to,and did,attach conditions to the receipt of those funds.new york united states.states have the choice whether to fulfill the requirements of the nclba,or else forego the grants.
by and large,the act provisions require states to administer certain mandatory assessments to students and to demonstrate accountability using the results of those assessments.see b.each state that wishes to obtain title i funds under the nclba must submit a plan to the secretary demonstrating how the state intends to comply with the act.state plans require the secretary approval,and the secretary is authorized both to reject plans that do not comply with the act requirements,id.e,and to penalize states,id.g.the secretary may also grant waivers from the act requirements.id.
at the core of this litigation is the unfunded mandates provision,which appears in a separate section of the act entitled prohibitions on federal government and use of federal funds,and consists of the following general prohibition 
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the federal government to mandate,direct,or control a state,local educational agency,or school curriculum,program of instruction,or allocation of state or local resources,or mandate a state or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this chapter.
connecticut has accepted substantial title i educational funds,and has had a plan on file with the secretary since.in january,the state asked the department of education to waive certain of the act testing requirements.specifically,connecticut sought permission to conduct testing in alternate years rather than annually to conduct cohort analysis to assess special education students at their instructional level,rather than at their grade level,if such testing is deemed appropriate by a student individualized education program iep and to permit students with limited english proficiency known as english language learners ell students three years in united states schools before assessing their performance.
on february,the secretary denied the state waiver requests to conduct testing and to phase in ell students for three years requested more information about cohort analysis and indicated that a doe policy change on special education was forthcoming.the secretary announced the new special education policy on april.the new policy did not permit testing special education students at their instructional level,even if consistent with a student iep.
on may,after extensive correspondence between the parties,connecticut state commissioner of education betty sternberg reiterated the state waiver requests regarding alternate grade testing,ell student,and testing special education students at their instructional level.in the same letter,commissioner sternberg submitted two proposed amendments to connecticut nclba accountability plan.the proposed amendments essentially embodied the waiver requests for phasing in ell students and testing special education students at their instructional level,but did not discuss the state waiver request concerning assessments.
on june,the secretary informed commissioner sternberg that the proposed plan amendments had been denied.at no point was the state provided the opportunity for a hearing on its proposed plan amendments.in august,the state sued the secretary.since then,the state has continued to comply with the act requirements,and the secretary has taken no enforcement action against the state.
the crux of the state lawsuit boils down to one core allegation the unfunded mandates provision of the nclba requires the state to be funded the full amount of any costs required to comply with the act,but the state is nevertheless currently paying more to comply than it is receiving in title i educational grants.in the state view,the unfunded mandates provision unambiguously prohibits the secretary from requiring a state to spend its own money to comply with an accountability plan.in the alternative,the state argues,if the meaning of the unfunded mandates provision is ambiguous,then the act violates the spending clause because a state can only agree to be bound by federally imposed conditions on funding when those conditions are set out unambiguously.see arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.murphy.additionally,the state contends,the secretary interpretation of the nclba violates the tenth amendment because its,the potential loss of all federal education so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.south dakota dole,internal quotation marks omitted.the state did not raise these statutory and constitutional arguments to the secretary when it requested its proposed waivers and plan amendments.
on appeal,the state challenges the district court ruling on a number of grounds its conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over claims i and ii pursuant to thunder basin coal reich,because congress did not intend for courts to exercise review of these claims its determination that claims i and ii are not ripe for review its finding that the state request for a hearing on its plan amendments was waived or moot and its holding that the secretary disposition of the state proposed plan amendments and waiver requests was not arbitrary or capricious.the state also reiterates the merits of its underlying claims about the unfunded mandates provision.
we agree that the state unfunded mandates provision arguments are not yet ripe for judicial review,and therefore we affirm the district court dismissal of claims i and ii on that basis without reaching the issues presented by thunder basin.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil.with respect to claim iv,we can not the district court did in spellings the state request for a hearing on its proposed plan amendments was waived.however,because the state now represents on appeal that a hearing would be futile without a resolution of the unfunded mandates issue,and because that issue is not ripe for review,we affirm the district court dismissal of claim iv as well.nonetheless,in doing so,we modify the dismissal to clarify that it is without prejudice.we also affirm the district court judgment that the secretary ultimate disposition of the state proposed plan amendments and waivers was neither arbitrary nor capricious,but we clarify that this decision too is without prejudice.
with respect to those claims that the district court found ripe,we have appellate jurisdiction under.we review de novo a district court legal conclusions,including the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b.leibovitz cornell,cir.a district court ripeness determination is also a legal determination subject to de novo review,murphy new milford zoning comm n,cir,as is a grant of judgment on the record,see jarvis ford motor,cir.
a.the unfunded mandates provision 
ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.park hospitality ass dep t of the interior,internal quotation marks omitted.at its heart is whether we would benefit from deferring initial review until the claims we are called on to consider have arisen in a more concrete and final form.murphy,at.in the district court view,the first two claims of the complaint will be better decided once there is an administrative record that addresses the state concerns about the unfunded mandates provision.we agree.
in its leading case on ripeness,the supreme court held that determining whether a dispute is ripe for review requires a analysis of whether the issues presented to the district court are fit for review,and what hardship the parties will suffer in the absence of review.see abbott labs.gardner,overruled on other grounds,califano sanders.analyzing the first prong of the ripeness inquiry,the district court held that claims i and ii were not fit for review until the agency addressed the factual and legal positions at the core of the state unfunded mandates claims.the district court noted that an administrative record would help the court to evaluate the secretary claim that the state can satisfy the testing requirements of the act in a manner that is fully funded by the federal government,thus potentially obviating the need for litigation.spellings i,d at.the district court observed further that its decisionmaking could only be enhanced by having some concrete action by the secretary to review.id.the court stated that consideration of the underlying legal issues would necessarily be facilitated if they were raised in the context of a specific attempt to apply enforce the regulation.id.at.next,analyzing the hardship prong,the district court concluded that the state was not suffering significant hardship because the state remains in compliance with the act,thus continuing to receive funds while facing no imminent enforcement action by the secretary.id.the court emphasized that it is unclear what steps,if any,the secretary would take against the state in the event of noncompliance.id.finally,the district court observed that the administrative forum remains an alternative venue in which the state can seek relief without risking the consequences of noncompliance.id 
we review the district court ripeness determination bearing in mind that b oth aspects of the inquiry involve the exercise of judgment,rather than the application of a rule.park hospitality,at stevens,concurring.we have repeatedly observed that when a court declares that a case is not prudentially ripe,it means that the case will be better decided later not that the case is not a real or concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns of the parties.new york civil liberties union grandeau,cir quoting simmonds ins,cir internal citations omitted emphasis in original.prudential ripeness is,then,a tool that courts may use to enhance the accuracy of their decisions and to avoid becoming embroiled in adjudications that may later turn out to be unnecessary or may require premature examination of,especially,constitutional issues that time may make easier or less controversial.id.
although the state is correct that the secretary interpretation of the unfunded mandates provision is clear and that the parties have a concrete dispute about its meaning and constitutionality,the district court did not err in concluding it would benefit from a more developed administrative record and that therefore this case is not yet fit for review.as a result of the state requested plan amendments and waivers,we know how the state proposes to bridge any gap between its title i funds and its costs of complying with the nclba.but we do not yet have a clear picture of solutions the secretary might propose,or,for obvious reasons,the state position on any such solutions.see nevada dep t of energy,noting that ripeness doctrine is designed in part to protect the agency interest in crystalizing its policy before that policy is subjected to judicial review.the secretary contends that the state cost estimates for compliance with the nclba reflect a misunderstanding of its statutory obligations,in particular by overestimating the requirements for administering assessments to special education students and ell students according to the secretary,the state can meet its responsibilities under the act using its current title i grants.resp.br.at.the state disagrees.while the district court is capable of resolving this factual and legal dispute,administrative proceedings are a more suitable venue because they will allow for inquiries related to educational finance,the agency area of expertise.these proceedings will also provide an opportunity for the parties to design an amended plan that satisfies the state specific fiscal objections.neither the underlying factual dispute nor the process of designing an amended plan,which might moot the entire lawsuit,are undertakings readily accomplished in the district court in the first instance.sharkey quarantillo,cir.
the secretary has taken no final action attributed directly to his interpretation of the unfunded mandates provision,and perhaps further administrative could include the resolution of pending factual disputes about the secretary suggestion of measures different from those already proposed by the render such final action unnecessary.f aced with a concrete proposal and specific facts the state education department and the secretary would have the opportunity to craft a compromise solution that would avoid the need for a lawsuit.sch.dist.of city of pontiac sec y of dep t of,cir en banc mckeague,concurring this case therefore differs from abbott,in which the supreme court found that a drug manufacturer challenge of an fda regulation was fit for review in part because all parties agree that the issue tendered is a purely legal one and there was no claim that further administrative proceedings are contemplated.abbott,at.judge kravitz was thus on solid ground in concluding that this case is not yet fit for review.
even if resolution of a dispute could be facilitated if a court waited for a specific application of the issues in contention,the question may,nonetheless,perhaps be justiciable under the second ripeness factor if the challenged action creates a direct and immediate hardship for the parties.nutritional health alliance shalala,cir.thus,although the issues presented in claims i and ii are not yet fit for review,we still consider the hardship prong with the understanding that it alone can,if sufficiently weighty,render a claim ripe.in assessing the possible hardship to the parties resulting from withholding judicial resolution,we ask whether the challenged action creates a direct and immediate dilemma for the parties.the mere possibility of future injury,unless it is the cause
