spencer is an year old student in the maui district of the hawaii department of education he was diagnosed with autism at age two.as a result of his condition,the department determined that spencer is eligible to receive special education and other related services,and his educational rights are protected by the idea.beginning in fifth grade,spencer iep placed him at a private special education facility,horizons academy,at the expense of the department of education.the department held spencer annual iep meeting on november,despite doug inability to attend the meeting that day.at that meeting,the department changed spencer educational placement,moving him to a program at maui high school,his local public school.
the central issue in this case is whether the department efforts to include doug in the november iep meeting are sufficient to meet the requirements of the idea.a close review of the events leading up to the iep meeting is therefore critical the iep team and doug first discussed the annual iep meeting date during a student support meeting in september kaleo waiau,a special education coordinator at maui high school,testified that doug and members of the education team all agreed that the iep meeting would be held on october.doug testified that he thought that they had only agreed,tentatively,to meet sometime in late october.in any event,waiau called doug on october to confirm the october meeting.doug stated that he was unavailable that day,and they settled instead on either november or the testimony on which is inconsistent.doug testified that the november date was also tentative,subject to checking his calendar and confirming.the following day,doug called waiau to let him know that he was not available on that day,and they settled firmly on november instead.
on the morning of november,doug waiau at.he explained that he was sick and therefore unable to attend the iep meeting.he suggested rescheduling the meeting for the following week,on either november or.the annual review deadline for spencer iep was saturday,november.according to waiau,some of the members of the iep team were not available on friday,november.therefore,waiau offered to reschedule for either wednesday,november,or thursday,november,accommodating the other members schedules while still holding the meeting before the deadline.doug responded that he could possibly participate on either of those days,but could not definitively commit to either day since he was ill and could not guarantee that he would recover in time.waiau also suggested that doug participate by phone or the internet.but doug explained that he wanted to be physically present at his son iep meeting and he did not feel physically well enough to participate meaningfully through any means that day.
waiau decided to go forward with the meeting on november as scheduled.he testified that he had already asked people on three separate occasions to change their schedules and cancel other commitments to schedule the meeting.therefore,without a firm commitment from doug for one of the two dates he proposed,waiau refused to reschedule the meeting.waiau and the iep team held the meeting without the participation of doug c.the only horizons academy staff member on spencer iep team also did not attend.
with these key participants absent,the iep team changed spencer placement from horizons academy to the workplace readiness program at maui high school.after the meeting,waiau sent doug the new,completed iep for his review.the team held a iep meeting on december with doug and a staff member from horizons.at the meeting,the team reviewed the already completed iep line by line.waiau testified that doug provided no substantive input,while doug explained that he rejected the iep in its entirety because he was excluded from the development process.no changes were made to the iep during the december meeting.
the day before the iep meeting,doug filed a request for a due process hearing as provided for by the idea.he argued,inter alia,that the lack of parental participation in the iep meeting denied spencer a fape.after a hearing,the administrative hearing officer issued a decision finding that the department did not deny spencer a fape and dismissed his claims for relief.the district court affirmed,holding that plaintiffs failed to show that defendant did not fulfill its statutory duty to ensure that doug was afforded an opportunity to participate at the november,iep meeting.doug timely appealed.

parental participation in the iep and educational placement process is critical to the organization of the idea.see d b i requiring the inclusion of parents on the iep team a same b requiring opportunities for parents to participate in meetings with respect to identification,evaluation and educational placement of the child.indeed,the supreme court has stressed that the idea structure relies upon parental participation to ensure the substantive success of the idea in providing quality education to disabled students 
w e think that the importance congress attached to these procedural safeguards can not be gainsaid.it seems to us no exaggeration to say that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.we think that the congressional emphasis upon full participation of concerned parties throughout the development of the iep demonstrates the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what congress wished in the way of substantive content in an iep.
rowley,at citation omitted see also schaffer weast,the core of the idea is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools the central vehicle for this collaboration is the iep process.honig doe,congress repeatedly emphasized throughout the idea the importance and indeed the necessity of parental participation in both the development of the iep and any subsequent assessments of its effectiveness.emphasis added.
echoing the supreme court,we have held that parental participation safeguards are a mong the most important procedural safeguards in the idea and that p rocedural violations that interfere with parental participation in the iep formulation process undermine the very essence of the idea.amanda,at.we have explained that parental participation is key to the operation of the idea for two reasons parents not only represent the best interests of their child in the iep development process,they also provide information about the child critical to developing a comprehensive iep and which only they are in a position to know.id.at.
in accordance with the foregoing,the regulatory framework of the idea places an affirmative duty on agencies to include parents in the iep process.the public agency responsible for providing education to children with disabilities,is required to take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents of a child with a disability are present at each iep meeting or are afforded an opportunity to participate including providing ample notice and scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place.a.moreover,if a parent can not attend,the agency must offer other methods of participation such as video or teleconferencing.c.most importantly,a meeting may only be conducted without a parent if the public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend.d emphasis added.and in that circumstance,the agency must keep a detailed record of its attempts to include the parent.id.in shapiro,we clarified the limited circumstances under which a public agency can hold an iep meeting without parental participation.at.we held that parental involvement in the creation process requires the agency to include the parents in an iep meeting unless they affirmatively refused to attend.id.emphasis added.
doug did not affirmatively refuse to attend the meeting,nor could it be said that the department was unable to convince him to attend,d.to the contrary,doug vigorously objected to the department holding an iep meeting without him and asked the department to reschedule the meeting for the following week.in response to the department offer to reschedule for either of the following two days,he agreed to try to attend but,understandably,could not firmly commit to a meeting date only one or two days later while he was sick.despite the foregoing,the department went forward with the iep meeting without him,over his repeated objections,and,at that meeting,decided to change spencer educational placement for the first time in six years.the department actions simply do not accord with the standard we set forth in shapiro.
the fact that it may have been frustrating to schedule meetings with or difficult to work with doug as the department repeatedly suggests does not excuse the department failure to include him in spencer iep meeting when he expressed a willingness to participate.we have consistently held that an agency can not eschew its affirmative duties under the idea by blaming the parents.see anchorage sch.dist,cir p articipating educational agencies can not excuse their failure to satisfy the idea procedural requirements by blaming the parents.see also target range,at holding that the school district could not blame parents choice to leave an iep meeting for its own failure to create an iep with the participation of the appropriate parties.an agency can not blame a parent for its failure to ensure meaningful procedural compliance with the idea because the idea protections are designed to benefit the student,not the parent.as we explained in amanda,parental participation is key to providing the student an adequate education because a n iep which addresses the unique needs of the child can not be developed if those people who are most familiar with the child needs are not involved.at because the department obligation is owed to the child,any alleged obstinance of doug does not excuse the department failure to fulfill its affirmative obligation to include doug in the iep meeting when he expressed a willingness indeed eagerness to participate,albeit at a later date 
the department central argument is that it could not accommodate doug request to reschedule because of the impending annual iep deadline on november.even assuming that the annual deadline should somehow trump parental participation,the department argument fails on the facts of this case.waiau,the coordinator of the iep meeting,testified that he refused to reschedule the meeting for the wednesday or thursday before the deadline because doug could not firmly commit to either of those dates because of his illness,even though doug testified that he said that he likely could attend.waiau explained that he did not wish to disrupt the other iep members schedules without a firm commitment.
this argument may seem reasonable but quickly unravels because,under the idea,the attendance of doug,spencer parent,must take priority over other members attendance for the reasons discussed above.indeed,a parent can consent to the absence of other team members at the meeting.d c.in shapiro,we clearly held that an agency can not exclude a parent from an iep meeting in order to prioritize its representatives schedules.at.by refusing to reschedule the meeting for wednesday or thursday,waiau improperly prioritized the schedules of the other members of the team over the attendance of doug moreover,waiau also testified that he did not offer doug the option of meeting on the friday before the annual review deadline because other members of the iep team were not available to meet that day.once again,the department improperly prioritized its own representatives schedules and attendance over the attendance of the parent.
even if the department theory of the case was supported by the facts,the department argument that it absolutely could not reschedule the iep meeting for a date even a few days after the annual deadline in order to include doug is untenable.waiau testimony suggests,and the department counsel represented at oral argument,that if the annual deadline passed without a new iep,services would lapse.the district court took a similar position.we reject this argument because it is premised on the erroneous assumption that the department is authorized let alone required to cease providing services to a student if his annual iep review is overdue.the idea mandates annual review of a student iep.d see also b i.however,the department cites no authority,nor could it,for the proposition that it can not provide any services to a student whose annual review is overdue.
