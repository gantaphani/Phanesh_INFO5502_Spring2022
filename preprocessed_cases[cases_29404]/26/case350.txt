in the wake of brown board of education,hundreds of school districts in the united states became,and remain today,subject to school desegregation orders issued by federal courts.see,united states commission on civil rights,becoming less separate school desegregation,justice department enforcement,and the pursuit of unitary statuss.as a condition precedent to lifting these desegregation orders,school districts must comply in good faith with the orders eliminate the vestiges of former de jure segregation to the maximum extent practicable and be adjudicated,by a federal court,as operating racially unitary as opposed to dual school systems.bd.of educ.dowell,d.notably,prior to being declared unitary by a federal court,school districts operate under an affirmative obligation to eliminate unconstitutional dual school systems,as well as under a rebuttable presumption that any current racial disparities are the result of past unconstitutional conduct.school bd.baliles,cir,jacksonville branch duval cnty,cir jacksonville.
in the,the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina determined that the school board was operating a racially segregated dual school district in violation of students rights to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.see edwards greenville city bd.of,civ.teel pitt cnty.bd.of,civ.subsequently,the district court approved desegregation plans that,through busing and other means,were designed to eliminate the racial identity of schools within the district.among other mandates and instructions in the desegregation orders,the district court specifically ordered the school board in teel to the extent consistent with the proper administration and operation of the school system,to locate any new school or addition with the objective of eradicating the vestiges of the dual school system and of eliminating the effects of segregation.in,the district court ordered edwards and teel administratively closed and removed from the court active docket,subject to being reopened whenever a pleading was filed in either case to warrant reopening.for over thirty years,although the school board remained subject to the edwards and teel desegregation orders,the actions remained dormant.
in,the greenville parents association filed a complaint with the office of civil rights within the united states department of education objecting to the school board use of race in its student assignment plan for the academic year assignment plan.the assignment plan was adopted under the school board policy for school attendance areas policy.policy obliged the school board to balance several factors to the degree possible when drawing school attendance areas,including student proximity to facilities and a racial balance defined by the policy as a student population in which no one race constituted more than seventy percent of the students at a given school.to this end,the assignment plan used satellite school districts and a racial balance ratio in an effort to reduce the racial isolation of elementary schools in the school district.
in march,as part of the school board settlement of the office of civil rights complaint,the school board filed a motion requesting that the district court approve the assignment plan and a revised version of policy revised policy,which proposed to reduce the school board reliance on race as a factor by replacing the prior policy explicit racial balancing with a definition of student diversity that balanced a number of factors,including student achievement,status,and ethnic,racial and educational the greenville parents association,as a in the litigation,filed a motion requesting the district court denial of the assignment plan and revised policy,as well as the district court declaration of the school district unitary status,which,as a consequence,would have lifted the desegregation orders in edwards and teel.the district court reopened and consolidated the edwards and teel cases and ordered discovery.
early in the discovery period,the parties participated in mediation resulting in a settlement.as part of the settlement,the greenville parents association agreed to withdraw its motion with the district court for a declaration of the school district unitary status,and the school board agreed to involve appellants and the greenville parents association in the planning and discussion stages of the assignment plan.on november,the district court issued an order approving the settlement consent order,which included the district court determination that the assignment plan and revised policy were issued by the school board in good faith compliance with the remedial plans approved by this court desegregation orders.
the consent order obligated the parties to work toward attaining unitary status so that the district court may relinquish jurisdiction over this case and restore to the school board full responsibility for the operation of its schools.accordingly,the consent order directed the parties to submit,on or before december,a report detailing the school board efforts and progress in achieving unitary status and eliminating the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable.
in,the school board began developing,and ultimately selected,the assignment plan,which was needed to accommodate the opening of a new elementary school lakeforest elementary the conversion of an existing elementary school into a program and overcrowding at existing middle schools.the school board,with the assistance of an independent consultant,designed student assignment proposals in accordance with the following criteria school proximity building capacity academic proficiency and impact area notably,rather than utilizing race or student diversity as defined in revised policy,consideration of diversity in the proposals was limited to measures of student achievement.
as required by the settlement agreement,the school board invited appellants to discuss the student assignment proposals during two retreats.initially,the parties considered two student assignment scenarios one using only proximity and capacity as criteria scenario and the other using student achievement in addition to proximity and capacity scenario.whereas scenario projected a relative increase in schools with lower student achievement,scenario projected better diversity but a relative increase in satellite neighborhoods,which,presumably,would have required more satellite busing.after discussion of these two scenarios,a third student assignment plan was considered,which,while retaining scenario consideration of student achievement,limited the number of satellite neighborhoods by prioritizing proximity scenario.scenario projected more racial diversity than scenario,less racial diversity than scenario,and fewer satellite areas than scenario.
on november,the school board selected scenario as its assignment plan.prior to the school board adoption of scenario,the appellants urged the school board to adopt scenario because scenario projected the best outcomes for student achievement and diversity.the school board was specifically asked,how can we open a new elementary school lakeforest elementary that is racially identifiable with low performance and follow the court order.appellants urged the school board to consider the impact that this assignment decision will make on the district court determination of unitary status,and appellants further asserted that scenario created the least amount of personal bias and the most equitable picture considering all factors.
after the school board adoption of scenario as the assignment plan,appellants urged the school board to reconsider its decision because,according to appellants,the assignment plan increase in schools with low student achievement moved the school district further away from unitary status.appellants advised the school board to seek the district court guidance regarding whether the assignment plan complied with existing desegregation orders.the school board declined to revisit its adoption of scenario or to seek guidance from the district court.
on april,appellants sought the district court intervention by filing a motion for injunctive and other relief.appellants motion alleged that the assignment plan violated the district court existing desegregation orders because it established lakeforest elementary as a racially identifiable,school,further stigmatizing students and aggravating the vestiges of racial segregation and discrimination failed to address imbalances in existing schools because only fourteen of the schools in the school district were included in the impact area was adopted despite the existence of less discriminatory alternatives and mov ed the school district further away from unitary status in contravention of the consent order.appellants sought an order to stop implementation of this regressive student reassignment,as well as an order requiring the school board to submit for judicial review a n assignment plan which moves the district towards unitary status.
the school board,on the other hand,urged the district court to deny appellants motion,arguing that the school board followed the revised policy in adopting the assignment plan and,therefore,its actions constituted a reasonable,good faith effort to achieve diversity goals and maintain progress toward the school district attainment of unitary status appellants motion was premature because the consent order set a timetable of december for considering the school district progress toward unitary status and halting implementation of the assignment plan would create an undue burden on the school system.
on august,four months after appellants motion was filed and just nine days before the start of the school year,the district court issued its order denying appellants motion.the district court characterized appellants motion as a request for a preliminary injunction and held that the appellants did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim so as justify the extraordinary relief they request.the district court also found that granting appellants motion would result in irreparable harm because of the disruption to the administration of the schools within the school district.finally,the district court held that equities tipped in favor of denying appellants motion because the district court anticipated a review of the school district progress toward unitary status in december.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
as an initial matter,the school board claims that this court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal.specifically,the school board argues that the district court denial of appellants motion is not a final order pursuant to because the district court has expressed its clear intention to take up the issue of unitary status after submission of the parties reports no later than december.appellee br.at.we initially note that a request for the parties to submit a report is not at all a clear indication that the district court will fully and finally resolve the issue of unitary status in december.
further,we reject the school board jurisdictional argument.first,a provides this court with jurisdiction over district court decisions granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.see also liddell bd.of,cir we conclude that the challenged orders approving aspects of a desegregation plan are presently appealable because they amount to mandatory injunctions under a.second,as further discussed below,even if we assume that the district court will fully consider the issue of unitary status in december,this does not absolve the school board from the burden of demonstrating to the district court,as green cnty.sch,d,and its progeny require,that the assignment plan moves the school district toward unitary status,particularly where this plan allegedly causes immediate and substantial adverse effects on students.see,dayton bd.of educ.brinkman,d holding school board bears the heavy burden of showing that actions that increased or continued the effects of the dual system serve important and legitimate ends quotation marks omitted.any other conclusion would necessarily,but impermissibly,provide the school board with latitude to discriminate pending the resolution of some future hearing.

on appeal,appellants argue that the district court committed legal error by failing to apply,and requiring the school board to rebut,a presumption that any racial disparities in the assignment plan resulted from the school board prior unconstitutional conduct in operating a racially segregated school district before.we agree.
it is well established that once a court has found an unlawful dual school system,the plaintiffs are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are causally related to prior segregation,and the burden of proving otherwise rests on the defendants.baliles,at see also freeman pitts,d the school district bears the burden of showing that any current imbalance is not traceable,in a proximate way,to the prior violation.jacksonville,at since the board operated de jure segregated schools in the past,there is a presumption that any current racial disparities in these areas are the result of its past unlawful conduct.green,at it is incumbent upon the school board to establish that its proposed plan promises meaningful and immediate progress toward disestablishing state imposed segregation.united states fordice,d thomas,concurring acknowledging that the supreme court decisions following green have indulged the presumption,often irrebuttable in practice,that a presently observed imbalance has been proximately caused by intentional state action during the prior de jure era freeman,at scalia,concurring acknowledging that the supreme court cases provide that,once school segregation is shown to have existed there arises a presumption,effectively irrebuttable because the school district can not prove the negative,that any current racial imbalance is the product of that violation.i n school desegregation cases th is burden does not shift back to the plaintiffs until the school system achieves unitary status.baliles,at.
