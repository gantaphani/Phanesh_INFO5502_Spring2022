factual and procedural background 
gutkin complaint alleged that he was a tenured professor of mathematics at the university.in the wake of a dispute over the university requirement that gutkin teach extra classes to make up for classes he had not been able to teach in the fall semester,the university initiated dismissal proceedings against gutkin in october.but gutkin dismissal hearing was not scheduled to take place until early december,because,according to gutkin,i t took the university longer than anticipated to effectuate the deceptive alterations to the faculty h andbook that would govern the rigged dismissal procedures,and the university dragged its feet.gutkin further alleged that by december,the university had not finished its tampering,so the deceptively altered h andbook was not ready for posting on the internet by the time of the scheduled hearing consequently,the university unilaterally postponed the hearing until february.
the dismissal procedure outlined in the faculty handbook required a hearing before a panel of gutkin faculty peers.according to gutkin,the panel selection process set out in the revised faculty handbook constituted a charade of impartiality that resulted in a sham dismissal procedure.in march,the faculty panel issued a recommendation to the president of the university that found that gutkin had engaged in serious neglect of duty,a ground for termination in the faculty handbook.the president of the university terminated gutkin in march for serious neglect of duty,as found by the faculty panel.
a.the complaint.
gutkin filed his complaint on january,naming as defendants the university and four individuals joseph aoun,robert guralnick,susan montgomery,and wayne raskind.the complaint set forth seven causes of action fraud and deceit breach of contract wrongful termination in violation of public policy age discrimination defamation intentional infliction of emotional distress and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.
gutkin asserted all seven causes of action against the university.in addition,he alleged his fifth cause of action for defamation and his seventh cause of action for intentional interference with contract and prospective economic advantage against aoun,montgomery,and guralnick his sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against all four individuals and his seventh cause of action for intentional interference with contract and prospective economic advantage against aoun,montgomery,and guralnick.
b.the demurrers.
respondents demurred,requesting dismissal of the first,second,fifth,sixth,and seventh causes of action in the complaint on the ground that gutkin exclusive judicial remedy as to those claims was administrative mandamus under pomona college superior court th,d pomona college.gutkin,they argued,had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,and all of those claims were barred.
on may,the trial court ruled on the demurrers 
the university demurrers to the first cause of action for fraud and deceit,the second cause of action for breach of contract,the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress,and the seventh cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage were sustained without leave to amend.
raskind demurrer to the sixth cause of action the only one asserted against him was sustained without leave to amend.
the university and aoun demurrers to the fifth cause of action for defamation were sustained without leave to amend.
montgomery and guralnick demurrers to the sixth and seventh causes of action were sustained without leave to amend.as to the fifth cause of action for defamation,montgomery and guralnick demurrers were sustained with leave to amend the allegations of the complaint relating to the alleged false and defamatory statements montgomery and guralnick made to gutkin peers at other universities.
gutkin filed a writ petition on may,seeking review of the trial court ruling on the demurrers,which we summarily denied.
gutkin did not amend his complaint,and the trial court granted respondents subsequent motion to dismiss all of the individual defendants on june.
following the trial court rulings on the demurrers,only two claims remained against the university gutkin cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and his claim of age discrimination.
c.the discovery order.
on june,the trial court granted respondents motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents.the court ordered gutkin to produce a privilege log and to produce all documents responsive to particular demands in the document request.the court also granted respondents request for sanctions in the amount of 
gutkin did not produce the privilege log as ordered by the trial court.instead,on july,gutkin filed an ex parte application seeking to modify the court june,discovery order and delay further production of documents.the trial court found that gutkin had failed to show good cause and denied the application.gutkin then sought leave to amend his complaint to delete the allegations of fraud and deceit so as to render discovery of documents the court had ordered him to produce irrelevant.the trial court denied the motion on august.
gutkin voluntary dismissal.
on july,gutkin produced some of the documents the court had ordered produced,but indicated that he was continuing to withhold additional responsive documents,which he did not intend to produce.the university threatened to move for an award of further sanctions,including terminating sanctions.
the university noticed gutkin deposition to take place in.on august,prior to the scheduled date for gutkin deposition,gutkin filed a voluntary request for dismissal of his complaint without prejudice.
gutkin filed a notice of appeal on august.he then twice sought entry of judgment of dismissal on the basis of the trial court orders sustaining the demurrers to five of the seven causes of action and dismissal of the individual defendants,as well as his own voluntary dismissal of the action.the court clerk rejected gutkin proposed judgment of dismissal because a dismissal of the complaint had been entered and notice of dismissal given.gutkin then followed with a supplemental notice of appeal on october.
contentions 
with respect to the trial court sustaining of the demurrers,gutkin contends that he has a constitutional right to a jury trial of his claims against the university and the individual defendants.he maintains that this court holding in pomona college,supra,th,d,does not apply to the revocation of tenure.gutkin also contends that the conduct underlying his tort claims falls outside the employment relationship,and these claims should not be subject to administrative mandamus.
gutkin challenges the trial court discovery order and sanction award and the denial of his ex parte application to modify the discovery order.he contends that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering further production of documents that were subject to attorney work product protections the trial court imposition of sanctions was unjust and failed to recognize the substantial justification for the work product objection and the trial court abused its discretion in denying gutkin ex parte application for modification of the discovery order.
appealabilitya.the ruling on the demurrers.
gutkin correctly observes that after the trial court sustained respondents demurrer to five of his seven causes of action without leave to amend,the plaintiff power to voluntarily dismiss those five causes of action was terminated.those counts had been effectively tried by the court,and a voluntary dismissal can not be taken after trial commences.wells marina city properties,cal d.gutkin further contends that even though the trial court refused to enter judgment following his voluntary dismissal of the complaint,the court order sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend,combined with the dismissal of the action,had the legal effect of a final,appealable judgment.we agree.
in ashland chemical provence d,the plaintiff dismissed the complaint with prejudice after the trial court had sustained a defendant demurrer without leave to amend.plaintiff expressly dismissed the complaint only for the purpose of expediting appeal,to obtain a final judgment to enable it to contest the court ruling.id.at.on appeal the court rejected defendant contention that plaintiff may not appeal after voluntarily dismissing its complaint,noting,many courts have allowed appeals by plaintiffs who dismissed their complaints after an adverse ruling by the trial court,on the theory the dismissals were not really voluntary,but only done to expedite an appeal.id.at.see also stewart colonial western agency,th,d casey overhead door th,fn,d.
b.the interim orders.
the effect of gutkin voluntary dismissal of the action on the appealability of other interim orders in this case is another matter.it is well established that a voluntary dismissal under code of civil procedure section is not appealable.the entry of a request for dismissal is a ministerial,not a judicial,act,and no appeal lies therefrom.associated convalescent enterprises carl marks,d.a wilful dismissal terminates the action for all time and affords the appellate court no jurisdiction to review motions made prior to the dismissal.cook stewart mckee d.because gutkin dismissed his remaining claims in this case without prejudice,the voluntary dismissal could not have the legal effect of a final judgment,and could not serve to expedite an appeal.by voluntarily dismissing the action without prejudice gutkin lost his ability to challenge the trial court interim orders.accordingly,no appeal lies from the trial court discovery order and denial of the ex parte application in this case.ashland chemical company provence,stewart colonial western agency,and casey overhead door,all of which involved voluntary dismissals with prejudice,are therefore inapposite.
gutkin appeal of the trial court discovery order,monetary sanction order,and orders denying his ex parte application and motion for leave to amend the complaint,as well as the voluntary dismissal of the action is dismissed.
standard of review 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.citation.payne national collection systems,th,d,quoting aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.nevertheless,if no liability exists as a matter of law,we must affirm that part of the judgment sustaining the demurrer,and if the plaintiff can not show an abuse of discretion,the trial court order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend must be affirmed.traders sports,city of san leandro th,d.the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate the manner in which the complaint might be amended.citation.hendy losse cal d,d.
discussiona.gutkin claims fail under pomona college,and the trial court properly sustained respondents demurrer.
our analysis is governed by our decision in pomona college,which is dispositive of all but gutkin discrimination claims in this case.
in pomona college,an assistant professor brought a civil action seeking damages for wrongful termination and breach of contract and implied covenants after the college denied him tenure.pomona college,supra,th at,d.plaintiff claimed that the college had promised him tenure as long as his performance was acceptable,in accordance with the policies outlined in the college faculty handbook.ibid.he alleged that the college had breached his employment agreement by failing to follow its policies and procedures during the tenure review process.ibid.we ordered the college demurrer sustained without leave to amend on the basis of our conclusion that administrative mandamus under section provides the exclusive remedy to a professor in a private university for any procedural defects which he believes existed in the tenure review or in the grievance process.pomona college,at,d.
we concluded that the case law supported application of section to private as well as public universities,and observed c ourts have been reluctant to review the merits of a tenure decision because academic peers,unlike nonacademics,are equipped to evaluate the candidate teaching and research according to their conformity with methodological principles agreed upon by the entire academic community.they also have the knowledge to meaningfully evaluate the candidate contributions within his or her particular field of study as well as the relevance of those contributions to the goals of the particular institution.pomona college,supra,th at,d.for this reason,we concluded that courts must be vigilant not to intrude into that determination,and should not substitute their judgment for that of the college with respect to the qualifications of faculty members for promotion and tenure.determinations about such matters as teaching ability,research scholarship,and professional stature are subjective,and unless they can be shown to have been used as the mechanism to obscure discrimination,they must be left for evaluation by the professionals,particularly since they often involve inquiry into aspects of arcane scholarship beyond the competence of individual judges.citation.id.at,d.a bsent discrimination,judicial review of tenure decisions in california is limited to evaluating the fairness of the administrative hearing in an administrative mandamus action.id.at,d.
gutkin attempts to distinguish pomona college on the ground that it involved the decision to deny tenure whereas his case involves the revocation of tenure.but our holding in pomona college applies equally to the revocation of tenure as to the denial of tenure.it goes without saying that the decision of who should have tenure and represent a university is inextricably connected to the essential freedoms of a university to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach,what may be taught,how it shall be taught,and who may be admitted to study.pomona college,supra,th at,d,quoting sweezy new hampshire,d.indeed,gutkin himself acknowledges the importance of the role of academic peers in making tenure determinations a faculty position,held with tenure,is the ticket to full membership in the academic community.the decision to prom
