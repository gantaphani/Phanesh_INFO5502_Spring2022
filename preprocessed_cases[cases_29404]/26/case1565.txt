in this appeal we interpret education code section,subdivision e section allows school districts to establish reduced workload programs,schedules for certificated employees who are at least years old and who satisfy certain other conditions.we read section e to mean that while the reduced workload employee is paid the prorated share of his salary,he retains the insurance benefits accorded to employees as long as he makes the benefit payments that would be required if he remained in employment specifically at issue here are health insurance benefits.consequently,we reverse the judgment denying plaintiff sheldon praiser petition for writ of mandate,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
plaintiff sheldon praiser praiser was a,certificated teacher employed by defendant biggs unified school district district or the district for over years.on february,praiser requested reduced status pursuant to section.section d states that t he option of section employment shall be exercised at the request of the employee under section,praiser became a employee,with a corresponding prorated salary.pursuant to article xix of the collective bargaining agreement between district and its teachers article xix,district paid for praiser insurance benefits on a prorated basis and allowed him to pay the difference.
in november,praiser filed a petition for writ of mandate.he alleged that article xix violates section because it requires him to pay a portion of the health insurance premiums he would not have to pay if he were a employee.to avoid losing these insurance benefits,praiser has continued to pay a portion of the health insurance premiums to keep those benefits in effect.praiser requested a writ of mandate compelling district to pay the insurance premiums to the same extent as if he had remained in employment,and to reimburse him for the premiums he has paid.praiser also requested his attorney fees.
the trial court denied praiser petition for writ of mandate in its entirety.the court found that section e permits district to provide certificated employees,on a prorated basis,the same health benefits provided to employees.
discussion 
at the center of this dispute is the meaning of section e.this presents a question of statutory interpretation for us to determine independently 
the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislature intent to effectuate the law purpose in determining intent,we look first to the statute words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning when the language is unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,however,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,the legislative history,and the ostensible objects to be achieved 
section provides in part 
notwithstanding any other provision,the governing board of a school district or a county superintendent of schools may establish regulations which allow their certificated employees to reduce their workload from to duties.
the regulations shall include,but shall not be limited to,the following,if the employees wish to reduce their workload and maintain retirement benefits pursuant to section of this code or section of the government code 
a the employee shall have reached the age of prior to reduction in workload.
b the employee shall have been employed full time in a position requiring certification for at least years of which the immediately preceding five years were employment.
c during the period immediately preceding a request for a reduction in workload,the employee shall have been employed full time in a position requiring certification for a total of at least five years without a break in service 
d the option of employment shall be exercised at the request of the employee and can be revoked only with the mutual consent of the employer and the employee.
e the employee shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the salary he or she would be earning had he or she not elected to exercise the option of employment but shall retain all other rights and benefits for which he or she makes the payments that would be required if he or she remained in employment.
the employee shall receive health benefits as provided in section of the government code in the same manner as a employee.
f the minimum employment shall be the equivalent of of the number of days of service required by the employee contract of employment during his or her final year of service in a position.
g this option is limited in prekindergarten through grade to certificated employees who do not hold positions with salaries above that of a school principal.
h the period of this employment shall include a period of time,as specified in the regulations,which shall be up to and include five years for employees subject to section of the government code or years for employees subject to section of this code.
under the employment authorized by section,the employee is to be paid a prorated salary,but is to retain all other rights and benefits as long as he makes the payments for those rights and benefits that would be required if he were still a employee.if he would not have to make any payments for those rights and benefits as a employee,if the employer pays in full for those rights and benefits,he does not have to make any payments as a employee under section.
the second paragraph of section e states the employee shall receive health benefits as provided in section of the government code in the same manner as a employee.italics added.the italicized phrase provides the cornerstone of district argument that article xix specifically governs here.
subdivision a of government code section provides in relevant part that the legislative body of a local agency including a school district,subject to conditions as may be established by it,may provide for any health and welfare benefits for the benefit of its officers,employees,retired employees,and retired members of the legislative body,who elect to accept the benefits and who authorize the local agency to deduct the premiums,dues,or other charges from their compensation,to the extent that the charges are not covered by payments from funds under the jurisdiction of the local agency as permitted by government code section.italics added.
district notes in its brief that section e requires the district to provide employees with health benefits as provided in section of the government code in the same manner as a full time employee.emphasis in district brief.district further notes that government code section a permits the district,subject to conditions as may be established by it,to provide for any health and welfare benefits for the benefit of its officers and employees who elect to accept the benefits and who authorize the local agency to deduct the premiums,dues or other charges from their compensation emphases in district brief.from this district argues,government code section a specifically allows the district to establish conditions for the provision of health insurance benefits to its employees.
district claims that article xix establishes those conditions authorized by government code section a by specifying that a certificated employee granted a reduced services employment contract which encompasses section will be afforded on a prorated basis the same major medical,dental and vision plan provided regular employees of the district and shall have the right to pay the balance of the cost of insurance premiums not paid by the district 
district bolsters its argument by noting that government code section,referenced in government code section a,states in relevant part that from funds under its jurisdiction,the legislative body including the governing board of a school district may authorize payment of all,or such portion as it may elect,of the premiums,dues,or other charges for health and welfare benefits of officers and employees subject to its jurisdiction.emphasis in district brief.
there is a fundamental flaw,however,in the district reading of section e reference to government code section.government code
