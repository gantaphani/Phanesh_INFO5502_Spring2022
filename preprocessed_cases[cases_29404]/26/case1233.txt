carolyn singh was a medical student at george washington university gw from until she was dismissed for academic reasons in.singh later sued gw,saying that it had violated the americans with disabilities act ada by failing to accommodate her alleged learning disabilities.
singh began her medical studies after a high school and undergraduate career that both parties describe as illustrious,despite singh inferior she sees timed tests as opposed to other means of assessment.due in part to her poor performance on certain tests,such as the medical college admission test mcat,she was admitted to a decelerated program at gw,with a reduced courseload and heightened standards for academic dismissal.there she received failing or unsatisfactory grades in several courses,based in part on examinations.a faculty committee recommended to the school dean,john williams,that he dismiss her.shortly thereafter anne newman,an independent professional psychologist chosen by singh from a short list recommended by gw disability support services,diagnosed singh with dyslexia and a mild disorder of processing speed,and recommended various accommodations to improve her performance.singh communicated the diagnosis and a request for accommodations to dean williams,who shortly thereafter sent her a written notice of dismissal.
after singh brought suit,both sides moved for summary judgment as to whether she had a disability.the ada defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual.a.thus,a plaintiff is disabled under the ada if he suffers from an impairment the impairment limits an activity that constitutes a major life activity under the act and the limitation is substantial.haynes williams.the district court granted singh partial summary judgment on the issue of impairment,holding that she suffers from some kind of mental impairment,either a learning disability or a psychiatric disorder such as depression.singh george washington,d.but it denied summary judgment for singh or for gw on the issue of substantial limitation,which it reserved for trial.id.at.
after a bench trial,the district court found that singh had failed to prove that she was disabled under the ada it then entered judgment for gw.singh george washington.sch.of med.health,d.singh appeals.gw,though it need not have,as it sought no change in the final judgment in its favor.mut.life ins.ludwig,d per curiam freeman b b.in reality,gw seeks only affirmance of the judgment,either on the grounds of the district court latest opinion or on the basis of arguments that the district court rejected in various interlocutory rulings.we find gw correct in two of these arguments.although corrections in favor of the appellee would normally tend to support affirmance,we can not affirm but must remand to the district court for reasons developed below.
gw objects to four adverse interlocutory rulings rendered at the summary judgment stage.it contends that the district court chose the wrong comparison group by which to measure singh substantial limitation that the court misidentified the relevant major life activity that singh request to gw for reasonable modifications under title iii was untimely and that singh is not otherwise qualified to attend gw,even with reasonable modifications to the university program.we resolve issues and in favor of gw,and issues and in favor of singh.
substantial limitation.singh argued below that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of learning as compared with a population of similar age and education level,or,alternatively,with what she could achieve if she was either free of her learning disabilities or was provided reasonable accommodations.mem.supp.pl.cross mot.summ.opp defs.mot.summ.mem.on summary judgment,the district court held that an ada plaintiff can be substantially limited based on comparisons of her success to others of comparable age and educational background.d at.thus m edical students,while in medical school,can only compare their test scores to their fellow students.id.gw argues that the proper standard is whether singh limitation is substantial as compared to the average person in the general population.we agree with gw.
the ada never defines the term substantially limits.its plain text as the district court notes never speaks of making a comparison.id.yet substantial is an inherently relative term,one that demands some further standard of do the synonyms considerable or to a large degree,offered by the supreme court in toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,d.in speaking of the major life activity of performing manual tasks,the court required that an impairment prevent or severely restrict the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives.id.at.emphasis added.it added that the statutory text must be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.id.at.
the court language suggests a comparison to the general population,rather than to persons of elite ability or unusual experience.a restriction qualifies as severe only if it limits the impaired individual in the context of what most people do in their daily lives.thus wong regents of the university of california,cir,in applying toyota motor,asked whether plaintiff impairment substantially limited his ability to learn as a whole,for purposes of daily living,as compared to most people,not whether he could keep up with a rigorous medical school curriculum.id.at.similarly,most americans could not run a marathon,and few would regard someone who can run a no severely restrict ed in the major life activity of walking.thus,an injured ultramarathoner,who could once run miles at a time,is not disabled by an impairment that forces him to quit after miles,even though his limitation is substantial as compared to his unimpaired abilities or those of his erstwhile running partners.
the criterion also appears inherent in sutton united air lines,d,which required the consideration of corrective measures such as eyeglasses for the visually impaired in assessing disability.because petitioners allege that with corrective measures their vision is or better,they are not actually disabled within the meaning of the act if the disability determination is made with reference to these corrective measures.id.at.in a case decided the same day,albertson,kirkingburg,d,the court extended that principle to offsetting measures,namely a person learn ing to compensate for the disability by making subconscious adjustments to the manner in which he sensed depth and perceived peripheral objects.id.at.the court went on we see no principled basis for distinguishing between measures undertaken with artificial aids,like medications and devices,and measures undertaken,whether consciously or not,with the body own systems.id.at.similarly,a plaintiff diligent study or high background intelligence may serve to mitigate the effects of a impairment and allow a high level of functioning.yet measuring singh limitations by comparison to her hypothetical achievements without impairment,to her fellow medical students,or to others of similarly elite educational background individuals selected in part on the basis of their intelligence and dedication,would place the same mitigating factors on both sides of the comparison,rendering them effectively irrelevant.
it is intuitively appealing to measure limitation by comparing the plaintiff condition impaired with her own condition,unimpaired.there is something poignant,in some cases even tragic,in the plight of a person cut off from exceptional achievement by some accident of birth or history.but the ada is not addressed to that plight.rather,it is designed to enable the disabled,as a group,to participate in mainstream society.the statute notes that historically,society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities that people with disabilities,as a group,occupy an inferior status in our society,and are severely disadvantaged socially,vocationally,economically,and educationally and that individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who have been relegated to a position of political powerlessness.a.congress found that discrimination denies this group the opportunity to compete on an equal basis,and costs the united states billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity the ada therefore seeks to offer the disabled equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic.id.a.a plaintiff who,despite an impairment,can participate in all major life activities at the level of the average person in the general population neither is denied independent living and economic,nor burdens society with dependency and nonproductivity,nor falls within the kind of isolate d and segregate d minority described by the statute text.the ada promotes equal opportunity for the disabled,but only after toyota motor demanding standard is met.
this understanding gains credence from its adoption by executive agencies purporting to define substantially limits.the ada does not delegate authority to any agency to define disability or its component terms by regulation,see sutton,at,yet both the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the department of justice doj have done so.the eeoc describes an individual as substantially limited if she is either u nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform,or s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform the major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.j i ii.the doj similarly defines substantially limited as being restricted as to the conditions,manner,or duration under which the major life activity can be performed in comparison to most people,pt,app.b.it illustrates this definition by noting that a person who can walk for miles continuously is not substantially limited in walking merely because,on the eleventh mile,he or she begins to experience pain,because most people would not be able to walk eleven miles without experiencing some discomfort.id.
without deciding what respect these regulations are due,see sutton,at,we note that the standard is currently the law in all of our sister circuits to have addressed the matter,some of those circuits according a degree of deference sometimes substantial to the agency interpretations.see wong,at ristrom asbestos workers local joint apprentice,cir asking whether the plaintiff impairments limit his ability to learn to a considerable or large degree as compared to the average person in the general population palotai of at coll.park,cir comparing the plaintiff to the average person in the general population emerson states power,cir employing the standard in the context of learning bartlett state bd.of law exam rs,cir t he proper reference group is most people,not college freshmen.gonzales bd.of med.exam rs,cir t he ada compares the performance of an individual who alleges a restriction in a major life activity to that of most people.bowen income producing mgmt.of,cir noting that plaintiff was not substantially limited in his ability to learn given that even after his injury,plaintiff retained greater skills and abilities than the average person in general bercovitch baldwin,cir holding that,because a student achievement remained consistently above average,the plaintiffs had not met their burden of showing a probability of success that he suffered a substantial limitation of a major life activity soileau guilford of maine,cir limitation is to be measured in relation to normalcy,or,in any event,to what the average person does.
in contrast,the district court relied on and extended the eeoc separate definition of substantial limitation in the purported major life activity of working a definition that compares individuals to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities in their ability to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.j i.the district court found this more specific comparison to be more applicable,and it therefore read the eeoc regulations to require comparisons to people of similar age and educational background in the activity of learning as well.d at.this was a misreading of the regulations.the eeoc includes learning among a list of many major life activities,i,and applies the standard only to working.we are reluctant to extend the eeoc standard beyond the agency own regulations,especially in light of toyota motor observation that n othing in the text of the ada,our previous opinions,or the regulations suggests that a framework of major life activity analysis should apply outside the context of the major life activity of working.at.
singh defends the district court comparison to those of similar age and educational background on the ground that it would be unreasonable to compare her to newborns and centenarians.singh reply br.but the statutory findings describe the disabled population as increasing as the population as a whole is growing older,a,which would be inconsistent with a definition of disability that controls for age.moreover,an comparison might have perverse consequences for the ada application.if a woman with hip problems has difficulty walking,it would be strange to tell her that she walks at least as well as the average is,not well at is therefore not disabled or entitled to reasonable accommodations.
while we need not explore the ada outer reaches to decide this case,it seems that the law may already provide sensible means of addressing extreme age or youth.for one thing,the medical definition of an impairment will frequently make reference to age the mental development of a is fine for,but not for their parents.for another,the ada requires that the impairment be the effective cause of the plaintiff limitation a newborn with a malformed foot can not walk as well as the average person,but he is not disabled under the ada,because even perfectly healthy newborns can not walk.thus,if a dyslexic can not learn as well as the average person,a court might begin by comparing his learning ability to that of the average,bercovitch,at,using the comparison to clarify how much limitation the impairment is responsible for.
finally,we note that any measure of substantial limitation that might change based on a plaintiff particular educational,a comparison of m edical students to their fellow students,singh,d at make disabled status vary with a plaintiff current career choices,and would fail to achieve the ada additional purpose of providing clear,strong,consistent,and enforceable standards to address discrimination.b emphasis added.and comparing the impaired plaintiff with the counterfactual unimpaired plaintiff would pose a similar risk of inconsistency,as it would sometimes require the court to speculate on the degree to which the sort of compensating mechanisms alluded to in albertson would have come into play in the absence of the impairment.
major life activity.in moving for summary judgment,singh claimed to be substantially limited in the major life activity of learning.mem.on its own motion,however,the district court held that the citing grades and scores back and forth had reduced the activity of learning to the activity of test taking.d at.while the court did not resolve whether is itself a major life activity or merely a crucial component of the major life activity of learning,it concluded that a plaintiff with an impairment that substantially limits her ability to perform on tests has an actionable ada claim.id.
while the district court rightly observed that tests are often the gatekeepers to ever higher levels of learning,its conclusion was nonetheless error.first,itself is not a major life activity in toyota motor,the supreme court defined major life activities as those activities that are of central importance to daily life,including such basic abilities as walking,seeing,and hearing,at.see also id.at.adding that an impairment must prevent or severely restrict the individual from doing activities that are of central importanc
