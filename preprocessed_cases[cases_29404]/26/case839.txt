having consolidated the appeals for purposes of decision,we now affirm in and reverse in,concluding that the district satisfied the requirements of the due process clause with respect to gibson termination and.because gibson is no longer a prevailing party and thus not entitled to attorney fees and costs,we reverse in.
gibson was hired by the district as a probationary teacher and coach for the school year.the district employed gibson pursuant to a contract that was renewed for the and the school years.in november,the district sought to terminate gibson contract after he allegedly assaulted a student.in a letter dated november,the district suspended gibson with pay,alleging that gibson had grabbed a student by the throat,pushed him into the wall,and threatened to strike him with his fist,and displayed threatening,intimidating,erratic potentially violent behavior toward and in the presence of district personnel,manifested by yelling,raised or clenched hands,cursing,rage and other threatening and aggressive gestures.the letter advised gibson that he was entitled to a hearing,an attorney,to testify on his own behalf,to present witnesses and documents,to witnesses,and to seek judicial review of an adverse decision.the letter further stated that superintendent olin parks would recommend to the board that gibson be terminated.a second letter dated november,alleged two additional grounds supporting gibson termination insubordinate behavior in failing to respond to repeated requests for grade sheets,and material misrepresentations on his job application regarding his previous employment.
pursuant to school board policy,gibson requested a public hearing,which began on january.the district presented and gibson eight witnesses.because of the late hour,the hearing was adjourned until february.on february,gibson asked that the hearing be continued until february because of a death in his family.before the hearing was resumed,gibson rejected the district offer to pay him through the end of the school year,contingent upon his signing a release and agreeing to terminate the hearing.the offer letter stated that gibson teaching contract would not be renewed for the school year and,because a probationary teacher has no right to such a renewal,the offer likely exceeded what he could receive in a lawsuit.during january and february,the allegations against gibson were publicized in newspapers and in pamphlets.in addition,news spread through after several student and staff interviews were conducted.more than people attended each hearing.
gibson and his attorney met with the district attorney immediately prior to the start of the february,continued hearing and were told by him that he was going to recommend that the school board close the hearing during the testimony of two students due to perceived intimidation by other students,members of the community,and gibson.after objecting to this proposal,gibson and his attorney met with the two students and their parents and were told that the students were not intimidated and that they were comfortable testifying in the open hearing.gibson attorney related this information to the district attorney,who nevertheless maintained his stance that the hearing be closed during the students testimony,offering instead to proceed with the hearing over gibson objection,close it for the receipt of testimony from those two witnesses and then have the rest of the hearing open,or we can adjourn the hearing while you seek a writ of prohibition from our local judge requiring us to have the hearing open for receipt of all the testimony.gibson attorney then objected to the proposed closure on the record,informing the school board what the student witnesses had told him.upon learning that the board intended to close the meeting,gibson attorney told the board that he wished to continue the hearing so that he could seek a writ of prohibition in the circuit court of pemiscot county,missouri,compelling the board to keep open the hearing.
gibson filed such a petition on march.on march,however,the school board had met and voted not to renew gibson teaching contract for the following school year,offering as reasons gibson failure to follow district procedures in purchasing equipment and making travel arrangements.despite these stated reasons,the district court found that the true reason that the board did not renew gibson contract was because it considered him to be insubordinate,volatile,erratic,and potentially abusive to the students.at the end of the school year,the district declared gibson termination hearing moot,as his contract had expired and he had been paid in full for the entire school year.gibson dismissed his petition for writ of prohibition on july.

the due process clause protects against deprivations of liberty interests as well as property interests.when a governmental employer makes statements in connection with an employee termination or that seriously damage the employee good name,the employee may be entitled to a due process hearing at which he is given an opportunity to rebut the allegations and clear his name.shands city of kennett,cir citing board of regents of state colleges roth,d.
