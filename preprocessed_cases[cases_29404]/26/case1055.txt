jeffrey grubbs appeals following his conditional guilty plea on a charge of receiving a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.a.he contends that the district court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence,including his statements,because the anticipatory search warrant that authorized the search of his premises was invalid under the fourth amendment.to resolve grubbs claim,we must determine whether a facially defective anticipatory search warrant may be cured by information contained within an affidavit when that affidavit is not presented to the person or persons whose property is to be searched.we answer that question in the negative,and hold that the search of grubbs premises violated the fourth amendment 
factual and procedural history 
on april,united states postal inspector gary welsh welsh presented an application and affidavit for anticipatory search warrant to a federal magistrate judge.the application sought authority to conduct a search of grubbs residence on the basis of an order grubbs allegedly placed for a videotape entitled lolita mother and daughter.grubbs allegedly ordered the videotape from a website that advertised for sale numerous videos depicting illegal child pornography.welsh averred that grubbs sent him a letter which contained in cash and a note stating i hope this makes it to you please send film asap thanks jeff grubbs.on the basis of this evidence,the magistrate judge issued an anticipatory search warrant.the face of the warrant stated 
affidavit s having been made before me by who has reason to believe that on the premises known as residence of jeffrey grubbs,address as more particularly described in attachment a to the attached affidavit,in the eastern district of california there is now concealed a certain person or property,namely the records and materials described in attachment b to the attached affidavit.i am satisfied that the affidavit s and any recorded testimony establish probable cause to believe that the person or property so described is now concealed on the person or premises and establish grounds for the issuance of this warrant.
as revealed by the now concealed language,the inartfully drafted warrant approved by the magistrate was written on a form forthwith search warrant the only indication that the warrant was an anticipatory search warrant was the word anticipatory,handwritten at the top of the page above the words search warrant.the warrant itself did not state what triggering conditions needed to occur in order to make the warrant valid nor did it state the criminal activity of which grubbs was suspected.
the warrant relied on a affidavit to satisfy the specificity and particularity requirements of the fourth amendment.according to the affidavit,the warrant would become operative once the videotape grubbs ordered was received by a person s and taken into the residence.pages five and nineteen of the affidavit set forth these triggering events,or conditions precedent,upon which a search would become authorized.the affidavit also had two attachments attachment a described the premises to be searched attachment b listed the items to be seized,including the videotape and packing material,grubbs web tv components,and various other items.
the search took place two days later.at approximately,an undercover postal inspector delivered the videotape to grubbs residence.grubbs wife accepted the delivery of the package,signed for it,and took it into the house.a few minutes later,postal inspector thomas brucklacher saw grubbs leaving.at approximately,brucklacher and inspector esteban approached grubbs and,after identifying themselves,told him to remain where he was standing.grubbs asked brucklacher why he and the other inspectors were there.brucklacher did not answer,but instead referred him to inspector welsh,who was then approaching the residence.meanwhile,inspector esteban performed a patdown search of grubbs.
shortly after grubbs was detained outside of the house,inspector welsh arrived at the premises with a number of other law enforcement personnel.in all,there were ultimately ten officers and inspectors at the scene.welsh allegedly announced warrant at the front door.grubbs wife,bradstreet,disputed hearing that announcement,but did testify that she heard a knock and answered the door.welsh briefly entered the house to help several other officers perform a protective sweep.during that protective sweep,the officers searched the house for other people and stopped to prepare sketches of the interior.they permitted grubbs children to leave for school after searching their backpacks.after assisting the officers inside,welsh went back outside to speak with grubbs,who was on the sidewalk with other officers.welsh identified himself,and stated either you know why we here or do you know why we here grubbs replied yeah,and said that what the officers were looking for was in the garage.welsh told grubbs that he was not under arrest,but that they were there to serve a search warrant,and that they should go inside the house to talk 
grubbs and welsh,accompanied by officer esteban,entered the house together and sat down at the dining room table.it was not until,approximately minutes after the search began,that welsh presented grubbs with the search warrant the copy of the search warrant provided to grubbs included the two attachments,which described the place to be searched and the items to be seized,but did not include the affidavit that contained the triggering events or conditions precedent that would serve to make the warrant operative.welsh contended that he had a copy of the affidavit with him at all times during the search,and that his team had all read the affidavit on the previous evening.however,the government concedes that the affidavit was not presented to grubbs or bradstreet,and that no copy of the affidavit was left at the residence following the search.
after the warrant was presented,welsh reminded grubbs that he was not under arrest,advised him of his miranda rights,and asked if he understood those rights.grubbs said that he did and agreed to speak to welsh.the interview lasted approximately minutes.in it,grubbs admitted that he had ordered the pornography.he further admitted that he possessed child pornography in various digital forms in his home.at the conclusion of the interview,grubbs was arrested and handcuffed.the officers seized the videotape in question along with several other items,including grubbs computer and several computer diskettes 
within a few days,a grand jury returned an indictment charging grubbs with receiving a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.a grubbs filed a motion to suppress evidence,in which he challenged the admissibility of all of the seized evidence and his statements to welsh.grubbs made three principal claims that the agents failure to present the affidavit to grubbs or his wife rendered the warrant inoperative that the agents violated.d by failing to present the search warrant at the outset of the search and that his statement that the video was in the garage should be excluded as the product of an impermissible custodial interrogation.the first and third claims alleged constitutional violations.
following an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion to suppress in a written order.with respect to grubbs first claim,the fourth amendment claim,the district court held that the anticipatory warrant could constitutionally be executed even though it failed to designate the triggering event for the implementation of the anticipatory search.it did so on the basis that the warrant incorporated the affidavit by reference,and that the affidavit was in the immediate presence of the officers while they searched grubbs residence.the court did not consider the officers failure to present the affidavit to the residents of the home to be searched as constituting a constitutional defect.the district judge admitted that it is logical that officers would be required to actually present the affidavit setting forth the triggering event to the people whose property they are searching in order to provide those people with information regarding the parameters of the search.however,after concluding that no case from our circuit had ruled on the precise question,the court declined to apply that logic in the absence of specific guidance from the ninth circuit.thus,it upheld the search,even though none of the persons whose residence was searched were shown the affidavit that identified the triggering event.
after filing a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied,grubbs entered a conditional guilty plea to the sole charge of the a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.he reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,a term of supervised release,a fine of,and a special assessment.grubbs timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
the fourth amendment states that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.the requirement that warrants particularly describ e the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized is most often described as the particularity requirement.as the supreme court has recently explained,that requirement applies with equal force to searches whose only defect is a lack of particularity in the warrant.groh ramirez,d.
the groh court considered a warrant that failed to identify any of the items to be seized.at.at.despite the fact that the officers conducting the search had presented to the reviewing magistrate a detailed affidavit setting forth sufficient probable cause for the search,the warrant itself did not explicitly incorporate by reference the itemized list of things to be seized contained in the application.id.the officers in groh left the residents of the searched home a copy of the search warrant,but not a copy of the application,which had been sealed.id.at.the court found that the officers conduct directly conflicted with the purpose of the fourth amendment particularity requirement 
the fourth amendment by its terms requires particularity in the warrant,not in the supporting documents.and for good reason the presence of a search warrant serves a high function,and that high function is not necessarily vindicated when some other document,somewhere,says something about the objects of the search,but the contents of that document are neither known to the person whose home is being searched nor available for her inspection 
we have long held,moreover,that the purpose of the particularity requirement is not limited to the prevention of general searches.a particular warrant also assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer,his need to search,and the limits of his power to search.
groh,at.at,citations omitted.
our cases have long been in accord with the supreme court reasoning in groh.we have held that a search warrant is invalid when it does not contain a specific description of the types of items to be seized.see,united states spilotro,cir.and,while we have permitted facially defective warrants to be cured by an affidavit that a is incorporated within the four corners of the warrant and b accompanies the warrant,see united states van damme,cir,we have unequivocally held that the defect is not cured if the officers fail to present the is,an affidavit that is not shown to the persons being subjected to the search does not have a curative effect on a facially defective warrant.see united states mcgrew,cir.
as we explained in mcgrew,we require affidavits to accompany warrants not only in order to limit officers discretion in conducting the search,but also in order to inform the person subject to the search what items the officers executing the warrant can seize.id.at quoting united states hayes,cir emphasis in mcgrew.if the officers conducting the search were not required to present the affidavit to the residents of the house being searched,law enforcement personnel would be free to search as they like,and homeowners and others would have no effective way to ensure that the search of their premises conformed to the lawful constraints approved by an impartial magistrate.see id.at see also ramirez bow,cir when officers fail to attach the affidavit to a general warrant,the search is rendered illegal because the warrant neither limits their discretion nor gives the homeowner the required information,aff groh,at.at ramirez,at to stand a real chance of policing the officers conduct,individuals must be able to read and point to the language of a proper warrant.
our cases have similarly held,without exception,that the particularity requirement of the fourth amendment applies with full force to the conditions precedent to an anticipatory search warrant.an anticipatory search warrant is not valid until the occurrence of one or more triggering events in other words,the predicted future events that the magistrate determines will create sufficient probable cause to justify the search.and,when a warrant execution is dependent on the occurrence of one or more conditions,the warrant itself must state the conditions precedent to its execution and these conditions must be clear,explicit,and narrow.united states hotal,cir.the rationale for this rule is simple a warrant conditioned on a future event presents a potential for abuse above and beyond that which exists in more traditional settings inevitably,the executing agents are called upon to determine when and where the triggering event specified in the warrant has actually occurred.id.at quoting united states ricciardelli,cir.application of the particularity requirement is the only way effectively to safeguard against unreasonable and unbounded searches.id.at.
we have,however,permitted the triggering conditions of an anticipatory search warrant to appear either on the face of the warrant itself,or in the attachments to the warrant that those executing the search maintain in their immediate possession in order to guide their actions and to provide information to the person whose property is being searched.id.emphasis added see also united states vesikuru,cir it is important to emphasize that we have not held that the condition precedent must be stated within the four corners of the warrant itself.still,while an affidavit may qualify as a valid curing attachment to an otherwise defective warrant,it counts as such only when the affidavit actually accompanies the warrant.as we explained in hotal,
the first requirement,that the application but not the warrant itself identify the triggering event,does little if anything to limit the discretion of the agents executing the warrant or to inform the subject of the search whether it was authorized,if the affidavit does not accompany the warrant.indeed,that the applicant and the magistrate may understand the parameters of the search has no bearing on whether the officers executing the warrant do,or whether the person to be searched is properly advised of their authority.
hotal,at emphasis added.
the question in this case is whether a curative affidavit that contains the conditions precedent to an anticipatory search actually accompanies the warrant when the affidavit is not shown to the person or persons being subjected to the search.given our prior holdings,and the court most recent decision in groh,the district court was correct when it opined that it is logical that officers would be required to actually present the affidavit setting forth the triggering event to the people whose property they are searching in order to provide those people with information regarding the parameters of the search.likewise,the district court was right to conclude that the underlying reasoning of hotal supports the rule that the affidavit setting forth the triggering event for an anticipatory warrant must be presented to the people whose property is being searched.the district court,however,was unwilling to impose such a requirement in this case without further explicit guidance from us.
we believe that our prior cases unambiguously require
