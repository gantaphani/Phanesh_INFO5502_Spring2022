crestview elementary school appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of steve rusk on rusk action challenging crestview practice of placing flyers from community organizations advertising religious activities in students school mailboxes.the district court,ruling that crestview practice violated the establishment clause of the first amendment,issued a permanent injunction barring crestview from distributing flyers advertising religious activities.we conclude that crestview practice does not violate the establishment clause,and therefore we reverse the district court ruling and grant summary judgment in favor of crestview.
as a service to community organizations,crestview occasionally distributes flyers advertising activities sponsored by such various groups as the american red cross,the club,sports leagues,and local churches.some of the flyers describe religious activities for example,one flyer advertises games,bible stories,crafts and songs that celebrate god love,while another notes that a program is rated religious.
although the school does not have a written policy governing the distribution of flyers,according to crestview unwritten policy organizations first submit their flyers to the principal,who reviews them to ensure that the sponsoring organization is a group serving children in the community,and the flyer does not advocate the benefits of a particular religion and was not created for use as a recruiting tool.aff.of principal.if the principal approves a flyer,copies that the organization supplies are given to teachers,who place them in students mailboxes.crestview also uses these mailboxes for distributing official school papers.while teachers require students to remove the flyers from the mailboxes,teachers do not discuss the flyers either informally or as part of formal classroom instruction.
rusk is a parent of two children attending crestview.rusk contends that the school distribution of flyers advertising religious activities violates the establishment clause of the first amendment.his complaint sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting crestview from engaging in acts of proselytization.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted rusk motion in part,enjoining the school from distributing flyers or similar notices that advertise religious activities.the district court opinion specified that while crestview can not advertis e activities at which proselytization will occur,the injunction does not bar the school from distributing a dvertisements promoting a food drive sponsored by a local church or temple to benefit the poor of the community,or even a youth sports league.slip op.at.the court based its conclusion that crestview violated the establishment clause solely on the possibility that impressionable elementary school students would misperceive the school distributing flyers advertising religious activities as promoting religion.
crestview appeals the partial grant of rusk summary judgment motion and the denial of its own motion,arguing that crestview practice does not violate the establishment clause,and the free speech clause requires crestview to distribute flyers advertising religious activities.
a.the establishment clause 
in lemon kurtzman,the supreme court set forth the basic test for determining whether a state action violates the establishment clause,d.under lemon,the government has violated the establishment clause if the purpose of the state action is to aid or promote religion the primary effect of the action is to aid or promote religion or the result is excessive entanglement with religion.id.in this appeal,rusk does not contend that crestview practice is intended to promote religion or results in excessive entanglement with religion.instead,rusk argues that because the practice in effect endorses religion,it is unconstitutional either under the lemon test second element or under other supreme court precedents.
whether a particular state action endorses religion depends upon how a reasonable observer would interpret the action.see capitol square review advisory bd.pinette,d,concurring see also zelman,d n o reasonable observer would think a neutral program of private choice carries with it the imprimatur of government endorsement.lynch donnelly,d holding that a reasonable observer would interpret the inclusion of a nativity scene in a public holiday display to be acknowledging,rather than promoting,religion.
we disagree on two grounds with rusk contention that in deciding whether a reasonable observer would perceive endorsement,this court should assess crestview practice from the perspective of a crestview student.first,because crestview students can not participate in any of the advertised activities without their parents permission,the relevant observers are the parents.see good news club milford cent,d t o the extent we consider whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the club activities,the relevant community would be the parents,not the elementary school children.it is the parents who choose whether their children will attend the good news club meetings.citation omitted.as such,the parents must be deemed aware that crestview distributes flyers advertising both religious and nonreligious community events.zelman,at.noting that the reasonable observer in the endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware of the history and context underlying a challenged program internal quotation marks omitted.given this awareness,no reasonable observer could conclude that by distributing the flyers at issue here,crestview is endorsing religion.see lamb chapel center moriches union free sch,d rejecting anticipated establishment clause challenge to policy concerning use of school facilities and ruling that because religious and secular organizations would have equal access,there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the school district was endorsing religion or any particular creed.
second,even if the crestview students were the relevant audience,their youth would not alter the outcome of our reasonable observer analysis.the supreme court has,as rusk points out,expressed general heightened concerns about the impressionability of elementary school students,edwards aguillard,d the court has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the establishment clause in elementary and secondary schools.widmar vincent,d university students are,of course,young adults.they are less impressionable than younger students and should be able to appreciate that the university policy is one of neutrality toward religion.but despite such concerns,the court has never ruled that a school practice might amount to an impermissible endorsement of religion because of the impressionability of the school young students.the court opinion in milford suggests just the elementary school students possible misperceptions of endorsement are an insufficient basis for finding an establishment clause violation 
we can not operate,as milford would have us do,under the assumption that any risk that small children would perceive endorsement should counsel in favor of excluding the club religious activity.we decline to employ establishment clause jurisprudence using a modified heckler veto,in which a group religious activity can be proscribed on the basis of what the youngest members of the audience might misperceive.

rusk citation to lee weisman does not convince us that whether distributing flyers advertising religious activities constitutes endorsement of religion depends on how a reasonable elementary school student would perceive the practice.in lee,the supreme court held that a public school practice of inviting local clergy to offer prayers at middle and high school graduation ceremonies violated the establishment clause,d.the court opinion noted two controlling factors the offering of a prayer at school graduation ceremonies constituted a religious activity and although not required,attendance at the ceremonies was in a fair and real sense obligatory.id.at.the court discussed at length the likely coercive ef
