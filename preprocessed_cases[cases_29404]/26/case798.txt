background 
bailey is a psychologist who was under contract with dese to provide consultation services for dese social security disability determinations unit ddu.bailey consulting duties entailed reviewing disability benefits cases to determine whether the claims contained proper evidence supporting an award or denial of benefits.
in approximately,missouri and nine other states began a pilot program called prototype instituted by the social security administration ssa to implement new procedures designed to streamline the benefits application review process.as part of the procedures,dese was permitted to use speech and language pathologists slps to help assess speech and language pathologies in child benefits cases.before this federal regulatory change,consultants like bailey offered opinions about an applicant mental health as well as speech and language problems raised in an application.after the change,slps could sign off on approval of claims based on speech and language pathologies thus,it was common for both an slp and a mental health consultant to review the same file for separate consideration.
in implementing the prototype procedures,ddu deputy administrator neil scully scully adopted a target allowance rate representing the level of claim allowance under the old procedures.the goal was that the allowance rate under the prototype procedures should be at least equal to the allowance rate under the old system.
bailey expressed concerns about what he believed to be a quota system,contending some claimants,especially children with speech and language pathologies,were being awarded benefits to which they were not entitled.bailey testified he consistently spoke out to supervisors and managers about his concerns.others testified bailey position was a fact.
in early,scully called a meeting with bailey and other management employees in the office of bailey supervisor,carolyn otterson otterson,to address problems with bailey unwillingness to sign off on slp decisions,particularly one slp complaint about bailey denial of a case.bailey testified he 
reiterated why i was making the conclusions i was making about particular cases,that i looked at things on a case by case basis and that i was following the regulations and the main thrust of that meeting was that scully liked the numbers he was getting he told me to comply with that in no uncertain terms if i wanted to stay with the program.
bailey claims he expressed his concern that blind adherence to an allowance rate would conflict with a consultant professional judgment and the case by case nature of the system,and scully told bailey he better stick with the program.
in the summer of,bailey began to have personality clashes and professional disagreements with a fellow consultant.on august,bailey and scully met at a conference.they privately argued about the slp program and a report scully had received about bailey engaging in unprofessional conduct with an slp.other complaints about bailey climbed the supervisory ladder to scully,who eventually forwarded the complaints to his boss,dese assistant commissioner ronald vessell vessell.on september,bailey drafted and sent via facsimile a letter to vessell,making an official complaint in regards to scully and detailing professional disagreements bailey and scully had over scully award target goal and the slp program.on the same day,vessell and scully met to discuss bailey,and vessell terminated bailey contract.vessell claims he did not read the letter before terminating bailey contract,but the jury found the letter was a motivating factor in dese decision to terminate bailey contract.
before trial,the district court asked the parties to draft proposed jury instructions that specifically describe the speech which forms the basis for the claim.bailey failed to identify specifically the particular speech,instead proposing as an instance of speech,plaintiff repeated,open criticism about established allowance quotas and wrongful allowances as stated to neil scully and supervisors and bailey september,letter to vessel.the district court then drafted its own instructions,identifying three specific instances of alleged speech for jury consideration bailey statements during the early meeting in otterson office bailey statements to scully at the conference on august,and the september,letter to vessell.
during the trial,the district court,over bailey objection,sua sponte drafted special jury interrogatories regarding the balancing of bailey interests against those of dese,based on the pickering balancing test.pickering,at.see connick myers,d.the jury determined bailey statements during the meeting in otterson office and bailey letter to vessell,but not bailey statements to scully at the conference,were motivating factors in dese decision to terminate bailey contract.the jury also found,in response to the pickering special interrogatories,bailey statements during the meeting in otterson office and bailey letter to vessell cause d,or could have caused,disharmony or disruption in the working relationship between those working for dese,and bailey letter impair ed his ability to perform his duties.
following trial,the district court directed judgment as a matter of law in dese favor,holding bailey speech was not entitled to first amendment protection,and even if it were,application of the pickering balancing test favored dese.

speech protected by the first amendment 
bailey argues the district court erred in directing judgment against him and holding his speech was not entitled to first amendment protection public employee speech is protected from retaliation,in certain circumstances,if the speech addresses a matter of public concern.garcetti ceballos,d citing connick,at,pickering,at.shands city of kennett,cir.so long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern,they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.garcetti.at.when the state is acting as the employer of a public employee,we focus on the role the employee assumed in advancing the particular expressions that of a concerned public citizen,informing the public that the state institution is not properly discharging its duties or merely as an employee,concerned only with internal policies or practices which are of relevance only to the employees of that institution.cox dardanelle pub.sch,cir footnote and citation omitted.when the employee speech includes matters of both public concern and personal interest,we 
must analyze the content,form,and context of the speech to determine whether the speaker was acting primarily as a concerned citizen or as an employee.if the speech was mostly intended to further the employee private interests rather than to raise issues of public concern,her speech is not protected,even if the public might have an interest in the topic of her speech.
