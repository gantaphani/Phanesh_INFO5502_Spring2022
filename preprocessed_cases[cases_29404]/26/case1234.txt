the petition for review filed by pace university seeks to have the court hold that the national labor relations board abused its discretion in applying its nonrelitigation rule.under that rule the board has determined that only in limited circumstances will a party be permitted to reopen a representation issue during an unfair labor practice proceeding.pace maintains that it did not raise an issue regarding the scope of the bargaining unit during the representation proceeding because it thought it had prevailed on the issue and only realized there was disagreement during collective bargaining negotiations with the duly elected union.in applying the rule,however,the board pointed to the record in the representation proceeding where pace was repeatedly asked to state its position on the issue and declined to explain the nature of its concern,instead urging that its motion to dismiss the union certification petition be granted due to prejudicial timing.
in view of the board reasonable determination of how it will conduct its proceedings,there was no abuse of discretion by the board.the board refusal to adopt an exception for claimed reliance upon a mistake of fact illustrates the principle behind the rule on an issue of central importance in the representation proceeding,a party having reason,ability,and opportunity must make its position a matter of record.otherwise,the rationale for the importance of the finality of elections and avoidance of delay in enforcing their compromised.accordingly,we deny the petition for review of the board order that pace unlawfully refused to bargain with the certified union representative and grant the board for enforcement of its order.
the relevant facts are undisputed.in december,the new york state united teachers union petitioned the board for certification as the representative of adjunct and faculty members adjuncts at pace university,a private,nonprofit institution of higher education.the number of adjuncts varies during the calendar year,ranging from approximately employed by pace in the summer semester to during the spring semester of the academic year,for example they are employed by the semester,but are frequently reappointed and receive increased promotional,salary,and other benefits according to years of service.pace filed a motion to dismiss the union petition on the ground that it was filed at a prejudicial time in the academic year when few adjuncts were employed.then,after a hearing in january,pace objected that the unit was unsupported by the evidence.
in response to pace objection,the regional hearing officer reopened the record and held a hearing in february.during this hearing pace did not contest the inclusion in the bargaining unit of adjuncts whom it subsequently sought,during the unfair labor practice proceeding,to exclude from the certified unit.the regional director denied pace motion to dismiss and issued an election order defining the scope of the bargaining unit and the criteria the board denied pace request for review of the election order on the ground that the petition raised no substantial issues warranting review and finding without merit pace claims of bias of the regional director and hearing officer.at this point,pace had raised no objection regarding the adjuncts whom it sought to have excluded during the unfair labor practice proceeding.
in response to pace letter seeking clarification of two footnotes in the regional director election order regarding which adjuncts would be eligible to vote at the election,the regional director issued an amended election order,which read,in relevant part 
included in the bargaining unit all adjunct faculty members,instructors,and all adjunct faculty members and instructors who work in a dual capacity for the employer,employed by the employer.
excluded all other employees,including adjunct faculty and instructors employed in the school of law,all faculty,casual employees,independent contractors,guards and supervisors within the meaning of the act.
pace did not seek board review of the amended election order 
the union won the election and in may the board certified it as the representative of the adjuncts bargaining unit.negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement between pace and the union commenced.a dispute arose in october about whether the bargaining unit included only those adjuncts eligible to vote.see supra note.in february,the union filed a petition for unit clarification.in response,the regional director stated that the unit included all adjuncts who teach at least credit hours hours in one semester,regardless of their eligibility to vote.the board denied pace petition for review on the ground that it raised no substantial issues warranting review regarding clarification of the unit.two members of the board noted that,although this was not the case to do so because the parties had not litigated the definition of casual employee and pace had not previously challenged the scope of the unit with respect to adjuncts,the board should reconcile its decisions on whether unit inclusion and voter eligibility must be coextensive.
when pace refused to resume collective bargaining negotiations,the board general counsel filed a complaint based on the union unfair labor practice charge,and moved for summary judgment.in defense,pace argued that the board unit determination was invalid because it included adjuncts who were casual employees and ineligible to vote in the election.the board,pursuant to its rule,refused to address the issue,observing that a ll representation issues raised by pace were or could have been litigated in the prior representation proceedings.pace,nlrb,case,wl,at,order.the board found that pace refusal to bargain violated a and of the national labor relations act the act,and issued a cease and desist order directing pace to bargain upon the union request.pace petitions for review.
pace contends that the board abused its discretion in refusing to allow litigation of representation issues in the unfair labor practice proceeding.it also challenges the board bargaining unit determination on several grounds,contending that the board erred as a matter of law in basing its decision upon an inappropriate unit determination,contrary to the act and board precedent,whereby the unit included members who were ineligible to vote casual employees excluded from the bargaining unit are those adjuncts who are ineligible to vote,namely those who teach more than credit hours hours in one semester,but have not done so for at least two of the last three academic years and there was not substantial evidence in the record that such adjuncts share a community of interest with other adjuncts as would justify placing them in the same bargaining unit.the board seeks enforcement of its order on both procedural and substantive grounds.
the board has broad discretion to define the contours of an appropriate bargaining unit.b skyline,nlrb.once a union is certified for a unit,the act prohibits an employer from refusing to bargain with the union.a,see exxon chem.nlrb.the board has authority under the act to make,amend,and rescind such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.under the act and the board rules,the representation proceeding is the forum designed for parties to contest the appropriateness of a bargaining unit.id.b.
