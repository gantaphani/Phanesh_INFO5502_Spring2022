defendant stockton unified school district filed an accusation against tenured teacher plaintiff david boliou boliou specifying conduct it claimed merited boliou dismissal.boliou denied the conduct and demanded a hearing,which the school district scheduled.after the school district and boliou vigorously litigated the case for months and the school district received some unfavorable rulings,the school district attempted to dismiss the charges before the hearing on the merits of the charges.at the hearing,the commission on professional competence commission granted the school district motion to dismiss the charges over boliou objection that he wanted a ruling that he should not be dismissed from his employment.such a ruling would have entitled him to reasonable attorney fees and costs.boliou took two writ petitions to the trial court.the trial court issued a writ of administrative mandate to order the commission to modify its dismissal order to include a determination that boliou should not be dismissed and issued a writ of administrative mandate to order the school district to pay boliou reasonable attorney fees and costs.
the issue we must resolve here is whether the trial court erred in issuing these writs.the answer is no based on the plain language of the relevant statutes.specifically,if a teacher demands a hearing on disciplinary charges and the governing board of the school district governing board exercises its option to schedule a hearing instead of rescinding the charges,the hearing shall be commenced,subd.a.the hearing must be conducted by the commission,subd.b,and the commission shall prepare a written decision containing a disposition that shall be,solely,one of the following a that the employee should be dismissed.b that the employee should be suspended for a specific period of time without pay.c that the employee should not be dismissed or suspended,subd.c.if the commission determines that the employee should not be dismissed or suspended,the governing board shall pay the expenses of the hearing and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the employee,subd.e.
based on the statutory language quoted above,we affirm the trial court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
boliou began teaching mathematics at franklin high school in the school district in.in november,one of his students alleged he had covered her mouth with duct tape as punishment for excessively talking in his classroom.in response to the allegation,the school district filed an accusation in february against boliou recommending he be dismissed based on three charges immoral or unprofessional conduct evident unfitness for service and persistent violations of school laws district rules and regulations.boliou denied the charges and demanded a hearing before the commission.the school district requested the hearing be set.the office of administrative hearings set a hearing to begin on january.
discovery commenced with disputes over such issues as whether boliou was entitled to the names of the students who claimed to have witnessed the duct tape incident and whether the school district discovery requests were timely.there were also disputes that went up to the trial court regarding whether boliou was compelled to answer certain deposition questions.
a prehearing conference and mandatory settlement conference in front of administrative law judge alj dian vorters was held in december.among other things,alj vorters denied boliou motion to dismiss the unprofessional conduct charge and the persistent violation charge.
the hearing before the commission was convened on january.outside the presence of the other two commission members,the alj who was presiding over the hearing,marilyn woollard,considered boliou in limine evidentiary motions,which included a motion to exclude evidence or testimony regarding a notice of unprofessional conduct and a motion to reconsider alj vorters decision denying dismissal of the unprofessional conduct charge.alj woollard took the matter under submission and continued the hearing.two days later,alj woollard issued an order dismissing the unprofessional conduct charge because the school district failed to provide boliou sufficient advance notice of the charge.the school district motion to reconsider woollard order was denied and so was its writ petition to the trial court requesting that alj woollard be ordered to reinstate the unprofessional conduct charge.
the school district served boliou on july,with an amended notice of hearing stating the hearing before the commission would commence july.however,the governing board voted to rescind the remaining charges against boliou on july.the governing board then sent a letter to alj woollard asking that the case be removed from calendar and the case not proceed to hearing.boliou objected because he wanted a decision from the commission stating,he shall not be dismissed.alj woollard construed the governing board letter as a motion to dismiss the case and set a hearing to address the school district motion to dismiss in light of the governing board action rescinding the charges against boliou.
at the hearing on july,two of the three commission members appeared in person including alj woollard and one appeared telephonically.boliou argued the governing board had the opportunity to rescind its action when boliou asked for a hearing but the board chose not to and instead chose to schedule administrative litigation between the parties all the way through an interim action before a superior court judge to try to get judge woollard prior order overturned,which was rejected by the superior court.boliou asked for a ruling on the merits,noting that basically what you have is on the date scheduled for hearing,the school district is standing up and resting a nd in light of that,boliou does need to present anything because the school district did make out a prima facie case against him.the school district argued the commission could not make any findings of fact because there had been no facts presented and asked for a dismissal of the action.
after taking the matter under submission,on july,the commission issued a dismissal order granting the school district motion to dismiss the remaining charges against boliou but with prejudice.the commission explained the dismissal was with prejudice because the school district had ample opportunity to assess and weigh the viability of these charges,having been on notice to proceed with these remaining charges since january but waited to rescind the charges until july two business days before the start of the hearing.however,the commission specified its dismissal order did not constitute a decision because it was not authorized to issue a decision where the governing board had rescinded the charges and requested dismissal prior to the commencement of trial.for this reason,boliou was not entitled to attorney fees attendant to such a decision.
boliou sought reasonable attorney fees and costs from the school district by filing a claim under the governmental claims act.the school district rejected his claim.boliou then filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate and writ of mandate in the trial court.he sought a writ of administrative mandate to compel the commission to vacate its dismissal order to the extent of its determination that the dismissal with prejudice was not a decision on the merits in his favor entitling him to an award of reasonable attorneys fees and costs.he sought a writ of mandate to compel the school district to pay his reasonable attorney fees and costs.
the trial court issued the writs.the court reasoned that because the hearing in front of the commission had been convened,the governing board could not unilaterally extinguish the administrative proceeding by rescinding the charges,and the commission should have entered a decision on the merits that the governing board failed to meet its evidentiary burden such that boliou should not be dismissed.the court issued a peremptory writ of administrative mandate to direct the commission to modify the dismissal order to state the commission dismissal with prejudice constituted the commission determinati
