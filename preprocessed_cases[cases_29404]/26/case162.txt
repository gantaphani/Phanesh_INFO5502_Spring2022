between march and july,chappaqua committee on special education the committee met several times to discuss progress and formulate an iep for year in.parents requested that chappaqua consider placing in the eagle hill school,a private school for disabled children.the committee declined to do so,and produced an iep providing for classes at a public middle school.the iep also provided for meetings with parents every four to six weeks where progress,including the level of prompting required,was to be discussed.other programs included additional academic instruction occupational and speech therapy psychiatric and psychological services and summer programs.the iep noted that required prompting to maintain focus,but stressed the importance of developing independence in applying reading and math skills and following classroom routines.though would only use a private bathroom at school,he no longer required prompting and an escort as had previously been necessary.the iep noted tangential speech,and that his b ehavior seriously interferes with instruction due to frequent tuning out and inattention.an additional adult such as a program assistant is needed.although not explicitly stated in the iep,a personal aide would again have been provided.
in august,parents informed the committee that they did not accept the iep and would enroll at eagle hill.they requested an administrative hearing to obtain reimbursement from chappaqua for the cost of eagle hill.they contended that chappaqua failed to offer a free appropriate public education by,among other things,not providing for a functional behavioral assessment fba of.an fba is the process of determining why the student engages in behaviors that impede learning and how the student behavior relates to the environment.r.

chappaqua director of special education and the school psychologist testified that the personal aide and prompting had successfully addressed inattentive behavior.psychological and psychiatric services were recommended to assess tangential and fantasy speech.the psychologist testified that incidents of this speech requiring his involvement decreased over the course of the school year,and that had improved tremendously in terms of his ability just to be part of the social environment.the director testified that had learned to recognize and alleviate distractions on his own by asking his classmates to stop making noise.both the director of special education and the school psychologist testified that an fba was unnecessary.
speech pathologist testified that tangential speech was minimal,and when it occurred she was able to successfully refocus to communicate meaningfully.teacher testified that she was able to effectively educate with prompting and cuing,and identified areas where prompting was decreased when it was no longer necessary.teacher testified that had progressed in the curriculum and in social interactions during the school year.
special education teacher kathy rowland testified that the school psychologist and teacher nodded their heads in agreement when mother stated at a march committee meeting that she thought had not made progress at home.when asked whether an fba is warranted for a student whose behavior seriously interferes with instruction,rowland initially responded that there are many factors,but when the question was asked again,stated i ca say no,so i would have to say yes.however,she also testified that she did not believe an fba was required for 
after the hearing,the iho ruled in favor of parents,finding that chappaqua erred in failing to conduct an fba,and that the personal aide served as a crutch or palliative measure that hindered the development of independence.the iho further found that eagle hill was an appropriate placement,and ordered chappaqua to reimburse the parents for the cost of eagle hill in.
chappaqua appealed to an sro.the sro reversed,finding that chappaqua adequately assessed behavior and produced an iep that was reasonably calculated to enable to receive educational benefits in the least restrictive environment.thus,the decision not to conduct an fba did not rise to the level of denying the student a free appropriate public education.the sro also noted ways in which the iep addressed need to develop independence.
the parents pursued their claim in the district court,which granted them summary judgment on the administrative record.the district court found that chappaqua failure to conduct an fba was a procedural violation of the idea that denied a free appropriate public education the provision of a personal aide and a private bathroom to made the iep substantively inappropriate because it promoted learned helplessness and not independence and eagle hill was an appropriate placement for.the district court awarded tuition reimbursement and attorneys fees and costs to parents.
