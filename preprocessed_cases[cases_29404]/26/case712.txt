leonard trejo was a assistant professor of psychology at the university of illinois campus who received three appointments to his position in each of the school years between and before he got into trouble necessitating his discharge.after the university terminated him in august,trejo filed suit under,alleging that the university violated his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and due process under the constitution of the united states and the state of illinois.the district court dismissed trejo free speech claims and granted the university motion for summary judgment with respect to trejo due process claims.we affirm.
factual background 
in august,as part of an affirmative action plan,leonard trejo was appointed to teach as a probationary,assistant professor in the department of psychology at the university of illinois.trejo appointment was subject to renewal at the end of each school year,and he was eligible to be considered for tenure only if he met the university expectations for teaching courses,researching and publishing articles,and serving as a mentor to students over the course of several years.the university came to the conclusion after an investigation that trejo had failed to meet these expectations.in october,the chairman of the psychology department,edward shoben,received several complaints from students about trejo misconduct and,after an investigation,expressed concerns about trejo trustworthiness,lack of judgment,and serious problems relating to students,especially women.thereafter,shoben drafted a report of his conclusions and findings and contacted the university administrators and recommended trejo termination.the administrators then proceeded to conduct their own independent investigation and,after review,refused to renew trejo contract.
the complaints that shoben received concerning trejo were made by several female graduate students who approached shoben upon their return from an academic conference in toronto,canada,they attended with trejo in october.trejo and the illinois students were lodged in the same hotel that was also the site of the academic conference,and following the first day of presentations,they met with several of the conference attendees for late night drinks and a meal at the hotel restaurant and bar.over the next minutes,trejo attempted to regale his dinner companions with a discussion of a documentary recently aired on a local television station concerning the sexual behavior of primates.
trejo vociferously opined that there is a relationship between pregnancy,orgasms,and extramarital affairs and went on to advocate sex outside marriage and extramarital affairs.trejo claims that his intent was to foster an academic debate over sociobiological theories of mating by asking whether we can take an animal model of sexual behavior and extrapolate it to humans.he characterized his comments as being intellectual and clinical in nature,saying that he focused exclusively on matters of reproductive biology and scrupulously avoided the use of questionable or offensive language.it is interesting to note that in his deposition before trial,trejo refused to concede that his incorporated the use of hand gestures to demonstrate various parts of the female anatomy,including the objectionable in any respect.
every other man and woman seated at the table that evening at the conference was offended by trejo speech,concluding that he was out of control and that his remarks were little more than thinly veiled sexual solicitations directed at the female graduate students in the group.one graduate student,leun otten,stated that trejo was using the conversation as a way to broach matters related to sex.graduate student jennifer isom and wichita state university professor darryl humphrey concurred with otten sentiments,stating that trejo who was married at the time was trying to persuade the women at the table to embrace the notion that it is acceptable to have an extramarital affair.when referring to trejo,a third graduate student,timothy weber,stated that the entire conversation had sexual undertones and a propositioning aspect,adding that trejo seemed to be testing the waters,possibly trolling for females or finding companionship for the evening.graduate student blair hicks further was of the opinion that trejo seemed to be taking some sort of sadistic pleasure in making the female students feel uncomfortable.indeed,once trejo left the table,an embarrassed professor humphrey subsequently felt it necessary to apologize to the students for trejo behavior.
trejo seemed indifferent to the concerns of his dinner companions,for he continued his pattern of sprinkling comments into conversations during the next several days of the conference.for example,later that same evening trejo invited graduate students jennifer keller and brandy isaacks to play cards in his hotel suite,and after they grew tired trejo commented that the female students should undress,declaring,well,it either we going to quit playing cards or we all going to get naked and go to bed the next night,as trejo and humphrey were preparing to attend a party in the hotel grand ballroom,trejo proceeded to make vulgar and disgusting comments and jokes about women,using coarse and derogatory language that we refuse to repeat in this opinion he also suggested to humphrey that they should go to the president party and see if we can find some women to bring back later on,while in attendance at the party,trejo struck up a conversation with a stanford university professor who knew isaacks and commented that he wanted to get his hands on her.
in addition to making sexually charged comments in the presence of male and female professors and students,trejo also saw fit to engage in childish behavior while attending a party in humphrey hotel suite.after lamenting the fact that he was having marital problems,trejo decided that he wanted to entertain his guests and drink a can of beer while standing on his head.trejo repeatedly pleaded with keller to pour the beer in his mouth but she refused.trejo eventually found another person to serve him alcoholic beverages in this peculiar manner as he proceeded to become intoxicated.meanwhile,the party continued into the wee hours of the morning until about,and at this time,trejo telephoned isaacks and awoke her,impersonated a male graduate student,and invited her to his room to play cards.not surprisingly,isaacks declined the invitation and remained in her room.
in the days following the illinois delegation return to the campus,trejo persisted with his unwelcome invitations to engage keller and isaacks in extracurricular social activities.trejo sent the two women an inviting them to play euchre at a local tavern.in the,titled obligatory challenge,trejo alluded to his impending divorce by referring to his wife as my stbx and writing,well,my stbx has always said i a male chauvinist.perhaps that why i like to challenge j b to a rematch at euchre.how about it guys the students responded that they were not interested and thereafter consulted their faculty mentor,gregory miller,and told him about trejo lascivious behavior in toronto.the students ultimately decided to meet with shoben and expressed their concerns about trejo continuous pattern of unwelcome,inappropriate,boorish behavior and requested shoben assistance in resolving these problems.the students went on to explain they felt uncomfortable and awkward around trejo and were avoiding contact with him by steering clear of his office and were refusing to enroll in his classes.they added that they were reluctant to approach trejo directly and file a formal grievance in view of the fact that he served on a committee that distributed research grants and they were in fear of possible retaliation.
shoben proceeded to investigate the complaints,and after speaking with more than a dozen individuals,he concluded that trejo had behaved boorishly around numerous female graduate students ever since his arrival in urbana in august.shoben learned,among other things,that trejo solicited at least three students for dates,even going so far as to invite one woman to dress up in something skimpy and take a motorcycle ride with him on the beach.shoben also became aware during his investigation that trejo had similar difficulties with this type of conduct at his prior place of employment at the navy personnel research and development center in southern california.
shoben spoke with trejo on three separate occasions between december and march in an attempt to inform trejo of the allegations and invite a response.trejo took umbrage and denied the charges,but as shoben proceeded with the investigation,one of his main concerns was that trejo appeared to be less than truthful.for example,trejo initially refused to admit contacting isaacks in the middle of the night and criticized shoben for believing that he was the kind of person who would do something like call a female graduate student at pretending to be someone else.however,trejo later acknowledged calling stated that it was only a joke.shoben also learned that trejo contacted professor humphrey,reminded him that they were buddies,and attempted to persuade him to recant certain statements he made to shoben about the toronto incident.based on this information,as well as the fact that trejo,in response to a question,told shoben that he was unaware of any reason why the female graduate students would file false charges against him at the time,shoben came to the conclusion that trejo had engaged in a series of unprofessional actions,alienated several graduate students and faculty members within the department,and,furthermore,refused to accept responsibility for his misconduct.thereafter,shoben prepared a written summary of the results of his investigation and gave a copy to trejo and the dean of the college,jessie delia,and recommended that trejo be terminated.t he reasons for this recommendation,shoben stated in a letter to trejo,have to do with your trustworthiness,your professional judgment,and your relations with graduate students.in my judgment,your performance on all three of these dimensions has been unsatisfactory.
delia met personally with trejo and discussed his pattern of misconduct,including his behavior at the and his midnight phone call to isaacks while they were attending the conference in toronto.even though he was not obligated to,delia granted trejo an opportunity to prepare a written response to shoben recommendation,as trejo was on a probationary,status.trejo obtained legal counsel and submitted an typewritten response along with numerous materials and several letters from individuals of the belief that he should be allowed to retain his position with the university.in may,dean delia and a faculty advisory committee reviewed these materials,conducted an independent review of shoben findings,and thereafter voted against renewing trejo probationary appointment.trejo filed a notice of intent to appeal the committee decision and received several extensions in order that he might submit additional material for consideration by the university.despite receiving the extra time he requested,trejo failed to submit any additional materials,and the faculty committee met a second time in august and again recommended termination.thus,pursuant to university policy requiring that assistant professors must receive at least one year notice of,trejo was advised of the university decision in and was terminated august.
ii.discussion 
free speech claims 
initially we address trejo claim that the university violated his rights to freedom of speech when it refused to renew his annual teaching appointment.trejo argues that his discussion at the conference in toronto amongst faculty,and graduate students relating to human sexuality is protected under the first amendment to the constitution of the united states,and that it was unconstitutional for the university to terminate him on the basis of the statements he made we reject trejo argument,for we are convinced that while trejo complaint alleges that he engaged in expressive activity protected by the first amendment,the facts in this record conclusively establish that his speech was related to matters of private concern and thus can not form the basis of a constitutional challenge.see connick myers,d pickering board of,d.
the first amendment protects an individual right to freedom of expression.furthermore,because of our mistrust of laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over educational institutions,keyishian board of regents,d,the first amendment protects the right of faculty members to engage in academic debates,pursuits,and inquiries and to discuss ideas,narratives,concepts,imagery,and,political or aesthetic with an audience whom the speaker seeks to inform,edify,or entertain.swank smart,cir.however,a public employee freedom of speech on matters of public concern is far from absolute and,and the exercise of protected speech may nevertheless serve as the basis for termination if the employer articulates convincing reasons for taking such action.see waters churchill,d connick,supra pickering,supra.
in cases like the one before us,where the employer brings a motion to dismiss the employee free speech claim on the basis of the pleadings rather than on the facts in the record,the speech may be presumed to involve a matter of public concern if it touches upon any matter for which there is potentially a public interest.eberhardt,cir.the purpose of the public concern requirement is to distinguish between grievances of an entirely personal character from statements of broader interest concerning one job,rather than to fix the boundaries of the first amendment.id.indeed,we have previously explained that 
when the supreme court in its cases establishing and bounding the rights of public employees to exercise free speech limited those rights to speech on matters of public concern,they did not mean matters of transcendent importance,such as the origins of the universe or the merits of constitutional monarchy they meant matters in which the public might be interested,as distinct from wholly personal grievances and casual.

we have cautioned that it would be a rare case indeed where the pleadings as a whole would permit judgment as a matter of law in favor of the employer.gustafson jones,cir.thus,we held in eberhardt that an assistant state attorney in illinois properly alleged that he was speaking on a matter of public concern when his complaint pled that he was writing a fictional novel concerning the criminal justice system.we stated that a public employee decision to write a book of fiction dealing with the criminal justice system is presumptively protected by the first amendment and that the trial judge erred when dismissing the complaint before the defendant filed an answer setting forth what legitimate reasons,if any,it may have had for terminating the plaintiff.at.
when we apply eberhardt reasoning to the facts pled in trejo complaint,we may assume that trejo spoke on matters that warrant some level of constitutional protection and that the university could not have fired trejo for his comments unless it offered a reason for doing so.see gustafson,at.krizek board of.based on trejo pleadings in this we accept as true when deciding a motion to dismiss rather than a motion for summary are told that trejo was a assistant professor of psychology who was in attendance at an professional conference along with other graduate students and professors in his area of academic expertise that he met these individuals at a for a late night dinner and some conversation that they engaged in a spirited academic and intellectual debate precipitated by a public television broadcast dealing with research about the mating rituals of humans and primates that none of the students considered it necessary to object or express discomfort with his remarks that evening and that he was thereafter unlawfully terminated in retaliation for his speech.compl.thus,a reading of the complaint in the light most favorable to trejo reveals his claim that his civil rights were infringed upon when he was discharged by administrators who allegedly capitulated to the pressure placed on them by certain feminist graduate students who felt that his speech was too provocative,insensitive,politically incorrect to remain on the faculty at the university of illinois.
nevertheless,we affirm the trial court decision to dismiss trejo free speech claims counts ii and ix and make clear that the university would have been entitled to summary judgment prior to trial.we have the discretion to affirm the district court decision to dismiss part of a complaint if subsequent discovery in connection with a separate claim clearly reveals that the would have been entitled to summary judgment on the claim that was dismissed and the fails to identify what additional favorable facts might possibly have been revealed through additional discovery if the claim had not been dismissed.see american nurses ass state,cir see also warner,cir posner,dissenting.
the gravamen of trejo free speech claim is identical to those portions of his substantive due process claim in which he argues that the university violated his civil rights when terminating him on the basis of his comments at the in toronto as well as his vulgar behavior on numerous occasions both before,during,and after the conference,which came to light after shoben investigation was undertaken and completed.pl.br.at.after trejo availed himself of his right to ample discovery in connection with the due process claim,the district judge granted the university motion for summary judgment,finding that trejo failed to produce even a scintilla of evidence to support his theory that he was terminated due to his speech rather than his pattern of misconduct.furthermore,trejo neither in his appellate brief nor at oral argument maintained that he could have uncovered additional materials to overcome the facts set forth by the university in support of its position that he was nonreappointed because he lied about his activities,because of the totality of his behavior toward the female graduate students,and because of concerns about his trustworthiness,professionalism,and judgment.def.br.at.thus,we may properly consider whether the university is entitled to summary judgment on trejo first amendment retaliation claim based upon the record before us.see american nurses,at.
the undisputed facts in this record demonstrate that trejo comments were focused almost exclusively on matters of private concern,thus belying the allegations in his complaint and thus requiring that we grant summary judgment in favor of the university.the chair of the university psychology department,edward shoben,explained that after the completion of his review and investigation he was convinced that the totality of trejo statements and actions mandated termination,including trejo remarks to a stanford university professor that he wanted to get his hands on illinois graduate student brandy isaacks trejo decision to telephone isaacks in the middle of the night,conceal his identity,impersonate another graduate student,and ask her to play cards with him trejo initial refusal to admit that he telephoned isaacks despite the fact that witnesses were present when he placed the phone call trejo statement to a wichita state university professor that they should go to the president party and see if we can find some women to bring back to their hotel room trejo attempt to persuade graduate students to pour a beer in his mouth while he stood upside down on his head trejo sexual comment and declaration during a late night card game with two female students that we going to quit playing cards or we all going to get naked and go to bed trejo attempts to solicit dates from graduate students,including his decision to send the students an that referred to his impending divorce and challenged the students to an obligatory rematch of the previously discussed card game trejo attempt to persuade the wichita state professor to recant certain statements he made to shoben about trejo conduct and trejo statements that there is a relationship between pregnancy,adultery,and sexual pleasure.
casual between two persons or otherwise confined to a small group is not protected under the first amendment.swank,at.thus,the comments trejo made while he was attending parties,playing cards,or frequenting taverns around the as his comment that he wanted to get his hands on one graduate student and get naked or drink some good beer with casual,idle,and flirtatious that may not form the basis of a first amendment claim.see contreras city of chicago.furthermore,after review of all the facts and circumstances dealing with trejo conduct during his three years as a probationary employee at the university of illinois,we hold that trejo statements in toronto regarding the sexual behavior of primates likewise failed to address an issue of public concern under connick and pickering.the statements were simply parts of a calculated type of speech designed to further trejo private interests in attempting to solicit female companionship and,at the same time,possibly to irritate the other graduate students to whom he was speaking.the record before us makes clear that trejo was prattling on before a table of acquaintances who had been drinking alcoholic beverages in a noisy rather than lecturing to students in a classroom setting on a topic relevant to their field of study.the individuals seated at the table all agreed that trejo remarks were delivered in a flirtatious manner peppered with double entendres and ribald references,while the record is barren of any evidence besides trejo statements that the remarks were designed to serve any truly pedagogic purpose.rather,trejo left the lounge to play euchre with a group of students immediately after his speech,thus further establishing that his throughout the evening primarily served to whittle away the time and further his own peculiar interests rather than any matter of public concern.accordingly,the scales are tipped in favor of the university,and we are convinced that it is entitled to summary judgment on trejo claims.see wales board of,cir smith fruin,cir keen penson,cir swank,at rubin.at.
federal due process claims 
we are also convinced that the trial judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of the university on the claims brought by trejo under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.as we noted ante at,trejo alleges that the university violated his substantive due process rights when terminating him,in part,because of his expressive activity in toronto.although we explained in part that none of trejo statements were protected as speech about matters of public concern,trejo nonetheless argues that the university decision violated his substantive due process rights by imposing an utterly unreasonable or arbitrary restriction upon his right to speak on matters of private concern.
a restriction on a form of liberty not explicitly codified in the bill of rights or singled out by the courts for special protection under such rubrics as right to privacy and fundamental rights violates the due process clause only if it is utterly is what arbitrary means in this it is less likely to be found so if it is a regulation of public employees than if it is a regulation of private citizens.swank,at.we hold that it was proper for the university to terminate trejo because of his conduct and comments during the academic conference in toronto during october,including but not limited to the remarks to the graduate students at the in toronto,as well as his conduct before and after the conference which did not come to light until such time as the investigation was completed.
trejo conduct and statements in toronto,when viewed in conjunction with the pattern of unprofessional conduct,poor judgment,and lack of trustworthiness demonstrated throughout his term of employment,had the effect of alienating professors and graduate students on the illinois campus and at other institutions across the nation.professors at stanford and wichita state universities advised shoben that the university ability to attract talented female graduate students might suffer if trejo behavior became widely known among prospective applicants.furthermore,several of the female graduate students within the department stated that they feared
