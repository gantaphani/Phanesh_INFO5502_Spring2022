in general,challenges to governmental action under the california environmental quality act ceqa face unusually short statutes of limitation.most limitation statutes are triggered by the filing of a public notice,which reports an agency determination about the applicability of ceqa or the potential environmental impact of a project.as we explain in greater detail,an action challenging this determination must generally be brought within days after the notice is filed,subds.b,c e.
this case involves a particular kind of challenge following a notice of determination nod.if an nod has been filed,but an action alleges that no environmental review was undertaken,which statute of limitations applies the general limit on challenges following a notice,or the longer period provided for a case alleging that no environmental determination was made,subd.a we hold that the filing of an nod triggers a statute of limitations for all ceqa challenges to the decision announced in the notice.this interpretation is consistent with the language of section and the general approach of all statutes of limitation.the legislature clearly intended the statute to apply when an agency files an nod,and this limitations period may not be extended based on the nature of the ceqa violation alleged.
because the court of appeal reached a contrary conclusion,we reverse that judgment.
background 
in,the leland stanford junior university stanford applied for a community plan and general use permit permit to add buildings on its campus.an environmental impact report eir prepared for the overall project the permit eir identified potential environmental effects and proposed specific mitigation measures.the permit eir found that the development would significantly impact public access to recreational facilities.in addition to requiring improvements to area parks,a mitigation measure in the permit eir directed that stanford dedicate certain trail easements shown on the santa clara county county trails master and coordinate with the county parks department regarding the trails locations,uses,construction and management.on december,the county board of supervisors board certified the permit eir and approved the permit.the permit was expressly conditioned on satisfaction of mitigation measures discussed in the permit eir.relevant here,condition required stanford to dedicate easements for,develop,and maintain the portions of the two trail alignments which cross stanford lands shown in the santa clara countywide trails master plan routes and specifically,within one year after permit approval,stanford was required to identify trail easements and reach agreements with the county on issues of trail construction,management and maintenance 
stanford and county staff proposed an agreement in december,but the board took no action and directed the parties to explore other alternatives for alignment of the trail.in june,the board directed county staff to proceed with environmental analysis of five routes and four routes.a dispute soon arose about the location of the route,and the board directed that work be suspended on the alignment.analysis of the alignment proceeded,however,and a supplemental eir seir analyzing three potential routes was published on september.a final seir for the trail was completed and presented to the board on september.
stanford and the county explored possible alignments for the trail on both sides of san francisquito creek.an alignment on the western side would require the agreement and cooperation of san mateo county,the city of menlo park,and the town of portola valley.a trail located on the eastern side would be within santa clara county jurisdiction.however,the eastern alignment was thought to have potentially significant environmental impacts,and county staff believed regulatory approval could be difficult to obtain.on september,the board instructed county staff to pursue an agreement with stanford on the location of the alignment.
subsequent negotiations produced the trails agreement,which was presented to the board in december.the trails agreement recites that its purpose is to satisfy condition of the permit.stanford agreed to dedicate easements for the trail and portions of the trail,construct and maintain the trail,and fund improvements to the trail by providing million to san mateo county and million to the town of portola valley.the agreement also requires that stanford provide million to the town of los altos hills for improvements to the connector trail these funds were intended to pay for trail construction and for costs to comply with ceqa or to implement mitigation measures a map attached to the trails agreement shows the trail on the western side of san francisquito creek.elsewhere,however,the agreement explains that this route is only one possible alignment.the final placement of the trail would depend on further environmental analysis and stanford agreement with san mateo county and the town of portola valley.
on december,the board authorized the county to enter the trails agreement.it also made numerous ceqa findings about existing and proposed trails and certified a final seir for the trail.the board found that no ceqa review was currently required for the trail because approval of the trails agreement did not constitute county approval of construction,operation or maintenance of specific trail improvements of the trail.instead,the trails agreement contemplated that,before any trail improvements were made,detailed construction plans would be reviewed and considered by the jurisdictions of san mateo county,town of portola valley and town of los altos hills the board observed that when these jurisdictions ultimately consider detailed designs and construction plans,they will be required by ceqa to determine the type and extent of environmental review that is necessary for their actions,and the trails agreement provides funds to pay for this environmental review.accordingly,the board concluded the county was not required to conduct further ceqa review before entering into the trails agreement.the board thus implicitly determined this aspect of the agreement did not constitute a new project subject to independent ceqa review.because the agreement obligated stanford to build trail segments on its own land and to provide funding for trail construction and environmental compliance on segments outside the county,the board found that stanford had satisfied permit condition.
on december,the county filed an nod with the county clerk.the notice described only the trail alignment.it reported that an eir had been prepared for this trail project and findings had been made pursuant to section of ceqa.four days later,on december,the county filed a revised nod.the revised notice included the and trail routes in its description of the project and identified the board actions with respect to the trail alignments as part of the project description.specifically,the notice reported that the county had approved an agreement for the and alignments,but had not approved any specific trail improvements.it explained that plans for such improvements would be reviewed and considered by san mateo county and the towns of portola valley and los altos hills.the revised nod again stated that an eir had been prepared and findings made under ceqa.the revised nod was posted for days,from december,through january.
on june,days after the revised nod was filed and posted,the committee for green foothills committee filed a petition for writ of mandamus challenging the county approval of the trails agreement.the committee complained that the county had violated ceqa by approving a trail alignment located in san mateo county and portola valley without having conducted the necessary environmental review.the county demurred on the ground that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations.the court took judicial notice of both nod and sustained the demurrer,reasoning that the timely filing of the notices had triggered the statute of limitations in section,subdivisions b,c and e.although the court initially allowed the committee leave to amend,it later sustained a demurrer to the amended petition without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of the county and stanford.
the court of appeal reversed and directed the trial court to grant the committee another opportunity to amend the petition.the court of appeal concluded there was a reasonable possibility the committee could allege facts sufficient to bring its case within the statute of limitations for actions claiming that an agency approved a project without having determined its potential environmental effects,subd.a.we reverse.

ii.statute of limitations 
whenever a local agency approves or determines to carry out a project that is subject to ceqa,the agency must file an nod within five working days in the county clerk office of each county where the project will be located,subd.a.the notice must reflect the agency determination as to whether the project will have a significant effect on the environment and must state whether an eir has been prepared,subd.a,subd.a.a similar procedure is required if the agency decides to embark on a project it believes is exempt from ceqa,subd.b.if a local agency finds a project is exempt from ceqa,it must file a notice of exemption with all appropriate county clerks,subd.b.both types of notice must be available for public inspection for days,subd.c,subd.c.

which subdivision of section applies depends upon the nature of the ceqa violation alleged.in substance,subdivision a pertains to an action charging the public agency with approving or undertaking a project having a significant effect on the environment without any attempt to comply with ceqa,subdivision b pertains to an action alleging that the public agency has improperly determined that the project does not have a significant effect on the environment,subdivision c pertains to an action alleging that the eir fails to comply with the requirements of ceqa,subdivision d pertains to an action charging that the public agency has improperly determined that the project is exempt from ceqa,and subdivision e is a catchall provision governing an action based on any other failure of the public agency to comply with ceqa.ilwu,supra,d at.a subdivision a challenge alleges that an agency approved a project without determining its potential environmental impact.obviously,the time for filing a subdivision a claim is not triggered by an nod,because the allegation is that no determination was ever made.for all other claims,however,subdivisions b through e link the start of the limitations period to the filing of a notice of determination or exemption 
this case does not challenge the initial approval of a project.the county granted a permit and certified a program eir for stanford development project more than five years before the committee filed suit.the committee has instead challenged the approval of an activity that was undertaken to ameliorate an environmental impact of stanford project.the trails agreement,the target of the committee attack,sets guidelines for the future construction and maintenance of certain trails.stanford was required to construct these trails by a condition of its permit,and the condition was imposed to implement a mitigation measure identified in the permit eir.under these circumstances,the trails agreement can not be considered an independent project.rather,it is a subsequent activity encompassed within the original project.after a program eir,like the permit eir,has been prepared,subsequent activities in the program must be examined in light of the eir to determine whether additional environmental review is necessary.guidelines,subd.c.if no new environmental effects are expected,the agency can approve the activity as within the scope of the prior eir.guidelines,subd.c.in addition to the permit eir,the trails agreement was also a subsequent activity encompassed within the seir prepared for the trails master plan.this program eir evaluate d,at a broad level,the environmental effects of implementing the county policies for the planning,acquisition,design,operations,and maintenance of countywide trails and trail facilities.
because the committee suit does not challenge either of these prior eir,or the seir prepared for the trail alignment,the limitations period in section,subdivision c does not apply.nor are we concerned with subdivision d,because this case does not concern an activity claimed to be exempt from ceqa.here,the committee artfully alleges that the trails agreement constituted a project and that the county approved this project without determining its environmental effects.the committee contends these allegations bring the case within the statute of limitations of subdivision a.the county and stanford counter that the statute of either subdivision b or e applies because the county filed an nod announcing its finding that approval of the trails agreement would not have a significant effect on the environment.
whether the committee action is barred as a matter of law thus rests on a threshold legal question does the filing of an nod invariably trigger one of the statutes of limitation in section,regardless of the type of ceqa violation alleged to answer this question,we apply principles of statutory construction to determine the legislature intent in enacting section,so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citations.city of burbank state water resources control bd.cal th.we begin with the statutory language because it is generally the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.people hudson cal th.shirk vista unified school dist.cal th.we consider extrinsic aids,such as legislative history,only if the statutory language is reasonably subject to multiple interpretations.people king cal th.miklosy regents of university of california cal th.
statutory language 
the language of section strongly suggests that the legislature intended the filing of an nod to trigger a statute of limitations.with the exception of subdivision a,each of the limitation periods in section is triggered by the filing of a notice of determination or exemption and continues for only or days,subds.b e.in contrast,the limitations period in subdivision a starts when a project is approved or begun,and it continues for days,subd.a.because subdivision a applies to suits alleging that an agency has approved or undertaken a project without having determined whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a,italics added,it would not have made sense to measure the limitations period from the filing of an nod.if an agency has made no determination about the environmental impact of a project,it has no determination to announce.as we have explained in the past,subdivision a reflects the legislature determin ation that the initiation of the project provides constructive notice of a possible failure to comply with ceqa.such a notice is a substitute for the public notification measures set forth in section.concerned citizens of costa mesa,dist.agricultural,supra,cal d at see also oceanside marina towers oceanside community development com.d.
but what do we make of a situation in which an agency decides no environmental review of a certain activity is required,approves the activity without conducting review,but also announces its conclusion in an nod this is essentially what happened here.the county approved the trails agreement after deciding that no environmental review was presently required,and it disclosed these findings to the public in an nod.as noted,the trails agreement was not a project but a subsequent activity encompassed within the permit eir and the trails master plan seir.because environmental review was previously undertaken in these program eir,further review is generally not required except in limited circumstances.guidelines.this situation is not particularly unusual.agencies may determine that supplemental environmental review is not required for a subsequent activity,and ceqa requires them to publicly notice these determinations.see,subd.a,subd.a.
section does not specifically define the limitations period that applies to this factual scenario.however,a related subdivision,not on point here,sheds light on the importance the legislature has given to the filing of a public notice in determining the applicable limitations period.section,subdivision d addresses the analogous situation that arises when an agency conducts no environmental review because it believes a project is statutorily exempt from ceqa if the agency files a notice of exemption alerting the public to its conclusion,subd.b,subd.b,any action or proceeding challenging this decision must be brought within days after the notice was filed,subd.d.but if the agency simply proceeds with a project it believes to be exempt and does not file the required notice,subdivision d permits a legal challenge to be brought up to days after the agency decision or commencement of the project,subd.d.
this difference indicates that the determinative question,for purposes of defining the statute of limitations,is not what type of violation the plaintiff has alleged,but whether the action complained of was disclosed in a public notice.when an agency gives the public notice of its decision that a project is exempt from ceqa,just like a notice of any other determination under ceqa,the public can be expected to act promptly in challenging this decision.however,when an agency does not give the statutorily required notice,and the public is held to constructive notice based on the start of the project,the legislature has determined that a longer limitations period should apply.
the principle illustrated in subdivision d is evident in all the other limitation periods set forth in section.if a state or local agency has filed an nod stating whether a project will have a significant environmental impact see,subd.a,subd.a,the statute of limitations for all types of ceqa claims related to the project is days from the date the notice was filed.the statute applies to claims challenging an agency determination about environmental impact,subd.b,claims challenging the adequacy of an eir,subd.c,and all other claims alleging ceqa violations,subd.e.if a state or local agency has made no environmental impact determination,the statute of limitations is days,measured from the date of the agency approval or the start of the project,subd.a.in such cases,project approval or initiation is deemed constructive notice for potential ceqa claims.
accordingly,the plain language of section makes the filing of a notice of determination of paramount importance for determining which statute of limitations applies to a ceqa claim.if a valid nod has been filed,subd.a,subd.a,any challenge to that decision under ceqa must be brought within days,regardless of the nature of the alleged violation.the statutory language does not authorize an extension of this period if the suit alleges that,despite the filing of an nod,the project was approved without a prior environmental assessment.
b.other evidence of legislative intent 
to the extent the language of section is ambiguous,we may consult extrinsic aids to determine the legislature intent.miklosy regents of university of california,supra,cal th at.here,both the regulatory guidelines implementing and relevant legislative history suggest that the legislature meant to impose a shorter statute of limitations for all types of ceqa claims following a notice of determination or exemption.
section,subdivision c of the guidelines summarizes the limitation periods for ceqa challenges as follows where the public agency filed a notice of determination in compliance with sections or,days after the filing of the notice and the posting on a list of such notices.where the public agency filed a notice of exemption in compliance with section,days after the filing of the notice and the posting on a list of such notices.where none of the other statute of limitations periods in this section apply,days after either a the public agency decision to carry out or approve the project,or b commencement of the project if the project is undertaken without a formal decision by the public agency.thus,the guidelines explain that the applicable statute of limitations depends in the first instance on whether a public notice was filed.if a notice of determination or exemption was properly filed,a or statute applies.this period is extended to days only in cases where no public notice was given.see also remy et,guide to the cal.environmental quality act ceqa ed in cases where agencies are proceeding with no ceqa compliance whatsoever and have failed to file a notice of exemption,aggrieved persons have days to file a legal challenge,italics added.sections of the guidelines describing the requirements for an nod also state that the filing of such a notice invariably start s a statute of limitations on court challenges to the approval of a project under ceqa.guidelines,subd.g,subd.g.
legislative history,although shedding little light on the question before us,contains some support for the guidelines interpretation.section was added to the public resources code in,as part of a bill that also added the notice of determination provisions of sections and.stats,ch.as first enacted,section defined only the three limitation periods set forth in subdivisions a through c.stats,ch.less than two years later,the legislature amended section to add subdivisions d and e.stats,ch.assembly bill reg.sess,which made these changes,was passed as an urgency measure to clarify the limitation periods for ceqa claims.stats,ch,at.
two enrolled bill reports concerning assembly bill reg.sess.are of interest here a department of water resources report noted that,in addition to creating a new statute of limitations for challenges to exemption determinations,the bill also retained the statute of limitations for claims that challenge an agency determination of environmental impacts or challenge the adequacy of an eir.thus,the report concluded,essentially any determinations made by public agencies under the environmental quality act will be subject to a or day challenge limitation,provided a notice of determination has been filed.if no notice is filed or utilized,a period of limitation applies.water resources,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.a similar conclusion was drawn in an enrolled bill report prepared by the governor office of planning and research,which has special expertise in interpreting the ceqa statutes.see,directing the office of planning and research to develop the guidelines.this report noted that,in addition to providing a statute of limitations for exemption determinations,assembly bill r equires that any action alleging that any act or omission of a public agency does not comply with the provisions of ceqa must be commenced within days after the required filing of notice.governor off.of planning research,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.
in enacting and amending section,the legislature clearly sought to place strict limits on the time during which projects may be challenged under ceqa.to this end,it mandated that ceqa suits be brought within days after an nod is filed,subds.b,c e.the committee has directed us to nothing in the legislative history that suggests the legislature intended to extend this period sixfold whenever,despite the notice,the plaintiff alleges no true environmental determination was made.
the interpretation we reach is also consistent with a key policy served by these statutes the prompt resolution of challenges to the decisions of public agencies regarding land use.citation.citizens for a alameda city of alameda th,alameda.ceqa contains a number of provisions evidencing the clear legislative determination that the public interest is not served unless challenges under ceqa are filed promptly oceanside marina towers oceanside community development com,supra,d at board of supervisors superior court th.in addition to the short statutes of limitation in section,other statutes impose expedited schedules for briefing and preparation of the administrative record,and require that ceqa cases be given preferential hearing in the trial and appellate courts.patently,there is legislative concern that ceqa challenges,with their obvious potential for financial prejudice and disruption,must not be permitted to drag on to the potential serious injury of the real party in interest.board of supervisors superior court,at.
a rule that the filing of an nod triggers a statute of limitations promotes certainty,allowing local governments and developers to proceed with projects without the threat of potential future litigation.after expiration of the period in,subd.c,an eir is conclusively presumed to be valid laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th,this presumption acts to preclude reopening of the ceqa process even if the initial eir is discovered to have been fundamentally inaccurate and misleading in the description of a significant effect or the severity of its consequences.if the limitation periods triggered by the filing of an nod could be defeated by a mere allegation that the parties proceeded without having made a sufficient determination about potential environmental impacts,the certainty normally afforded by the filing of an nod would be lost.developers would have to wait a full days before embarking on a project to avoid potential interruption by litigation.such delay and uncertainty are precisely what the legislature sought to avoid when it enacted the unusually short limitation periods in section.see san franciscans for reasonable growth city and county of san francisco d,obviously,the rationale of the statutory scheme is to avoid delay and achieve prompt resolution of ceqa claims.
iii.application to the present case 
statute of limitations applies 
because the county filed an nod concerning its approval of the trails agreement,any ceqa challenge to this approval had to be brought within days.the committee argument that a longer limitations period should apply because the county allegedly approved the agreement without conducting any environmental review turns the system of section on its head.
a similar argument was rejected decades ago in california manufacturers industrial welfare com.d.there,an association argued that the statutes of limitation in section,subdivisions b and e apply only if the agency has undertaken an environmental investigation and filed a valid notice of determination and negative declaration.california manufacturers,at.the court of appeal disagreed,noting this assertion flies in the face of the clear language of the statutes which provide that they apply in b,where it is alleged that the agency has improperly determined whether there will be a significant impact and in e,where it is alleged that agency action or omission does not comply with statutory requirements.california manufacturers,at.we agree with this analysis.for purposes of the ceqa statutes of limitation,the question is not the substance of the agency decision,but whether the public was notified of that decision.
thus,the committee can not avail itself of the statute of limitations in section,subdivision a.subdivision a addresses claims that an agency has ignored ceqa and made no attempt to satisfy its requirements.when an nod has been filed,the agency has at a minimum acknowledged ceqa and attempted compliance.in these situations,the legislature has limited the time for filing suit to days.
precisely which statute in section applies in this case is somewhat harder to discern.subdivision b addresses claims that an agency has made an improper determination about the environmental impact of a project.because the committee takes issue with the county determination that approval of the trails agreement would have no significant effect on the environment,this claim can be understood as a challenge to an improper determination about potential impacts of the agreement.but this case does not fit neatly within subdivision b.subdivision b typically governs challenges to the initial approval of a project,when a negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration has been filed.the trails agreement was not a ceqa project being considered for initial approval.it was a s ubsequent activit y to stanford broader development project and the county trails master plan.guidelines,subd.c.each of these larger projects had been previously evaluated in a program eir.
if subdivision b does not apply here,however,the appropriate limitations period is still days under the catchall provision of subdivision e.in addition to the ceqa claims addressed elsewhere in the statute,section,subdivision e states that ceqa challenges to any other act or omission by a public agency must be filed within days after an nod is filed,subd.e.because the committee brought this challenge more than days after the county disclosed its approval of the trails agreement in an nod,the action is clearly under section,subdivision e.
notice of determination was not defective 
the committee also argues the county nod did not trigger a statute of limitations because the notice was invalid.
several cases have made an exception to the strict limitation periods in section when the notice of determination is materially defective.the ceqa guidelines describe the contents and filing procedures required for an nod filed in connection with a negative declaration guidelines,or eir.among other things,the nod must identify and briefly describe the project identify the lead agency and responsible agency if applicable state the date of project approval and the agency environmental impact determination report that a negative declaration,mitigated negative declaration or eir has been adopted,and give the address where it may be examined and state whether mitigation measures were required as a condition of approval.id,subd.b,subd.b.the guidelines contain a similar list for notices of exemption,subd.a.
in ilwu,supra,d,the court refused to hold plaintiffs to the statute of limitations in section,subdivision d because the notice of exemption filed for the project was not in substantial compliance with the notice requirements in the guidelines.there,t he project description was the only required item of information contained in the notice and even that was of debatable adequacy.ilwu,at.most notably,the notice did not state that the project had been found to be exempt or explain the reasons for this finding.ibid.because of these substantial deficiencies,the court concluded the notice was not adequate to trigger the short limitations period in section,subdivision d.ilwu,at see also county of amador el dorado county water agency th,notice of exemption was not valid,and did not trigger limitati
