background 
moore is an woman who has been employed by the school district as a teacher for over years.in total,she has more than years of experience as a school teacher.in the past,moore has been recognized as a strong teacher,and she consistently received exemplary ratings in her performance reviews.
for over years,moore has applied for various administrative positions,but her advancement efforts have been unsuccessful.moore first attempt to obtain a promotion was in when she applied for an assistant principal position.moore was not granted an interview.she is not sure which candidate was selected for the job,but she contends that the recipient was a white applicant.
moore applied for another assistant principal position in june,but again she did not get the job.this job went to tammy mills,a white female applicant.at the time,moore had years of teaching experience,and mills only had years.also,moore had her master degree for years and her principal certification for years,while mills obtained both her master degree and her principal certification a few months before her appointment.after this,moore filed a discrimination claim with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the outcome of moore eeoc grievance is not clear from the record.
in march,moore submitted a third application for an assistant principal position,but the school district did not consider her for the position because her application was submitted after the deadline.the job ultimately went to another white female candidate,connie reed.moore contends her untimely application did not matter because reed would have still received the position.she notes that the school district had already hired reed husband as the head football coach when it posted the position.she filed another discrimination charge with the eeoc.the eeoc dismissed the charge and issued a right to sue letter in august.
also in august,another administrative vacancy was filled but moore did not apply for the testified that she was not notified of the opening.the school district denied that jamie rougeau,the individual who filled the position,was promoted to an assistant principal position and contends that rougeau was actually promoted to a newly created position of lead teacher.further,the school district stated that it created the position to preserve rougeau employment with the school district as there was a surplus of science teachers for the school year.in the next school year,rougeau was promoted to dean of students.moore did not apply for the dean of students position because it had lower pay and prestige than an assistant principal position.moore filed another grievance with the eeoc this charge too was dismissed,and moore received a right to sue letter on may.
in august,moore applied for a position as an assistant elementary school principal but was not granted an fact,the position was not filled during this interview period.alice barnes testified that the position remained vacant because all of the applicants were employees of the school district and the school district would have had trouble filling the vacancies that would have resulted if any of the applicants received the job.specifically,barnes stated that moore did receive the job because if she had been hired,there would be no one to teach moore elementary school class.
in november,the school district reopened its search to fill the elementary school assistant principal position that was left vacant in august.moore again submitted an application,and this time,she was granted an interview.moore again was denied the job because the school district chose not to fill the position.the school district explained that it did not fill the position because after reevaluating student enrollment,the school district determined that the position was no longer necessary.the school district explained that the number of building administrators is directly correlated to the number of enrolled students,and a campus with fewer than students is only required to have one administrator.the school district presented evidence that the elementary school underwent a realignment,and after this was completed,the school had fewer than students,making a second administrative position unnecessary.
moore sued the school district and its superintendent in november,asserting that the defendants discriminated against her on the basis of race and retaliated against her for pursuing her rights with the eeoc,in violation of title vii,and.moore alleged that the school district decision not to promote her in march and november was racially motivated.moore alleged that the school district characterization of the august position as a lead teacher position was pretextual.moore claimed that the school district failure to notify her of the administrative job opening was retaliation for her eeoc complaint filed earlier in the year.
after a bench trial,the district court found in favor of the defendants.in regard to the march position,the district court determined that moore failed to present evidence of discrimination and concluded that reed was hired because her husband was selected as the football coach.the district court further found that the august position was a lead teacher position and not an assistant principal position.with regard to moore retaliation claim,the district court held that the passage of time between the march position and the eeoc claim was too long for moore to demonstrate a discriminatory motive.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,moore argues that the district court finding of no discrimination was clearly erroneous.she contends that the district court erred in finding that moore failed to show discrimination in the march assistant principal selection process show discrimination in the august position hiring process and establish a prima facie case of retaliation.
on appeal after trial,we are less concerned with the intricacies of the mcdonnell douglas scheme,and more concerned with whether sufficient evidence supports the judgment of the district court.sherman runyon.cir.once a finding of discrimination has been made and that judgment is being considered on appeal,the mcdonnell douglas presumptions fade away,and the appellate court should simply study the record with a view to determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support whatever finding was made at trial.id.quoting morgan arkansas gazette,cir.moreover,t his court reviews the district court ultimate finding of discrimination for clear error,giving due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.ledbetter alltel corporate,cir.
moore discrimination claims 
the district court,in applying the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting framework for covert discrimination,ruled in favor of the school district.moore argues that the district court erred in finding for the school district on her discrimination claims.moore alleged that the school district discriminated against her in failing to promote her in march and august.
to prove a prima facie claim of discrimination,moore must show that she is a member of a protected group she was qualified and applied for an available position she was rejected for that position and employees similarly situated who are not part of the protected group were promoted instead.see gordon shafer contracting,cir laying out the elements in reference to a title vii claim wright rolette county,cir stating,in reference to sexual harassment claims,that the elements of a prima facie case are the same regardless of whether a plaintiff sues under o
