jurisdiction 
jurisdiction was proper in the district court based upon,and.jurisdiction on appeal is proper based upon.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
background 
elwood employed michael kluck as a teacher and coach in.kluck taught,and grade english,and grade study skills,and sponsored a journalism group.in november,the gosper county sheriff department investigated a sexual assault complaint that kluck had allegedly touched his female students inappropriately while at school.the school administration was aware of this investigation.based upon student interviews,the deputy determined that kluck had made inappropriate remarks to students but found no evidence of physical contact.
in october,richard einspahr,the school principal,complaints about kluck from students.based on these statements,einspahr sent kluck a written reprimand on october,which detailed the complaints about kluck inappropriate comments and touching.the letter also expressed concern about kluck having spent time alone with several junior high boys.the reprimand warned kluck that einspahr would continue to investigate the charges and allegations against him,and was prepared to take further action.kluck issued a written reply that attempted to explain some of the allegations.
in december and march,kluck received poor evaluations of his work.on march,after consulting with elwood attorney,einspahr sent kluck a letter informing kluck that he intended to recommend that the elwood board of education not renew kluck contract for the following year.in a subsequent meeting,kluck asserted that the letter violated his due process rights because he was not given adequate notice to request a termination hearing before the school board.on march,superintendent david wade sent kluck a second letter that included all of the information required to satisfy kluck due process concerns,and kluck requested a termination hearing before the elwood board of education.after discovering that the school district legal fees for the hearing would cost between and,elwood entered into a confidential settlement agreement with kluck 
the settlement stipulated that kluck could voluntarily resign,wade would write him a positive letter of recommendation,all future references to kluck would be consistent with the letter of recommendation,kluck resignation would be categorized as with good cause for purposes of unemployment compensation,kluck would be allowed to remove any documentation from his employment file other than what the school district relied upon when hiring him,and the terms of the settlement would remain confidential to the extent allowed by law.wade distributed a memorandum to each school board member describing these conditions and recommending that they agree to them.after the school board agreed,wade signed the settlement agreement on march,
after leaving elwood,nebraska,kluck applied for a teaching position for the following school year in la porte,texas,where he submitted the letter of recommendation from elwood.the letter stated in full 
kluck has assisted elwood public schools in a variety of activities and has been willing to help out in emergency situations.he has a good knowledge of his subject area and his coaching area.he has participated in numerous clinics.
kluck used a variety of teaching aids and made use of library resources.outwardly he showed an interest in his students and the varied activities of the school.he arrived at school on time and was aware of and followed school channels and procedures phone calls,bills,and invoices were handled properly.
kluck was responsible for senior,junior,and freshman english,junior high study skills,journalism and year book sponsor.in addition he was head boys basketball and golf coach.
during the interview process,the la porte school superintendent called wade twice to ask about kluck teaching record at elwood,but never actually spoke with wade.the la porte school district hired kluck as a coach and teacher at la porte junior high for the school year.the la porte school district claims that it would not have hired kluck if it had known about his prior misconduct in elwood.
in november,kluck sexually molested shrum son,kelly,one of kluck junior high students in la porte,texas.on september,kluck pled guilty in texas to the crime of indecency with a child.shrum,on behalf of her son,filed suit against elwood and wade in federal district court,alleging and pendent state law claims.elwood moved for summary judgment,which the district court denied due to outstanding disputes of material fact on the claim.shrum amended her complaint to add a title ix claim,arguing that elwood control over kluck future teaching opportunities made it liable for kluck subsequent molestation of her son.elwood again moved for summary judgment.on its own motion,the district court asked for briefs on whether to apply the shocks the conscience standard to the claim.shrum,ex rel.kelly kluck,citing county of sacramento lewis,d lewis memorandum and order.after additional briefing,the district court applied the shocks the conscience standard to the claim,renewed consideration of and granted elwood first motion for summary judgment on the claim,and also granted elwood second motion for summary judgment on the title ix claim.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c ingram johnson,cir.like the district court,we view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.however,the nonmoving party must substantiate its allegations with evidence that is sufficiently probative to avoid summary judgment as a matter of law.moody charles county,cir.if the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to her case,then all other facts will be considered immaterial and the moving party will be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.
shrum contends that the district court erred in dismissing her claim on summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether elwood should be held liable for damages under as a result of elwood maintenance of a policy or custom which exhibited deliberate indifference to her son constitutional right to bodily integrity,and which proximately caused her son injuries,and elwood creation of the danger which resulted in her son molestation and its subsequent duty to protect him from that danger.we disagree.for shrum to defeat summary judgment,she must adequately prove the essential elements of liability violation of a constitutional right,committed by a state actor,who acted with the requisite culpability and causation to violate the constitutional right.board of county commissioners of bryan county,oklahoma brown,d brown.we agree with the district court that shrum failed to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact on these elements.
in order to incur liability,there must first be a violation of the plaintiff constitutional rights.roach city of fredericktown,cir see also doe wright,cir quoting martinez california,d noting that the first inquiry in a claim is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.shrum argues that her son was deprived of a liberty interest,his freedom of bodily integrity,under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.it is that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the liberty interest of a child in public school from sexual abuse.see rogers city of little rock,cir citing doe taylor,cir.we agree with the district court that shrum satisfactorily presented this essential element of liability.
however,shrum must also show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.west atkins,d.shrum asserts that elwood,as a state actor,was responsible for her son constitutional deprivation because elwood enabled kluck to continue his teaching career at another school despite his sexual misconduct with students during his employment at elwood.a school district may be accountable for the unconstitutional acts of its employees if a constitutional deprivation results from either implementation or execution of an unconstitutional policy or custom by school officials or employees,see johnson outboard marine,cir,or in the event of a substantive due process violation,an executive action by a school official.see lewis,d.
as a result,shrum may be able to satisfy this essential element of her claim,but only if she can also show that elwood acted with the requisite degree of culpability and that there was a direct causal link between the school district action and the deprivation of federal rights.brown,at.we require that where a plaintiff claims that the school district has not directly inflicted an injury,but nonetheless has caused an employee to do so,rigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied to ensure that the school district is not held liable solely for the actions of its employees.id.at.the purpose of such a stringent standard is to prevent liability from collapsing into state tort law or into respondeat superior liability,an intent not contemplated by.see city of canton harris,d a municipality can be found liable under only where the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation at issue.respondeat superior or vicarious liability will not attach under.pembaur city of cincinnati,d pembaur interpreting congress intent to limit liability to situations that municipalities could control,without obligating municipalities to control the conduct of others.
liability resulting from a policy or custom 
shrum claims that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether elwood possessed the requisite culpability,and caused the constitutional violation directly enough to incur liability.shrum accuses elwood of maintaining a policy or custom which deprived her son of his constitutional right to bodily integrity.she defines that infringing policy or custom as elwood official decision to terminate kluck and enter into a confidential settlement agreement with him,even though kluck should have been terminated for his sexually inappropriate behavior with students.because shrum claim against elwood depends upon her son liberty interest in his bodily substantive due process district court correctly applied the culpability standard for a substantive due process claim as mandated by lewis.
in lewis,at,the supreme court distinguished the different criteria used to establish liability,depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue.it is clear in the present case that elwood liability depends on one specific action undertaken by the elwood administration,which constitutes an executive action.when the substantive due process violation occurs as a result of abusive executive action,we recognize a remedy under only when the behavior at issue shocks the conscience.id.the purpose of this high fault standard is to distinguish the liability from traditional tort law claims.see id.at.we have made it clear that the due process guarantee does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing liability whenever someone cloaked with state authority causes harm rogers city of little rock,at observing that the shocks the conscience test is the appropriate test to apply to substantive due process claims because it serves to distinguish abusive executive acts amounting to constitutional violations from breaches of common law duties covered by tort law.
however,in some circumstances,official policy that is deliberately indifferent to unconstitutional conduct may satisfy the shocks the conscience standard required by lewis.at.w e have also employed deliberate indifference as a standard of culpability sufficient to identify a dereliction as reflective of municipal policy and to sustain a claim of municipal liability for harm by unconstitutional conduct for which an employee would be individually liable citing city of canton harris,at.we therefore must consider whether elwood official decision to enter into the confidential settlement agreement with kluck is a policy that is so deliberately indifferent to a predictable constitutional violation that it shocks the conscience.
we have defined policy as an official policy,a deliberate choice or a guiding principle or procedure made by an official with authority,and custom as a persistent,widespread pattern of unconstitutional conduct of which officials have notice and subsequently react with deliberate indifference or tacit authorization.johnson outboard marine,at see mettler whitledge,cir mettler.while a single incident normally does not suffice to prove the existence of a school district custom,mettler,at,a school district liability may be imposed for a single decision by school policymakers under appropriate circumstances,pembaur,at,because even a single decision by such a body unquestionably constitutes an act of official government policy.id.
if elwood instituted a policy or custom which deprived kelly of his constitutional right,then shrum must illustrate that the school district action was taken with deliberate indifference as to its known or obvious consequences.brown,at.in addition,shrum must show a direct causal link,indicating that the policy or custom is the moving force behind the constitutional violation,mettler,at citing monell dep t of social,d.because we apply a stringent standard of fault,elwood action must have been highly likely to inflict the particular injury suffered by kelly.brown,at.the culpability standard and the causation standard are intertwined,because t he high degree of predictability may also support an inference of the school district indifference led directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.id.
in the present case,elwood into a confidential settlement agreement with kluck rather than terminating him outright,and providing him with a neutral letter of not rise to the level of deliberate indifference.first,it is undisputed that elwood did not have any actual knowledge of the extent of kluck misconduct it was aware of rumors,investigations,and student statements,but did not possess any conclusive proof that kluck actually molested students while employed at elwood.furthermore,we do not find any genuine issue of material fact regarding whether,at the time of the settlement agreement,elwood knew that another school district would subsequently hire kluck or that he would molest a student there.we agree with the district court that kluck subsequent sexual misconduct was not so obvious a consequence as to impute liability to elwood for its deliberate indifference to that consequence.
we also disagree with shrum that the generally positive letter of recommendation demonstrates recklessness.on the contrary,we agree with the district court that the letter of recommendation does not raise an issue of material fact because it was neutral in tone,and a reasonable person reading that letter might read between the lines and realize that it did not unreservedly endorse kluck as a teacher.in any event,as a matter of law,the letter o
