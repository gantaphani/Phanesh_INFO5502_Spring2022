plaintiff and appellant appeals a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining without leave of a demurrer interposed by defendant and respondent arcadia unified school district the district to first amended complaint.
the government claims statutes,et require that before suing a public entity,the plaintiff must present a claim to the public entity no later than six months after the cause of action accrues.the essential issue presented is whether properly pled she filed a timely claim with the district prior to filing suit.

the district knew sutliff had used to communicate with female students in the past and had warned him not to continue said conduct.parents of at least one other female student had complained to the school regarding excessive and late night communications between sutliff and their daughter.although sutliff had been warned by school authorities to cease such communication,there had been no monitoring of his activities.
at no time during her minority did disclose her relationship with sutliff to her parents.

the government claims statutes do not contain a unique definition of accrual.rather,accrual of the cause of action for purposes of the claims statute is the date of accrual that would pertain under the statute of limitations applicable to a dispute between private litigants.shirk,supra,at,d.
timely claim presentation is not merely a procedural requirement,but rather,a condition precedent to plaintiff maintaining an action against defendant,and thus,an element of the plaintiff cause of action.shirk,supra,cal th at,d.a complaint which fails to allege facts demonstrating either that a claim was timely presented or that compliance with the claims statute is excused,is subject to a general demurrer for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.ibid.

determining the date of accrual.
the date of accrual of a cause of action marks the starting point for calculating the claims presentation period,mosesian county of fresno d.the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises.citation.in other words,it sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements citations the elements being generically referred to by sets of terms such as wrongdoing or wrongful conduct,cause or causation,and harm or injury citations.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,see also mosesian county of fresno,supra,at,a cause of action normally accrues when under the substantive law the wrongful act is done and the liability or obligation arises,that is,when action may be brought.a cause of action accrues for purposes of the filing requirements of the tort claims act on the same date a similar action against a nonpublic entity would be deemed to accrue for purposes of applying the relevant statute of limitations.john,supra,cal d at,fn,accord santee santa clara county office of education d,supra,th at,d.
a civil cause of action for child molestation generally accrues at the time of the molestation.doe bakersfield city school dist.th,fn,d accord christopher mojave unified school dist.th,d.where the molestation is continuous,accrual is measured from the date of the last molestation.ortega pajaro valley unified school dist.th,d,supra,th at,d.
here,the year period of sexual abuse ended in june,upon graduation.did not present a claim to the district until september.the question presented is whether has alleged sufficiently either equitable estoppel to bar the district from asserting her noncompliance with the claims statute,or a delayed discovery of the cause of action which postponed the accrual date until she learned in therapy that she had been victimized by sutliff.
equitable estoppel.
general principles.
it is well settled that a public entity may be estopped from asserting the limitations of the claims statute where its agents or employees have prevented or deterred the filing of a timely claim by some affirmative act.john,supra,cal d at,accord christopher,supra,th at,d,supra,th at,d.estoppel as a bar to a public entity assertion of the defense of noncompliance arises when the plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence the public entity was apprised of the facts,it intended its conduct to be acted upon,plaintiff was ignorant of the true state of facts,and relied upon the conduct to his detriment.christopher,supra,at,d.
estoppel most commonly results from misleading statements about the need for or advisability of a claim john,supra,cal d at.estoppel may also be established by acts of intimidation or violence that are intended to prevent the filing of a claim.john,supra,at.in john,for example,the court found that the doctrine of equitable estoppel could be applied when a student failed to tell his parents about a teacher sexual abuse because the teacher threatened to retaliate if he disclosed the incidents.id.at,see also doe bakersfield city school,supra,th at,d undisputed evidence of teacher threats and the plaintiff fear,even into adulthood,supported application of the equitable estoppel doctrine ortega pajaro valley unified school,supra,th at,d teacher continuous verbal threats and intimidating conduct,including driving by student new school and filing a defamation action against her for reporting abuse to school officials,supported application of the equitable estoppel doctrine christopher,supra,at,d a directive by an authority figure to a child not to tell anyone of the molestation is a sufficient inducement of delay to invoke an estoppel,supra,th at,d.
failed to allege facts supporting the application of equitable estoppel against the district.
has not alleged any acts of violence or intimidation by sutliff that were intended to deter her from presenting a tort claim to the district.john,supra,cal d at.nor has alleged sutliff made any misleading statements about the need for,or advisability of,a claim.ibid.in the absence of such allegations,has failed to plead a basis to estop the district from asserting her noncompliance with the claims statutes.
here,theory is she felt dependency,loyalty,affection and friendship toward sutliff,such that she did not even know she had been molested and victimized.theory implicates the doctrine of delayed discovery,rather than equitable estoppel.
the delayed discovery doctrine.
general principles.
generally,a cause of action accrues when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.the delayed discovery doctrine modifies that rule and protects a plaintiff by postponing accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.ibid.for purposes of that doctrine,the plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis,as opposed to a legal theory,for its elements,even if he lacks knowledge,simply put,he at least suspects that someone has done something wrong to him citation,wrong being used,not in any technical sense,but rather in accordance with its lay understanding citation.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
b.the delayed discovery doctrine,as applied to victims of childhood sexual abuse.
courts equitably may apply the delayed discovery doctrine to a cause of action arising out of childhood sexual abuse.curtis,supra,th at,d,supra,th at,d.in curtis,the minor plaintiff brought a tort action against a county alleging he had been molested while in foster care for several years,between march and februar
