the santa clara unified school district the district placed teacher susan martin on compulsory leave on april,after she was arrested on april,on charges of cultivation of marijuana and possession of methamphetamine.on january,she was eventually referred to a diversion program and the charges against her were dismissed on august,after she successfully completed diversion.education code section,subdivision c provides that if an employee who has been placed on compulsory leave due to a certain type of arrest is acquitted of the offense,or the charges against him or her are dismissed the district must pay the employee full compensation for the time spent on compulsory leave upon the employee return to work.on facts indistinguishable from those before us,the court in unzueta ocean view school dist.th,d unzueta,found that a dismissal following completion of diversion is a dismissal within the meaning of section,subdivision c,and therefore held that the reinstated teacher was entitled to back pay for the entire period of the compulsory leave of absence.although there was a strong dissent in unzueta,the majority found no compelling reason to disregard the plain meaning of the word dismissed in the statute.however,the court expressly invited the legislature to amend section,subdivision c,to except diversion dismissals,if that reflected its intent.ten years have passed,and the legislature has not amended this statutory provision.
pursuant to section,subdivision c,and in accordance with the unzueta case,the trial court in our case granted martin petition for a writ of mandate and ordered the district to compensate her approximately in back pay for the time she was on compulsory leave,less an offset of for money actually earned during that time.the district appeals,raising the following contentions section,subdivision c,was not intended to apply to diversion dismissals section,subdivision c,as applied in these circumstances,is unconstitutional cal,art.xvi,martin failed to use due diligence to mitigate damages during the period of her compulsory leave and martin unreasonably delayed in bringing this action.
the legislature has not responded to the court invitation in unzueta to amend section,subdivision c,to exclude diversion dismissals,and as an intermediate court of appeal our role in reviewing this matter is limited.we may not act as a in order to reach a result we think best.unzueta,supra,th at,d.therefore,consistent with unzueta,we conclude that the diversion dismissal in this case falls within section,subdivision c.on the district remaining claims,we find that the application of the reimbursement provision of this statute to the diversion dismissal here is not an unconstitutional gift of public funds,and we further find that martin did not unreasonably delay in filing her action.however,on the issue of mitigation,we find that martin had a duty to mitigate damages by exercising reasonable diligence in seeking comparable employment during the period of her suspension when comparable employment was available.the record in this case does not support a finding that she made any effort to seek comparable employment.the district is therefore entitled to a reduction of damages in an amount representing what martin could have earned in comparable employment.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings to recalculate the amount of mitigated damages.
background 
on april,science teacher susan martin was taken into custody pursuant to an arrest warrant charging her with felony violations of health and safety code sections marijuana cultivation and,subdivision a possession of methamphetamine.the investigation report indicates the presence of a fairly sophisticated marijuana cultivation and cloning operation located in the upstairs bedroom closets of the martin home.in addition,a small amount of methamphetamine was found in the martins bedroom closet on the ground floor.following the arrest,the arresting officer notified the superintendent of the district.
section,subdivision b,lists various offenses involving controlled substances as optional leave of absence offense s.subdivision e of section provides that when a certificated employee of a school district is charged with an optional leave of absence offense,the district may immediately place the employee upon compulsory leave.pursuant to this section,on april,the district placed martin on an unpaid leave of absence for the duration of the criminal proceedings.
the california commission on teacher credentialing commission initially suspended martin teaching credential,effective may.however,upon reviewing this action,the commission determined that the charges against martin were optional leave of absence offense s under section,subdivision b,rather than mandatory leave of absence offense s under subdivision a of the statute.a mandatory leave of absence offense would result in an automatic suspension of the teaching credential,subd.d,whereas an optional leave of absence did not.the commission therefore ordered martin teaching credential reinstated retroactive to may.
the prosecution of martin case was delayed for several years.eventually,on january,she was referred to a drug diversion program under former penal code sections.the applicable version of the diversion statute did not require that defendant enter a guilty plea martin completed the diversion program in august of,and the charges against her were dismissed pursuant to former penal code section by an order of the court filed august.the commission informed martin on december,that due to her successful completion of the diversion program,it determined no further review of her file was necessary.
on december,martin made demand on the district to reinstate her to her former employment status and to recompense her for all back pay and benefits accrued during her unpaid leave of absence,pursuant to section.subdivision c of that section provides that if the employee is acquitted of the offense,or the charges against him or her are dismissed,the school district shall pay to the employee his or her full compensation for the period of the compulsory leave of absence upon his or her return to service in the school district.
the district rejected martin request and on august,she filed her petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to compel the district to comply with section,subdivision c.the district answered and at the same time filed a demurrer.the demurrer was overruled on september.the court found the district had failed to show cause why martin should not be immediately reinstated to her position as a teacher in the santa clara county unified school district,and the court therefore granted her petition for a writ of mandate as to the issue of her reinstatement.the court continued the matter for days on the issue of back pay so that the parties could submit evidence of the amount of back pay owed and the amount of offset for other income earned by martin during her statutory leave of absence.
the district brought a motion to reduce back pay for failure to mitigate,and the parties submitted further briefing and evidence.the district calculated what martin would have earned from the date of her arrest,april,to the date of the scheduled hearing,february.this amount was.there was evidence that martin had earned approximately during this time,including received for selling her art work,consisting of spore prints from wild mushrooms,and an approximately equal amount in traded services.in addition,the district introduced evidence that martin had a valid teaching certificate throughout the period of her suspension,that teaching jobs were available and in fact teachers were in great demand,and that she made no effort to secure comparable employment.
on march,the court heard the continued matter and on march,the court denied the district motion and issued a writ of mandate ordering martin reinstatement and further directing that the district pay her all back pay from april,totaling,reduced only by for amounts actually earned by martin.the court further ordered the district to pay martin per teaching day beginning march,until she is reinstated and receiving regular pay.judgment was entered april.
the district argues on appeal that section,subdivision c was not intended to apply to a dismissal following a diversion,since such a dismissal is not based on the merits and does not reflect exoneration.thus,the application of section in these circumstances to compensate martin for all of her back pay does not further the policy behind the statute,which is to make whole an employee who has been wrongly accused.the district argues further that section,subdivision c,is unconstitutional as applied here because it constitutes a pledge of the district credit,or an unauthorized gift of public funds.cal,art.xvi.next the district argues that if an award of back pay is authorized under section,subdivision c,martin did not mitigate her damages and thus the court erred by failing to reduce the award by amounts she could have earned had she exercised reasonable diligence.finally,the district argues that martin petition for a writ of mandate was barred by laches,as she did not file it until almost a year after the charges against her were dismissed.
standard of review 
the interpretation and applicability of a statute present questions of law and thus warrant our independent review.lazar hertz th,d.however,the further questions in the case,whether martin mitigated damages and whether her action was barred by the doctrine of laches,are governed by a substantial evidence review.california school employees personnel commission d.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d.
education code section as applied to a drug diversion dismissal 
we are not the first court to address the issue whether the reinstatement and reimbursement provisions in section,subdivision c,apply when the charges against the teacher are dismissed pursuant to the drug diversion statute.in unzueta,supra,th,d,the court found that a diversion dismissal was within the purview of section,subdivision c.in unzueta,as in our case,the teacher was charged with an optional leave of absence offense within the meaning of section,subdivision b,namely possession and use of cocaine.pursuant to section,subdivision e,the school district placed him on compulsory leave.he completed a diversion program and the charges against him were dismissed under former penal code section.after resuming employment,he filed a petition for a writ of mandate under section,subdivision c,requesting back pay for approximately two years because the charges against him had been dismissed.the trial court granted the petition.on appeal,a majority of the court found that under section,subdivision c,the teacher was entitled to back pay for the period of time during which he had been suspended and was completing diversion.but the court remanded the matter to determine an offset for amounts actually earned by the teacher during the relevant time.
the majority in unzueta acknowledged that section,subdivision c,carries a connotation that the school district subject to its provisions has unlawfully or erroneously suspended a teacher who is later found to be innocent of the charges.the court nonetheless concluded that the statute did not on its face distinguish between different types of dismissals.whether the defendant is dismissed pursuant to penal code section,or pursuant to penal code section,or after a trial on the merits,the court found that a dismissal is a dismissal for purposes of section.unzueta,supra,th at,d.
the court reasoned that the diversion statute and section must be construed together and harmonized if possible.the court stressed that former penal code section now,provided that after diversion is successfully completed,the arrest upon which the diversion was based shall be deemed to have never occurred.unzueta,supra,at,d.furthermore,the record pertaining to such an arrest shall not be used in any way which could result in the denial of any employment,benefit,license,or certificate,original italics.the court found this language indicative of an intent by the legislature that the protection of section be given the broadest application.id.at,d board of medical quality assurance d.given the language of education code section,subdivision c,it would be inappropriate for the judiciary to preclude backpay based upon an event which is deemed to have never occurred.moreover,the district may not use the record of the arrest to deprive the teacher of the benefit afforded pursuant to penal code section.unzueta,supra,th at,d.the court declined to interpret the language of section to exclude a dismissal pursuant to the diversion statute however,it invited the legislature to amend section if it had intended such a result.no changes were made in the statute in response to this invitation.
in a dissent in unzueta,justice gilbert found that the result reached by the majority not only did not further the purposes of the statutes but also defied common sense.he wrote that it would be absurd and unjust to allow unzueta to recover backpay the purpose behind education code section is to protect students from teachers who have committed certain offenses.the purpose behind the drug diversion statute is to rehabilitate drug offenders and to spare them the stigma of a criminal record.citations penal code section and education code section were not designed to provide teachers with an additional reward of backpay for the time spent on a drug diversion program.unzueta,supra,th at,d,dis.opn.of gilbert,in justice gilbert view,section,subdivision c,was intended only to make whole a teacher who is suspended for certain criminal charges but who is later found to be innocent.a dismissal pursuant to the diversion statute does not carry with it the presumption of innocence.he concluded that a literal reading of section to include diversion dismissals created a result contrary to public policy,contrary to legislative intent,and contrary to our shared notions of justice.id.at,d.
on appeal here the district endorses the reasoning of justice gilbert dissent in unzueta.the district further argues that unzueta is both factually distinguishable and wrongly decided.the district would distinguish unzueta factually in that the criminal proceedings in unzueta did not keep the teacher out of the classroom as long as those in our case,and consequently the backpay in unzueta was considerably less than the over awarded here.unzueta prosecution and diversion was completed within two years and his back pay was only,which the court ordered must be offset by approximately he earned during that time.martin,on the other hand,was charged in april of and did not complete diversion until august of.her lawsuit was not brought until august of,over four years after she had been suspended.while these quantitative differences tend to make a more compelling argument,they are nonetheless only differences of degree.unzueta and our case are not so factually dissimilar as to justify a different interpretation of the legal effect of the statutes.
the district contends that the majority in unzueta,by adhering to a literal interpretation of section,subdivision c,failed to give effect to the purpose of the statute.this was essentially the position taken by justice gilbert in his dissent.we must not,he wrote,be slaves to the tyranny of literalness so that we construe a statute in a way that yields a grotesque caricature of the legislature purpose.unzueta,supra,at,d,dis.opn.of gilbert,the majority in unzueta rejected the notion that reinstating a teacher who has completed diversion and compensating that teacher for the duration of the criminal proceedings could not have been the purpose of the legislature in section.the legislative reward for successful completion of diversion is dismissal of the criminal charge and rehabilitation of the experimental drug user by returning him to productive citizenship.when the successful divertee is a school teacher,an otherwise competent teacher is saved and backpay for time of suspension is given.can we say,as a matter of law,that the legislature did not intend this latter consequence given the language of education code section,subdivision c unzueta,supra,at,d.the majority concluded there was no compelling reason not to accept the plain meaning of the words of the statute.
the legislature,as the majority in unzueta pointed out,could have specifically excluded diversion dismissals from the reach of section,subdivision c.the current version of section was enacted in,years after the legislature had enacted the diversion statute in.if the legislature had desired to preclude backpay for those who obtain dismissals through diversion,it could simply have said so.id.at,d.furthermore,in the court in unzueta expressly invited the legislature to amend the statute to except diversion dismissals if it so intended,and it did not do so.
as an intermediate court of review,our function is not to judge the wisdom of statutes.unzueta,supra,at,d wells fargo bank superior court cal d.we may not act as a,nor are we free to enforce what we think best.unzueta,supra,at,d.while we share some of the concerns expressed in the dissent in unzueta,we find no principled basis to distinguish that case from ours.the legislature in section,subdivision c,provided a remedy to teachers where charges against them have been dismissed.it has seen fit not to qualify this language.we therefore conclude,consistent with unzueta,that the diversion dismissal in this case is a dismissal within the meaning of section,subdivision c.
constitutionality of section 
the district contends that the court in unzueta did not consider or decide the further argument raised here that an award of backpay under section,subdivision c,constitutes an unconstitutional pledge of the district credit or in the alternative a gift of public funds.the constitutional provision relied on is article xvi,section of the california constitution,which provides the legislature shall have no power to give or to lend,or to authorize the giving or lending,of the credit of the state,or of any county,city and county,city,township or other political corporation or subdivision of the state or to pledge the credit thereof,in any manner whatever,for the payment of the liabilities of any individual,association,municipal or other corporation whatever a school district is considered to be a political subdivision of the state within the meaning of article xvi.hall city of taft cal d.article xvi,section goes on to provide nor shall the legislature have power to make any gift or authorize the making of any gift,of any public money or thing of value to any individual,municipal or other corporation whatever 
the district argues that the first part of article xvi,section prohibits the legislature from pledging the district credit by requiring the district to pay for a future unknown obligation created by the state,namely the obligation under section to award undetermined amounts of back pay to a reinstated teacher.the district complains that it has no way of anticipating such an obligation and no means of controlling the amount of the expenditure.this would be true,however,in any case of the application of section,subdivision c,to any acquittal or dismissal,and does not render the statute unconstitutional when specifically applied to diversion dismissals.
in regard to the second part of article xvi,section,which prohibits a gift of public funds,the district argues that all expenditures of public funds must have a public purpose.white state of california th,d.the district position is that the application of section,subdivision c,in the circumstances here manifestly lacks a public purpose since the only possible purpose of the statute is to make whole a person who has been wrongly charged and suspended.that purpose is not served here because martin was not exonerated and her suspension was not wrongful.furthermore,the district was obliged to pay another teacher to fill martin position during the entire time she was suspended.therefore,applying section,subdivision c,to require that the district pay out over for which it received no services furthers no conceivable purpose and is an unconstitutional gift of public funds.
few courts have interpreted article xvi,section,and consequently no precedent exists to aid us in determining whether the application of section,subdivision c,to a diversion dismissal is unconstitutional.ordinarily legislative enactments are presumed to be valid.voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors cal th,d.as a general rule statutes should be construed,if reasonably possible,to avoid finding they are unconstitutional.tuffli governing board th,d.furthermore,it appears that the district constitutionality arguments rest upon the premise that section,subdivision c,could not have been intended to be applied to diversion dismissals and thus that its application in these circumstances serves no public purpose.these claims were discussed above,however,where we concluded that unzueta provided pertinent legal precedent.that court found it was not unreasonable or absurd for the legislature to have intended section,subdivision c,to apply to diversion dismissals.
as the district concedes,the question whether an expenditure has a public purpose is within the discretion of the legislature.i ts discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.county of alameda carleson cal d.we can not find as a matter of law that section as applied to diversion dismissals is devoid of a legislative purpose.we therefore conclude that it is not unconstitutional 
mitigation 
the district argues that martin had a duty to mitigate damages and that her failure to do so requires that any award be reduced by amounts she could have earned during the time she was suspended.the unzueta case provides some guidance on the issue of mitigation.that court found that even though section,subdivision c,authorizes full compensation and does not expressly provide for any offset,general principals of law dictate that the obligation to reimburse the teacher for the amount of salary wrongfully withheld may be offset by deducting earnings from other employment.unzueta,supra,at,d california school employees personnel commission,supra,d.thus,while the school district must make a teacher whole who has been suspended due to criminal charges later dismissed,it need not make the teacher more than whole.unzueta,supra,at,d.
since unzueta did mitigate his damages,earning approximately at other employment during the time of his suspension,the court in unzueta did not discuss the nature of the duty to mitigate.it simply found that money actually earned could be deducted from back pay owed.our case presents the question not reached in unzueta where a teacher has been placed on compulsory leave due to charges that fall within section,what is that teacher duty to mitigate damages arising to the school district in the event of a subsequent acquittal or dismissal of the charges 
in the context of wrongful termination,the general rule is that a public employee who is wrongfully discharged has a duty to exercise due diligence to mitigate damages while pursuing remedies against the employer.california school employees personnel commission,supra,d.the exercise of due diligence includes the duty to look for comparable employment.stanchfield hamer toyota,th,d.the employer has the burden to show mitigation,what the employee has earned or with reasonable diligence might have earned from other employment.id.at,d.however,before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation,the employer must show that the other employment was comparable,or substantially similar,to that of which the employee has been deprived the employee rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages.parker twentieth film cal d.we believe these rules apply here,even though this was a case of statutory suspension rather than wrongful termination.
the trial court,guided by unzueta,ordered that the award of back pay to martin be reduced by.this represented what the district could show she actually earned,by means other than teaching,during her suspension.the trial court made no findin
