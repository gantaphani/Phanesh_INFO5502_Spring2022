the issue in this appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion when it awarded a student who is disabled placement in a private school as compensation for violations of the individuals with disabilities education act.jarron draper entered the atlanta independent school system as a student in the second grade.after years of conflict with the school system,draper family requested and received an administrative hearing about his education.by then,draper was years old and in the eleventh grade,but he could read at only a level.the administrative law judge entered extensive findings and awarded draper relief,and the district court,after both parties sought review,adopted the findings and increased the award.draper is now years old.the school system concedes that it violated some of draper rights and,in one year,provided him a deficient educational program,but the school system argues that other violations are either barred by the statute of limitations or not supported by the record.the school system also contends that draper must be educated in a public school and that draper award is disproportionate to the violations of his rights.this appeal reminds us of words written by the late judge john minor wisdom about a denial of educational opportunity in a different era a man should be able to find an education by taking the broad highway.he should not have to take through the woods and follow winding trails through sharp thickets,in constant tension because of the pitfalls and traps,and,after years of effort,perhaps attain the threshold of his goal when he is past caring about it.meredith fair,cir.because the district court did not abuse its broad discretion to fashion appropriate relief under the act,we affirm.
background 
before we address the merits of the arguments of the school system,we review three matters.first,we provide a brief overview of the act to place the factual record in context.next,we review the factual record about the education of draper by the school system.finally,we review the decisions of both the district court and the administrative law judge.
a.the individuals with disabilities education act 
the act provides federal assistance to states that provide a free and appropriate education to children with disabilities.a a.states are required to identify children in need of special education services.id.a a.after a child is identified as disabled,the state must develop,review,and revise an individualized education program that meets the requirements of the act.id.a.a team that includes,at a minimum,the parents of the child,one teacher of the child,one teacher of the child,and a representative of the local educational agency develops the educational program.id.d b,d a.the program must comply with the procedures of the act and be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.jsk ex rel.jk hendry county sch,cir citing bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch,westchester county rowley,d.
if the parents either disagree with the educational program or believe that the child has been denied rights under the act,they are entitled to a hearing conducted by the state educational agency or by the local educational agency as determined by state law.f a.georgia law provides that the hearings are to be conducted by the office of state administrative hearings.ann.a.if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the state educational agency,the party can file a civil action in a district court of the united states.i a.

factual background 
draper entered the school system as a child in the second grade in.he could not read,was writing at a kindergarten level,and did not know the sounds of the alphabet.draper teachers recommended that draper be tested to determine the cause of his academic struggles in february,november,february,and october.
the school system performed an evaluation of draper on june,and concluded that he had an intelligence quotient of.this evaluation was flawed because it failed to assess draper for a specific learning disability even though he displayed signs of dyslexia,such as writing letters,numbers,and words backwards.draper was years old.
on january,draper was placed in the most restrictive educational environment available,a classroom for children with mild intellectual disabilities.the restrictive classroom provided draper with a functional curriculum that would not lead to a regular high school diploma.draper team met on april,and determined that he was reading at a level and spelling at a level.draper was years old.draper remained in the restrictive classroom through the school year of.his placement in the restrictive classroom between and was based on the evaluation.
draper was not reevaluated until april,when he was in the ninth grade and years old.under the act,draper should have been reevaluated by june.a b ii.after completing the evaluation,the school psychologist recommended further testing because discrepancies in subtest scores suggested that the evaluation did not accurately reflect draper intellectual potential.
the school system reevaluated draper in july.this evaluation revealed that draper did not have mild intellectual disabilities but had a specific learning disability.the evaluation established that a intelligence quotient of,which is in the range of intelligence,more accurately reflected draper intelligence.the evaluation also established that draper was still reading at a level,performing at a level in arithmetic,and performing at a level in spelling.his reading level had not improved since april.
draper team met several times throughout the summer and fall to modify his educational program.draper family made it clear to the school system that draper wanted to receive a regular high school diploma so that he could go to college.on august,draper family requested private schooling and tutoring to help draper close the achievement gap in his studies.no action was taken on these requests.
on september,the school system modified draper diagnosis from mild intellectual disabilities to specific learning disability.draper team recommended only hours of speech tutoring a week.on october,draper team amended the educational program to provide draper with hours of general education and hours of special education a week.the school system placed draper in classes for the first time since third grade even though a witness for the school system testified that a or reading level is required to survive academically in high school.
draper educational program provided that he would use the lexia program,an instructional computer program,to improve his ability to read,but draper was not provided the lexia program.on november,the school system agreed,after mediation,to provide draper with the lexia program by no later than november.despite the agreement,the school system did not implement the lexia program until december,and,by january,draper had received only hours of instruction with the lexia program.
on may,draper was privately evaluated by the reading program.the center recommended that draper receive intensive training at a rate of hours daily for a total of hours.on may,although the school system was aware that draper was still reading at a level,draper team decided that he would use the lexia program for the summer.draper family requested private reading services but were informed that they would have to file a formal complaint to pursue the matter.
during the summer of,the school system referred draper to judy wolman for an independent psychological evaluation.the evaluation established that draper skills in several areas were severely discrepant from his potential.wolman concluded that draper suffered from a specific learning disability consistent with dyslexia and recommended intensive training to remedy his academic deficits.despite draper family objections that the lexia program was inadequate to address draper needs,draper team decided on november,to continue the use of the lexia program.when draper team met again on may,draper had failed his class and was failing the second semester of algebra.
on september,the georgia department of education acknowledged that draper grades had not improved.the department informed draper family that they could request a hearing if they were not satisfied with draper educational program.the hearing was conducted by the administrative law judge in november.by then,draper was years old and in the eleventh grade.
procedural history 
the administrative law judge held a hearing for three days regarding draper education.the school system retained an expert,barry bogan,who had never met or spoken with draper.established that bogan assumptions regarding draper diagnosis,age,and educational level were incorrect.bogan was unaware that draper had been diagnosed as having a specific learning disability.bogan testified that draper was or years old when in fact draper was almost years old.bogan was of the opinion,based on his review of a single test,that draper was reading at a or level instead of a level.bogan opined that the school system had provided draper an adequate education.
draper called several experts to testify on his behalf.both wolman and camilla fletcher had spent extensive time with draper.wolman testified that draper did not have the necessary skills to benefit from the lexia program,and fletcher testified that the use of the lexia program for minutes a day was insufficient to remedy draper achievement gap.after edward dragan spoke with draper and reviewed his educational file,dragan testified that the school system should have discovered that it had misdiagnosed draper as mildly intellectually disabled much earlier than.dragan expressed serious doubt that the school system could or would provide draper the appropriate services to remedy his educational deficits.wolman and fletcher both expressed concern about the ability of an expert to evaluate a student education if the expert had never spoken with the student and was unfamiliar with the student diagnosis.
draper testified that the school system did not provide him with lexia instruction minutes a day for five days a week as the school system had alleged.draper stated that his tutor,a football coach,spent much of the sessions surfing websites about football on the internet.draper testified that his science class consisted of coloring and his math class of crossword puzzles.the administrative law judge concluded that draper was very articulate and a very impressive witness.
the administrative law judge found that the school system failed to provide draper an adequate education for the school years of,and.the administrative law judge found that,after the school system misdiagnosed draper in,the school system failed to reevaluate him,in violation of the act.the administrative law judge concluded that the use of an educational program that did not increase draper reading ability after three years failed to satisfy the act.
the administrative law judge awarded draper a choice of two remedial options.the first option provided draper with substantial additional support services in the school system.the school system would have been required to provide draper with intensive reading services for minutes a day,five days a week train all of draper teachers in dyslexia instructional strategies provide draper with a,certified,teacher to support him in all his classes provide one hour a day of tutorial services provide services during the summer and,during the first year,evaluate draper progress monthly.the second option allowed draper to be placed in a private school and required the school system to pay his tuition,not to exceed a year.these services were available until june or when draper received a high school diploma,whichever came first.
both parties sought review by the district court.i a.draper contended that the administrative law judge provided inadequate compensatory services to remedy the violations of the act by the school system,and the school system argued that it had not violated the act.the school system argued that the administrative law judge had disregarded the statute of limitations,made erroneous findings of fact,failed to use the proper standard under the act,and created a remedy unauthorized by the law or the evidence.
while the dispute was pending in the district court,draper selected the second option,the placement in a private school,and requested placement at the cottage school,but draper reserved his right to argue that the second option was inadequate.the school system moved to stay the enforcement of the order of the administrative law judge so that the school system would not have to pay for draper placement in a private school while the district court reviewed the dispute.the district court denied the motion to stay the enforcement of the award and ruled that draper selection of the second option was enforceable while the dispute was pending in the district court.
in its final order,the district court ruled for draper in part and for the school system in part.the district court concluded that the statute of limitations permitted an award for draper placement in the restrictive classroom in but limited compensation for the failure by the school system to reevaluate draper for the period between november and april.the district court agreed with the administrative law judge that the school system failed to provide draper an adequate education for the school years of,and.as draper requested,the district court modified the second option in the award by the administrative law judge.the district court awarded draper full services at the cottage school without the cap and extended the time frame of the remedy to or when draper receives a high school diploma,whichever comes first.the district court found that there is ample evidence in the record of the types of services draper will require to appropriately educate him within the meaning of the act.the district court concluded that the cottage school could address draper educational needs and was the appropriate placement.
ii.standards of review 
a few standards govern our review of this appeal.whether an educational program provided an adequate education under the act is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review.cp leon county sch.bd,cir citing sch.bd,cir.specific findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.id.citing,at.to the extent that this issue involves the interpretation of a federal statute,it is a question of law which we review de novo.id.citing walker county sch.dist.bennett ex rel.bennett,cir.we review awards under section i b iii of the act for abuse of discretion.see bd.of educ,cir.if the district court finds a violation of the act,it shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.i c iii.the act grants broad discretion to the district court.sch.comm.of burlington dep t of,d.
iii.discussion 
we evaluate the argument of the school system in two parts.first,we consider whether the district court abused its discretion in the light of the decision of the administrative law judge.second,we consider whether draper award is disproportionate to the violations of the act by the school system.
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion in the light of the decision of the administrative law judge.
the school system argues that,even if draper was entitled to an award,the district court abused its discretion in two ways.first,the school system argues that,because the award by the administrative law judge provided draper a placement in a public school as one option for compensation,the district court could not award draper a placement in a private school.second,the school system contends that draper award is contrary to the act because the administrative law judge granted draper a unilateral choice regarding his education.these arguments fail.
the provision of a public school option by an administrative law judge does not preclude an award of placement in a private school by a district court.
the school system argues that draper award violates the act as a matter of law because it allows a placement in a private school when the administrative law judge provided the option of a placement in a public school.the school system reads the provision of a public school option by the administrative law judge as a finding that the school system is able to educate draper adequately.although we doubt that the decision of the administrative law judge evinced any confidence in the ability of the school system to compensate for its failed attempt to educate draper,we will assume,for the purpose of this discussion,that the administrative law judge found that the school system could prospectively provide an appropriate educational program for draper.even with that assumption,the argument of the school system fails.
the district court was free to fashion appropriate relief for draper regardless of the options offered in the discussion of the administrative law judge.the act requires appropriate relief,and the only possible interpretation is that the relief is to be appropriate in light of the purpose of the act.burlington,at.at.e quitable considerations are relevant in fashioning relief,burlington,at,at,and the court enjoys broad discretion in so doing,at,at.florence county sch.dist.four carter ex rel.carter,d.this circuit has held compensatory education appropriate relief where responsible authorities have failed to provide a handicapped student with an appropriate education as required by the act.andrews,at citing breen,at.
the district court did not find that the school system could afford draper appropriate relief.the district court,unlike the administrative law judge,did not award draper a placement in a public school as one option for compensation.the district court awarded draper placement in a private school.
the school system argues that a purpose of the act,which is to make public schools the preferred setting,precludes draper award of placement in a private school,but we disagree.the supreme court has explained,the act contemplates that such education will be provided where possible in regular public schools,but the act also provides for placement in private schools at public expense where this is not possible.burlington,at.at.we have recognized that the act reflects a structural preference in favor of providing special education in public schools,but we have explained that when a public school fails to provide an adequate education in a timely manner a placement in a private school may be appropriate.loren ex rel.fisher atlanta indep.sch,cir.
a prospective injunction that requires a placement in a private school is appropriate beyond cavil when an educational program calling for placement in a public school is inappropriate.burlington,at.at.a disabled student is not required to demonstrate that he can not be educated in a public setting.under the act,the relevant question is not whether a student could in theory receive an appropriate education in a public setting but whether he will receive such an education.ridgewood bd.of educ.ex rel,cir.
it is well settled that an award of reimbursement for the expenses of a private school is allowed under the act when the private placement is appropriate for the student and an educational program at a public school has been inadequate.burlington,at.at.in burlington,the student father unilaterally removed the student from the public school and placed the student in a private school because the father believed that the educational program offered by the public school was inadequate.id.at.at.the supreme court held that a prospective injunction providing placement in a private school would be appropriate,as would reimbursement for those expenses.id.at.at.the court reasoned that,because of the inevitable elapse of time during the litigation,a determination that a public school system violated the act would be an empty victory if reimbursement for the expenses of a private education were unavailable.id.similarly,in florence county,after the local and state agencies rejected the parents complaints about an educational program,the parents unilaterally placed the student in a private school.at.at.the supreme court affirmed the award of reimbursement because the educational program offered by the public school was inadequate and the placement in a private school was appropriate.id.at.at.
the school system argues that draper award is different from an award of reimbursement,but reading appropriate as requiring prospective placement in a public school,as the school system argues,would create an anomaly in the law.if draper family had unilaterally placed him in the cottage school,then an award of reimbursement would be appropriate under the act.see burlington,at.at.the district court found that the school system had failed to provide draper an adequate educational program,and the district court concluded that the cottage school offered an appropriate placement.if the district court could not prospectively award draper a placement in a private school,draper would be worse off with an award of prospective education than he would be with a retroactive award of reimbursement for the same violations of the act.the supreme court has recognized that conscientious parents who have adequate means will place their child in private school if they are reasonably confident of their assessment that an educational program at a public school is inadequate.id.at.at.the argument of the school system would provide those wealthier parents greater benefits under the act than poorer parents.
we do not read the act as requiring compensatory awards of prospective education to be inferior to awards of reimbursement.the act does not relegate families who lack the resources to place their children unilaterally in private schools to shouldering the burden of proving that the public school can not adequately educate their child before those parents can obtain a placement in a private school.the act instead empowers the district court to use broad discretion to fashion appropriate equitable relief.
the argument of the school system is wrong.although it ordinarily has a structural preference for special education in public schools,the act does not foreclose a compensatory award of placement in a private school.the district court was free to award draper a placement in a private school without regard to the remedy fashioned by the administrative law judge,and draper was not required to prove that the school system was incapable of providing him an appropriate education.
the provision of two options for draper by the administrative law judge does not affect the validity of the award by the district court.
the school system also contends that draper award violates the act because the administrative law judge provided draper a unilateral choice between two options.the school system argues that draper award is inconsistent with the cooperative process that the act establishes between parents and schools.schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,d.we disagree.
the argument of the school system is based on the erroneous premise that the district court,like the administrative law judge,awarded draper two options for compensation when,in fact,the district court awarded draper placement in only a private school.whatever two options the administrative law judge awarded draper is beside the point.we review the decision of the district court,and that decision awarded draper his preferred form of compensation.
the school system contends that the district court left the provision of two options in draper award intact,but we read the record differently.before the district court modified and supplemented draper award,draper selected the second option in that award,which was placement in a private school.the school system moved to stay the enforcement of the award so that it would not have to pay for draper placement in
