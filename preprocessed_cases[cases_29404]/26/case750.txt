this interlocutory appeal is the latest battle in a nearly conflict between heartland christian academy hca and the state of missouri.the two corporations that own and operate hca,heartland academy community church hacc and cns international ministries,cns,six former hca students students,and thirteen parents of former hca students parents collectively,heartland are suing twelve missouri juvenile officials officials under heartland alleges the officials conspired to raid hca campus and seize scores of its students in,in violation of the united states constitution.the officials maintain they are entitled to qualified immunity,but the district court denied their motions for summary judgment.to the extent we have jurisdiction over the officials interlocutory appeal,we affirm.
background 
allegations against the officials 
viewed in the light most favorable to heartland,see,brown city of golden valley,cir,the facts are these 
the officials participated in a conspiracy to harass and intimidate hca,a christian boarding school in northeastern missouri.hca educates and provides social services to children with behavioral and substance abuse problems.as of,approximately of hca students lived on hca campus.
two of the conspiracy more prominent members were chief juvenile officers michael waddle waddle and cindy ayers ayers.waddle,the conspiracy ringleader,disliked hca because hca was unlicensed legally,waddle disagreed with hacc teachings,and waddle believed hca had not acted very.ayers complained hca was growing too fast,and expressed the view that there were people everywhere at hca,including children from foreign countries,and missouri should slow or put a stop to hca.
the charged conspiracy reached its nadir on october,when juvenile authorities and armed law enforcement officers,total,arrived at hca campus and removed of its students.the officials did not provide any notice to heartland of the removal until the last possible moment.waddle and ayers procured ex parte orders from local juvenile court judges to remove hca students.waddle and ayers used false misrepresentations to obtain the ex parte removal orders.the juvenile court judges issued the ex parte orders under the false impressions all hca students were in imminent danger of physical harm,hca was unwilling to cooperate with the relevant juvenile authorities,and no lesser alternative short of a mass removal was available to ensure the students safety.
the ex parte orders were rife with error,because waddle and ayers knowingly presented the juvenile court judges with stale information about hca student body.as a direct consequence,those conducting the raid lacked ex parte orders for dozens of the children they removed.yet they possessed ex parte orders for approximately forty children who no longer lived at hca and four adults over whom the juvenile judges lacked jurisdiction.
members of the conspiracy,together with others,detained the hca students at local facilities until the students parents retrieved them.when the parents arrived at the detention several days after the raid and from parents received stern letters advising the parents to keep their children away from hca.the letters suggested the return of a child to hca might result in the parents loss of custody of their children or referral to law enforcement authorities.
the juvenile court judges scheduled detention hearings,but waddle and ayers preemptively moved to dismiss the underlying juvenile court cases as soon as the parents picked up their children.all cases were eventually dismissed,the judges never held any hearings,and the propriety of the raid was never litigated in juvenile court.
after the hearings were cancelled and the juvenile court cases dismissed,the officials tried to cover up their misdeeds.they spread false and misleading information to the press and politicians alike.for example,dana martin martin,director of the missouri department of social services,sent a letter to a missouri state representative.in the letter,martin falsely stated the missouri division of family services dfs had received numerous reports of child abuse and neglect at hca dating back to dfs made many attempts to resolve concerns with hca from march until the eventual removal of the children in october no dfs personnel participated in the mass removal and a hca staff member had pled guilty to beating a child.
legal wrangling 
equitable relief case 
in july,months before the raid,hacc and cns collectively,heartland corporations filed a lawsuit equitable relief case in the district court against waddle and others.heartland corporations asked for a permanent injunction to stem an alleged campaign to harass and intimidate hca,its employees and students and their families.
shortly after the raid,heartland corporations asked the district court for emergency equitable relief to prevent waddle from carrying out another raid absent certain safeguards,including notice and hearings for affected parties.the district court issued a preliminary injunction.among other things,the court forbade waddle from seeking or participating in any removal of all boarding children from hca unless all boarding children at hca are directly involved in the underlying facts that serve as the basis for such removal.we affirmed the preliminary injunction in.see generally heartland acad.cmty.church waddle,cir.
the district court then presided over a bench trial on heartland corporations request for a permanent injunction against waddle and ayers the district court held waddle and ayers violated and conspired to violate heartland corporations fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures waddle and ayers violated heartland corporations fourteenth amendment procedural and substantive due process rights and waddle violated heartland corporations first amendment rights to free association.the district court permanently enjoined waddle from caus ing or attempt ing to cause the or removal of or tak ing into protective custody children from hca without reasonable cause to believe that each child for whom protective custody or removal is sought is in imminent danger.the district court found waddle appear ed ready and willing to once again remove the children from hca.the court declined to enjoin ayers,however,because the court found she expresse d no intention of engaging in such behavior in the future.we affirmed the permanent injunction in.see generally heartland acad.cmty.church waddle,cir heartland ii,aff g d.
present lawsuit for damages 
in,heartland sued the officials in their individual capacities for monetary damages counts i through vi are claims.in count i,the students and parents allege the officials violated their fourteenth amendment rights to family integrity.in count ii,the students allege the officials violated their fourth and fourteenth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures.in count iii,the students and parents claim the officials violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights to free association.in count iv,the students and parents claim the officials violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights to religious liberty and free speech.in count v,heartland claims certain officials violated its first amendment rights to freedom of association.in count vi,heartland claims certain officials violated its first amendment rights to free speech and religious freedom.counts vii through ix are missouri common law tort claims 
the officials moved for summary judgment,asking the district court to dismiss counts i through vi on qualified immunity grounds and to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over counts vii through ix.after wading through an extensive officials appendix on appeal is comprised of twelve volumes and nearly district court held there were genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment with respect to counts i,ii,iii,and v.the court dismissed counts iv and vi but allowed the remaining counts to proceed to trial.the officials appeal the denial of qualified immunity as to counts i,ii,iii,and 
ii.discussion 
qualified immunity general principles 
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,d quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity is not only a defense to liability but also an immunity from suit.id.because qualified immunity is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,a district court order denying qualified immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order exception to the final judgment rule to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.mitchell forsyth,d.
inasmuch as we have jurisdiction,we review the district court denial of qualified immunity de novo.see nelson corr.med,cir en banc citing plemmons roberts,cir.we consider two questions whether the plaintiff has shown the violation of a statutory or constitutional right,and whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct.see pearson.at nelson,at citation omitted.
we retain discretion to decide which of the two questions to answer first.see pearson.at nelson,at.with respect to the first question,we view the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,heartland,and afford heartland all relevant inferences.nelson,at quoting plemmons,at.with respect to the second question,we evaluate the objective legal reasonableness of the alleged misconduct,assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.pearson.at quoting wilson layne,d.in other words,we seek the answer to the second question in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.brosseau haugen,d per curiam quoting saucier katz,d,overruled in part on other grounds by pearson.at.
b.the officials i did do it defenses 
the officials primary argument on appeal is that the district court failed to assess their respective conduct individually when deciding whether they were entitled to qualified immunity.for example,the officials point out the district court repeatedly referred to them collectively as defendants.various officials then argue heartland adduced insufficient evidence to demonstrate they participated in a conspiracy to harass and intimidate hca.see marti city of maplewood,cir citation omitted requiring a civil rights plaintiff pressing a conspiracy claim to show that two or more individuals conspired for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of a constitutional right and that an act was done in furtherance of the conspiracy that caused an injury or deprivation.
heartland rejoins we do not have jurisdiction over the officials primary argument because it is and does not turn on an issue of law.mitchell,at.heartland opines the requirement to gauge an official conduct individually is a t most dictum and practically speaking,is unenforceable in any interlocutory appeal of a denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.in the alternative,heartland maintains there is sufficient evidence in the record to show all of the officials participated in a conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of the heartland community.
duty to evaluate the officials conduct individually 
we do not quarrel with the officials premise that the district court was required to evaluate their conduct individually.authorities not involved in the allegedly unconstitutional acts of their fellow public servants have not violated constitutional rights and are entitled to qualified immunity.see,grayson ross,cir the defendant was not involved in the decision to accept the plaintiff at the jail therefore,he could not have violated the plaintiff constitutional rights based on the plaintiff intake and is entitled to qualified immunity for the intake.liability for damages for a federal constitutional tort is personal,so each defendant conduct must be independently assessed.wilson northcutt,cir citing doran eckold,cir en banc.section does not sanction tort by association.
we believe we have jurisdiction over the narrow threshold question of whether the district court examined the officials conduct individually.see northcutt,at asserting jurisdiction,without discussion,for the purpose of independently assessing each defendant conduct.this threshold question asks only whether the district court properly applied the law.see mitchell,at.holding jurisdiction exists when the denial of qualified immunity turns on an issue of law.this question does not,in itself,require us to resolve any disputed issues of evidentiary sufficiency.see kahle leonard,cir reiterating jurisdiction does not extend to issues of evidence sufficiency,which facts a party may,or may not,be able to prove at trial quoting johnson jones,d.
after reviewing the district court order,we do not agree with the officials that the district court shirked its duty to gauge the officials conduct individually.although the district court did not cite cases such as northcutt,doran,or grayson,the court recognized qualified immunity is to be applied to a particular defendant conduct.the court expressly held genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to the degree of each defendant involvement in the mass removal.
the district court was not required to provide the officials with an exhaustive written analysis of the merits of each claim as to each defendant.united states feemster,cir en banc stating district courts need not provide a mechanical recitation of the a factors when determining a sentence quoting united states walking eagle,cir.see also behrens pelletier,d remarking that the district court did not identify all the bases for its order denying qualified immunity and the cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court likely assumed is the task facing the court of appeals.time is a precious commodity for busy district court judges,and judicial opinions need not resemble law review articles.
i did do it 
we lack jurisdiction over the officials arguments that heartland adduced insufficient evidence to demonstrate various officials participated in a conspiracy to harass and intimidate hca.these arguments amount to nothing more than prohibited i did do it defenses.see johnson,at.mueller tinkham,cir.
in johnson,the supreme court delineated the scope of the qualified immunity exception to the final order rule.the supreme court cautioned that considerations of delay,comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts,and wise use of appellate resources argue in favor of limiting interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity matters to cases presenting more abstract issues of law.johnson,at.the court held a defendant,entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense,may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.id.at.the supreme court made clear we must eschew w e did do it defenses and confine appellate review to neat abstract issues of law.id.at.citations omitted 
in mueller,a married couple brought a action against two police detectives for conspiring to violate their fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.mueller,at.the couple alleged the detectives applied for and executed a search warrant without probable cause.id.the district court denied the detectives motion for summary judgment.id.at.relying upon johnson,we held we lacked jurisdiction to the extent the detectives argued the district court erred in finding a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the detectives actually conspired with one another to deprive the couple of their constitutional rights.id.at citing johnson,at.
other cases follow the teachings of johnson and mueller.see,pendleton louis county,cir dismissing appeal for want of jurisdiction to the extent the defendants argued insufficient evidence links them to a conspiracy to retaliate against plaintiffs for sending the fax.put simply,we lack jurisdiction when a defendant attempts to argue on appeal that he did not do what the civil rights plaintiff accuses him of doing.see,behrens,at.construing johnson to hold there is no interlocutory
