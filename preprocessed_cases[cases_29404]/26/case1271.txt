in this case we consider a challenge under the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa to a decision by the board of trustees board of the california state university csu certifying an environmental impact report eir.the eir concerns the board project to expand the campus of san diego state university sdsu to accommodate more than additional students over the next several years part of a larger program to expand csu statewide enrollment capacity by.the sdsu project will contribute significantly to traffic congestion in the city of san diego.although the board has budgeted substantial state and funds to expand its campuses billion,the board has declined to use those funds,or any of csu financial resources,to reimburse other public agencies for its fair share of the statewide cost of mitigating its projects environmental effects million.instead,based on dictum in city of marina board of trustees of california state university cal th,d,marina the board has taken the position that csu may not lawfully pay to mitigate the environmental effects of its projects unless the legislature makes an appropriation for that specific purpose.anticipating the legislature might not make an earmarked appropriation for mitigation,given the resources already budgeted for campus expansion,the board has found that mitigation is infeasible and certified the eir for sdsu based on a statement of overriding considerations,that is,a determination the project offers benefits that outweigh its unmitigated effects.see pub.resources code,subds.a mitigation infeasible,b overriding benefits see also of,tit,et ceqa guidelines,subd.a findings,statement of overriding considerations.
we granted review to determine whether the board eir complies with ceqa and to reexamine the dictum in marina,supra,cal th,d.we conclude the dictum does not justify the board assumption that a state agency may contribute funds for environmental mitigation only through earmarked appropriations,to the exclusion of other available sources of funding.the erroneous assumption invalidates both the board finding that mitigation is infeasible and its statement of overriding considerations.accordingly,we will affirm the court of appeal decision directing the board to vacate its certification of the eir.
background 
csu is a public institution of higher education established by the legislature in to offer undergraduate,graduate and professional instruction,subd.b.currently the largest public university in the united states,csu enrolls students and employs faculty and staff members on campuses throughout the state.sdsu,one of csu campuses,enrolls over students and employs faculty and staff members on a acre campus in the city of san diego,eight miles from downtown.
defendant board is the governing body of csu,and the lead agency responsible for preparing and certifying the eir for sdsu master plan.see pub.resources code,lead agency,subd.a duties of lead agency see also,board powers.plaintiffs,who challenge the board decision to certify the eir,are the city of san diego city the san diego association of governments sandag,a regional agency with statutory responsibilities that include transportation and transit and the metropolitan transit system mts,a public agency that serves san diego and sdsu with light rail and buses.
in,the board directed csu to take the steps necessary to accommodate a projected increase in enrollment of students statewide.to support higher enrollment with additional physical facilities,the board approved a capital improvement program budgeting billion in state funds and billion in,nonappropriated funds as part of this program,the board determined that sdsu should expand to enroll more equivalent students by the academic year.the planned expansion will enlarge sdsu actual enrollment of full and students by,raising total enrollment from to,and also add faculty and staff members.
in,the board prepared an eir and campus master plan revision the eir proposing to undertake several construction projects on the sdsu campus.the proposed projects included a housing development for faculty,staff,and graduate students,a research and instructional facility,the expansion of a student residence hall,a new student union building,and a hotel.
in the eir,the board found the proposed projects would contribute significantly to cumulative traffic congestion at several identified locations.the board declined,however,to contribute its share of the cost of improving the affected roadways and intersections to the other public agencies responsible for making the necessary improvements the city and the california department of transportation caltrans.any contribution of funds for mitigation,the board asserted,would amount to a prohibited assessment of state property,art.xiii,subd.d and an unlawful gift of public funds,art.xvi.based on those assumptions,the board concluded that sdsu was not legally responsible for funding or constructing physical road improvements and that the improvements were instead the responsibility of others.for the same reasons,the board found that sdsu could not feasibly mitigate its project traffic impacts and that those impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.having found mitigation infeasible,the board on september,certified the eir as complete and in accordance with ceqa based on a statement of overriding considerations.
on october,the city challenged the board decision by filing a petition for writ of mandate in the san diego county superior court.among other things,the city challenged the board assumption that payments for mitigation would represent unlawful assessments or gifts of public funds.at that time,the board was taking the same position in another case challenging its refusal to mitigate the environmental impacts of a project to expand csu monterey bay csumb.in that other case,the court of appeal for the sixth appellate district had filed an opinion accepting the board position,we had granted review,and the case was pending in this court.city of marina board of trustees of california state university june,review granted.on july,we reversed the sixth district decision.in our opinion marina,supra,cal th,d,we rejected the board arguments against payments for mitigation and concluded the board had abused its discretion in certifying the eir for csumb.
in light of our decision in marina,supra,cal th,d,the san diego superior court in the case now before us issued a peremptory writ of mandate on september,directing the board to vacate its decision certifying the eir for sdsu.in its writ,the superior court stated that it retain ed jurisdiction until the court has determined that the board has complied with ceqa and the views expressed by the california supreme court in marina 
on june,the board circulated for public comment a new draft eir and campus master plan revision for sdsu deir.that document,as subsequently revised,finalized and certified by the board the eir or final eir,is the subject of the instant proceeding.
in the deir,the board proposed to undertake several large construction projects on acres on and adjacent to the sdsu campus.the proposed projects include adobe falls housing,a unit,acre development of townhouses,condominiums and recreational facilities for faculty and staff,to be funded by an outside development interest the alvarado campus,several buildings totaling square feet intended for academic,research and medical use,together with a square foot parking structure,to be funded by parking reserves and a future bond sale supported by parking fees the alvarado hotel,a room,square foot hotel to be funded by partnership arrangements a campus conference center of square feet to be funded by donors five new student housing structures totaling million square feet to accommodate students,replacing two smaller structures,and a related square foot administrative building,to be funded by state revenue bonds and the renovation and expansion of the student center to include square feet of new social and meeting space,recreational facilities,offices,and food and retail services,to be funded by student fees.
in the deir,the board acknowledged the proposed project would contribute significantly to cumulative traffic congestion in san diego.the board predicted the project,in the near term,would significantly impact six intersections,three street segments and one freeway ramp meter,and in the longer term by,nine more intersections,five more street segments,and four freeway mainline segments.for each affected location,the board estimated the project contributions to mitigate increased congestion those contributions average percent.the board also identified the specific improvements that would mitigate most of the impacts to below a level of significance.the board offered no assurance,however,that it would pay sdsu fair share of the mitigation costs.instead,the board made the following statement,citing marina,supra,cal th,d,as authority mitigation is recommended that would reduce the identified impacts to a level below significant.however,the university funding commitment is necessarily conditioned up on requesting and obtaining funds from the california legislature.if the legislature does not provide funding,or if funding is significantly delayed,all identified significant impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.
in public comments on the deir,the city objected that the board had misinterpreted marina,supra,cal th,d,and violated ceqa by failing to guarantee the proposed mitigation measures would be implemented a series of meetings followed in which representatives of the board,the city and caltrans discussed sdsu duty to mitigate traffic impacts.when negotiations failed,the board reiterated its position that any mitigation payment by sdsu would be conditioned on a future appropriation and stated it would request from the legislature for that purpose.in negotiations with caltrans the board agreed the project responsibility for freeway impacts would be in the near term and in the long term by.but the board disclaimed any obligation to pay its share.the board adhered to these positions in the final eir,explaining them in the following series of statements setting out the board interpretation of marina 
under the california supreme court decision in marina,supra,cal th,d,is obligated to request funding from the state legislature to pay its of the mitigation costs associated with the identified significant impacts pursuant to that obligation,csu will,following the normal state budget timelines and process,submit a budget request to the state legislature and governor that will include a mitigation dollar amount consistent with csu contribution towards implementation of the necessary roadway improvements within the jurisdiction of local agencies.
the intent of the california supreme court decision in marina,supra,cal th is to ensure that significant impacts under ceqa are feasibly mitigated and that localities recover the cost of csu impacts.the underlying logic of that decision does not apply to other state agencies,such as caltrans,as these other state agencies are funded from the same source as csu.instead,will support caltrans in its efforts to obtain the level of funding agreed to by the parties through the annual state budget process,and will look to the city and sandag to join in that support.
however,the board continued,because csu can not guarantee that its request to the governor and the legislature for the necessary mitigation funding will be approved,or that any funding request submitted by caltrans will be approved,or that the funding will be granted in the amount requested,or that the public agencies will fund the mitigation improvements that are within their responsibility and jurisdiction,the identified significant impacts are determined to be significant and unavoidable.for the same reasons,the board found that there are no feasible mitigation measures that would reduce the identified significant impacts to a level below significant.therefore,these impacts must be considered unavoidably significant even after implementation of all feasible and parking mitigation measures.
in august,before certifying the eir,the chancellor of csu submitted to the department of finance a capital outlay budget change proposal requesting the legislature create a systemwide fund for the mitigation of impacts related to growth and development on csu campuses.noting that six csu campuses bakersfield,fresno,long beach,monterey bay,san diego and san francisco were currently revising their master plans,the chancellor requested a total of million to mitigate environmental effects at all locations,including million for sdsu.the board request did not appear in the governor proposed budget,the may revision or the budget act.the board repeated the request in each of the next two years,apparently without any different result.
on november and,the board conducted a public meeting to certify the eir.representatives of the city,sandag,mts and caltrans reiterated previously expressed concerns about the board approach to mitigation and its interpretation of marina,supra,cal th,d.at the meeting conclusion,the board approved a resolution adopting the eir findings,certifying the eir as complete and in compliance with ceqa,and approving the campus master plan revision for sdsu.
the board resolution,in summary,finds the project will have significant impacts on traffic that the impacts can not feasibly be mitigated given the board interpretation of marina,supra,cal th,d,and that the impacts are unavoidable but nevertheless acceptable because the project offers overriding benefits that justify proceeding despite the unmitigated effects.the board statement of overriding considerations includes a list of the anticipated benefits of campus expansion,which the board summarizes as satisfying statewide educational demand,improving educational opportunities for underrepresented populations,creating jobs,and fueling economic growth.
on december,plaintiffs city,sandag and mts filed petitions for writ of mandate in the san diego superior court challenging the board decision to certify the eir.after consolidating the petitions,the court issued a statement of decision and judgment rejecting all of plaintiffs claims,denying the petitions for writ of mandate,and discharging the peremptory writ.
plaintiffs appealed the superior court decision.the court of appeal reversed in part,affirmed in part,and directed the superior court to issue a writ of mandate ordering the board to vacate its decision certifying the eir.among other things,the court of appeal held the board had erred in relying on marina,supra,cal th,d,to find mitigation infeasible and,based on that finding,to conclude that overriding considerations justified proceeding with the master plan despite the unmitigated environmental effects we granted the board petition for review 
ii.discussion 
the main issue before us is a question of law does the dictum in marina,supra,cal th,d,support the board assumption in the eir that csu may not contribute its fair share to mitigate the environmental effects of campus expansion unless the legislature makes an appropriation for that specific purpose the assumption critically underlies both the board finding that mitigation is infeasible and its statement of overriding considerations.we conclude the answer is no the marina dictum does not justify the assumption.the board other contentions also lack merit.
a.the standard of review.
ceqa sets out the applicable standard of review in any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void or annul a determination,finding,or decision of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with this division,the inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.pub.resources code.
the board finding that mitigation is not feasible without an earmarked appropriation depends for its validity on a question of law a type of question we review de novo.marina,supra,cal th at,d.de novo review of legal questions is consistent with the principle that,in ceqa cases,t he court does not pass upon the correctness of the eir environmental conclusions,but only upon its sufficiency as an informative document.id.at,d,quoting laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.an eir that incorrectly disclaims the power and duty to mitigate identified environmental effects based on erroneous legal assumptions is not sufficient as an informative document marina,at,d,and an agency use of an erroneous legal standard constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required by law id.at,d,quoting no oil,city of los angeles cal d.
b.the marina decision.
as noted,our decision in marina,supra,cal th,d,addressed a challenge to the board eir for an earlier campus expansion project.in that eir,the board had found that to expand csumb would significantly affect drainage,water supply,traffic,wastewater management and fire protection throughout fort ord,the former military base on which the campus was located,as well as vehicular traffic in the neighboring municipalities of seaside and the city of marina.id.at,d.nevertheless,the board refused to share the cost of mitigating these impacts with the public entities responsible for undertaking the necessary infrastructure improvements.any payment for that purpose,the board asserted in its eir,would amount to an unlawful assessment of csu or a gift of public funds.id.at,d.based on these legal assumptions,the board found that mitigation was infeasible and that overriding considerations justified certifying the eir and approving the master plan despite the unmitigated effects.id.at,d.
we concluded the board had abused its discretion in certifying the eir because the finding of infeasibility and statement of overriding considerations depended on erroneous legal assumptions.marina,supra,cal th at,d.prominent among those assumptions was that the campus geographical boundaries defined the extent of the board duty to mitigate.to the contrary,as we explained,ceqa requires a public agency to mitigate or avoid its projects significant effects not just on the agency own property but on the environment pub.resources code,subd.b,italics added,with environment defined for these purposes as the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,italics added.marina,at,d.
the same erroneous assumption had also led the board to find that mitigation was the responsibility of other agencies.marina,cal th at,d.ceqa does permit a lead agency to determine that mitigation measures necessary to avoid a project environmental effects are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have been,or can and should be,adopted by that other agency.pub.resources code,subd.a.however,as we explained,the board shared with other agencies the responsibility for mitigating csumb effects on regional infrastructure,and a lead agency may disclaim responsibility only when the other agency said to have responsibility has exclusive responsibility.marina,at,d,citing ceqa guidelines,subd.c the finding in subdivision a shall not be made if the agency making the finding has concurrent jurisdiction with another agency to deal with identified feasible mitigation measures or alternatives.
having explained that the board duty to mitigate extended beyond the boundaries of the campus,we dismissed as beside the point the board argument that it lack ed the power to construct infrastructure improvements away from campus on land the board did not own and control marina,supra,cal th at,d.certainly,we acknowledged,the board may not enter the land of others to widen roads and lay sewer pipe ceqa gives the board no such power.see pub.resources code,i n mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a project on the environment,a public agency may exercise only those express or implied powers provided by law other than this division.but ceqa does not,we continued,limit a public agency obligation to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects to effects occurring on the agency own property.see pub.resources code,subd.b.ceqa also provides that a ll state agencies shall request in their budgets the funds necessary to protect the environment in relation to problems caused by their activities.thus,we concluded,if the board can not adequately mitigate or avoid csumb environmental effects by performing acts on the campus,then to pay a third party to perform the necessary acts off campus may well represent a feasible alternative.marina,at,d.
c.the marina dictum.
the discussion just quoted led to the dictum we granted review to reexamine.that dictum appears in the following paragraph,which imagines possible limitations of our holding that the board shared with other agencies the responsibility to mitigate the environmental effects of its project.the dictum on which the board relies appears in the sentence set out below in italics 
to be clear,we do not hold that the duty of a public agency to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects pub.resources code,subd.b,combined with the duty to ask the legislature for money to do so,will always give a public agency that is undertaking a project with environmental effects shared responsibility for mitigation measures another agency must implement.some mitigation measures can not be purchased,such as permits that another agency has the sole discretion to grant or refuse.moreover,a state agency power to mitigate its project effects through voluntary mitigation payments is ultimately subject to legislative control if the legislature does not appropriate the money,the power does not exist.for the same reason,however,for the board to disclaim responsibility for making such payments before it has complied with its statutory obligation to ask the legislature for the necessary funds is premature,at the very least.the superior court found no evidence the board had asked the legislature for the funds.in its brief to this court,the board acknowledge s it did not budget for payments it assumed would constitute invalid assessments that assumption,as we have explained,is invalid.marina,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the italicized sentence embodied dictum rather than a principle necessary to our decision that the board had erroneously disclaimed responsibility for mitigation.see manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,d,dictum is the statement of a principle not necessary to the decision.see also marina,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of chin,the discussion is dictum.indeed,our opinion unmistakably identifies the sentence as dictum by describing the argument to which it responded as premature,at the very least.marina,at,d.we called the argument premature because the board had not yet asked the legislature for funding,and premature,at the very least,to indicate the argument might lack merit even if properly presented.
the marina dictum does not justify the board position.
in any event,the marina dictum does not justify the board position that csu may contribute funds for environmental mitigation only through an appropriation designated for that specific purpose,an earmarked appropriation several reasons lead us to this conclusion 
first,to read the marina dictum as saying anything about earmarked appropriations is strained.no such argument was made by the board or addressed in the opinion.neither does the marina dictum offer useful guidance about a public agency power to mitigate the environmental effects of its projects.the dictum most important clause if the legislature does not appropriate the money,the power does not exist id.at,d,is simply an overstatement.in mitigating the effects of its projects,a public agency has access to all of its discretionary powers and not just the power to spend appropriations.pub.resources code.those discretionary powers include such actions as adopting changes to proposed projects,imposing conditions on their approval,adopting plans or ordinances to control a broad class of projects,and choosing alternative projects.see ceqa guidelines,subd.h.moreover,some agencies such as csu enjoy some discretion over the use of appropriations see,csu may use part of general support appropriation for capital projects and access to funds see ante,at fn,d.the board,in its own words,has never claimed that it lacks all discretion to prioritize the use of its funds.
second,the proposition that a state agency may pay mitigation costs only through an appropriation earmarked for that purpose is incorrect.neither ceqa itself,marina,cal th,d,nor any other decision suggests that mitigation costs for a project funded by the legislature can not appropriately be included in the project budget and paid with the funds appropriated for the project.indeed,such a procedure would appear to represent the most natural interpretation of ceqa,which directs that a ll state agencies shall request in their budgets the funds necessary to protect the environment in relation to problems caused by their activities.pub.resources code,county of san diego grossmont cuyamaca community college dist.th,d district incorrectly found in eir that funds appropriated for construction project could not feasibly be used to mitigate project traffic impacts.
furthermore,all but one of the new physical facilities proposed in the eir are to be financed with nonappropriated funds.these facilities include the proposed adobe falls housing,the alvarado campus,the alvarado hotel,the campus conference center and the student union expansion.see ante,at,d.the board power to participate in such projects logically embraces the power to ensure that mitigation costs attributable to those projects are included in the projects budgets,board may use for the payment of the costs of acquisition,construction or completion of any project any funds made available to the board by the state of california or any other funds provided by the board from any source,board has full power and responsibility in the construction and development of any state university campus,and any buildings or other facilities or improvements connected with csu.
third,no provision of ceqa conditions the duty of a state agency to mitigate its projects environmental effects on the legislature grant of an earmarked appropriation.mitigation is the rule each public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so.pub.resources code,subd.b.the legislature has expressly subjected the board decisions concerning campus master plans to the requirements of ceqa,subd.b,including the requirement of mitigation,subd.b.when the legislature has wanted to exempt the board from those requirements,it has done so explicitly.see,concerning adoption by csu and other agencies of land use plans subject to california coastal act,et.no such exception can reasonably be inferred from the statute the marina dictum purported to interpret pub.resources code,see marina,cal th at,d,which simply directs state agencies to include mitigation costs in their budgets.
fourth and finally,the board interpretation of the marina dictum is mistaken because it depends on a legally unsupportable distinction between environmental impacts occurring on the project site and those occurring.ceqa draws no such distinction for purposes of mitigation.instead,ceqa defines the environment as the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project pub.resources code,italics added and mandates that e ach public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so,subd.b,italics added.indeed,this point represents one of marina main holdings.see marina,supra,cal th at,d.in the eir,the board commits to undertake a wide variety of mitigation measures on the sdsu campus,constructing noise barriers,preserving native plant habitats,creating wetlands,and incorporating flow control measures to prevent erosion.if these mitigation measures can be properly funded through the project budget without an earmarked appropriation,then so too can mitigation measures.
the board proposed rule entails unreasonable consequences.
unreasonable consequences would follow from the board proposed rule that payments for mitigation may be funded only with an appropriation earmarked for that purpose,and that without such an appropriation mitigation is infeasible.
first,such a holding would logically apply to all state agencies,thus in effect forcing the legislature to sit as a standing environmental review board to decide on a basis whether state agencies projects will proceed despite unmitigated environmental effects.yet ceqa has never been applied in this manner,and nothing in its language or history suggests it should be so applied.ceqa requires not the legislature but the responsible agency to determine whether and how a project effects can feasibly be mitigated pub.resources code,subd.a,to include mitigation costs in the budget,and if mitigation is infeasible to decide whether the project should nevertheless proceed based on a statement of overriding considerations,subd.b.the board suggests we should treat csu differently than other agencies in this respect because csu has different missions and funding directives than other agencies.but the board has identified no statute or regulation that modifies the requirements of ceqa for projects undertaken by csu.rather,the legislature has declared that the whole of ceqa applies to the board decision to approve the development plan for a campus,subd.b.
second,under the rule the board proposes,if the legislature did not make an earmarked appropriation for mitigating the effects of a particular state project but the responsible state agency nevertheless decided to proceed without mitigation,the cost of addressing that project contribution to cumulative impacts on local infrastructure would fall upon local and regional governmental agencies.marina,supra,cal th at,d.such a rule would impose a financial burden on local and regional agencies,which may not recover fees to mitigate the environmental impacts of state projects from other developers.this is because mitigation fees imposed on a project must be reasonably related and roughly proportional to that project impacts.see,subds.a,b g the mitigation fee act dolan city of tigard,d amend.requires rough proportionality ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d,construing the mitigation fee act in light of dolan ceqa guidelines,subd.a incorporating dolan standard,subd.a b incorporating dolan and ehrlich standards.
third,under the board proposed rule,mitigation would likely be found infeasible for many,if not all,state projects that receive funding,and more such projects would proceed without mitigation pursuant to statements of overriding considerations.because a state agency power to participate in such logically entails the power to ensure that mitigation costs are included in the projects budgets,state agencies can not necessarily expect the legislature to appropriate state funds to mitigate such projects environmental effects.in any event,a decision by this court adopting the board proposed rule could not compel the legislature to make any such appropriation.see mandel myers cal th,separation of powers generally prohibits a court from directly ordering the legislature to enact a specific appropriation.
taken together,the consequences of adopting the board proposed rule that mitigation may be funded only through appropriations for that specific purpose would substantially impair the fundamental statutory directive that e ach public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so.pub.resources code,subd.b.to adopt the proposed rule would also represent a sharp,unwarranted departure from prior decisions recognizing the legislature intended ceqa to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,see mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d,same.we thus decline to adopt it.
the board new arguments.
in support of its finding that mitigation may be funded only through an appr
