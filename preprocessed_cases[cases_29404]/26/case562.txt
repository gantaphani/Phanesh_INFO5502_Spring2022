anika wikol is a child with autism who is eligible for special education and related services under the individuals with disabilities act idea.she resides within the birmingham public school district in birmingham,michigan.at issue in this case are her parents attempts to secure reimbursement from birmingham for anika educational program for the and academic years.
the wikols have appealed what they regard as an inadequate award by the jury.they also seek to recover attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest,all of which the district court denied.in its,birmingham challenges the timeliness of the wikols appeal with respect to all but their claim for attorney fees and costs.for the reasons set forth below,we agree that the wikols appeal was untimely except for these latter items.we accordingly dismiss the bulk of the wikols claims for lack of appellate jurisdiction.with regard to their claim for attorney fees and costs,we vacate the decision of the district court denying such relief and remand for reconsideration.
background 
when anika was approximately years old,her parents enrolled her in the preprimary impaired program in the birmingham public schools.the wikols soon became dissatisfied with the program.they consequently removed anika from the public school system and established a alternative program recommended by the lovaas institute,a organization that specializes in educating children with autism.after approximately three years in the lovaas program,the wikols decided to partially transition anika back into the birmingham public schools.
an individualized education program team comprised of the wikols and members of anika school thus convened,pursuant to the idea,to develop an individualized education program iep for anika.at the meeting,birmingham and the wikols could not agree upon anika educational program because,according to the wikols,birmingham refused to provide anika with an iep that would support her education,and reimburse the wikols for their past expenses in providing anika with the lovaas program.
this impasse led the wikols to request a due process hearing pursuant to f.the due process hearing did not occur,however,because the parties reached a settlement.under the settlement agreement,dated april,birmingham agreed to pay the wikols as reimbursement for necessary educational services actually incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred during the through school years.the agreement further provided that birmingham and the wikols would meet to determine anika iep for the following school years,and that if a lovaas or program were implemented,birmingham would pay of the costs of any such program.despite the settlement for these prior years,disputes continued between the wikols and birmingham regarding reimbursement for the lovaas program in the and school years.
in december of,the wikols again requested a due process hearing to resolve the outstanding reimbursement issues.a local hearing officer was appointed in early,but birmingham objected to the hearing officer jurisdiction and requested that the matter be dismissed.birmingham and the wikols ultimately stipulated to the dismissal of the wikols request for a due process hearing regarding the two school years in question,opting instead to seek judicial resolution of the issues.
the wikols brought suit in may of against birmingham in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.eight months later,the wikols moved for summary judgment,arguing that they were entitled to reimbursement from birmingham for anika lovaas program.the district court granted the wikols motion in part with regard to the school year.it concluded that,pursuant to the settlement agreement,birmingham owed the wikols fifty percent of the costs of the lovaas program,but that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to what constituted those costs.with regard to the school year,the district court denied the wikols motion for summary judgment in its entirety.
the case then proceeded to trial,at the end of which the jury awarded the wikols approximately for costs incurred in providing anika program for the school year.as for the academic year,the jury determined that birmingham educational program had provided anika with a free appropriate public education,and therefore declined to award the wikols any reimbursement for that year.
following the district court entry of judgment on march,the wikols timely moved for the recovery of attorney fees and costs pursuant to,which the district court denied.the wikols appeal from the district court partial denial of their motion for summary judgment,the jury verdict concerning the school year,the district court denial of their motion for attorney fees and costs,and the district court denial of prejudgment interest.birmingham,challenging the timeliness of the wikols appeal as to all issues other than their claim for attorney fees and costs.
ii.analysis 
timeliness of the wikols appeal 
we must determine,as a threshold issue,whether we have jurisdiction to hear the bulk of the issues raised in this appeal.on,birmingham argues that we do not have such jurisdiction because the wikols filed their notice of appeal late,outside of the time limits imposed by rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.
determining the timeliness of the wikol notice of appeal requires an analysis of the interplay between rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure and rules,and of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure provides the generally applicable limitation that a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.a litigant compliance with this mandatory and jurisdictional requirement is of critical importance.wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.
exceptions to the rule exist,however.if a party timely files any one of the six motions enumerated in rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure,other than the one for attorney fees,the time to file an appeal automatically runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.the motion relevant to this case is of course the one for attorney fees,which was filed pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.when a litigant files a rule motion for attorney fees,the time to file a notice of appeal will run from the disposition of that motion if the district court extends the time to appeal under rule.fed.a a iii emphasis added.the plain language of rule thus stipulates that in order for the time to file an appeal to be tolled when a party moves for attorney fees under rule,the district court must affirmatively act pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule,in turn,provides that 
w hen a timely motion for attorney fees is made under rule d,the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and has become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under federal rule of appellate procedure a as a timely motion under rule.
c emphasis added.
rule reference to a timely motion under rule is initially puzzling,given that rule neither mentions the filing of a notice of appeal nor refers back to rule.a number of are necessary to divine rule place in the rule,quagmire.the only part of rule that appears relevant to the timeliness of a notice of appeal is e,which provides that a ny motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than days after the entry of the judgment.if we then look back to rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure,we see that a rule motion to alter or amend the judgment is one of the five enumerated motions that automatically resets the time to file a notice of appeal from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.
we therefore conclude that when a timely motion for attorney fees is filed under rule,and the district court exercises its discretion under rule a a to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal,the motion for attorney fees is given the same effect as a rule motion to amend or alter the judgment,which,pursuant to rule a a,automat
