this case presents the question of whether an educational loan may be partially discharged consistent with a of the bankruptcy code.we conclude that bankruptcy courts may partially discharge student debt pursuant to their equitable authority under a.
background 
on september,appellee dennis saxman sought to discharge several of his student loans in bankruptcy on the ground that paying them off would cause him an undue hardship within the meaning of a.this case concerns two of those loans one held by the united states department of education and a much larger consolidated loan held by appellant educational credit management corporation ecmc.
the bankruptcy court found that saxman would not suffer undue hardship if he was made to repay the to the department of education,but that he would suffer undue hardship if he were held to his ecmc debt of.in support of its finding,the court considered that saxman had a net income of per month,lived a very frugal lifestyle,and had disposable income of about per month.the court found that under the standard repayment plan,the monthly payments of the combined ecmc and department of education loans would total per month,or per month more than his disposable monthly income.the court concluded that saxman,who was years of age at the time of trial,could not reasonably pay off his student loans during his working lifetime.the court added that it felt constrained by united student aid funds taylor in re taylor,cir,to reject ecmc suggestion that the court discharge only the portion of the loan that saxman was unable to pay.
on appeal,the district court vacated the bankruptcy court discharge order and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this court intervening decision in graves myrvang in re myrvang,cir,which the district court interpreted as permitting the partial discharge of student debt.saxman dep t of educ.in re saxman.
appellate jurisdiction 
saxman initially contends that the district court decision to vacate the bankruptcy court order and remand for further proceedings was not a final decision and therefore not appealable.under d,this court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a district court on appeal from a bankruptcy court.because of the unique nature of bankruptcy proceedings,we apply a pragmatic approach to determining finality.vylene,naugles,in re vylene,cir.the factors considered in determining finality include the need to avoid piecemeal litigation judicial efficiency systemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court role as factfinder and whether further delay would cause either party irreparable harm.knupfer lindblade in re dyer,wl,cir,scovis henrichsen in re scovis,cir in re vylene,at.
in north slope borough barstow in re markair,cir,we summarized the law as follows 
if the matters on remand concern primarily factual issues about which there is no dispute,and the appeal concerns primarily a question of law,then the policies of judicial efficiency and finality are best served by our resolving the question now.on the other hand,if the district court remands for further factual findings related to a central issue raised on appeal,the district court decision is usually not final.even when the remand involves factfinding on a central issue,we may nonetheless exercise jurisdiction if that issue is legal in nature and its resolution either could dispose of the case or proceedings and obviate the need for factfinding or would materially aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition on remand.

in the present case,the district court remanded for further proceedings consistent with myrvang,specifically instructing the bankruptcy court to abandon its approach and to calculate the portion of the ecmc loan that saxman could pay without causing him an undue hardship.in short,the remand order only requires the bankruptcy court to calculate how much saxman could reasonably pay per month it does not require anything beyond the task of computing the partial discharge of saxman loan.
as noted in in re fox,cir,if all that remains to do on remand is a purely mechanical or computational task,such that the proceedings on remand are highly unlikely to generate a new appeal or to affect the issue that the disappointed party wants to raise on appeal,then immediately deciding the issue will save time without raising the spectre of piecemeal appeals.id.at.in such circumstances,the decision of the district court is final for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.id.
this appeal also presents an independent question of law.see zolg kelly in re kelly,cir.this case is therefore distinguishable from those cases in which we declined jurisdiction because the district court remand order required factual development to clarify a central legal issue.see walthall united states,cir declining jurisdiction because district court remanded for a factual determination of whether damages and attorneys fees should be awarded king stanton in re stanton,cir declining jurisdiction because the bap remanded for factual development of issues involved in a counterclaim that was improperly dismissed by the bankruptcy court.in those cases,we declined jurisdiction on the theory that we would be faced with an inadequate factual record,making it difficult to identify the controlling legal issues.id.however,in this case,the resolution of the legal issue is entirely independent of the factual issues,which,in any event,are admitted as true and not in dispute.see crevier welfare pension fund for local in re crevier,cir asserting jurisdiction where the facts in the complaint are admitted as true and where no factual issues are pending that would impede the review of the legal issues turgeon victoria station in re victoria station,cir similar.
because this appeal concerns a question of law and the remand concerns only the calculation of a partial discharge,we conclude that the policies of judicial efficiency and finality weigh in favor of our resolving the question now.demarah united states in re demarah,cir if the matters on remand concern primarily factual issues about which there is no dispute,and the appeal concerns primarily a question of law,then the policies of judicial efficiency and finality are best served by our resolving the question now.quoting in re kelly,at.

discussion 
an educational loan is dischargeable in bankruptcy if excepting such debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.a rifino united states in re rifino,cir.to determine if excepting student debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship,we apply the test first enunciated by the second circuit in brunner new york state higher education services in re brunner,cir.united student aid funds,pena in re pena,cir.under the brunner test,the debtor must prove that she can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.id.at in re brunner,at.
the bankruptcy court concluded that saxman had satisfied the brunner factors.on appeal to the district court,ecmc raised the single contention that the bankruptcy court had erred in finding that saxman could not maintain a minimal standard of living if made to repay the ecmc loan.the district court never reached this question.instead,the court,citing our intervening decision in myrvang,remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court with instructions to determine how much of the ecm
