after beginning a job at appellee george washington university,appellant cynthia carter received three promotions over five years while earning a master degree and pursuing a.from onward,carter worked as director of reunions and events in the alumni relations office.according to carter,because she spoke out about what she considered discriminatory treatment within that office,her relationship with michael worth,gw vice president for development and alumni affairs,began deteriorating.
in and,carter applied for the positions of executive director of alumni relations,director of development at mount vernon college a former women college now owned by gw,and director of corporate and foundation relations.she obtained none of these promotions.carter then resigned,taking a job at howard university.
following the second promotion denial,carter filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission,which she later amended to cover the third denial.when the eeoc chose not to pursue the complaint,carter sued gw in the united states district court for the district of columbia,raising claims based on title vii of the civil rights act of,the age discrimination in employment act of adea,and common law.specifically,she claimed race discrimination regarding all three promotion denials,age discrimination regarding the first two denials,retaliation regarding the last two denials,retaliation regarding an adverse evaluation,constructive discharge,and breach of contract.
despite what the district court termed ample opportunity to conduct discovery,carter trial counsel she is now represented by different counsel deposed no witnesses,served no interrogatories,and requested no admissions.carter george washington,d,carter george washington,may.at the very end of the discovery period,carter counsel did ask gw to produce certain documents,but because he failed to comply with the federal rules of civil procedure in submitting this request,discovery ended and plaintiff had taken no discovery whatsoever.carter,may.gw then moved for summary judgment.as part of her opposition,carter attached her own affidavit,but submitted no sworn statements from any one else.claiming that carter affidavit included inadmissible hearsay,speculation and conclusions,gw moved to strike numerous paragraphs.though the district court did not address gw motion to strike,it granted gw motion for summary judgment on all counts without referring to carter hearsay statements.see d at.the district court later denied carter motion for reconsideration.carter george washington.
before addressing the merits of carter appeal,we consider gw motion in this court to strike several of carter exhibits and those parts of her opening brief that reference them.specifically,gw argues that certain pages from carter deposition and the university personnel manual were never presented to the district court and thus can not be part of the record on appeal.conceding that her lawyer failed to file these documents in opposition to gw motion for summary judgment,carter insists that counsel did file them as attachments to her motion for reconsideration.gw responds that even were this true,carter may not have a second bite at the apple by including in her motion for reconsideration evidence which she could have submitted to the district court prior to summary judgment.
we need not consider gw latter argument,for our review of the district court docket sheet and file convinces us that carter trial counsel never filed the disputed documents as attachments to the motion for reconsideration,although the motion itself made reference to them.this circuit will not normally consider evidence that a party never presented to the district court,willoughby,see.a describing the composition of the record on appeal.to be sure,in eureka investment chicago title insurance,we treated as part of the record an exhibit never formally moved into evidence in the district court,but we did so because all parties and the district court treated the exhibit as evidence.in this case,by contrast,gw objected to the documents from the first possible moment,and the district court never mentioned them in its denial of carter motion for reconsideration,carter.
we therefore grant gw motion to strike and will disregard the disputed exhibits in the remainder of this opinion.
this brings us,then,to carter challenges to the district court entry of summary judgment for gw.as usual,we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to carter and drawing all reasonable inferences accordingly,we conclude that no reasonable jury could reach a verdict in carter favor.see holbrook reno,see also anderson liberty lobby,d.
because carter never claimed in the district court,as she does here,that the record contains direct evidence of discrimination,she has waived this argument.see howard,finding argument waived when not raised below.we will therefore evaluate her claims under the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.under mcdonnell douglas,in order to establish a prima facie case for a discrimination claim,the plaintiff must show that she belongs to a protected class she applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants despite her qualifications,she was rejected and after her rejection,the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of her qualifications.mcdonnell douglas,at.for a retaliation claim,the plaintiff must show that she engaged in a statutorily protected activity she suffered an adverse employment action and there is a causal connection between the two.taylor small.where,as here,the plaintiff claims that the retaliation took the form of a failure to hire,the plaintiff must also show that she applied for an available job and that she was qualified for that position.morgan fed.home loan mortg.
if the plaintiff satisfies her prima facie case,then the employer must produce admissible evidence that,if believed,would establish that its action was motivated by a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason.teneyck omni shoreham hotel.once the employer has met this burden of production,the framework disappears,and a court reviewing summary judgment looks to whether a reasonable jury could infer intentional discrimination or retaliation from all the evidence,including the plaintiff prima facie case any evidence the plaintiff presents to attack the employer proffered explanation for its action and any further evidence of discrimination that may be available to the plaintiff such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer.waterhouse district of columbia,quoting aka washington hosp,en banc internal quotation marks omitted see also kidd district of columbia.
because the mcdonnell douglas framework governs all of carter title vii,adea,and claims,hall giant food,applying framework to adea claims berger iron workers reinforced rodmen local,applying framework to claims,we shall apply it to each of her three promotion denials in turn.
executive director of alumni relations 
when gw executive director of alumni relations resigned in,carter applied for the position along with many other candidates.michael worth,vice president for development and alumni affairs,appointed a search committee to review applications,interview candidates,and then recommend at least three finalists to him for the final decision.joe hall,associate vice president for university development,served as the nonvoting committee chair the committee also had four alumni and five administrators,including two african americans.the committee narrowed the field and interviewed only five candidates carter,two white men under age forty,and two white women.it recommended only the four white candidates to worth,who ultimately picked one of the men,keith betts.betts had recently received a in higher education administration and,like carter,had worked as a director in the alumni relations office since.he had started working there a few months after carter and occupied a lower salary grade.
according to joe hall,the committee decided against recommending carter for several reasons,including poor interviewing skills and lack of qualifications.most committee members ranked her last.during her deposition carter testified that a few weeks after the interview,she sought out an committee member for advice,and that member suggested that she adopt a new approach to interviews.
carter filed her complaint with the eeoc more than days after gw decision to select betts and more than days after learning that the committee had declined to send her name forward to worth.asserting that title vii requires the filing of complaints within days of the time the employee learns of the challenged employment action,gw argues that carter claims are untimely.but a ii a provides that employees have up to days to file where a worksharing agreement exists between the eeoc and a local fair employment practices agency.since the eeoc had such an agreement with the office of human rights at the time of carter complaint,see pl.ex,vol,tab,carter had up to days to file with the commission.by any count,she met this deadline,thus preserving her right to sue.
as gw concedes,carter has established a prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas for both race and age discrimination.an african american over forty,carter belongs to two protected classes she possessed the qualifications identified as necessary for the position in gw job description and the committee rejected her while advancing four other applicants.to survive summary judgment,however,she must also present evidence to rebut gw proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason that she interviewed poorly.
we review subjective considerations like gw given reason with caution,since employers can easily use such criteria to mask discrimination.see aka washington hosp,en banc.in aka,for example,the employer offered the plaintiff lack of enthusiasm as a basis for the decision not to hire,but the plaintiff claimed that he expressed enthusiasm at his interview and introduced corroborating evidence suggesting high motivation.id.at.specifically,aka presented evidence that he had volunteered at the washington hospital center in hopes of getting hired,that he had applied for numerous other jobs at the hospital,and that in a related hiring dispute an arbitrator had described him as highly intelligent and motivated.id.at.based on this evidence,we found that a reasonable jury could disbelieve the employer proffered reason for refusing to hire aka.id.at.
carter situation differs quite significantly from aka.she neither claimed that her interview went well nor offered a sufficiently concrete description of her interview from which we might infer that it did.indeed,to rebut gw proffered reason,she offers only one admissible piece of evidence the affidavit of graeme baxter,executive dean of gw mount vernon campus,which described carter as seeming very professional in an interview conducted several months later for a different job.in combination with other evidence,this fact might well prove useful for rebutting gw reason,as did aka evidence that an arbitrator thought highly of him.standing alone,however,the affidavit falls far short,for we can not see how a reasonable jury could use a single positive description of carter behavior during a job interview to infer that she interviewed well during a different interview conducted by different months earlier.
in her affidavit,carter states that while two of the other candidates told her that the committee asked them only five or six questions,the committee asked her around nineteen questions.we have no need to consider whether such evidence could counter gw proffered nondiscriminatory reason,however,because carter trial counsel failed to depose any of the candidates or committee members,and we can not consider inadmissible hearsay evidence presented by one party where,as here,the other party objected and moved to strike.commercial drapery contractors,united states,see also.e.
in short,carter presents no admissible evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that gw claim that she interviewed poorly was pretextual.given this,we have no need to address whether she can rebut gw second nondiscriminatory the committee found her less qualified than other candidates.
finally,we note that carter has offered very little other evidence that the committee might harbor discriminatory animus.while she makes factual allegations which,if true,might suggest discriminatory intent on the part of michael worth,he was not a at the committee level,nor does carter suggest that he exercised discriminatory animus in selecting the committee members.indeed,responding to gw specific interrogatories,carter named none of the committee voting members as discriminatory actors she named only keith betts,joe hall,and michael worth.because no reasonable jury could find sufficient evidence to infer intentional discrimination from the evidence before us,the district court correctly granted summary judgment to gw on carter race and age discrimination claims related to this promotion denial.
director of development 
in the spring of,carter applied for the position of director of development at gw recently absorbed mount vernon campus.gw sought to hire a director who would work with baxter to identify,cultivate,and solicit major gifts.the job description called for a bachelor degree,with a master degree preferred,and a minimum six years of fundraising experience.baxter and hall interviewed carter and two other applicants,including sarah morgan.a white woman,morgan worked as gw associate director of development for major gifts and had at least nine years of experience in fundraising,including a year spent working at a women college.when baxter identified morgan as the best candidate,hall agreed to hire her.according to baxter,she selected morgan because of morgan experience managing campaigns and working at a women college.carter was not a viable candidate,baxter concluded,because she had no pertinent experience working with potential major donors,and had never directed a campaign of any size,let alone a major campaign for a college or university.no evidence suggests that baxter knew of carter prior complaints about discrimination.
carter alleges that gw rejected her for this promotion due to her race and age,and in retaliation for her allegations that she had experienced discrimination in her earlier promotion denial.the district court found that carter had not established a prima facie case for these claims because she failed to show that she and morgan were similarly qualified for the position.d at.to make out a prima facie case in this circuit,however,a plaintiff need not show that she is as qualified as the successful applicant,only that she is qualified relative to the entire pool from which applications are welcome.mitchell baldrige.we need not determine whether carter would meet the prima facie requirements for qualifications under the mitchell standard,however,for she has failed to present evidence from which a reasonable could infer that gw proffered reason for hiring morgan over carter was pretextual.see morgan,at not addressing whether plaintiff met prima facie requirements where plaintiff could not rebut legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.nor,for the same reason,need we address whether carter has made out a prima facie case for retaliation.if she has failed to provide evidence which could lead a jury to doubt gw legitimate nondiscriminatory it hired morgan because she was the better carter can not survive
