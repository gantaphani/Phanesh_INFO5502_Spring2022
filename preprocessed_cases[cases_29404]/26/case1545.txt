procedural and factual history 
appellant employment with the district.
the district hired appellant to teach sociology pursuant to consecutive temporary employment contracts.her employment was under the auspices of education code section which enables a community college district to employ a temporary teacher on a perennial basis to work not more than percent of a assignment for regular employees the district considers a teaching load in sociology to be units per semester.appellant was assigned to teach nine classroom units in the fall,the spring,the fall,the fall,and the spring,which the district considered a percent load.in the spring,she was assigned to teach six classroom units,which the district considered less than a percent load.in addition to appellant assigned classroom schedule,she supervised work experience students as follows one in the fall,three in the spring,one in the fall,three in the fall,and seven in the spring.
work experience classes.
the work experience classes allow a student to receive one to four units for working in a job related to the student particular field of study.students enroll through the regular class registration process.a teacher supervises these students,confers with their supervisors,and gives them a final grade.the teachers are paid a stipend,up to three hours per student.as a matter of practice,the district does not count a teacher work experience assignments in calculating either a or percent temporary teacher load.
appellant petition for writ of mandate and this appeal.
on june,appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate with the superior court to compel the district to reclassify her as a contract or regular employee on the grounds that her work experience assignments,when coupled with her teaching load,caused her to exceed percent of,triggering her eligibility for tenure pursuant to sections,and 
in its minute order denying appellant writ of mandate,the trial court cited balasubramanian,deciding that case states that under education code section,any person who is employed to teach community college classes for not more than percent of the hours per week considered a assignment shall be classified as a temporary employee under section.nothing in section says that a temporary employee who exceeds the percent limit must be reclassified as a contract employee.the trial court did not reach the second issue presented by appellant writ,which is whether her work experience assignments caused her to exceed percent of.
this timely appeal followed.
upon petition,we allowed community college council of the california federation of teachers,the peralta federation of teachers,aft local,afl cio,and the faculty association of the california community colleges to file a joint amici curiae brief on appellant behalf.

discussion 
reclassification by operation of law.
whether a temporary community college teacher who exceeds percent of is entitled to reclassification is a legal issue.therefore,we exercise our independent judgment.
in broaching this issue,we are confronted with a split of authority.while balasubramanian holds that a temporary employee who exceeds percent of is not entitled to automatic reclassification balasubramanian,supra,th at,d,kalina san mateo community college dist.d.kalina implicitly holds the opposite.
the district urges us to reject kalina,and to follow the lead of the fourth district in balasubramanian.first,the district contends that balasubramanian considered and correctly applied the applicable precedents and statutes.second,the district maintains that the cases cited by appellant and,ostensibly,the amici curiae parties are no longer controlling because they predate the statutory changes to the education code.third,the district argues that kalina is distinguishable because the teacher in that case was employed or virtually.
we are not persuaded by the district arguments,and conclude that kalina was properly decided.for reasons we discuss below,we hold that a temporary community college teacher who exceeds percent of is entitled to reclassification by operation of law.
kalina,not balasubramanian,is consistent with the applicable law.
the education code governs the rights and classification of a community college teacher.the governing board of a community college district shall employ each academic employee as a contract employee,regular employee,or temporary employee.a contract employee is probationary,and a regular employee is permanent.while a community college may terminate a temporary employee at its discretion,a contract or regular employee may be terminated only for statutorily specified cause,and only after being provided with notice and a hearing before termination.balen peralta junior college dist.cal d,balen.
as demonstrated above,teacher rights are dictated by classification.not surprisingly,over the last century teachers have litigated classification issues in order to preserve these rights.thus,before analyzing whether kalina or balasubramanian correctly interpreted the education code,we survey past precedent to shape our perspective on the current classification system.
we begin with grigsby king cal,grigsby.in grigsby,our supreme court held that a school district was required by the teachers tenure act to classify a teacher as a permanent employee because she completed two years of successful work.the court noted that the school board power to classify a teacher was modified and limited by the provisions of political code section subdivisions c,d,and e.it is therein provided that the board shall classify as substitutes only persons employed for less than a school year to take the places of absent regular teachers that the board shall classify as probationary teachers only those persons employed for the school year and who have not been classified as permanent.and subdivision e,under attack here,compels the boards in all classify as permanent all successful,teachers,and to make its decision as to whether or not the teacher is a successful one at the end of a period.it limits the power of the board to act otherwise.grigsby,at.the teaching of grigsby is boards lacked the power in to classify teachers outside of the strict classification boundaries dictated by the political code.
soon thereafter,la shells hench,la shells held that a teacher who successfully taught for two years was entitled to be classified as permanent even though the school board did not make the reclassification official.this lack of the board to act,however,does not prevent the operation of the law in making such classification,and as the petitioner,under the law,was entitled to such classification,she must be so considered as classified,even though the board of trustees has failed to act,and at all times proceeded to enter into contracts purporting to limit the term of employment from year to year.to hold otherwise would be to decide that the provisions of the teachers tenure act may be evaded by the expedient of using contracts reading for a yearly employment,and thus giving the board of trustees the authority to dispense with the services of a teacher,even though section of the political code prohibits dismissal of a teacher,other than for cause,and requires that notice shall be given to the teacher,and a hearing had.id.at,italics added.the la shells court supported this holding by citing grigsby.in concluding that reclassification occurred by operation of law,the la shells court merely placed a label on the principle that a teacher entitlement to reclassification springs from the application of statutory language to completed teaching assignments.
numerous cases that followed grigsby and la shells were decided in a consistent manner.in cullen board of education,that court noted the petitioner tenure as a permanent teacher became fixed by operation of law.in chambers davis,the court concluded that a teacher was automatically entitled by operation of law to classification as a permanent teacher.continuing that tradition,abraham sims cal d,held that service for the requisite period by a teacher automatically effects the classification and nothing more is required to accomplish it,and la rue board of trustees d,determined that when statutory requisites were met,teachers attained by operation of law the classification of permanent employees of the school district.decades later,vittal long beach unified sch.dist.d,stated the provisions for permanent status are contained in the education code and if they have been met the attainment of permanent status is automatic.no application need be made,nor is any affirmative action on the part of the school board necessary.citations.in campbell cal d,the court held that teachers required to teach for the minimum school day prescribed by the code constituted them employees.finally,kamin governing board d.kamin,stated that t he matter of classification of teachers as probationary or permanent is determined by state law and then held that the plaintiff,a teacher meeting the statutory prerequisites for permanent employment status,was entitled to reclassification.
having surveyed this body of law,we come to the conclusion that educational entities have no power to classify teachers outside the applicable statutory bounds,and that reclassification can occur by operation of law.furthermore,b ecause the temporary classification is not guaranteed procedural due process by statute,it is narrowly defined by the legislature,and should be strictly interpreted.balen,supra,cal d at.with these principles firmly in mind,we turn to the relevant statutes pertaining to temporary employees and the cases that interpret the applicable statutory language.
section permits a community college district to employ a teacher as a temporary faculty member.however,subdivision b of that section provides no person shall be so employed by any one district under this section for more than two semesters or three quarters within any period of three consecutive years.section permits a community college district to employ a teacher for percent of a assignment.the statutes do not establish what happens if a temporary teacher exceeds percent of.
for the answer to that specific question,we examine a group of includes balasubramanian and appeals by temporary teachers seeking to be reclassified on the theory that their assignments caused them to exceed percent of.the other cases are rooney san diego community college dist.d.rooney,saraceno anza community college dist.d.saraceno,and mcguire governing board d.mcguire 
in kalina,the teacher was first employed by respondent college district as a temporary employee to teach units in the fall semester.she was subsequently employed as a temporary employee for the spring semester as well as the fall and spring semesters of the school year,teaching units per semester,for the purpose of replacing instructors on leave.although kalina was hired to teach units in the fall of the school year,respondent college district offered her only a teaching assignment for the spring of that year,thus restricting her to percent or less of a teaching assignment in an apparent attempt to prevent her from acquiring vested rights as a probationary employee under section.kalina,supra,d at.
kalina filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to be reclassified as a probationary employee.the trial court denied the petition.kalina appealed,arguing that section mandated reclassification.the kalina court reversed,effectively reclassifying the plaintiff as a probationary employee by operation of law.the court stated our holding is in harmony with the general policy of the teacher classification system to afford teachers some measure of employment security.citation.while it is also the policy of the law authorizing temporary employment of teachers to permit flexibility in teacher assignments and to prevent overstaffing citations,our holding does not in any meaningful way impair such flexibility,for,under section authorizing the indefinite hiring of temporary employees for percent or less of assignments,community college districts retain considerable control over the hiring of temporary and probationary staff.we find no merit in respondents argument that appellant employment contract providing that she would at all times be classified as a temporary employee should be deemed controlling.both statutory and case law prohibit the waiver of benefits afforded by the tenure law.citations.kalina,supra,d at,fn.omitted.kalina did not expressly state that the plaintiff was reclassified by operation of law.undeniably,however,that is the logical import of the decision.
next came rooney,saraceno,and mcguire.none of the teachers in those three cases was successful on appeal.however,they lost only because they had not in fact exceeded percent of.by entertaining the issue,these cases recognized that reclassification of a percent temporary employee occurs by operation of law,and were decided consistent with kalina.
then,in,the fourth district decided balasubramanian.in that case,the teacher claimed that she exceeded percent of,entitling her to be reclassified as a contract employee.the fourth district disagreed,stating preliminarily,we note balasubramanian erroneously assumes she automatically attains contract status once she exceeds the percent fte limit of section.she cites no statutory authority for her assumption and we have found none the provisions under which she was employed were imposed n otwithstanding any other provision of law,subd.a.having been employed to teach not more than percent fte under section,she can not now claim the rights of other temporary employees unrestricted by the percent fte limit.nothing in the record before us shows the terms of balasubramanian employment required her to fill a position of a regular employee absent from service,to teach temporary classes for a specified amount of time or to teach classes due to higher student enrollment.in contrast to those provisions mandating contract status upon reemployment or continuation of particular duties,section provides no such consequence.the legislature easily could have expressly stated that a temporary employee who exceeds the percent fte limit must be reclassified as a contract employee.however,legislative silence in this statutory labyrinth,remarkable for its attention to minutia,connotes the legislature intent not to provide for a rigid,mechanically applied sanction.citation.balasubramanian,supra,th at,d.
after reviewing these cases,we conclude that kalina rather than balasubramanian was correctly decided.
the effect of balasubramanian is to allow a community college district to classify an employee who exceeds percent of as temporary even though not expressly permitted by statute.we conclude that balasubramanian violates the admonition in balen,that temporary employee statutes should be strictly construed.in other words,we conclude that an employee should not be classified as temporary unless that classification is specifically authorized.if the statutes are otherwise silent,then the catchall provision in section controls.section provides in relevant part governing boards of community college districts shall classify as contract employees,those faculty members who have not been classified as regular employees or as temporary employees.as we read the statutes,if they do not provide for a temporary or regular classification,a community college district has but one choice,which is to classify a teacher as a contract employee.kalina,in contrast to balasubramanian,is consistent with balen,and with the general proposition that an educational entity lacks the power to classify outside statutory boundaries.
the district invites us to adopt the reasoning in balasubramanian.we decline this invitation.
to begin,balasubramanian did not analyze or even cite kalina,nor did it discuss the body of law pertaining to reclassification of teachers by operation of law.in its analysis of whether the plaintiff was entitled to contract status if she exceeded percent of,balasubramanian cited haase san diego community college dist.d.haase mcguire,supra,d.balen,supra,cal d,rooney,supra,d.california teachers pasadena unified sch.dist.d.california teachers santa barbara federation of teachers santa barbara high sch.dist.d.santa barbara fed.of teachers and peralta federation of teachers peralta community college dist.cal d,peralta.most of these cases implicitly acknowledge that reclassification occurs by operation of law.none of them negates the possibility.see haase,supra,d at.analyzing the consequences of a community college district failure to annually reclassify a teacher as temporary mcguire,supra,d.citing to kalina,but deciding against the teacher because he did not demonstrate that he taught more than percent of fulltime balen,supra,cal d,concluding that a teacher was entitled to be classified as probationary because he met statutory prerequisites rooney,supra,d.determining that a teacher was not entitled to reclassification because he did not exceed percent of california teachers,supra,d.considering whether teachers obtained probationary status santa barbara fed.of teachers,supra,d.recognizing that under particular facts the statutory scheme can compel reclassification peralta,supra,cal d,ordering classification of teachers as probationary certificated employees.however,balasubramanian cited these cases only to support statements about the nature and purpose of temporary employees and the classification system.balasubramanian did not analyze whether the rights of teachers to reclassification by operation of law,as applied in kalina,have been or should be abrogated in any respect.
furthermore,balasubramanian failed to explain how a teacher who exceeds percent of can be classified as temporary.rather,balasubramanian cited rooney to support the following statement by its express terms,section classifies balasubramanian as a temporary employee who is prohibited from becoming a contract employee.balasubramanian,supra,th at,d.but neither rooney nor section support this assertion.rooney simply stated in view of the fact rooney was employed by the district for the school year to teach adult or community college classes for not more than percent of the hours per week considered a assignment for regular employees having comparable duties,he was properly classified as a temporary employee.rooney,supra,d at.although section provides that a person who is employed not more than percent of the hours per week considered a assignment shall be classified as a temporary employee,and shall not become a contract employee under section,peralta teaches that the restriction in the second clause only pertains to the initial classification,not a subsequent classification.peralta,dealing with section containing the relevant predecessor language of current section,stated the fourth paragraph of section imposes two restrictions on giving other than temporary status to persons employed to teach community college classes only percent of full time the teacher shall be classified as a temporary employee,and shall not become a probationary employee under the provisions of section.the second restriction would be superfluous if the first were not construed to apply only to initial classification and not to preclude an otherwise authorized subsequent change from temporary status.peralta,supra,cal d at.in any event,the restriction in section does not by its terms apply to employees teaching in excess of percent of.
next,balasubramanian opined that the plaintiff could not claim the rights of other temporary employees unrestricted by the percent fte limit balasubramanian,supra,th at,d because she was hired under section.however,balasubramanian did not cite any case authority for this proposition.as indicated in kalina,academic employees can not waive their statutory rights,which coincides with the observation in la shells that the applicable statutory scheme can not be evaded by the expedient use of employment contracts.balasubramanian pointed to the fact that certain statutes mandate contract status upon reemployment,but that section does not.however,the silence of section on this issue is of no moment.ever since grigsby,which is bolstered by balen in connection with temporary employees,the question is whether a district has the power to impose a certain classification.if not,then the employee must be reclassified.
at the end of its analysis,balasubramanian states that b ecause section does not compel reclassification,balasubramanian has no legally based expectation of such reclassification and is not entitled to contract employee status.balasubramanian,supra,th at,d.balasubramanian cited to santa barbara fed.of teachers as supporting authority,but that case stated only that the mere continuity of employment by a temporary or substitute teacher in a position regularly held by a probationary or permanent teacher does not,by itself,give rise to tenured status.citation.santa barbara fed.of teachers,supra,d at.we agree with the cited language.however,it compels no particular result.reclassification arises from statute,not an employee expectations.
finally,we note that there was no need for balasubramanian to hold that the plaintiff was ineligible for reclassification even if she did in fact teach more than percent of.in the second part of its opinion,the fourth district concluded that the plaintiff fell under section,subdivision b,which states that s ervice as a substitute on a basis shall not be used for purposes of calculating eligibility for contract or regular status.if the plaintiff did not exceed percent of,then the reclassification issue was moot.
kalina has not been superseded by statute.
the district suggestion that the cases cited by appellant in support of her reclassification argument are no longer controlling due to statutory changes in lacks merit.the only change in the current statutes since kalina was decided is that the percent language,which used to be in the last paragraph of section,was relocated to section,subdivision a.the substance of the statutory language has not changed.moreover,even if the substance had changed,the general principle of reclassification would apply.if a temporary employee was not properly classified as temporary,he or she would be entitled to be reclassified as a contract employee.see kamin,supra,d at.the matter of classification of teachers as probationary or permanent is determined by state law.citation.if statutory requirements are met,a teacher rights are automatically vested independently of any action by the governing board.citations.finally,as appellant noted in her reply brief,the district attempt to support its statutory change argument necessarily fails because it cites to sections,which are tenure statutes that have no bearing on our analysis.
kalina is not distinguishable.
finally,the district attempt to distinguish kalina lacks merit.whether kalina involved a teacher who was employed or virtually is irrelevant.the district appears to suggest,for example,that kalina can not be applied to a
