opinion of the court 
this appeal concerns the property rights created by the pennsylvania veterans preference act vpa.section a of the vpa provides that a veteran possessing the requisite qualifications shall be given a preference in the assignment of public jobs.after working as a substitute teacher in the washington school district,plaintiff james gikas,who had received an honorable discharge from both the army and the navy,sought employment in the district as a social studies teacher.on two occasions,were hired into the district social studies department instead of gikas,who would have qualified for a preference over the applicants if it were shown that he possessed the requisite qualifications.gikas asserts that the district violated his substantive due process rights by denying him the preference and by not hiring him when a position became available in the social studies department in.
gikas also claims that his procedural due process rights were violated because the district failed to define the requisite qualifications for the positions and to publish those requirements so that applicant veterans would know what was required in advance of applying for the positions.by not defining in advance the requisite qualifications,gikas maintains,the district had free rein to ignore the veterans preference.in his submission,the district could define requisite qualifications post hoc as those of the most qualified applicant so that a veteran would be employed only if he was the most qualified,essentially eviscerating any preference.gikas argues that a was meant to be a counterpart to b of the vpa,which creates a preference in the assignment of public jobs when a civil service exam is administered if an applicant veteran passes the civil service exam,he is entitled to the position even if his name does not stand highest on the eligible or promotional list.b.thus,gikas argues that the district must provide in advance of the hiring process an objective definition of requisite qualifications to ensure that applicant veterans are actually given the preference to which they are entitled under the act.
the district court dismissed the procedural due process claim because gikas had fail ed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the substantive due process claim because there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the defendants were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.b fed.c.we too conclude that gikas has alleged neither a substantive nor a procedural due process violation.while the veterans preference contained in a is a property interest subject to procedural due process protection,not all property interests worthy of procedural due process protection are protected by the concept of substantive due process.reich beharry,cir.rather,a property interest must be fundamental under the united states constitution to be subject to substantive due process protection.in our view,the preference contained in a is not sufficiently fundamental to qualify as a property interest deserving substantive due process protection.
moreover,we conclude that procedural due process does not require the district to publish the definition of requisite qualifications for a position in advance of the hiring process.the property interest at issue here is not in the teaching position itself,but in the preference.as such,the district is not required to help applicant veterans become qualified for the job rather it is required to give those applicants a preference only if they are independently qualified.requiring the publication in advance of the requisite qualifications for a position is simply too attenuated from the specific protected property interest in the preference to be required by procedural due process.in sum,gikas has not established a federal constitutional violation,hence we are constrained to affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,james gikas,a veteran of both the army and the navy who is certified to teach school in pennsylvania,applied for a teaching position in the washington school district and was hired as a substitute teacher.in june,a teaching position became available in the social studies department and the district hired cyril walther,a substitute teacher who had served an entire year in the position to be filled,teaching the same material required for the position.when gikas asked why he was passed over for the position,he was told that he did not have enough experience as a substitute teacher.gikas objected because he had not been informed that working full time as opposed to part time as a substitute teacher would affect his ability to be hired as a teacher.the school board represented that it would inform gikas of future openings in his area of certification and would delineate the minimum qualifications for such openings.
in the summer of,another teaching position became available in the district social studies department.william watson,the district high school principal,and ronald junko,the district assistant high school principal,chose eight candidates,including gikas,to interview for the position based on the following criteria the appearance of the application extracurricular activities grade point average and proximity of his or her residence.during the interview,watson and junko evaluated the applicants based on four general criteria those criteria were further divided into subsets.the criteria were 
instruction 
a teaching techniques learning 
b planning 
c managing students 
d motivating students 
professional development and fit with needs 
a preparation 
b experience 
c professional growth responsibility 
d philosophy goals 
e coaching sponsoring 
relationships 
b parents community 
a standard district measure.
the applicants were given a score in each area based on their answers to a standardized series of questions.
based on this score,gikas ranked sixth out of the eight candidates,and he was not offered the teaching position.watson testified that gikas provided only generic responses to questions related to teaching techniques,planning,managing and motivating students,and that he did not demonstrate an understanding of the district demographics or philosophies.a,mark albertina,who scored the highest in the interview evaluation,was hired.
gikas brought suit,pursuant to,in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania against the washington school district,the washington board of school directors and nine members of the washington school board individually,seeking appointment to a teaching position with the district,with back pay and benefits,based on alleged substantive and procedural due process violations pursuant to the magistrates act,b,and the local rules for magistrates,this case was heard before magistrate judge francis caiazza.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation proposing the dismissal of the procedural due process claim,pursuant to fed.b,which the district court adopted.the magistrate judge later filed a report and recommendation suggesting that the district court grant the defendants motion for summary judgment on the substantive due process claim.the district court issued an order adopting the recommendations of the magistrate judge.gikas timely appealed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over both the order dismissing the procedural due process claim and the order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment.see united states occidental chemical,cir we exercise plenary review of a grant of a motion to dismiss,accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.pacitti macy,cir we exercise plenary review over a grant of summary judgment and apply the same legal standard used by the district court.
gikas argues that the district deprived him of a property interest protected by substantive due process when it hired albertina,a,to fill the teaching position in the social studies department.in particular,gikas maintains that because he was one of eight individuals selected to be interviewed for the position,he met the requisite qualifications for the job,and as a result,he was entitled to a preference under a of the pennsylvania veterans preference act section of the vpa provides 
a service.whenever any soldier possesses the requisite qualifications and is eligible to appointment to or promotion in a public position,where no such civil service examination is required,the appointing power in making an appointment or promotion to a public position shall give preference to such soldier.
b name on civil service list.whenever any soldier possesses the requisite qualifications,and his name appears on any eligible or promotional list,certified or furnished as the result of any such civil service examination,the appointing or promoting power in making an appointment or promotion to a public position shall give preference to such soldier,notwithstanding,that his name does not stand highest on the eligible or promotional list.emphasis added 
pursuant to our caselaw,a plaintiff must establish as a threshold matter that he has a protected property interest to which the fourteenth amendment due process protection applies.nicholas.state,cir quoting woodwind estates,gretkowski,cir.gikas maintains that the veterans preference in a is a property right which entitles him to substantive due process protection.this contention is based primarily on our decision in carter city of philadelphia,cir,in which we stated that b of the veterans preference act confers a constitutionally protected property right upon the plaintiff.gikas argues that a of the vpa creates essentially the same property interest as b,establishing the same preference where there is no civil service exam,and that we must therefore conclude that a creates a property interest protected by substantive due process.
gikas misunderstands the import of carter.although carter holds that b creates a property interest which can not be deprived without due process of law,the carter opinion refers specifically to procedural due process protection and not substantive due process protection.although this is not explicitly stated in the opinion,it is because the carter panel cited to board of regents roth,d,for the proposition that a property interest deserves constitutional protection if the plaintiff has a legitimate claim of entitlement,and not simply an expectation of the benefit.at.roth and this line of analysis refer specifically to the creation of a property interest subject to procedural due process protection,see discussion infra.the carter panel went on to conclude that the veterans preference in b created such an entitlement.id.at.
in nicholas,pennsylvania state university,supra,we explained that a property interest protected by procedural due process is not necessarily protected by substantive due process 
on past occasion,we have lamented that the case law of this circuit and the supreme court provides very little guidance as to what constitutes this certain quality of property interest worthy of protection under the substantive due process clause.nevertheless,we believe that a careful review of the case law does reveal one guiding principle whether a certain property interest embodies this particular quality is not determined by reference to state law,but rather depends on whether that interest is fundamental under the united states constitution t his circuit has adopted an approach to substantive due process that focuses on the nature of the property interest at stake.by way of illustration,we have so far limited substantive due process review to cases involving real property ownership we have been reluctant to extend substantive due process protection to other,less fundamental property interests.at emphasis added internal citations omitted.
the nicholas panel also cited favorably justice powell concurrence in regents of university of michigan ewing,d,in which the majority assumed the existence of a substantive due process property interest in the university decision to dismiss the plaintiff from a program of study,although it eventually concluded that the there was no violation since the decision to dismiss the plaintiff was not arbitrary or capricious.justice powell noted 
although i join in the court opinion holding that respondent presents no violation of the substantive due process right that he asserts,i think it unnecessary to assume the existence of such a right on the facts of this case even if one assumes the existence of a property right not every such right is entitled to the protection of substantive due process.while property interests are protected by procedural due process even though the interest is derived from state law rather than the constitution,substantive due process rights are created only by the constitution the interest asserted by respondent in continued university enrollment is essentially a contract right.it bears little resemblance to the fundamental interests that previously have been viewed as implicitly protected by the constitution.ewing,at.powell,concurring internal citations omitted.
using this analysis,the nicholas panel held that a university professor tenured public employment was not a fundamental property interest entitled to substantive due process protection.see nicholas,at the plaintiff tenured public employment is a wholly contract right w e view public employment as more closely analogous to those property interests that this court has previously deemed unworthy of substantive due process than to the venerable rights of real property ownership t he federal judiciary should not become a general court of review for state employment decisions.internal citations omitted.
the property interest at issue in this case,which gikas alleges entitles him to substantive due process protection,is not even a employment interest.rather,the property interest here is in an employment preference,not in the employment itself.at all events,the property interest in the preference appears to be no more fundamental under the federal constitution than the employment interest in nicholas.the interest in the preference is solely based upon state law.thus,having no reason to believe that gikas interest in the veterans preference is a fundamental right created by the federal constitution,we conclude that a of the vpa does not create a property interest protected by substantive due process.failing to meet this threshold requirement,we do not need to determine whether gikas was deprived of his right to the preference when he was not hired for the teaching position.
gikas argues that he was deprived of procedural due process when the district failed to notify him of the meaning of requisite qualifications so that he could make himself a better applicant for the teaching positions that became available in and.gikas also maintains that applicant veterans have no way of knowing whether they are entitled to the veterans preference if the district is not required to publish the requisite qualifications for the position in advance of hiring.the practical result of not publishing the requisite qualifications in advance of hiring,the argument continues,is to eliminate the veterans preference under a if the district does not have to set forth the meaning of requisite qualifications,it can simply hire the most qualified applicant and later assert that the applicant veterans were not qualified to perform the job.
gikas relies on justice zappala concurrence in brickhouse area school district,stating that for the veterans preference under a to be meaningful it is necessary that the criteria be clearly spelled out in advance of the selection process,and not merely be subjective conclusions,formed ad hoc during or after the selection process,based on the relative credentials of the actual applicants,zappala,concurring.under b of the vpa,any veteran who passes the civil service exam is entitled to the hiring preference even if his name does not stand highest on the eligible list.b.gikas asserts that if the a preference is not construed similarly to ensure that the veteran does not have to be the most qualified app
