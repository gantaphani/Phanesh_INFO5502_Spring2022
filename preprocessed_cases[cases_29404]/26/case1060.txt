in this appeal,we consider the extent to which the first amendment and due process guarantees are implicated when a graduate student thesis committee declines to approve a thesis that meets academic and professional standards in all respects except one the acknowledgments section does not conform to established academic and professional standards.we conclude that the amendment does not require university professors to assign a passing grade to such a thesis.we further hold that the university review procedures satisfied due process.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,who are university professors and officials.however,we remand the case for the district court to address a state constitutional claim that it did not resolve.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff christopher brown was a master degree candidate in the department of material sciences at the university of california at santa barbara ucsb,a public university.in order to earn a master degree,plaintiff was required to write a thesis under the guidance and subject to the approval of his thesis committee defendants galen stucky plaintiff thesis advisor,daniel morse,and fred lange.
rules governing the content and structure of master theses,and the procedures for submitting those theses for approval,are contained in ucsb graduate student handbook handbook and in the ucsb guide to filing theses and dissertations guide.the guide notes that one of the pedagogical purposes of the thesis project is to educate students about how to communicate research results in their chosen disciplines the essence of academic research is shared results.each discipline has a relatively standard method of presenting research results so that other researchers can find and build on past work.guide at.with respect to the content of a thesis or dissertation,the guide states 
you and your committee are responsible for everything between the margins.the organization,presentation,and documentation of your research should meet the standards for publishing journal articles or monographs in your field.for general information,consult any standard style guide such as strunk and white,turabian,or the university of chicago manual of style.for questions,consult your faculty committee a style sheet from a journal in your discipline.
id.emphasis added.
the guide also provides the general criteria for an optional dedication acknowledgments section of a student thesis you may wish to dedicate this work to someone special to you or to acknowledge particular persons who helped you.within the usual margin restrictions,any format is acceptable for these pages.
one of the style manuals to which the guide refers further clarifies the criteria for acknowledgments sections contained in scholarly papers.see kate turabian,a manual for writers of term papers,theses,and dissertations,of chi.press,ed.with respect to acknowledgments,it states 
in the acknowledgments,the writer thanks mentors and colleagues,lists the individuals or institutions that supported the research,and gives credit to works cited in the text for which permission to reproduce has been granted.although one might wish to acknowledge special assistance such as consultation on technical matters or aid in securing special equipment and source materials,one may properly omit formal thanks for the routine help given by an adviser or thesis committee.the generic heading acknowledgments,which appears only on the first page,is in uppercase and centered over the text.
the handbook elaborates further on the supervisory role of the thesis committee with respect to the content of a master thesis 
students,in conjunction with the faculty who supervise the writing of the dissertation,are responsible for the quality of scholarship in theses and dissertations,including presentation in a format that conforms to disciplinary standards.faculty should not approve a dissertation that fails to address disci plinary departmental standards.
handbook at emphasis added.
in the spring of,plaintiff brought his thesis,the morphology of calcium carbonate factors affecting crystal shape,to his committee for final approval.plaintiff did not include an acknowledgments section of any kind in the document that he delivered to his committee.all three committee members signed an approval page stating,this thesis of christopher brown is approved.emphasis added.in accordance with ucsb rules,that approval page became the second page of the thesis.
after he had obtained the signature page from his committee,plaintiff inserted an additional,section into his thesis without the knowledge or consent of his committee members.that section,entitled disacknowledgements,began i would like to offer special fuck you s to the following degenerates for of being an hindrance during my graduate career it then identified the dean and staff of the ucsb graduate school,the managers of davidson library,former california governor wilson,the regents of the university of california,and science as having been particularly obstructive to plaintiff progress toward his graduate degree.plaintiff later explained that he had not revealed the section to the members of his committee because he feared that they would not approve it.
ucsb rules require that graduate students file their approved theses or dissertations in the university library as a prerequisite to earning a degree.in june of,plaintiff attempted to file his thesis,including the unapproved disacknowledgements section,with the library.defendant charles li,the dean of the graduate division of ucsb,was alerted to the presence of the disacknowledgements.dean li,in turn,referred the issue to plaintiff thesis committee.
during june and july,plaintiff met with members of his committee and with dean li to discuss the disacknowledgements.he also met with the ucsb ombudsperson and with the dean of the ucsb school of engineering.plaintiff drafted an alternative version of the section,eliminating the profanity.
the committee members agreed that the disacknowledgements section even in its nonprofane form did not meet professional standards for publication in the field.they notified plaintiff of their decision in a memorandum dated august.that memorandum,written by stucky,read in part 
the dissertation committee stands by its approval of the thesis dissertation as it was presented by you to the committee for their evaluation,review and approval and,subsequently signed by the members of the dissertation committee.
the disacknowledgement was not submitted to the dissertation committee or to the graduate division of the university of california,but for deposition in the library without knowledge of either the dissertation committee or the graduate division.it is the understanding of the dissertation committee members who reviewed your thesis that the signatures of the dissertation committee members are a guarantee that the presentation and content of the entire thesis meets the standards and requirements of the department,college,and the university of california to whom the thesis is submitted for the appropriate advanced degree.the addition or removal of material from a dissertation after the examination,evaluation and signed approval of the original materials that are presented by the candidate to the committee and,the subsequent presentation to the scientific community and to the university of such a modified dissertation under the approval signatures of the committee given only for the original dissertation presentation to the committee without the consent of the committee for the addition or removal of material,is unacceptable to the committee.
in the august memorandum,the committee also commented that it had consulted with counsel and determined that a thesis or other scientific manuscript is not a public forum.the committee further said that it would not approve the addition of the added material s to the original,approved thesis,nor would it approve a thesis that contained them.
on the same date,dean li wrote a letter to plaintiff,informing him that his degree would be conferred upon the approval of his thesis.the letter further noted that approval would be forthcoming as soon as plaintiff removed his disacknowledgements.it outlined plaintiff avenues of appeal,should he opt to challenge the committee decision not to approve the new version of the thesis.
plaintiff declined to remove the disacknowledgements.instead,he submitted a written appeal to the academic affairs committee aac of the department of material sciences.the aac considered plaintiff appeal and unanimously rejected it in a written decision.the aac reasoned that the entire paper,not merely the technical content of the thesis,was subject to the review and approval of the thesis as the entirety of a scientific paper would be subject to the review and approval of the editorial board of any publication to which it was submitted.the aac articulated the standard for an acknowledgment section 
an acknowledgment section in a scientific paper is relevant only as a vehicle for the author to give proper credit to people or organizations that have contributed to make possible the technical work being reported.in the case of a thesis this could include faculty,fellow students,and laboratory staff who have helped the student with ideas,setting up experiments,clarifying difficult questions.a student is also expected to thank the agency that has provided funding for assistantship and research expenditures.under the same premise,the student is given a certain latitude in a thesis to thank parents,spouse,family or close friends who have provided moral or financial support through education.the student is encouraged to have an acknowledgment section as part of teaching proper professional conduct.
the aac determined that plaintiff disacknowledgements did not meet that standard.it concluded that the section was otherwise irrelevant to the content of his thesis.the aac reminded plaintiff that several other avenues were open to him for disseminating the opinions contained in the disacknowledgements and observed that it was common in the field for technical material removed from a paper on the ground of irrelevancy to be published separately.the decision additionally noted the rights of the committee members not to be associated,through their approval,with the content of the disacknowledgements section.finally,the aac commented that plaintiff conduct was unprofessional in later inserting the material into his thesis without the knowledge or approval of his thesis committee.
plaintiff appealed the aac decision to the associate dean of the graduate division,diane mackie.after reviewing the file,dean mackie denied the appeal.
next,plaintiff appealed to the ucsb graduate council,to which he submitted extensive written material.the graduate council rejected plaintiff appeal in a written decision.it reasoned that,under the university regulations,the entirety of plaintiff thesis was subject to the approval of his thesis committee,and the committee members were within their rights to withdraw their approval,as they do not approve of your added section.the graduate council additionally found that plaintiff had been denied a degree only because he had not completed one of the prerequisites to completing a master degree filing a thesis approved by the committee.the graduate council suggested two ways in which plaintiff could complete his degree 
seek approval of your entire thesis from your current committee,including the content of any section.all sections of your thesis are subject to their editing and approval.
seek to change the membership of the committee,subject to the approval of your department and the graduate division and appropriate university regulations.submit your complete thesis with the new committee and meet all editing or research requirements imposed by that committee.
plaintiff chose not to pursue either option proposed by the graduate council.instead,he filed a grievance with the academic freedom committee afc.he presented his case orally to the chair of the afc and in writing to the full afc.the afc rejected his grievance.it reasoned that the rules for filing theses did not impermissibly restrict academic freedom and that plaintiff had failed to follow those rules.
by january,plaintiff had exceeded the time limit for completing his master degree and was,therefore,placed on academic probation in accordance with ucsb policy.dean li notified plaintiff that if he failed to complete his degree by the end of the spring quarter of,then the department of material sciences would be asked to recommend either academic disqualification or continued academic probation.on april,near the end of spring quarter,dean li sent a memorandum to the department,asking for its recommendation as to plaintiff academic status.on may,the department recommended that plaintiff receive his degree,based on the draft of the thesis that had received approval,despite plaintiff failure to comply with the requirements for earning his degree.ucsb followed the recommendation and awarded plaintiff his degree.however,because plaintiff has not filed the approved version of his thesis with the ucsb library,the thesis has not been added to the library archive of theses.
plaintiff initiated this action on june.his complaint alleged three claims that defendants the dean of the ucsb graduate division,the chancellor of ucsb,the members of plaintiff thesis committee,and the director of the ucsb library violated his first amendment rights by withholding his degree and by their conduct that defendants violated his right to procedural due process by withholding his degree without having provided him a formal hearing and that defendants refusal to grant his degree unless he removed the disacknowledgements violated article i,section,of the california constitution.plaintiff sought damages,declaratory relief,and an injunction to compel defendants to place plaintiff thesis,including the disacknowledgements,in the ucsb library.
defendants moved for summary judgment on the federal claims.they argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the damages claims and that plaintiff was not entitled to injunctive relief.the court permitted plaintiff to conduct limited discovery.
after discovery,plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to summary judgment.he attached,as an exhibit to the memorandum,several other students acknowledgments sections approved by ucsb faculty,including three approved by defendant stucky.none were approved by any other members of plaintiff thesis committee.all of those acknowledgments sections conveyed thanks to various people and institutions,sometimes in profuse,humorous,or poetic form.in addition to thanking teachers,colleagues,family,friends,staff,employers,the university,and sources of grants or other support,some students thanked god for providing guidance or thanked their pets.the three sections approved by stucky included a section describing how the student came to arrive at graduate school thanking his grandfather,professors,staff,and o ther chemists in the stucky group that have given valuable input and endorsing certain products plus a of negative statement s related to the inferior state of the chemists facilities and to a flood that ruined some of the student files plus a dedication page honoring my family and friends who have died since i began my college career and with whom the student would have liked to share this moment a section thanking many professors,scientists,friends,supervisors,colleagues,graduate students,a summer assistant,collaborators,influential people in the zeolite field,the staff of the materials research laboratory,family,and friends plus a dedication page honoring the student wife for her support,encouragement,and love and his daughter for her smiles and hugs a section thanking the student professors and colleagues,his parents,and a friend plus a dedication page honoring his wife for all of her love and understanding.
after holding a hearing,the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.plaintiff timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.margolis ryan,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must decide whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.
discussion 
qualified immunity on the first amendment claim 
we apply a test to determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on a federal constitutional claim.first,we must determine whether the facts alleged,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,demonstrate that the defendant conduct violated a constitutional right.robinson solano county,cir en banc citing saucier katz,d.next,if the facts alleged show a constitutional violation,we must decide whether the constitutional right at stake was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.id.finally,if the right was clearly established,we assess whether an objectively reasonable government actor would have known that his or her conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional right.id.
plaintiff primarily contends that the facts,viewed in his favor,demonstrate a violation of his clearly established first amendment rights.he challenges three acts the thesis committee decision not to approve his disacknowledgements the library decision not to file his thesis in its archives and the ucsb initial decision not to confer his degree.
plaintiff can not state separate first amendment claims with respect to the second and third decisions.under ucsb policy,each of those two decisions was nondiscretionary,that is,turned completely on the committee decision whether to approve the thesis.had the committee approved the disacknowledgements section,the library would have had to file the thesis containing it.the library had no independent authority to decide whether or not to include the thesis in its collection.likewise,had plaintiff filed an approved thesis with the library,ucsb would not have had discretion to decide to withhold or defer the degree 
because the decisions not to place the thesis in the library and to delay granting plaintiff degree were not independent decisions but,rather,were direct consequences of the committee decision not to approve the disacknowledgements,the real question is whether defendants violated plaintiff first amendment rights when they refused to approve that section.we have found no precedent precisely on point.however,a review of the cases discussing the relationship between students free speech rights and schools power to regulate the content of curriculum demonstrates that educators can,consistent with the first amendment,restrict student speech provided that the limitation is reasonably related to a legitimate pedagogical purpose.
in hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,d,the supreme court of the united states held that school officials did not violate students first amendment rights when they prohibited the publication in the school newspaper of stories that the officials found objectionable.the court concluded that the newspaper,which was produced by a high school journalism class,was fairly characterized as part of the school curriculum because it was supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences.id.at.because of its curricular nature,the newspaper did not qualify as a public forum.id.at.the court then held that,with respect to students curricular speech,educators do not offend the first amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.id.at.both the majority and the dissent in hazelwood agreed that the first amendment permits educators to assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach and that 
the first amendment should afford an educator the prerogative not to sponsor the publication of a newspaper article that is ungrammatical,poorly written,inadequately researched,biased or prejudiced,or that falls short of the high standards for student speech that is disseminated under the school auspices the educator may constitutionally censor poor grammar,writing,or research because to reward such expression would materially disrup t the newspaper curricular purpose.

settle dickson county school board,cir,more strongly resembles the present case.there,the plaintiff argued that her teacher violated her first amendment rights when she refused to approve the plaintiff chosen topic for a class research paper and gave the plaintiff a grade of zero on the assignment when the plaintiff refused to comply with requirements related to the assignment.id.at.the student had submitted only one topic for the teacher approval,which the student duly received.then the the knowledge or approval of the her topic.id.at.relying on hazelwood recognition of a school power to regulate classroom speech,the court rejected the plaintiff first amendment argument,holding 
the free speech rights of students in the classroom must be limited because effective education depends not only on controlling boisterous conduct,but also on maintaining the focus of the class on the assignment in question.so long as the teacher violates no positive law or school policy,the teacher has broad authority to base her grades for students on her view of the merits of the students work.grades are given as incentives for study,and they are the currency by which school work is measured.
so long as the teacher limits speech or grades speech in the classroom in the name of learning and not as a pretext for punishing the student for her race,gender,economic class,religion or political persuasion,the federal courts should not interfere.
like judges,teachers should not punish or reward people on the basis of inadmissible,religion,gender,political teachers,like judges,must daily decide which arguments are relevant,which computations are correct,which analogies are good or bad,and when it is time to stop writing or talking.grades must be given by teachers in the classroom,just as cases are decided in the courtroom and to this end teachers,like judges,must direct the content of speech.teachers may frequently make mistakes in grading and otherwise,just as we do sometimes in deciding cases,but it is the essence of the teacher responsibility in the classroom to draw lines and make a word to encourage speech germane to the topic at hand and discourage speech unlikely to shed light on the subject.
id.at citations omitted.one judge concurred in the judgment,but concluded that the first amendment was not implicated at all by the facts presented 
the bottom line is that when a teacher makes an assignment,even if she does it poorly,the student has no constitutional right to do something other than that assignment and receive credit for it.it is not necessary to try to cram this situation into the framework of constitutional precedent,because there is no constitutional question.
id.at batchelder,concurring in the judgment.
hazelwood and settle lead to the conclusion that an educator can,consistent with the first amendment,require that a student comply with the terms of an academic assignment.those cases also make clear that the first amendment does not require an educator to change the assignment to suit the student opinion or to approve the work of a student that,in his or her judgment,fails to meet a legitimate academic standard.rather,as articulated by hazelwood,educators do not offend the first amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.at.
plaintiff argues that the hazelwood standard does not apply in the context of a assignment,as distinct from a or environment.it is true that the court left open the question whether the same degree of deference is appropriate with respect to expressive activities at the college and university level.id.at.it also is true that courts addressing the extent to which a public college or university,consistent with the first amendment,can regulate student speech in the context of extracurricular activities,such as yearbooks and newspapers,have held that hazelwood deference does not apply.see,kincaid gibson,nn.cir en banc holding that the hazelwood standard did not apply in a challenge to kentucky state university regulation of the student yearbook student gov t ass bd.of trs.of of,cir concluding that hazelwood is not applicable to college newspapers see also nicholson bd.of educ.torrance unified sch,cir in a case holding that a high school could require review of newspaper articles without violating students first amendment rights,stating that d ifferent considerations govern application of the first amendment on the college campus and at lower level educational institutions and that activities of high school students may be reviewed more stringently than those of college students because the former are in a much more adolescent and immature stage of life and less able to screen fact from propaganda citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
however,the parties have not identified,nor have we found,any supreme court case discussing the appropriate standard for reviewing a university regulation of students curricular speech.it is thus an open question whether hazelwood articulates the standard for reviewing a university assessment of a student academic work.we conclude that it does.
the supreme court has suggested that core curricular which is an integral part of the function of an educational from students extracurricular speech and that a public educational institution retains discretion to prescribe its curriculum.for example,in arkansas educational television commission forbes,d,the supreme court held that a debate sponsored by a public television station was a nonpublic forum from which the broadcaster could exclude an independent candidate in the exercise of journalistic discretion.in reaching that conclusion,the court said 
as a general rule,the nature of editorial discretion counsels against subjecting broadcasters to claims of viewpoint discrimination.programming decisions would be particularly vulnerable to claims of this type because even principled exclusions rooted in sound journalistic judgment can often be characterized as viewpoint based much like a university selecting a commencement speaker,a public institution selecting speakers for a lecture series,or a public school prescribing its curriculum,a broadcaster by its nature will facilitate the expression of some viewpoints instead of others.were the judiciary to require,and so to define and approve,criteria for access,it would risk implicating the courts in judgments that should be left to the exercise of journalistic discretion.
id.at.emphasis added.the court thus referred to the principle that a public school has discretion to engage in its own expressive activity of prescribing its curriculum.
an earlier supreme court case also distinguished between curricular and extracurricular activities in the first amendment context.in board of education,island trees union free school district pico,d,the court held that a local school board could not remove books from the school library solely because the members of the board disliked the ideas contained therein.the plurality opinion of the court was careful,however,to clarify that its ruling did not apply to curricular speech.the plaintiffs did not seek 
to impose limitations upon their school board discretion to prescribe the curricula of the island trees schools.on the contrary,the only books at issue in this case are library books,books that by their nature are optional rather than required reading.our adjudication of the present case thus does not intrude into the classroom,or into the compulsory courses taught there.
id.at.see also id.at.stating that the school board was attempting improperly to extend its claim of absolute discretion beyond the compulsory environment of the classroom,into the school library and the regime of voluntary inquiry that there holds sway horowitz,at.observing that the decision of an individual professor as to the proper grade for a student in his course is a determination that requires an expert evaluation of cumulative information and is not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial decisionmaking bd.of educ.of indep.sch.dist.earls,d distinguishing between core educational functions and voluntary extracurricular activities for fourth amendment purposes and holding that a school district constitutionally may require all students to submit to drug testing as a prerequisite to participating in all competitive extracurricular activities.
in summary,under the supreme court precedents,the curriculum of a public educational institution is one means by which the institution itself expresses its policy,a policy with which others do not have a constitutional right to interfere.downs unified sch,cir,cert.denied,d.the supreme court jurisprudence does not hold that an institution interest in mandating its curriculum and in limiting a student speech to that which is germane to a particular academic assignment diminishes as students age.indeed,arguably the need for academic discipline and editorial rigor increases as a student learning progresses.
to the extent that the supreme court has addressed the difference between a university regulation of curricular speech and a primary or secondary school regulation of curricular speech,it has implied that a university control may be broader.it has done so in its cases recognizing the doctrine of university professors academic freedom,a doctrine that encompasses the idea that universities and schools should have the freedom to make decisions about how and what to teach.bd.of regents of of.southworth,d souter,concurring in the judgment.in southworth,justice souter summarized the current state of academic freedom law 
in regents of of ewing,d,we recognized these related conceptions academic freedom thrives not only on the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among teachers and students,but also,and somewhat inconsistently,on autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself.some of the opinions in our books emphasize broad conceptions of academic freedom that if accepted by the court might seem to clothe the university with an immunity to any challenge to regulations made or obligations imposed in the discharge of its educational mission.so,in sweezy new hampshire,d,justice frankfurter,concurring in the result,explained the importance of a university ability to define its own mission by quoting from a statement on the open universities in south africa 
it is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation,experiment and creation.it is an atmosphere in which there prevail the four essential freedoms of a determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach,what may be taught,how it shall be taught,and who may be admitted to study.
while we have spoken in terms of a wide protection for the academic freedom and autonomy that bars legislatures and courts from imposing conditions on the spectrum of subjects taught and expressed in college teaching,we have never held that universities lie entirely beyond the reach of students first amendment rights.
id.at.citations omitted.
we do not know with certainty that the supreme court would hold that hazelwood controls the inquiry into whether a university requirements for and evaluation of a student curricular speech infringe that student first amendment rights.nevertheless,of all the supreme court cases,hazelwood appears to be the most analogous to the present case.
in view of a university strong interest in setting the content of its curriculum and teaching that content,hazelwood provides a workable standard for evaluating a university student first amendment claim stemming from curricular speech.that standard balances a university interest in academic freedom and a student first amendment rights.it does not immunize the university altogether from first amendment challenges but,at the same time,appropriately defers to the university expertise in defining academic standards and teaching students to meet them.
applying the hazelwood standard to the facts of this case,and viewing those facts in favor of plaintiff,we conclude that plaintiff can not show a violation of his first amendment rights.in this case,as in settle,plaintiff was given an assignment the writing of a master thesis.that assignment,like the paper in hazelwood,is fairly characterized as part of the curriculum,at,because it was designed to teach plaintiff how to research within an academic specialty and how to present his results to other scholars in his field.therefore,like the newspaper in hazelwood,plaintiff thesis was subject to a reviewing committee reasonable regulation.plaintiff was given reasonable standards for that assignment,including a pedagogically appropriate requirement that the thesis comply with professional standards governing his discipline.he was instructed that he should consult a standard style manual,or talk with members of his committee,about those requirements.like the plaintiff in settle,plaintiff bypassed the approval process and prepared an assignment that did not comply with the stated criteria.under hazelwood and settle,plaintiff committee members acted well within their discretion,and in conformity with the first amendment,when they declined to approve the noncompliant section.their decision was reasonably related to a legitimate pedagogical objective teaching plaintiff the proper format for a scientific paper.
moreover,the committee members had an affirmative first amendment right not to approve plaintiff thesis.see parate isibor,cir holding that a university professor has a first amendment right to assign grades and evaluate students as determined by his or her independent professional judgment.that is especially true where,as here,the committee members names appear in the thesis and where,according to the guide,they are jointly responsible for its content.the presence of defendants affirmative right underscores plaintiff lack of a first amendment right to have his nonconforming thesis approved.
plaintiff counters,first,that the guide does not require acknowledgments sections to meet academic and professional standards but,instead,grants students wide discretion to write whatever they want.according to plaintiff,the use of the word may in the part of the guide defining the dedication acknowledgments section of a thesis means that a student has complete discretion with respect to the content of that student may dedicate the thesis to someone special or give thanks to helpful individuals in the section,or the student may use the section to communicate some other message.that is not a permissible reading of the guide.an acknowledgments section has a form and purpose in academic writing.moreover,the context is the statement in the guide that the inclusion of such a section is optional.thus,the word may simply refers to the fact that a student may either include an appropriately drafted section thanking people or may omit the section altogether.that is,the discretion to which the term may refers is the discretion whether to include the section or not 
plaintiff also contends that the fact that the guide permits the section to be in any format means that a student has freedom to choose the content of the acknowledgments section.we are not persuaded.format commonly refers to the physical layout of a document,not its substantive content.see,the american heritage dictionary ed.nothing in the guide suggests that format has a meaning here.
in the alternative,whatever the meaning of the guide,plaintiff argues that he has a first amendment right to draft an acknowledgments section from any viewpoint.to the contrary,hazelwood and settle establish with the first teacher may require a student to write a paper from a particular viewpoint,even if it is a viewpoint with which the student disagrees,so long as the requirement serves a legitimate pedagogical purpose.for example,a college history teacher may demand a paper defending prohibition,and a professor may assign students to write opinions showing how justices ginsburg and scalia would analyze a particular fourth amendment question.in this case,the thesis committee was entitled to require that the acknowledgments section if it were included recognize those who made a positive contribution to plaintiff education.such requirements are part of the teachers curricular mission to encourage critical thinking in the hypothetical examples and to conform to professional norms in this case.
finally,plaintiff argues,even if the guide requires that an acknowledgments section meet academic and professional standards,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether ucsb enforced the standards in his case for nonpedagogical reasons.he argues that some other students were not required to conform to those standards,suggesting that there actually were no standards.
a few prior acknowledgments sections that arguably were nonconforming create no issue of material fact,for two reasons.first,and most importantly,this thesis committee was entitled to set an academic standard for plaintiff thesis,including its acknowledgments section,even if no thesis committee in the past ever had set one.second,this thesis committee was entitled to adhere to written academic standards even if some other thesis committees none of which was identical in composition to plaintiff committee had been lax.the evidence on which plaintiff relies is irrelevant it simply has no bearing on whether his thesis committee had a legitimate pedagogical purpose.instead,it simply shows,at best,that some professors are less rigorous in enforcing academic standards than others.while it would be preferable,as a matter of academic policy,for individual professors to strive for uniformity when evaluating students work,inconsistency among individual professors in applying academic standards to students work does not vest students with a constitutional right to passing grades on papers that would meet the approval of the professor.there is no first amendment right to consistency.
moreover,the summary judgment record does not support an inference that ucsb acted because of the content of plaintiff ideas,rather than the format and placement of those ideas.an academic thesis by a committee of professors is not a public forum,limited or otherwise as defendants explained to him,plaintiff remained free to publish and publicize his ideas in many other ways.
in short,the decision of plaintiff committee members not to approve the disacknowledgements section did not violate plaintiff first amendment rights.because ucsb decision not to place the thesis in the library and to defer granting plaintiff degree can not be viewed as independent of the approval decision,those actions likewise did not violate plaintiff first amendment rights.therefore,the district court properly concluded that a defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff first amendment claim and b plaintiff can not compel the library to file the unapproved thesis in the archives.
qualified immunity on the procedural due process claim 
plaintiff also argues that defendants violated his clearly established right to due process when they withheld plaintiff degree and otherwise harmed him without ever giving him a fair hearing.
although plaintiff labels defendants conduct punitive or disciplinary,the entire record belies that characterization.the undisputed facts show that plaintiff was not punished on account of his disacknowledgements.to the contrary,defendants at all times confirmed their approval of his thesis as it had been submitted to them,and even pointed helpfully to ways in which plaintiff could express the criticisms embodied in the disacknowledgements.defendants only act was a simple refusal to approve the section because it did not meet academic and professional standards.as a result,plaintiff did not receive his degree earlier because he had not met the requirements to receive it.in view of those facts,the decision not to approve plaintiff thesis is properly characterized as an academic decision,rather than as a disciplinary decision.
board of curators of university of missouri horowitz,d,establishes the standard for procedural due process in the context of academic decisions.in that case,the plaintiff argued that the university had violated her right to procedural due process when it dismissed her for academic reasons without first giving her a hearing.id.at.the court,without deciding whether the plaintiff had a protected liberty or property interest in continuing her education,rejected her argument.the court held that,when dismissing a student for academic reasons,a university need not hold a hearing.id.at.a university meets the requirements of procedural due process so long as the dismissal decision is careful and deliberate.id.at.
here,the initial decision not to confer plaintiff degree for academic reasons was analogous,although not identical,to the decision in horowitz.applying analogous principles,procedural due process did not require defendants to hold a formal hearing before they decided to defer conferral of plaintiff degree until he met academic requirements.instead,it was sufficient for defendants to make a careful and deliberate decision.the the written decisions resolving plaintiff various that they did.consequently,the facts,even when viewed in favor of plaintiff,do not establish a violation of procedural due process.the district court properly held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff procedural due process claim.
plaintiff claim 
the district court decision granting summary judgment focuses entirely on plaintiff federal constitutional claims and is silent with respect to his claim under the california constitution.the order does not state whether the court considered the state claim to be resolved or whether the court was dismissing the claim under united mine workers of america gibbs,d discussing when a federal court should retain pendent jurisdiction over claims if federal claims are dismissed before trial.the reason for granting summary judgment was that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.qualified immunity does not necessarily provide a ground for dismissing the california constitutional claim,even if the freedom of speech protected by the california constitution is coextensive with the first amendment.consequently,we remand the case to the district court with directions either to address the claim on the merits or to dismiss it.
conclusion 
we hold that plaintiff does not have a first amendment right to have his nonconforming thesis approved,nor did he have a right to a formal hearing with respect to his committee academic decision not to approve the thesis.as a result,defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff damages claims,and plaintiff can not compel defendants to place the unapproved version of his thesis in the ucsb library.
because the district court did not address plaintiff claim under the california constitution,we remand the case to the district court to resolve it on the merits or dismiss it.
affirmed with respect to the federal claims remanded with respect to the california constitutional claim.the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
i agree that the plaintiff first amendment rights were not violated and express a reasoning different from both of my associates.
this case is about an erosion of academic integrity.to put it in the vernacular,the guy cooked the books his master thesis,got caught,and now wants to shield his misbehavior under the umbrella of the first amendment.
the plaintiff,in order to earn his master degree,presented his thesis to his faculty committee for its approval.the thesis did not include the optional acknowledgment section.the committee approved the thesis as presented to them.the university requires that graduate students must file their approved thesis in the university library as an additional requirement for earning their master degree.
instead of submitting the approved copy of his thesis to the university library,the plaintiff,unknown to his thesis committee,added two pages of disacknowledgments,containing vulgar language naming the persons he believed to be the degenerates who posed an burden during my graduate career 
the librarian refused to file the altered thesis because it had not been approved by the faculty committee.university regulations provide that the faculty members who comprise the thesis committee are jointly responsible with the candidate for the content of the thesis.by adding the disacknowledgments section to his thesis for submission to the university library,the plaintiff tried to circumvent the university requirement of faculty approval and misrepresented to both the university and his academic field that his disacknowledgments had been accepted by the faculty committee for publication.
the faculty committee was not required to approve the plaintiff thesis with his modifications.the committee emphasized that its refusal to publish the thesis with the disacknowledgments section was based on its conclusion that the plaintiff addition of the material after the examination,evaluation and signed approval of the original materials is unacceptable to the committee.thus,it was the academically dishonest manner in which the plaintiff tried to publish his disacknowledgments,rather than his views,that the committee disapproved.
the first amendment does not protect nor authorize deception.state board of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d untruthful speech,commercial or otherwise,has never been protected for its own sake.citing gertz robert welch,d.just as the university could punish the plaintiff for plagiarism or cheating,so could it refuse to approve his dishonest addition of the disacknowledgments.see slaughter brigham young,cir finding no first amendment problem with a student code of conduct that authorized expulsion of a graduate student for using his professor name,without his knowledge,as a coauthor in an article he submitted for publication.the plaintiff can not cheat and then seek to evade accountability through the first amendment.
accordingly,the plaintiff first amendment claim fails.
although the underlying dispute may appear to some to be trivial,and perhaps not worthy of serious first amendment deliberation,the extreme positions taken by the parties during the course of their disagreement and the erroneous legal rule advocated by one of my colleagues leaves me with little choice but to discuss the constitutional questions in some depth.i agree that we should affirm the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to brown procedural due process claim and that we should remand the state law claims for further consideration.i respectfully dissent,however,from my colleagues decision to affirm the award of summary judgment to the university with respect to brown first amendment claims.
first,i emphasize that there is no agreement between my colleagues in the majority as to the legal standard applicable to brown first amendment claims.thus,there is no majority opinion and no binding precedent with respect to any first amendment principles.although judges graber and ferguson reach the same conclusion,they do so for wholly different reasons.judge graber would apply the first amendment standard that the supreme court created for high school student speech in hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d,to the speech of college and graduate students and would affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the university defendants on the ground that under that standard it may regulate the content of the disacknowledgments that brown inserted in his thesis.judge ferguson would also affirm the district court decision,but would do so because he believes that this case is about punishing a student who was caught cheating,an action that he does not believe triggers first amendment review.he believes that it is the insertion of unauthorized material in brown act of cheating or caused the university to discipline him.because he does not believe that the first amendment protects on that legal question i agree with ferguson does not address the first amendment standard that is applicable to the regulation of college and graduate student speech.
i disagree with both of my colleagues positions.i disagree with judge graber because she would have this court adopt an erroneous first amendment standard for a university attempts to regulate the speech of college and graduate students,and also because,even if that standard were applicable,the issues regarding the university excessive response to brown disacknowledgments are not appropriate for decision without a trial on the facts.i disagree with judge ferguson because the record does not in any way support his conclusion as to the reason brown was disciplined.moreover,at the very least,the university motivation for disciplining brown is a question of fact that can not be resolved on summary judgment.
judge graber would have us adopt a first amendment standard regarding the authority of public universities to limit the speech of graduate students that i believe to be wholly standard that would seriously undermine the rights of all college and graduate students attending state institutions of higher learning.specifically,she would import into the college and graduate academic world the limitations on speech that the supreme court has held appropriate for use in the case of emotionally less mature high school students.because the reasons underlying the deference with respect to the regulation of the speech rights of high school youths do not apply in the adult world of college and graduate students,an arena in which academic freedom and vigorous debate are supposed to flourish,i can not agree with judge graber conclusion that the first amendment standard established in hazelwood applies at the university level.
even were the hazelwood standard applicable to this case,i would vigorously disagree that a university decision to withhold a graduate student degree for almost a year,despite the fact that he has successfully completed his masters thesis and complied with all of the department other academic requirements,is a reasonable response to his attachment to his chemistry thesis of a one and a half page prefatory disacknowledgments section in which he caustically expresses his view that university and other public officials obstructed rather than aided his progress toward a graduate degree.nor,in my opinion,is it a reasonable response to such expressive conduct for the university to exacerbate its retaliatory action by placing the offending graduate student on academic probation for the period during which his degree is being withheld,thus making him ineligible for a teaching or research position or for financial support.
the university extreme actions in response to brown that was highly critical of university and other public a genuine question of material fact as to whether the university punished him because of the viewpoint he sought to express or whether,as the judge graber appears to believe,it simply desired to further a legitimate pedagogical concern.thus,a genuine issue of fact as to the university extreme actions exists even if,as i willingly assume for purposes of this dissent,the university had the right to refuse to file brown thesis in the library archives as long as he insisted that it not be filed without the hostile disacknowledgments.summary judgment was therefore wholly inappropriate.
of equal importance,judge graber rejection of brown principal constitutional claims is based entirely on a false premise.she begins her opinion by assuming,contrary to fact,that the university refusal to approve of brown disacknowledgments statement and to file his thesis with the disacknowledgments in the library archives required it to withhold his degree for almost a year and to deprive him of university financial assistance by placing him on academic probation on the basis of that incorrect assumption,she concludes that we need not discuss brown claims that the withholding of his degree and the imposition of financial sanctions constituted punishment for the expression of his views.specifically,she contends that brown can not state separate first amendment claims for the university decisions to withhold his degree and to place him on academic probation because those decisions were nondiscretionary and were compelled by the university earlier decision not to approve his thesis with the disacknowledgments statement included.however,that contention is plainly incorrect.the fact that the university had no quarrel with the academic content of brown thesis and that it did indeed confer his degree on him after withholding it for almost a year,even though he continued to refuse to submit a revised thesis without the disacknowledgments statement,demonstrates beyond any question that the university did have the discretion to confer the degree and totally belies judge graber ipse dixit assertion to the contrary thus,without any basis in fact or law,judge graber simply refuses to confront,or even discuss,the principal constitutional issues presented in this the university allegedly retaliatory and punitive actions denying brown the right to graduate and to receive financial assistance during his involuntary extended tenure as a graduate student violated his first amendment rights.
judge ferguson similarly avoids the principal constitutional issues in this case by simply stating that brown was punished,not on the basis of his views,but rather because of the academically dishonest manner in which he tried to publish his disacknowledgments.this assumption,however,is also not supported by the factual record.the university was not interested in punishing brown for cheating.it was perfectly willing not to discipline him at all for his deception.in fact,it was willing at all times to file the thesis in the library archives and give brown his degree,without imposing any discipline whatsoever,if he would simply remove the disacknowledgments statement or allow the librarian to do so.it later awarded him the degree despite his refusal to remove the statement,not because he had received adequate punishment,but because it changed its mind about continuing to wage the battle at that escalated level.in fact,it appears to me that the university was not nearly as affronted as judge ferguson by brown act of inserting an unauthorized disacknowledgments statement as a preface to his thesis.it simply did not want to place the thesis in the library as long as it included the disacknowledgments.at the very least,there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the university was motivated by a desire to punish brown for making modifications to the thesis or by its disagreement with the views that he expressed in the disacknowledgments.
it may be helpful to at this point the history of this dispute.the question we must decide is whether brown has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the university punished him for the views he sought to express.there can be no question that the substantive portion of brown work on the morphology of calcium approved by his thesis committee and that,had nothing further occurred,he would have graduated shortly thereafter.following the approval of the thesis,however,brown inserted as a forward a disacknowledgments statement.it was in response to this one and a half page insert that the university decided to withhold brown degree for almost a year until sufficiently pressured to do otherwise and to deprive him of financial support during that period by placing him on academic probation.judge graber ignores the questions raised by the drastic sanctions that the university imposed on brown speech.in both the introduction and conclusion sections of her opinion,she characterizes this case as one involving only a thesis committee decision not to approve of or assign a passing grade to brown thesis she applies the first amendment standard she would have us adopt to that action only and fails to discuss entirely how the excessive punishment could be justified in light of the free speech clause.brown complaint,as well as the record on summary judgment,clearly demonstrates,however,that this case is about much more than the mere decision not to approve the disacknowledgments or the ensuing decision not to permit the placement of the thesis in the library 
in the first paragraph of his complaint,brown states that he is suing for declaratory relief and damages because his degree was withheld from him in violation of the first amendment.moreover,brown first claim for relief in the complaint,asserts that d efendants decision to withhold plaintiff master degree because of his critical comments was an unconstitutional infringement on his first amendment rights emphasis added.
the university decision to withhold brown degree for almost a year after he had completed all of the academic requirements to earn a degree appears to be clearly unreasonable.more important,for purposes of this appeal,the university drastic actions raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the sanctions it imposed on brown were motivated by a desire to punish him because of the views he sought to express or were simply designed to further its legitimate pedagogical concerns in some manner.such questions are ordinarily not appropriate for decision on summary judgment,see,hunt cromartie,d i t was error in this case for the district court to resolve the disputed fact of motivation at the summary judgment stage,and this case is no exception.accordingly,i would permit brown to present his first amendment arguments to a jury,as the constitution requires.
hazelwood standard does not apply to college and graduate school student speech.
i vehemently disagree with judge graber conclusion that hazelwood provides the appropriate first amendment standard for college and graduate student speech and begin this section by emphasizing that her opinion on this point is hers alone and is not joined by any other judge on this panel.thus,her desire to import the hazelwood standard into the university context does not constitute binding precedent.rather,the appropriate speech standard for college and graduate students speech remains an open question in this circuit.it is precisely because the question remains an open one here and elsewhere that i address judge graber analysis in some depth and explain why hazelwood deferential standard is inappropriate for college and graduate student speech.
in hazelwood,the court addressed the degree of first amendment protection available to high school student speech and held that high school educators do not offend the first amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.id.at.see also settle dickson county sch,cir applying the hazelwood standard to the speech of a junior high school student writing a research paper.in so holding,the hazelwood court emphasized that a first amendment standard that is more deferential to school officials is appropriate in a high school setting because high school students are young,emotionally immature,and more likely to be inappropriately influenced by speech on controversial topics.hazelwood,at.a school must be able to take into account the emotional maturity of the intended audience see also bethel sch.dist.fraser,d emphasizing that one reason why high school officials should be accorded more deference to limit student speech is because a high school audience is less mature planned parenthood of southern nevada,clark cty.sch,cir en banc discussing the immaturity of a high school audience and stating that the first amendment standard applicable to high school student speech must provide educators with the ability to consider the emotional maturity of the intended audience.
the supreme court has recognized that college and graduate students,unlike high school students,are more mature,independent thinkers who are less likely to be influenced by the publication of controversial ideas.see,widmar vincent,d university students are,of course,young adults.they are less impressionable than younger students.tilton richardson,d recognizing that college students are less impressionable.in fact,discussion of controversial ideas on a college campus is essential to the background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition in the university setting.rosenberger rector and visitors of the of virginia,d.vigorous debate on controversial topics is consistent with the supreme court description of our college and university campuses as vital centers for the nation intellectual life.id.at.see also widmar,at.the college classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas.internal quotations omitted.
because college and graduate school students are typically more mature and independent,they have been afforded greater first amendment rights than their high school counterparts,just as they have been afforded greater legal rights in general.along with the right to vote,most college and graduate school students are permitted to drive automobiles,to purchase cigarettes,to marry,and even to join the military many high school students do not enjoy any of these rights or privileges.similarly,most college students and almost all graduate students may legally consume alcohol,a right not generally available to high school students.although we have not explicitly addressed how much protection to give the first amendment rights of college and graduate school students,we have recognized that 
d ifferent considerations govern application of the first amendment on the college campus and at lower level educational institutions.the activities of high school students,for example,may be more stringently reviewed than the conduct of college students,as the former are in a much more adolescent and immature stage of life.
nicholson board of educ.torrance unified sch,cir internal quotations omitted see also mabey reagan,cir a college relies in large measure on faculty and its contributions to administrative decisions.this is analogous to,but different from a high school need to discipline by superiors.in hazelwood itself,the supreme court recognized that the same degree of deference shown to high school officials may not be appropriate when analyzing the first amendment protection available to expressive activities at the college and university level.id.at.when discussing the first amendment rights of college students generally,the supreme court noted that the precedents of this court leave no room for the view that,because of the acknowledged need for order,first amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large.healy james,d see also board of regents of the of wisconsin southworth,d emphasizing that the right of teaching institutions to limit expressive freedom of students ha s been confined to high schools,whose students and their schools relation to them are different and at least arguably distinguishable from their counterparts in college education.
judge graber suggestion that we import the hazelwood standard into the college and university context is particularly unfortunate,because the standard is a deferential one that courts often use to justify highly questionable actions by high school educators that restrict controversial speech.see,planned parenthood,at holding that the school district justification for refusing to publish family planning advertisements was reasonable under the hazelwood standard fleming jefferson county sch,cir upholding a school district guidelines restricting a tile painting project at area high schools under the hazelwood standard mccann fort zumwalt sch,d holding that school board decision to prohibit the high school marching band from performing a song that it interpreted as promoting the illegal use of drugs was reasonable under hazelwood.
recognizing that college and graduate student speech should be entitled to greater first amendment protection than that of high school students,the sixth circuit has explicitly declined to apply hazelwood deferential first amendment standard in the university setting.see kincaid gibson,cir en banc.in kincaid,a public university attempted to suppress the speech of some of its college students by withholding publication of the school yearbook.kincaid,at.the sixth circuit,on rehearing en banc,held that the hazelwood standard was inapplicable and instead concluded that the yearbook was a limited public forum in which viewpoint discrimination was impermissible and regulations were permissible only when narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.id.at see also student govt.ass board of trustees of the of,cir stating that the hazelwood standard does not apply to a college newspaper.
judge graber attempts to distinguish the first and sixth circuit decisions from the instant case by characterizing the student speech in college yearbooks and newspapers as that is entitled to broader first amendment protection than the curricular speech at issue here.her suggested distinction between curricular and extracurricular speech,however,is belied by the supreme court analysis in hazelwood itself.hazelwood involved a challenge to the school censorship of a high school newspaper.the court specifically stated that publications and theatrical productions that are supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences are examples of expressive activities that bear the imprimatur of the school and are therefore subject to the same degree of first amendment scrutiny as curricular speech,even if they do not occur in a traditional classroom setting.hazelwood,at.see also planned parenthood,at interpreting the supreme court hazelwood decision and holding that the court intended that the same principles that animate educational decisions come into play when determining what advertisements are suitable for publication in school newspapers,yearbooks and athletic programs emphasis added.the yearbook at issue in kincaid was under the management of a student publications board consisting of faculty and university officials,as well as students.kincaid,at.thus,student speech in the yearbook was just as likely to be perceived by members of the public to bear the imprimatur of the school as student speech in a curricular context.hazelwood,at.despite the evident similarity in subject matter in hazelwood and kincaid,the sixth circuit refused to apply the hazelwood high school standard to a university decision to withhold publication of a yearbook and instead applied a standard that was more protective of university students first amendment rights.when discussing its rationale,the kincaid court emphasized the fact that university students are less impressionable than younger students and noted that t he danger of chilling individual thought and expression is especially real in the university setting,where the state acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.kincaid,at quoting widmar,at,and rosenberger,at.thus,judge graber purported distinction provides no basis for distinguishing kincaid and student government association and is disingenuous at best.
because i believe that the first and sixth circuits appropriately afforded college and graduate student speech,whether curricular or extracurricular,greater first amendment protection than high school student speech,and because the importation of the hazelwood standard into the college and graduate school context would dilute the free speech rights of all students attending public institutions of higher learning,i respectfully disagree with judge graber conclusion that hazelwood reasonableness standard should apply to brown first amendment claims.
ii.there are a number of more standards that could be applied to college and graduate student speech.
although our set of opinions leaves open the question of what first amendment standard applies to the regulation of college and graduate student speech,it is worth considering what that standard might be.there are a number of possible standards that are more protective of student speech than the hazelwood standard,and yet still respect a university need to further its legitimate pedagogical purposes.i will mention only two.
first,there is the limited or designated public forum in which the government opens a forum for use by the public at large for assembly and speech,for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain subjects.cornelius naacp legal defense and educ.fund,d.in a limited public forum,the government may impose reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions on speech restrictions are impermissible and all restrictions must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.id.this is the standard that the sixth circuit applied in kincaid when it held that the university yearbook constituted a limited or designated public forum in which regulations were subject to strict scrutiny review.kincaid,at,
another possibility is to adopt an intermediate level of scrutiny for regulations of student speech in college and graduate programs.united states virginia vmi,d applying intermediate scrutiny to classifications in equal protection jurisprudence.under an intermediate level of scrutiny,the university would have the burden of demonstrating that its regulation of college and graduate student speech was substantially related to an important pedagogical purpose.id.at.although intermediate scrutiny is more protective of first amendment speech rights than the hazelwood standard,it affords more deference to educators decisions than does the strict scrutiny standard that applies under a limited public forum analysis.
when determining what standard is appropriate for analyzing regulations of college and graduate student speech,it is important to distinguish student speech from university speech,teacher or other employee speech,and the speech of private individuals using the university facilities.rosenberger,at.distinguishing between a university right to determine the content of the education that it provides,which is the university speech,and the university ability to regulate the speech of private individuals who use its facilities.it may be that different first amendment standards are applicable in different contexts to restrictions imposed at the university level depending on both the speaker and the nature of the particular forum.for purposes of this dissent,i need not decide what standard s of review is appropriate for analyzing a university attempts to regulate college or graduate student speech in general,or brown in particular,because,regardless of what standard is deemed applicable,brown has established a genuine issue of material fact as to the university motivation for imposing such extreme sanctions in response to his attempt to add a disacknowledgments section to an thesis.the constitutional questions in this case can not be resolved on summary judgment,regardless of the standard employed 
iii.even if hazelwood were the applicable standard,the university decisions to place brown on academic probation and to withhold his degree for almost a year would raise genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment.
even under hazelwood highly deferential standard,questions of material fact remain that preclude summary judgment.when applying the hazelwood standard,we first balance the totality of the school its decisions to withhold brown degree for almost a full year and to place him on academic probation for that period,thus making him ineligible for a university teaching or research position or for financial the university purported pedagogical interest in ensuring that graduate students write theses that not only meet all of its academic standards but also conform to the proper format for a scientific order to determine whether the university actions were reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.hazelwood,at.here,the university imposition of so extreme a sanction appears grossly disproportionate when balanced against the minor nature of brown alleged transgression and against its own interest in ensuring that all of its rules and regulations are fully complied with and that all o
