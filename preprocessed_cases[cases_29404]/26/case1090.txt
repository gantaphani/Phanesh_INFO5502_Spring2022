we must decide whether a state university may classify an alien temporary nonimmigrant visa holder student as a nonresident for tuition purposes.
nicole carlson,a canadian citizen,entered the united states in under a td nonimmigrant visa and has lived in california since that time.under the terms of the north american free trade agreement nafta,a td visa holder is authorized to enter the united states solely on a temporary basis as a condition of entry,the visa holder must disclaim any intent to establish permanent residence in this country.despite such restriction on her visa,however,carlson alleges that california is her one and only domicile.carlson has periodically applied for,and received,annual extensions of her td visa.
in,carlson applied for admission to san jose state university sjsu,part of the california state university csu system.she was advised by a sjsu representative that she would be classified as a nonresident,and hence could not attend sjsu on the basis afforded california residents.carlson appealed her nonresident classification to linda macallister,university counsel and residence specialist for the csu system.macallister informed carlson that she was not eligible for resident classification because her td immigration status precluded her from establishing permanent residence in the united states.carlson appealed macallister determination to chancellor charles reed,who rejected carlson appeal on the ground that she did not meet the residence requirements established by the california education code given her td immigration status.carlson alleges that,as a result of her nonresident classification,she was unable to enroll at cjsu because she could not afford the nonresident tuition rate.
in october,carlson instituted the present federal civil rights action under,bringing suit against csu chancellor reed and sjsu president robert caret in their official and individual capacities,seeking damages and injunctive relief for their alleged violation of her federal constitutional rights under the supremacy clause and the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.in january,carlson sought a preliminary injunction.after a brief hearing,judge real denied carlson request,explaining that the holder of a visa does not have the legal capacity to possess the requisite intent to establish domicile and thus can not be granted residency status in california.chancellor reed and president caret thereupon filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,which judge real granted on june,this timely appeal followed.
we must first decide whether,under california state law,carlson is eligible for classification as a california resident for state university tuition purposes.
each student in the california state university system is classified as either a resident or nonresident for tuition purposes.cal.only nonresident students are charged tuition.to be deemed a resident for tuition purposes,a student must have resided in the state for at least one year.section sets forth the rules for determining residence.these rules include,in pertinent part,the following 
a there can only be one residence.
b a residence is the place where one remains when not called elsewhere for labor or other special or temporary purpose,and to which he or she returns in seasons of repose.
c a residence can not be lost until another is gained.
d the residence can be changed only by the union of act and intent.
h an alien,including an unmarried minor alien,may establish his or her residence,unless precluded by the immigration and nationality act,et from establishing domicile in the united states.
the specific question before us,therefore,is the proper interpretation of section h,which provides that aliens are eligible for classification as california residents only if they possess the legal capacity to establish domicile in the united states under federal immigration law.
according to carlson,subsection h incorporates the ina definition of residence set forth at,which provides 
unless otherwise specified,for purposes of this chapter an alien residence is the same as that alien domicile,or principal actual dwelling place,without regard to the alien intent 
carlson urges that this regulation equates domicile with simple physical residency,and,thus,simple physical residency is all that h requires,too.
we disagree with carlson interpretation of.clearly,the plain language of this regulation demonstrates that it defines residence rather than domicile.thus,we must look elsewhere to determine how federal immigration law may preclude establishment of domicile in the united states for purposes of california education code section h.
prior to,california education code provided 
a student who is an adult alien shall be entitled to resident classification if he has been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence in accordance with all applicable laws of the united states provided,that he has had residence in the state for more than one year after such admission prior to the residence determination date for the semester,quarter or term for which he proposes to attend an institution.
cal.repealed,cal.stat.in,the california legislature repealed section and replaced it with current section h.
it is apparent that it did so in response to the supreme court decision in toll moreno,d.see cal.atty op.reprinted as appendix in regents of the of cal.superior court,d.in toll,the court held that a similar maryland provision that limited resident tuition status to united states citizens and immigrant aliens,aliens admitted to permanent residence violated the supremacy clause,because the state thereby imposed additional burdens not contemplated by congress on nonimmigrant aliens whose visa status permitted them to establish united states domicile.at.the language of h was drawn directly from toll 
the immigration and nationality act recognizes two basic classes of aliens,immigrant and nonimmigrant.with respect to the nonimmigrant class,the act establishes various categories,the plaintiffs category among them.for many of these nonimmigrant categories,congress has precluded the covered alien from establishing domicile in the united states.but significantly,congress has allowed aliens to enter the country on terms permitting the establishment of domicile in the united states.
id.at.emphasis added internal citations omitted.
in a prior related case,elkins moreno,d,the supreme court contrasted nonimmigrant classes such as the class with other nonimmigrant classes for whom congress expressly conditioned admission on an intent not to abandon a foreign residence or,by implication,on an intent not to seek domicile in the united states.id.at.the court proceeded to observe that,
b y including restrictions on intent in the definition of some nonimmigrant classes,congress must have meant aliens to be barred from these classes if their real purpose in coming to the united states was to immigrate permanently i t is also clear that congress intended that,in the absence of an adjustment of status,nonimmigrants in restricted classes who sought to establish domicile would be deported.
id.at.the court concluded,however,that congress did not impose restrictions on intent for nonimmigrants in the class,and,thus,congress was willing to allow such aliens to adopt the united states as their domicile.id.at.accordingly,in order to determine if carlson is precluded by section h from establishing california residence for tuition purposes,we must determine whether congress conditioned carlson admission into the united states on an intent not to abandon a foreign residence or otherwise on an intent not to seek domicile in the united states.id.at.
the tn visa category was created pursuant to section d of annex of nafta,which provides that e ach party shall grant temporary entry and provide confirming documentation to a business person seeking to engage in a business activity at a professional level if the business person otherwise complies with existing immigration measures applicable to temporary entry.north american free trade agreement,emphasi
