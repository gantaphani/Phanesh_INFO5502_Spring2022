facts shown by the evidence.
the school is a nonprofit corporation.it owns and operates the california lutheran high school,a private religious school in wildomar.the school is affiliated with the evangelical lutheran synod els and the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels.

the school requires students to pay tuition fees for the school year,it charged students and other students.failure to pay tuition may result in suspension.
the school allows members of the public to buy tickets to its football games and other sporting events.at football games,it sells food,beverages,and spirit items.it sells advertising space in its yearbook to lutherans and alike.it holds auctions and golf tournaments that are open to the public.it has also rented portions of its campus,such as the gymnasium or the football field,to outside organizations for their events.
lutherans believe that homosexuality is a sin.the school has a policy of refusing admission to homosexual students.its christian conduct rule provided that a student could be expelled for engaging in immoral or scandalous conduct,whether on or off campus.this would include homosexual conduct.
the school enrollment application,which was supposed to be signed by both the student and a parent,provided in attaching their signatures to this application,both student and parent acknowledge their understanding that admission to california lutheran high school places the student under the policies and regulations of the school and obliges both student and parent to accept and to cooperate with those policies and regulations.
in early september,a student at the school reported to a teacher that one unnamed female student had said that she loved another unnamed female student.the reporting student added that,if the teacher looked at these female students myspace pages,he would be able to find out who they were and how they felt about each other.
the teacher then reviewed the myspace pages of all female students on the class roster,including plaintiffs myspace pages.mary roe went by the screen name,scandalous love jane doe went by the screen name,truely sic in with you.on their myspace pages,plaintiffs referred to being in love with each other.in addition,mary roe myspace page listed her sexual orientation as bi.jane doe listed hers as not sure.
as a result,on september,pastor bork,the principal of the school,called a meeting of the school disciplinary committee.the committee agreed that pastor bork should talk to plaintiffs immediately and ask them if the report was true if it was,they should be suspended.
that same day,pastor bork had plaintiffs taken out of class and brought to separate rooms in the school office.he then questioned each of them,asking them whether they were bisexual,whether they had kissed each other,and whether they had done anything inappropriate.at one point,according to mary roe,he got very close and he said,have you ever touched jane doe in any inappropriate ways and he looked me up and down when he asked that.
according to pastor bork,both girls admitted that they loved each other,that they had hugged and kissed each other,and that they had told other students that they were lesbians he therefore suspended them and had their parents come pick them up.
throughout this time,plaintiffs were not free to leave.however,while they were waiting for their parents to pick them up,they were allowed to go to the restroom and to their lockers.
on september,pastor bork sent plaintiffs parents letters stating that plaintiffs had been suspended because they had a bond of intimacy characteristic of a lesbian relationship,in violation of the christian conduct rule.on october,by a unanimous vote of the school board of directors,the school expelled plaintiffs for engaging in a homosexual relationship.
lutherans also believe that women should not be placed in a position of authority over men.accordingly,only men serve on the school board of directors,which is responsible for expulsions.plaintiffs allege that,as a result,female students have been disciplined more harshly than male students.their evidence showed that some male students had been involved in incidents of drug or alcohol possession or use that had resulted in,at most,temporary suspensions.

the summary judgment 
plaintiffs challenge the propriety of the summary judgment with respect to each of their causes of action.accordingly,we begin by discussing the applicable standard of review,which we will then apply to plaintiffs causes of action in succession.
standard of review.
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.merrill navegar,cal th,d.i n moving for summary judgment,a defendant has met his burden if he has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.we review the trial court decision de novo citations.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d.
causes of action for violation of the unruh act.
first,plaintiffs challenge the summary judgment with respect to their causes of action under the unruh act.they contend that the trial court erred by ruling that the school was not a business enterprise subject to the act.
preliminarily,plaintiffs argue that the trial court ruling conflicts with previous rulings in the case.early on,defendants demurred on multiple grounds,including that the school was not a business enterprise under the unruh act the trial court overruled the demurrer on this ground.moreover,when defendants sought writ review of that ruling,this court summarily denied their petition.however,because the demurrer concerned the pleadings,whereas the motion for summary judgment concerned the evidence,the two rulings were not inconsistent.leo piazza paving foundation constructors,d,fn.moreover,even assuming they were,the statutory limitations on reconsideration code civ,did not apply hence,the trial court had plenary authority to change its mind.le francois goel cal th,d.finally,our order denying a writ did not establish the law of the case.kowis howard cal th,d.accordingly,we turn to the merits.
following the lead of our supreme court in similar cases,w e emphasize at the outset that our resolution of the legal issue before us does not turn upon our personal views as to the wisdom or morality of the exclusionary policy challenged in this case.instead,our task involves a question of statutory interpretation.warfield peninsula golf country club cal th,d.
the general policy embodied in civil code section can be traced to the early common law doctrine that required a few,particularly vital,public as privately owned toll bridges,ferryboats,and serve all members of the public without arbitrary discrimination.citation.after the united states supreme court,in the civil rights cases,invalidated the first federal public accommodation statute,california joined a number of other states in enacting its own initial public accommodation statute,the statutory predecessor of the current version of section.citation.t he statute,by its terms,specifically granted the right to full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities and privileges in a number of specifically designated enterprises,as well as in all other places of public accommodation or amusement.
in,in apparent response to a number of appellate court decisions that had concluded the public accommodation statute did not apply to the refusal of a private cemetery,a dentist office,and a private school to make their facilities available to patrons citations,the legislature undertook,through enactment of the unruh civil rights act,to revise and expand the scope of the version of section as ultimately enacted in,the relevant paragraph of section provided all citizens within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their race,color,religion,ancestry,or national origin are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.citation.in subsequent years,this paragraph of section was amended to add sex and disability to the specified categories of prohibited discrimination citations,but the paragraph otherwise has not been altered.warfield peninsula golf country club,supra,cal th at,d.
an organization is not excluded from the scope of civil code section simply because it is nonprofit.citation.hart cult awareness network th,d.thus,cases have held that business establishments included a nonprofit religious corporation that sold advertisements in a christian yellow pages pines tomson d.a homeowners association that perform ed all the customary business functions of a landlord village green owners cal d,a club that offered its members substantial commercial advantages and business benefits rotary club of duarte board of directors d.see id.at.and a club that operated a recreation center open to all local male children isbister boys club of santa cruz,cal d.
two cases decided by the california supreme court afford particularly apt illustrations of what what is business establishment within the meaning of the unruh act.first,in warfield peninsula golf country club,supra,cal th,d,the court held that a nonprofit golf and country club was a business establishment.it conceded that,at least as a general matter,the statute does not apply to truly private social clubs.id.at,d.it concluded,however,that the business transactions that are conducted regularly on the club premises with persons who are not members of the club are sufficient in themselves to bring the club within the reach of the act.id.at,d.
the court explained a lthough the record indicates that defendant financial support comes primarily from dues and fees paid by its members,the club derives a significant amount of revenue,as well as indirect financial benefit,from the use of its facilities,and the purchase of goods and services on its premises,by persons who are not members of the club.because such business transactions with nonmembers are conducted on a regular and repeated basis and constitute an integral part of the club the members own financial contributions and reducing the dues and fees that members otherwise would be required to pay in order to maintain the club facilities and conclude that the club falls within the very broad category of business establishments governed by the nondiscrimination mandate of section.warfield peninsula golf country club,supra,cal th at,d.
by contrast,in curran mount diablo council of the boy scouts cal th,d,the court held that,with regard to its membership decisions,the boy scouts of america is not a business establishment within the meaning of the unruh civil rights act.id.at,d,see also id.at,fn,d.it acknowledged that the term business establishments must properly be interpreted in the broadest sense reasonably possible citation id.at,d.nonetheless,no prior decision has interpreted the business establishments language of the act so expansively as to include the membership decisions of a charitable,expressive,and social organization,like the boy scouts,whose formation and activities are unrelated to the promotion or advancement of the economic or business interests of its members.citation.id.at,d.
the court went on to explain i n light of the legislative history demonstrating that the unruh civil rights act was intended to extend the reach of california prior public accommodation statute,the very broad business establishments language of the act reasonably must be interpreted to apply to the membership policies of an a charitable organization that lacks a significant the entity attributes and activities demonstrate that it is the functional equivalent of a classic place of public accommodation or amusement.citation.
h owever,we do not believe that the circumstance that the boy scouts is generally nonselective in its admission policies,and affords membership to a large segment of the public,is itself sufficient to demonstrate that the organization reasonably can be characterized as the functional equivalent of a traditional place of public accommodation or amusement.the record establishes that the boy scouts is an organization whose primary function is the inculcation of a specific set of values in its youth members,and whose recreational facilities and activities are complementary to the organization primary pu
