background 
claiming that their son,loren,suffers a nonverbal learning disability,his parents requested that the atlanta public schools aps accommodate him under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,and section of the rehabilitation act of section,et.deeming aps efforts inadequate,they removed him from an aps school and him,then unsuccessfully pursued aps for reimbursement administratively and in district court.
they now appeal,inter alia,the district court denial of their reimbursement claim for convenience,we will simply refer to loren.we preliminarily note a substantial divergence between the administrative and district court rulings below.also,loren presents us with several procedural,jury trial right issues.we therefore find it useful to first review some governing legal principles before discussing the merits.
ii.analysis 
idea governing standards 
the idea guarantees disabled students a free and appropriate public education fape.sch.bd.of collier county,cir.a fape is defined as special education services that 
a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge 
b meet the standards of the state educational agency 
c include an appropriate preschool,elementary,or secondary school education in the state involved and 
d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section d 
although the idea reflects a structural preference in favor of providing special education in public schools,it recognizes that certain public schools are unable or unwilling to provide appropriate special education services.the idea,therefore,provides that the cost of the private school may be reimbursed if the public school did not make a fape available to the child in a timely manner.a c ii.
to provide a fape,a school formulates an individual educational plan iep during a meeting between the student parents and school officials.see d a b knox county,cir.an iep must be amended if its objectives are not met,d revise it at least annually if deficient kings local sch,bd.of educ.zelazny,cir,but perfection is not required.cjn minneapolis pub,cir,at.
courts thus ask whether the school complied with the idea procedures and the iep developed through those procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefits vashon island sch,cir citing board of educ.rowley,d.a yes answer to both questions ends judicial review.white ascension parish sch,cir citing rowley,at.
a no answer means no fape was provided due to,for example,a deficient iep,thus enabling the student to resort to private school and seek reimbursement from the school district under a c ii.rafferty cranston pub.sch,cir see also id.court also must find the private school placement proper.
even where a fape is not provided,courts can nevertheless deny reimbursement if a parent own actions frustrated the school efforts see mm sch.dist.of greenville county,cir school district not idea liable for its failure to timely complete iep where parents ceased to cooperate in iep completion,preferring to place child in private school doe defendant i,cir parent could not complain that school district failed to complete a timely iep when iep was attributable to parent request that school allow student to perform on his own for a while see also doe.of,cir.
courts also can deny or reduce reimbursement if parents otherwise act unreasonably,see a c iii iii d upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents,or if parents fail to give the school proper notice that they reject the school iep are removing their child from the school a c iii i d see also voluntown bd.of,cir.
as the losing part y before the district court,loren bear s the burden of demonstrating that the aps did not comply with the idea.fed.way sch,cir see also devine indian river county sch,cir.
we review district court idea decisions under the standards set forth in,at whether an iep provides a fape is a mixed question of fact and law subject to de novo review,and walker county sch.dist.bennett,cir statutory interpretations are reviewed de novo.
contrary to loren contention,summary judgment in idea cases has been deemed appropriate even when facts are in dispute,and is based on a preponderance of the evidence.beth van clay,cir.that is why the district court decision is perhaps better described as judgment on the record.see also slama indep.sch.dist,d,on motion for judgment on the record in an idea suit,the district court may make a decision on the merits,even if there exist,upon the stipulated r ecord,disputed issues of material fact citation omitted.
that means that the usual civ.summary judgment principles do not apply in an idea case this is not surprising because no idea jury trial right exists.see whitehead sch.bd.for hillsborough,because only injunctive relief and equitable damages are allowed under the idea,there is no jury trial right for idea claimants.the district court often conducts a bench trial on a stipulated record.slama,d at quotes and cite omitted.
while many courts cite to the commonly applied rule standards without acknowledging these distinctions,see,southington bd.of,cir,we find nothing to prevent district judges from factfinding under civ.in idea on a record bearing evidence tendered in addition to the idea administrative to the requirement that they accord due weight to administrative findings 
reimbursement,after all,is a matter of equitable relief,committed to the sound discretion of the district court roland concord sch,cir cites omitted emphasis added,see also kurz chase manhattan bank,d,if the award of statutory damages is seen as representing equitable relief then it should go without saying that no right to a jury attaches to claims for equitable relief quotes,cite and alterations omitted,so no right exists on that score.and factfinding is not limited to bench trials involving live witnesses.see anderson city of bessemer city,d absent clear error,a district court factfindings can not be overturned even if they do not rest on credibility determinations,but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.
finally,in deferring to the administrative law judge alj,the district court must receive and thus review the records of the state administrative proceedings.i b i.where the district court does not receive any additional evidence or testimony,this court stands in the same shoes as the district court in reviewing the administrative record and may,therefore,accept the conclusions of the alj and district court that are supported by the record and reject those that are not,at.
loren iep rejection 
loren attended an aps school through the sixth grade,then private school for the seventh and eighth grades.in,midway through the eighth grade,his parents took him to pamela frey,a psychologist who diagnosed him with a nonverbal learning disability nld.
on,loren mother submitted his application to a private school for the ninth grade.the second page of the application includes the following text if you are seeking funding from your school district,please check here.next to the box,which is checked,loren mother wrote but can pay without funding from school.the printed text of the application further reads please note your advocate name and phone number if applicable and where you are in the process at this time.beneath this text,loren mother wrote jon.have met with zimring and plan to meet with school reps in weeks.zimring expects to be able to complete process by end of this academic year.
despite the fact that loren was currently enrolled in private school and had a pending application at a private high school,loren mother contacted aps on,via telephone,and expressed an interest in her son in public school.in a letter on,loren mother informed aps that she wanted to enroll her son in public school and that he would need special education services.also in the letter,loren mother requested a meeting with battle,an administrator for aps special education needs,to register loren and begin to discuss the accommodations and services that he will need.with the end of the school year being so near,i feel it is very important that we meet as soon as possible.the letter then went on to describe her scheduling constraints for such a meeting.specifically,the letter states that,i will be out of town from april,but could meet with you tuesday,april,after am,or after i return to atlanta.i do not work on tuesday afternoons but with enough notice could meet you on another day.
on,loren parents met informally with aps.due to the scheduling constraints of loren parents and darlene brooks,loren special education advocate,the parties did not meet again until.at the meeting,the participants reviewed loren case and discussed the concerns of loren parents.a timetable was set for loren evaluation concerning his eligibility for special education programs.loren mother also gave her written consent to the evaluations and was set for a meeting to determine her son eligibility for special education and to develop an iep.
the next day,an aps pathologist began assessing loren but was not able to complete the assessment because loren father told the aps pathologist that he and loren had to leave.however,aps completed an ot evaluation,and a learning disability teacher conducted math and reading assessments,while an aps psychologist was to contact frey to discuss her evaluation and diagnosis of loren.
on,the parents and aps personnel reconvened to discuss loren special education services availability and,if appropriate,to write an iep.by then,however,certain evaluations had not been completed and the school system had not had the opportunity to observe loren in the classroom.therefore,the group formulated an interim iep.during the next days,then,classroom observations and evaluations would be completed,after which the group would reconvene.
loren parents did not sign the interim iep.neither,however,did they reject it.the school added an addendum to the iep minutes,however,acknowledging the parents contention that aps lacked a program and training for handling nld students.loren mother fisher attests that no personnel qualified to implement what loren needed ever contacted her through loren first week of school.
loren started school at southside on but left after five days,never to return.on,fisher sent aps a letter rejecting the iep and informing aps that loren would be attending private school.she,in essence,stated her belief that the school could not meet her son needs.this was the parents first formal iep rejection notice to the aps.
the aps points to evidence reflecting its attempts,starting on,to contact fisher to arrange a meeting to review loren iep.this and subsequent attempts to contact her,it claims,proved fruitless.fisher admits she received an aps letter announcing that it would contact her to arrange an iep meeting,but denies receiving a communication from the aps until it communicated with her attorney in april.
fisher does not contend that she ever attempted to contact aps after withdrawing loren from school on.rather,she explains that she did not do so because aps letter stated that it would contact her.she claims she never received any communications from the aps after.thus,factual issues exist as to precisely what communications,or attempted communications,occurred after but before.
we do know that after loren parents removed him from the aps,they formally challenged his iep and sought tuition reimbursement through an administrative hearing request on.on,the alj ruled in the aps favor,finding that the parents had failed to provide the aps with sufficient notice of their rejection of loren iep and their intention to private place him,as required by c iii i,and also failed to provide the aps with a reasonable chance to accommodate loren.
specifically,the alj concluded that the fact that loren parents removed loren from aps after only five days meant that loren parents can not,as a matter of law,establish that aps failed to provide loren with fape that is,the fact that loren parents gave the interim iep only five days meant that loren parents failed to give the iep a chance to succeed,and thus can not establish that aps failed to provide loren with a fape.according to the alj,
t his is particularly true where loren had not been enrolled in aps for two years,and had never demonstrated previously any need for special education and related services.indeed,because of an utter lack of information regarding loren needs and abilities,the iep in question was an interim diagnostic designed to provide aps with the opportunity to observe loren in the classroom and gather baseline data,and to conduct evaluations,in order to assess the exact nature of loren disability and create appropriate programming to meet his individual needs where aps had promptly responded to loren requests and was taking the appropriate steps to educate loren,it can not be said to have denied him fape.
the alj also concluded that it is beyond dispute that loren parents never gave aps the requisite notice of their rejection of the iep until after loren had been withdrawn from school and enrolled in the private school in vermont.that is,loren mother did not provide aps with notice of her rejection of the iep and her intent to enroll loren in private school.according to the alj,
the parents refused to respond to aps entreaties to discuss and,if appropriate,modify loren programming,nor did loren mother contemporaneously request a due process hearing to challenge aps offered iep.instead,the parents waited idle until almost an entire school year had passed,and only then sought a due process hearing to claim the costs of the private placement.
on review before the district court,the aps again prevailed.while finding fault with the alj determination the district judge nevertheless found for the aps on a different loren parents had acted unreasonably as a matter of law.this obviated the need to rule on whether the aps provided him with a fape.
in a later order,the district court rejected the parents proffered supplemental affidavits as,inter alia,untimely,cumulative,prejudicial to the aps,and contrary to precedent cautioning against allowing losing parties to undercut the statutory role of administrative expertise finally,the district court found that loren failed to establish a section claim,then denied his motion.
unreasonableness 
insisting that he qualifies for reimbursement,loren raises a variety of issues on appeal,including whether the district court erred by failing to recognize that his placement was a remedy for the school failure to provide an adequate iep,and thus a fape,and not evidence of unreasonableness.
rather than decide whether aps provided loren with a fape,the district court focused on whether his parents acted unreasonably within the meaning of a c iii iii the cost of reimbursement may be reduced or denied upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents.the district court found it unreasonable that loren mother filled out an application to pine ridge before she contacted aps about enrolling loren in public school.the district court relied on the fact that loren mother indicated on the pine ridge enrollment form that she would be seeking funding from the public school system.
yet,the district court also assum ed good faith on the part of the parents before finding unreasonable their apparent unwillingness to communicate with aps regarding their concerns about his iep and their differences of opinion with aps about its implementation.it further found that i t was also unreasonable for the parents to have acted on the unrealistic expectation that the interim iep could have been perfectly implemented and suited loren needs within the first five days of the school year,prior to the aps completion of its evaluations.at the same time,the judge did not reach the idea notice requirement,a c iii i aa bb.
the record supports loren contention that in some ways his parents did communicate their iep dissatisfaction with the aps.but there is a difference between voicing general dissatisfaction and formally rejecting an iep.and it is arguable that congress sought to compel a definitive rejecti
