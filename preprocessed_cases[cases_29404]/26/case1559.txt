the newly elected president of petitioner tracy educators association,the association requested a leave of absence from her position as a school teacher in order to fulfill her responsibilities for the association.the real parties in interest,tracy unified school district,its governing board and superintendent collectively the district,rejected the request.the association filed a petition for writ of mandate in the respondent superior court seeking to compel the district to grant the leave request,but the superior court denied the petition.because we conclude the district was compelled by education code section,subdivision a hereafter section a to grant the leave request,we shall order the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the respondent superior court to grant the writ petition.
background 
the district employs julie escobedo as a third grade bilingual teacher.in may,escobedo was elected president of the association for a term.on may,escobedo wrote to the district,requesting that she be released from her teaching position,at the start of the school year,to attend to the association business.escobedo stated she would seek a bilingual teacher to share a job with her days a week or possibly every afternoon.escobedo enclosed a copy of a provision of the education code presumably section a,which she asserted authorized her leave request so long as the association reimbursed the district for her release time.
on june,the district rejected escobedo leave request,asserting the district may place reasonable limitations on leaves granted under the education code.the district maintained that a reasonable limitation is the amount of leave authorized for union business by the parties master agreement,up to days or periods of leave.the district further argued that granting escobedo a leave would adversely affect the school bilingual program,its students,its teachers and the district rights and powers.
on june,the association attorneys made an express demand on the district for escobedo leave pursuant to section a.on june,and again on july,the district attorneys responded that the district disagreed with the association interpretation of section a,but would agree to discuss alternatives to allow escobedo to take a reasonable amount of leave time.
on july,the association filed a petition for writ of mandate in the respondent superior court,seeking an order directing the district to grant escobedo leave request for the and school years.during the hearing on the petition,the district conceded that if escobedo had requested a leave of absence the district would have been compelled to grant her request.
on august,the respondent court filed an order denying the petition,explaining petitioner request was not for a leave as contemplated by the sic education code s ection.moreover,the association leave article in the master agreement between the parties does not conflict with the education code it offers benefits not otherwise available under the education code.
on september,the association filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court,seeking an order compelling the respondent superior court to vacate its order denying the writ petition filed in that court and to issue a writ compelling the district to grant escobedo request for a leave.we issued an alternative writ of mandate.
mandamus is appropriate where there is not a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law.code civ.t his court necessarily determined that appeal was not an adequate remedy when it issued the alternative writ citations.given the time that would be consumed by an appeal from the respondent court order denying the association writ petition,escobedo term of office could well expire before this court decision on appeal could become final.
discussion 
the association contends the language of section a requires the district to grant escobedo request for a leave to attend to the business of the association.we agree.
section a includes leaves of absence.
the meaning of section a presents a question of statutory interpretation for us to determine independently.the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislature intent to effectuate the law purpose.in determining intent,we look first to the statute words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning.when the language is unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,however,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,the legislative history,and the ostensible objects to be achieved.
the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.
section a provides in pertinent part the governing board of a school district shall grant to any employee,upon request,a leave of absence without loss of compensation for the purpose of enabling the employee to serve as an elected officer of any local school district public employee organization,or any statewide or national public employee organization with which the local organization is affiliated.
the leave shall include,but is not limited to,absence for purposes of attendance by the employee at periodic,stated,special,or regular meetings of the body of the organization on which the employee serves as an officer 
following the school district payment of the employee for the leave of absence,the school district shall be reimbursed by the employee organization of which the employee is an elected officer for all compensation paid the employee on account of the leave 
the leave of absence without loss of compensation provided for by this section is in addition to the released time without loss of compensation granted to representatives of an exclusive representative by subdivision c of section of the government code.
the legislature choice of the phrase leave of absence in section a rather than leave or time off arguably creates ambiguity.a leave of absence may commonly be understood to refer to a period of extended absence.however,when the words leave of absence are considered in the context of the full text of section a,it is apparent the legislature intended to allow an elected officer of a local school district employee organization to take a leave of absence for any period of time for which the organization is willing to reimburse the school district.
thus,section a,in authorizing leave for the purpose of enabling the employee to serve as an elected officer of the employee organization,necessarily anticipates a broad range of reasons for the employee to take a leave of absence,limited by the purpose of serving as an officer.further,section a provides that t he leave shall include,but is not limited to,absence for purposes of attendance by the employee at periodic,stated,special,or regular meetings of the body of the organization on which the employee serves as an officer.this language reinforces the legislative intent to allow the employee organization to determine the purposes for which leaves of absence are required.this language also demonstrates the legislature intended to authorize leaves of absence of short or infrequent duration,as well as leaves of absence of longer or regular duration.
moreover,for several reasons,the phrase leave of absence can not reasonably be interpreted to refer solely to an extended period of absence.first,such an interpretation would render nugatory the provision that the leave includes,but is not limited to,attendance at meetings.second,the standard legal dictionary definition of leave of absence is a worker temporary absence from employment or duty with the intention to return.salary and seniority normally are u
