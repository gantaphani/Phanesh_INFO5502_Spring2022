this appeal raises two interrelated questions may teachers who serve under provisional credentials be classified as probationary for purposes of the education code and,if so,are such provisionally credentialed teachers entitled to the statutory layoff rights the code provides to fully credentialed probationary teachers 
as part of a reduction in work force,on march,the vallejo city unified school district district sent a letter to certificated,teachers see kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d,kavanaugh notifying them of impending layoffs and advising them of their right to request a hearing to determine if the district decision to terminate their employment was supported by cause.after calculating exactly how many positions it needed to eliminate,the district sent a letter to many teachers rescinding the prior notice and stating their employment would not be terminated after all.at the same time,on april,the district sent a letter to teachers that rescinded the prior layoff notice but nevertheless terminated their employment.the district explained these teachers had erroneously been given the notice that applies to probationary and permanent employees who are to be dismissed pursuant to the layoff statutes instead of following such layoff procedures,the district had decided to release them from employment at the end of the school year and not reemploy them the following year.none of the teachers who received this notice held a clear teaching credential.rather,each of them was either a district intern see,a,or the holder of an emergency teaching permit or a credentials waiver.the parties have stipulated that none of the teachers was being released for a issue or any perceived deficiency.the sole reason for their release was economic considerations.
acting on behalf of the teachers so released,on july,the california teacher association cta filed a petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief in the superior court.cta asserted the teachers were probationary employees who were denied their statutory rights to notice and a hearing under sections and,and as a result were entitled to reinstatement in their positions with backpay and benefits due.the parties reached a stipulation as to nearly all background facts and agreed t he primary issue for determination was whether the provisionally credentialed teachers were entitled to the hearing and preferential reappointment rights afforded to probationary teachers who are dismissed for economic reasons.the trial court determined they were not.the court reasoned the statutory scheme establishing the rights of probationary employees in a layoff presupposes that a teacher is on track to permanent status.because the provisionally credentialed employees here were not,and were not automatically entitled to employment in the ensuing year,the court reasoned the district could release them in the manner it did.
we disagree with the trial court conclusion.because the legislature has sharply limited school districts ability to hire temporary teachers,and there is no evidence the teachers in this case fell within the narrow categories of temporary employment defined in the education code,they fell within the default classification of probationary.the code gives probationary teachers a number of rights and protections,including certain protections in the event of a layoff,and the statutes in question do not distinguish between probationary teachers based on the status of their credentials.accordingly,because the dismissed teachers were denied their statutory rights as probationary employees of the district,we shall reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
discussion 
cta sought a writ of mandate.on appeal,we defer to the trial court factual determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence and independently review the trial court legal conclusions about the meaning and effect of statutory provisions.kavanaugh,supra,cal th at,d,welch oakland unified school dist.th,d.because the trial court here based its decision on purely legal grounds,and did not attempt to resolve any disputed issues of fact,our review is de novo.kavanaugh,supra,cal th at,d.
temporary versus probationary classification 
the education code establishes four possible classifications for certificated employees permanent,probationary,substitute and temporary.taylor board of trustees cal d.the code authorizes the governing boards of school districts to hire,classify,promote and dismiss certificated employees,teachers see,but establishes a complex and somewhat rigid scheme to govern a board exercise of its decisionmaking power.kavanaugh,supra,cal th at,d.in general,this complicated classification system is designed to provide a level of tenure,job security,commensurate with an employee seniority.a certificated teacher classification governs the level of statutory job protection the teacher enjoys and controls the level of procedural protections that apply if he or she is not reelected.in general,permanent employees may not be dismissed unless one or more statutorily enumerated grounds are shown.probationary employees may not be dismissed during the school year except for cause or unsatisfactory performance,but,on timely notice,may be nonreelected without any showing of cause,without any statement of reasons,and without any right of appeal or administrative redress.bellflower education bellflower unified school dist.d.substitute and temporary employees,on the other hand,fill the short range needs of a school district and generally may be summarily released.taylor board of trustees,supra,cal d at.thus,temporary teachers may be dismissed a t the pleasure of the governing board prior to serving during one school year at least percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district are maintained,subd.a,and after that time so long as the temporary employee is notified before the end of the school year,subd.b.kavanaugh,supra,cal th at,d.
classification also determines an employee rights in the context of a layoff.when it becomes necessary,as the result of a reduction or discontinuation of services within a district,to reduce the number of permanent or probationary employees,the district must give notice to the affected employees,setting out reasons for the action and the employees right to a hearing,no later than march,cousins supra,th at,d distinguishing procedure to lay off probationary employees for economic reasons from procedure to nonreelect them for subsequent year gassman governing board cal d,distinguishing procedure to lay off probationary employees for economic reasons from procedure to dismiss them for unsatisfactory performance.if the district fails to give the required notice by march,the employee shall be deemed reemployed for the ensuing school year,subd.c.bakersfield elementary teachers bakersfield city school dist.th,d bakersfield,fn.omitted.an employee who receives such a notice may also request a hearing to determine if there is cause for the layoff,subd.b.layoffs proceed down the classification scheme,in accordance with seniority no permanent employee may be laid off if a probationary employee,or any other employee of less seniority,occupies a position the permanent employee is certificated and competent to fill,subd.c.likewise,a probationary employee may bump another probationary employee with less seniority.seniority is determined as of the date the employee first rendered paid service in a probationary position,italics added.temporary employees therefore do not accrue seniority,and so must be released before probationary employees.bakersfield,supra,th at,d.
finally,the code establishes preferential reappointment rights for permanent and probationary employees who have been released in a layoff,subd.a california teachers mendocino unified school dist.th,d mendocino.for the period of months from the date of termination,any employee shall have the preferred right to reappointment,subject to the prior rights to reappointment by all permanent employees,in the order of original employment,subd.a.temporary first to be released in a layoff bakersfield,supra,th at,d enjoy no such reappointment rights and are not entitled to the formal notice and hearing available to probationary and permanent employees.ibid.temporary employees,unlike permanent and probationary employees,need be given only a more limited form of notice before the end of the school year,and no hearing.given these differences,it is important to determine the proper classification of the teachers whom the district summarily released.
section states governing boards of school districts shall classify as probationary employees,those persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications for the school year,who have not been classified as permanent employees or as substitute employees.although this statute does not mention temporary employees,other provisions of the code authorize that classification in certain narrowly defined situations.bakersfield,supra,th at,d see.section therefore establishes probationary status as the default classification for teachers whom the education code does not require to be classified otherwise.bakersfield,supra,th at,d motevalli los angeles unified school dist.th,d motevalli.
the education code recognizes two general kinds of temporary employees those who are employed to serve for less than three or four months,or in some types of limited,emergency,or temporary assignments or classes see,and those who are employed for up to one year to replace a certificated employee who is on leave or has a lengthy illness see,in addition,persons employed in categorically funded programs or in programs operated by a district under contract are treated like temporary employees in certain respects,as are persons employed as substitute teachers.bakersfield,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.in establishing these narrow categories,the legislature has sought to limit the ability of school districts to classify teachers as temporary employees.id.at,d haase san diego community college dist.d.the legislature has restricted the flexibility of a school district in the continued use of temporary employees citations,for otherwise the benefits resulting from employment security for teachers could be subordinated to the administrative needs of a district.because the substitute and temporary classifications are not guaranteed procedural due process by statute,they are narrowly defined by the legislature,and should be strictly interpreted.balen peralta junior college dist.cal d.
in this appeal,the district does not claim the teachers fell into one of these statutorily defined categories of temporary employees,and the trial court made no factual findings to support such an argument.instead,the district argues these teachers must be classified as temporary,or at least treated as temporary in the present context,due to the terms of their employment contracts and the provisional nature of their credentials neither argument has merit.
the teachers in question were employed in the school year pursuant to a contract of employment.this contract recited that the teacher would be serving under a credential and,once hired,would be classified as a provisional employee pursuant to education code section.provisional is not an employment classification recognized in the education code.the contract characterization of these teachers as provisional thus referenced only the status of their credentials,not their employment classification.see motevalli,supra,th at,d construing a similar contract provision.moreover,contract terms can not supersede the statutory protections for teachers set forth in the education code,including provisions governing their classification and termination.bakersfield,supra,th at,d fine los angeles unified school dist.th,fn,d.any agreement to waive the benefits of these provisions is void.citations.zalac governing bd.of ferndale unified school dist.th,d see also hart federation of teachers william hart union high sch.dist.d.the statutory provisions in the education code,governing the rights of teachers,are an expression of public policy they can not be bargained away either expressly or impliedly.
the district also insists the teachers in this appeal can not be classified as probationary because they held provisional credentials,and time spent teaching under a provisional credential does not count toward a teacher attainment of permanent status.summerfield windsor unified school dist.th,d summerfield.since a provisionally credentialed teacher accrues no credit towards his or her mandatory probationary service,the district reasons such teachers are not on tenure track and thus are not truly probationary.the same argument was made and convincingly rejected by a panel of the fifth district court of appeal in california teachers governing bd.of golden valley unified school dist.th,d golden valley.
in golden valley,a teacher who had been employed for one year under an emergency permit was dismissed just before the start of her second school year.golden valley,supra,th at,d.the school district argued that,because she held only an emergency credential,the teacher was not entitled to the notice and hearing rights afforded to probationary employees.id.at,d see,subd.a requiring days written notice and right to a hearing for midyear dismissals of probationary employees due to unsatisfactory performance.in response,the teacher invoked the default probationary classification of section.golden valley,supra,th at,d.the court observed the education code does not explicitly resolve this dispute.on one hand,the statutory provisions do not explicitly prohibit a teacher with an emergency permit from being classified as a probationary employee.on the other hand,no statutory provision explicitly delineates how teachers with emergency permits should be classified.consequently,we must determine whether the general rule set forth in section concerning when a teacher should be classified as a probationary employee applies to a teacher with an emergency permit,fn.omitted.
after tracing the historical development of education code provisions concerning teacher classification and provisional credentials golden valley,supra,th at,d,the court concluded section applies to teachers serving under an emergency permit as well as fully credentialed teachers,and teachers serving under an emergency permit who satisfy the requirements of section are entitled to the statutory protections governing the dismissal of a probationary employee.id.at,d.although as here the school district relied on section and summerfield to argue provisionally credentialed teachers are not truly probationary,the court observed that the exclusion they,that time served under an emergency permit does not count toward attaining permanent status would not be necessary unless service by teachers with emergency permits was otherwise eligible to be counted id.at,d.thus,the very existence of the exclusion in section implies that teachers with emergency permits can be classified as probationary employees.id.at,d.
a different panel of the fifth district court of appeal recently reaffirmed the golden valley holding.in bakersfield,supra,th at,d,a school district effecting a layoff sent release notices to approximately employees who were considered temporary because they held something less than a full teaching credential.like the district here,the school district made their employees classification dependent upon their level of certification and,further,required all employees without full credentials to sign contracts acknowledging their temporary status.id.at,d.the appellate court explained this view of classification is incorrect rather,a s a general rule,classification and certification operate independently of one another a person who has been determined to be qualified to teach is not a temporary employee simply because he or she is not yet fully accredited,but rather because he or she occupies a position the law defines as temporary.ibid.
just as the district does in this appeal,the school district in bakersfield conflated the concepts of teacher credentialing with classification,reasoning that since teachers working under a provisional credential do not earn credit toward permanent status,whereas probationary employees generally do earn such credit,subd.b,a person working under a provisional credential must by definition be something less than probationary.see bakersfield,supra,th at,fn,d summarizing this line of reasoning.however,golden valley and bakersfield make it clear that a provisionally credentialed teacher may possess some of the rights of probationary employees,such as protections against midyear dismissals and layoffs,although she does not possess others,such as progress toward tenure.bakersfield,supra,th at,fn,d golden valley,supra,th at,d.the education code mandates that teachers be classified as probationary employees if they are not permanent and do not fall within one of the narrowly defined classes of temporary employees.school districts have no discretion to deviate from the code classification scheme.bakersfield,supra,th at,d see eureka teacher board of education d.district can not impose a classification contrary to statutory scheme.the fact that provisionally credentialed teachers do not accrue credit toward tenure is merely an exception to the general rule that after two years a probationary employees attains permanent status,subd.b.nothing in the education code suggests the lesser status of their credentials removes such teachers from the,probationary.
nor do we agree with the district assertion that cases extending summerfield compel a different result.in motevalli,supra,th,d,and culbertson san gabriel unified school dist.th,d culbertson,division three of the second district court of appeal considered whether the notice of reelection paragraph of section,subdivision b applies to teachers serving under an emergency permit.section,subdivision b has two paragraphs of note a tenure paragraph,which provides that a probationary employee becomes permanent when he or she is reelected to a third year after two consecutive years in a position requiring certification qualifications and a notice paragraph,which requires districts to notify probationary employees on or before march of their second consecutive year of the decision whether to reemploy them for a third year and states that,absent timely notice,the employee is deemed reelected.see culbertson,supra,th at,d naming these the tenure and notice paragraphs.because provisionally credentialed teachers do not accrue time toward permanent status summerfield,supra,th at,d,the tenure paragraph can not apply to them.culbertson,supra,th at,d.the question in culbertson and motevalli was whether provisionally credentialed teachers enjoy automatic reelection pursuant to the notice paragraph if they do not receive a notice of nonreelection by march of their second consecutive year.reasoning that the paragraphs of the subdivision are interdependent,the court concluded the employees do not have a right to automatic reelection in these circumstances.motevalli,supra,th at,d culbertson,supra,th at,d.because such employees are not eligible for permanent employment,it would have made no sense to impose early notice and automatic reelection requirements that are part of the progress toward permanency described in section,subdivision b.
notably,neither decision suggests teachers with provisional credentials are something less or other than probationary employees.by its own terms section,subdivision b applies only to probationary employees therefore,the court analysis of this statute for emergency permit holders assumes such a classification is possible.indeed,the motevalli decision expressly concluded the provisionally credentialed teacher in that case was a probationary employee based on the default rule of section.motevalli,supra,th at,d she was a probationary teacher,albeit working under an emergency credential.moreover,the conclusion that provisionally credentialed teachers do not have automatic reelection rights under section,subdivision b does not mean all rights the code affords probationary employees are similarly off limits.the notice and automatic reelection rights provided in section,subdivision b are so closely related to the acquisition of tenure that the legislature has described these concepts in the same subdivision.the same is not true of layoff rights afforded to probationary employees,where,as we shall discuss,tenure is relevant only to the order of termination and reappointment 
accordingly,because the record does not establish that the teachers in this appeal were hired to fill temporary vacancies see,they were probationary employees by operation of law.see bakersfield,supra,th at,d motevalli,supra,th at,d.we next consider whether probationary teachers who hold provisional credentials are entitled to the statutory layoff rights provided to other probationary employees.
ii.layoff rights of probationary teachers with provisional credentials 
the procedures required for economic layoffs are described in sections,and.in this process,the code requires permanent employees to be released after probationary employees,and terminations must proceed in reverse order of the employees seniority,subds.b c.both permanent and probationary employees are entitled to notice of their termination and must be provided with a hearing,upon demand,to determine if there is cause for not reemploying them the following year,subds.a b,subd.c.for two years after an economic layoff,a probationary employee has a preferred right to reappointment,subject only to the prior reappointment rights of permanent employees and probationary employees who have more seniority.see also mendocino,supra,th at,d summarizing the rights of probationary teachers in a layoff.
these statutory rights are expressly provided only to permanent and probationary employees see neumarkel allard d.layoff benefits not available to administrative employees of a county superintendent,but the statutes themselves make no further distinction based on the status of an employee credential.the supreme court has held that districts must follow the layoff statutes when they terminate a probationary employee for purely economic reasons.gassman governing board,supra,cal d at,economically motivated release of a probationary employee had to be conducted under layoff statutes and not as a termination for cause see also board of education round valley teachers,supra,cal th at,d,if the school district terminates a probationary employee because of a decline in pupil attendance,discontinuance of a service,or modification of curriculum,the school district must comply with procedures governing layoffs,including notice,hearing,and rights to reappointment if the work force is reinstated.
arguably,these statutory layoff protections are inconsistent with the conditional nature of probationary employment.a probationary teacher has no vested right to be rehired.turner board of trustees cal d.by labelling sic the position probationary,the legislature had clearly advised the employee that the position is neither vested nor permanent.probation means the teacher is on competence and suitability remaining to be determined.citation.ibid.school districts have complete discretion to release probationary employees at,nonreelect them,without showing cause for the decision and without providing any means of appeal or redress.bellflower education bellflower unified school,supra,d at.
the question of which of these conflicting statutory schemes has employees layoff rights,or districts discretion to nonreelect probationary employees without cause arose in cousins,supra,th,d.in cousins,a school district determined it was necessary to terminate several certificated employees for financial reasons.rather than following the layoff procedures of sections and,the district served the plaintiff,a second year probationary employee,with a notice of nonreelection pursuant to section,subdivision b.cousins,supra,th at,d.the employee argued the district should not be allowed to circumvent her statutory layoff protections by issuing a notice of nonreelection.id.at,d.after tracing the history of statutory provisions concerning layoffs and nonreelection of probationary employees,the court agreed.id.at,d.reading the statutes together,the court concluded the broad nonreelection provisions of section are qualified by the more specific requirements that sections and impose in the context of an economic layoff.cousins,supra,th at,d.a school district may elect not to retain a probationary employee and need not assert a reason for termination but where,as here,it is undisputed that termination was prompted by the conditions described in section decline in daily attendance,reduction or discontinuance of services,modification of curriculum then a school district is obliged to provide appropriate notice and right to a hearing as prescribed by section.layoffs must proceed in accordance with the criteria set forth in section and the procedures prescribed by section.citations.in the event that a permanent or probationary employee is not given the notices and a right to a hearing he or she shall be deemed reemployed for the ensuing school year,subd.c.cousins,supra,th at,d.
the district does not distinguish cousins except to assert it does not apply because the employees here were temporary,not probationary.for reasons discussed previously,this distinction is faulty because the teachers were probationary by operation of law.moreover,we perceive no principled basis for disregarding cousins when the probationary employees involved do not hold full credentials.the holding of cousins had nothing to do with the teacher credentials.rather,purely as a matter of statutory interpretation,the court concluded the specific education code provisions concerning economic layoffs take precedence over the more general rule of nonreelection.cousins,supra,th at,d.there is no reason to think the outcome should be that the nonreelection statute is the teacher who is terminated for economic reasons lacks a full credential.
without any authority directly on point,the district asserts layoff protections are only available to teachers who have a reasonable expectation of continued employment.similarly,the trial court believed the layoff statutes presuppose that a certificated employee term of employment continues to the ensuing year and the employee is on track to permanent status but these arguments prove too much.school districts have discretion to nonreelect any probationary employee,regardless of the type of credential he or she holds.see board of education round valley teachers,supra,cal th at,d,school districts have the absolute right to decide not to reelect probationary teachers without providing cause or other procedural protections.only as of march of a probationary employee second consecutive year does a district lose that discretion because,failing a notice of nonreelection by march of that second year,the employee is automatically reelected into a permanent position,subd.b.until then,no probationary employee has a reasonable expectation of continued employment,nor any reason to believe his or her term of employment continues to the ensuing year.if this were the prerequisite for application of sections and it appears nowhere in the probationary teacher,even one holding a full credential,would be protected in the event of an economic layoff.clearly,such a result would be contrary to the statutory scheme,which grants protections to all probationary employees.see no probationary employee shall be deprived of his or her position any probationary employee whose services have been terminated as provided in section shall have the following rights.if the legislature had meant to limit these rights to probationary employees with full credentials,it could have easily said so 
the code states that employment under a provisional credential may not be counted in computing an employee time toward achieving permanency.beyond this limitation,however,the code does not restrict provisionally credentialed teachers from enjoying rights afforded to their fully credentialed colleagues of the same classification.in the context of a midyear dismissal the decision in golden valley made it clear that,where matters of tenure are not involved,an emergency permit holder is entitled to the same statutory protections as other probationary employees.golden valley,supra,th at,d holding emergency permit holders who satisfy the requirements of section are entitled to the statutory protections governing the dismissal of a probationary employee and rejecting policy arguments against recognizing such protections.
the court that decided golden valley recently reaffirmed this holding and extended it to the context of layoffs,such as we now consider.bakersfield,supra,th,d.after concluding the provisionally credentialed teachers before it were probationary employees,the court stated a probationary employee working under an emergency teaching or specialist permit does not accrue credit toward permanent status summerfield,supra,th,d,but is entitled to the statutory protections accorded such employees in the event of a dismissal for cause or unsatisfactory performance,golden valley,supra,th,d,or a layoff as the result of a reduction in the workforce.bakersfield,supra,th at,d,italics added.we agree with this conclusion.the cases holding emergency permit holders do not have an automatic right of reelection after the second probationary year are consistent with this result because,as these cases observe,the automatic reelection provision of section,subdivision b is closely tied to the same subdivision provision regarding tenure acquisition.motevalli,supra,th at,d culbertson,supra,th at,d.in contrast,the statutory rights of prior notice,a hearing,and preferential reappointment after a termination for economic reasons,are not related to the acquisition of tenure.providing such rights to provisionally credentialed teachers would not contradict the directive in section that time served under such a credential shall not count toward achieving permanent status.
nevertheless,the district and amicus curiae assert it would be unfair and contrary to public policy to require them to provide layoff rights to teachers who lack full credentials.they argue there is a strong policy preference,manifested in provisions of the federal no child left behind act of et for hiring fully credentialed teachers.however,because section requires layoffs to be conducted based upon teachers classification and seniority and section gives teachers a right of preferred reappointment based upon classification and seniority alone,the district imagines it could be required to retain or reappoint provisionally credentialed teachers ahead of fully credentialed teachers who have less seniority.this result could theoretically occur because in california a teacher seniority is determined solely by the date upon which a probationary or permanent employee first rendered paid service in a probationary position.none of the statutes in question conditions seniority on the type of credential an employee holds.as the fifth district court of appeal noted in rejecting the same policy argument,if the legislature had intended that only probationary and permanent employees with a preliminary or clear credential shall acquire seniority,it would not have been difficult to say so but once having determined that certificated employees with less than a regular credential must in certain circumstances be classified as probationary,we can not then overlook the clear directive in section that,as probationary employees,they are entitled to accrue seniority.bakersfield,supra,th at,d.
we would add that school districts enjoy somewhat greater discretion in determining which teachers are released or rehired than the district and amicus curiae let on.although districts must generally conduct layoffs starting with probationary employees who have the least seniority,when multiple employees share the same start as,for example,the beginning of the previous school district shall determine the order of termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof,subd.b.the code also allows districts to take account of a teacher qualifications in making assignments and reassignments as part of a layoff,subd.c the governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any service whi
