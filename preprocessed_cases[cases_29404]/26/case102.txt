plaintiffs appellants ana salazar,marilyn mercado,ana bernardez,jeannette poole,lisa bryant,cherryline stevens,and edna villatoro,plaintiffs brought this class action against defendant appellee arne duncan,in his official capacity as the secretary of the united states department of education doe plaintiffs allege that federal student loans were fraudulently procured on their behalf when the wilfred american educational corporation wilfred beauty schools falsely certified that plaintiffs had an atb from the education they received from wilfred.plaintiffs allege that the doe refusal to temporarily suspend collection of the student loan debt of putative class members,and refusal to send them notice of their potential eligibility for a discharge,was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act apa.the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge granted the doe motion to dismiss,holding that plaintiffs had not adequately alleged a final agency action that may be subject to judicial review.because the district court dismissed the complaint,it also denied plaintiffs motion for class certification as moot.
as a preliminary matter,the doe argues that the case has become moot because all the named plaintiffs wilfred loans have now been discharged.we have jurisdiction to review this case because the plaintiffs had standing when they filed their class action complaint and this case fits into the narrow exception to the mootness doctrine for class action claims that are inherently transitory.exercising our jurisdiction to review plaintiffs apa challenge,we hold that plaintiffs are entitled to judicial review because there is sufficient law to apply to the challenged agency decisions.the text of the relevant statute directs that the doe shall discharge a borrower loan liability when a school has falsely certified a student atb.doe regulations and informal agency guidance direct that the doe shall temporarily suspend collection on loans and notify borrowers of their possible eligibility for a discharge when the doe has reliable information that a borrower may be eligible for discharge.we therefore hold that plaintiffs claims are judicially reviewable under the apa.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
background 
statutory and regulatory structure of student loan discharge 
title iv of the higher education act of hea,provides the statutory authorization for federal student loans,including both federal family education loans ffel,id.et and william ford federal direct loans direct loans,id.et.under the ffel program,private lenders issue subsidized student loans,which are then insured by guaranty agencies a state or private organization,which,in turn,are insured by the doe.id.b c defining guaranty agency.under the direct loans program,the government lends money to students directly.
to qualify for federal educational financial assistance under either loan program,a student must attend an eligible institution and must have a high school diploma or recognized equivalent.if the student lacks a diploma,the institution must demonstrate the student has an atb from the training that she would receive using the financial aid.a,d.the particulars of how a school must demonstrate that the student has an atb have changed over the years however,a student generally must pass a standardized test.see e dep t of,gen,dear colleague letter,at dcl summarizing changes in atb requirements between and.
the atb test,which between and was based on criteria developed by private accrediting agencies and could be administered and evaluated by the school itself,proved to be a target of fraud some schools falsified results or never even gave prospective students the test.see dep t of,gen,dear colleague letter,at.although after,the atb tests had to be approved by the doe and independently administered,and after the doe specified a required score,fraudulent atb testing continued unabated.see dep t of,gen,dear colleague letter,at june dcl at gov t accountability office,gao,proprietary schools stronger department of education oversight needed to help ensure only eligible students receive federal student aid through separate investigations at proprietary schools,we,along with other federal and state investigative agencies,found test administrators or school officials violating rules to ensure prospective students without high school diplomas passed required tests and obtained access to title iv aid.
similarly,the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations report found that students were the victims of unscrupulous and dishonest school operators of private,trade and other vocational institutions that provide postsecondary education that leav e them with huge debts and little or no education.abuses in federal student aid programs,at.the subcommittee also found that a virtually complete breakdown in effective regulation and oversight had opened the door for fraud,abuse,and other serious problems at every level,at.
in response to these findings of pervasive fraud in federal student loans and contentions of lack of adequate supervision by doe,congress passed a statute in directing that the secretary of the united states doe secretary shall discharge the borrower liability on the loan including interest and collection fees by repaying the amount owed on the loan if the borrower received a federal student loan on or after january,and the student eligibility to borrow under this part was falsely certified by the eligible institution.july,codified at emphasis added.additionally,the statute provides that a borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded from receiving additional grants,loans,or work assistance for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible and that the borrower must have her adverse credit history repaired.c.
to implement the statute,the secretary issued two similar regulations,one to govern the ffel program and one to govern the direct loans program.both state that the secretary shall discharge the borrower liability on a loan made after when the student eligibility to borrow under this part was falsely certified.id.a,c see e governing discharge of ffel program loans due to false certification governing discharge of federal direct loans due to false certification.these regulations include obligations to ensure that the congressional directive is fulfilled by the guaranty agencies that administer the ffel program and by the doe,which is the final insurer of the ffel program and administers the direct loans program.
the regulation governing the ffel program provides that 
i f the guaranty agency receives information it believes to be reliable indicating that a borrower whose loan is held by the agency may be eligible for a discharge under paragraph e false certification by a school of a student eligibility to borrow of this section,the agency shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the loan was made but may continue to receive borrower payments,and inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.
e ii emphasis added.although it speaks of the guaranty agency,that regulation also implicates the obligations of the doe because,as our court has recognized,i t is the obligation of the department of education to see that the role of guaranty agencies is properly performed.mcnamee,lochner,titus williams,higher educ.assistance,cir.the doe accepts that the ffel regulation also applies to the doe for the purposes of this litigation 
another regulation speaks directly to the doe obligations under the direct loan program,stating 
if the secretary determines that a borrower direct loan may be eligible for a discharge under this section,the secretary mails the borrower a disclosure application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge.the secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan.the secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.
d emphasis added.although the language in the two regulations is slightly different,the doe has acknowledged that the ffel and direct loan regulations on false certification discharges have the same rules with respect to a discharge based on an improper determination of the student.federal family education loan ffel program and william ford federal direct loan program,proposed july,to be codified at pts,
in addition to the statute and regulations,the doe has issued dear colleague letters dcls to provide additional guidance about discharges based on a school fraudulent determination of a student atb.two dcls provide specific guidance concerning the evidence that guaranty agencies and the doe should consider to determine whether a borrower atb was falsely certified and thus whether the loan should be discharged.dcl dep t of,fp,dear colleague letter dcl.
the secretary,as the head of the doe,is required to try to collect federally guaranteed student loan debt.see a.the secretary is authorized to take a variety of actions in order to collect a debt,including charging interest,fees,and penalties reporting debts to consumer reporting agencies garnishing wages and imposing offsets.imposing an offset allows an administrative agency to withhold government funds otherwise due to an individual,such as social security payments or tax refunds,to pay an outstanding debt owed to the government.see,lockhart united states,d upholding the government withholding of individual social security payments to offset a debt owed on a federally reinsured student loan incurred between.the doe regulations require that when garnishing wages or imposing an offset the secretary must provide written notice to the debtor with certain enumerated information.the regulations do not require this notice to include any information about the possibility of discharging debt that was incurred through fraudulent certification.
ii.factual background 
plaintiffs are former students of a chain of beauty schools run by wilfred.each alleges that wilfred fraudulently certified that she was eligible for federal student aid by falsely certifying that she had the atb from a wilfred program.all of their loans were initiated under the ffel program however,some borrowers later consolidated their ffel loans under the direct loan program.plaintiffs allege that the doe knows that wilfred fraudulently certified the eligibility of a large percentage of borrowers,but has failed to notify plaintiffs that they may be eligible for relief and has continued to collect on their loans.plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and a proposed class consisting of many thousands of individuals whose eligibility for federal student loans was falsely certified by the wilfred schools beginning in.ja.
wilfred began as a small chain of schools offering vocational training in professions.by the late,it had expanded to a nationwide chain of campuses,with over students enrolled annually.between and,wilfred received million in federal student aid,which accounted for between and percent of wilfred revenue.according to the doe,at least ffel program loans were issued to wilfred students between and.plaintiffs allege that wilfred targeted and recruited immigrants and economically disadvantaged individuals for enrollment in its schools.ja.
the facts alleged by the named plaintiffs include examples of the fraud that plaintiffs allege is common to the class.according to the complaint,not one of the named plaintiffs was ever asked if she had a high school diploma or its equivalent.further,no named plaintiff was given a test to determine if she had the ability to benefit from the wilfred program,as required in lieu of a high school diploma.several plaintiffs allege that the wilfred campus they attended was closed without advance notice,making it impossible for them to complete the program.
each named plaintiff has a student loan that was paid directly to wilfred.each had her federal income tax refund seized to pay the debt on her student loan at the direction of the doe,and at least one also had her wages garnished at the direction of the doe.at the time the lawsuit was filed,all named plaintiffs continued to be burdened with the responsibility for their loans and to suffer consequences of that indebtedness.many allege that the wilfred student debt ruined their credit scores,making it impossible for them to obtain credit to pay for basic necessities.outstanding wilfred debt has also made plaintiffs unable to access educational opportunities decades after they were the victims of fraud.
a.the named plaintiffs 
plaintiff ana salazar alleges that she was recruited to attend wilfred in late.she did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.salazar did not speak english,but was told she qualified and was given forms to sign in english.the wilfred school she attended closed without warning,and she was unable to finish the program.she made payments toward her wilfred debt for thirteen years,pursuant to a payment plan arranged with collectors of the debt.the irs seized her federal income tax refund approximately five times at the direction of the doe.salazar never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.she applied to the doe for a loan discharge on april,and her discharge was granted on september.
plaintiff marilyn mercado dropped out of school in junior high and enrolled in wilfred academy at age seventeen.she did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.although she completed the program,she was unable to obtain a job as a hair cutter,the field that wilfred purported to train her for,because she was not adequately trained to cut hair and not prepared to pass the cosmetology license test.mercado ultimately defaulted on the debt.she is not able to obtain an extension of credit,and the irs seized her federal income tax refund to pay the debt.she never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.mercado applied to the doe for a loan discharge on april,and her discharge was granted on june.
plaintiff ana bernardez alleges that she inquired about a wilfred educational program in,and she was told that the only requirement for enrollment was a social security number,and that it would cost only a few hundred dollars.bernardez did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.she did not understand that she had taken out a loan until she tried to obtain a loan years later to cover the cost of furniture.the irs seized her federal tax refunds approximately five times.she never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.bernardez applied to the doe for a loan discharge on april,and her discharge was granted on october.
in,plaintiff jeannette poole gave her personal information to a representative of the wilfred academy,who said he would use it to determine if she qualified for loans to cover the cost of the program.poole did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.after receiving information from the wilfred representative,she told the representative that she did not want to enroll in the program or take out a loan.she was homeless and sleeping in an abandoned building at the time and did not want to take on debt.even though she never attended any wilfred program,wilfred took out two loans in her name without her knowledge.because these loans went into default,poole was unable to enroll in a business training program at a community college over a decade later.further,her credit was impaired so she was not able to receive credit for necessities such as repairing her living quarters damaged by a flood.additionally,the irs seized her federal tax refund despite her attempts to contest the loan.she never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.poole applied to the doe for a loan discharge on april,and her discharge was granted on may.
plaintiff edna villatoro enrolled in a wilfred academy in new jersey.she did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.the wilfred representative told villatoro that the school offered ged classes,but a ged teacher was never provided.after completing the wilfred program,villatoro learned that to apply for a cosmetologist license in new jersey she needed a high school diploma or its equivalent.she never obtained a license.the irs seized her federal income tax refund.she never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.villatoro applied to the doe for a loan discharge to the doe on april,and her discharge was granted on june.
plaintiff lisa bryant attended a wilfred school in houston,texas in.she did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.a wilfred representative told bryant that if she did not find a job within six months after graduation her loan money would be refunded.she attended the school for three months,until one day she arrived for class and was told by a security guard that the school was closed.she never received any correspondence about the closure.the irs seized byrant federal income tax refunds at least four times.she never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.she has never been able to obtain a credit card or take out a loan to buy a car or a home because of the wilfred debt.bryant applied to the doe for a loan discharge on may,and her discharge was granted on june.
plaintiff cherryline stevens enrolled in a wilfred school in queens,new york in.stevens did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent and was not given an atb test.although she completed the program,the school never gave her an official diploma,which is necessary to get a cosmetologist license.approximately eight years ago,stevens started working at queens village day care and the doe garnished her wages to pay her student debt.she has also had her federal tax refund seized at least three times.she never received any communication from the doe informing her of the availability of a false certification discharge.at the time the lawsuit was filed stevens was continuing to make monthly payments towards her student debt.stevens applied to the doe for a loan discharge on april,and her discharge was granted on june.
b.the class allegations 
the doe estimates that over student loans were given to individuals to attend wilfred schools.plaintiffs allege that their factual allegations are common to the class and that the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class because wilfred routinely falsely certified students as eligible for federally guaranteed student loans even though the certified students did not have a valid high school diploma or ged,and wilfred did not give them ability to benefit tests and certified that the students had taken and passed an approved atb test when they had not.ja.all members of the putative class suffered harm because they paid money towards the debt incurred interest,penalties and collection fees had their federal income tax refunds seized their wages garnished and had their credit damaged.plaintiffs also allege that the majority of class members are,and have always been,unaware of the availability of a false certification discharge,that defendant has or had information in his possession demonstrating that specific loans were falsely certified by wilfred,and that the doe had and has knowledge of wilfred bad practices,including its pattern of falsely certifying students loan eligibility,and information indicating that current or former wilfred borrowers may be eligible for a discharge.ja.
in support of the motion for class certification,plaintiffs counsel avers that counsel spoke with fifty individuals whose eligibility for federally guaranteed students loans was falsely certified by ten different wilfred schools,and that n one of these individuals had been aware of the existence of the false certification discharge or that they were qualified for a false certification discharge of their federally guaranteed wilfred loans until they were referred to counsel,or until counsel advised them of it.ja.
c.the doe investigation of wilfred 
the doe began investigating wilfred fraud as early as the.in,the doe found five wilfred schools ineligible for continued participation in the federally guaranteed loan program.the doe office of inspector general oig investigated the financial aid practices of wilfred schools in massachusetts in,wilfred florida schools in,and wilfred schools nationwide by.the oig and the united states department of justice doj formed a joint federal task force to investigate wilfred principals and employees.the doj brought criminal prosecutions against wilfred,its officers,and individual employees for financial aid fraud,false certification,racketeering,wire fraud,embezzlement,making false statements,and other crimes,resulting in the conviction of wilfred,along with its president and other employees,for financial aid fraud and defrauding the federal government.in december,the doe attempted to terminate wilfred schools from the federally guaranteed loan program,but this attempt was defeated on procedural grounds.wilfred filed for chapter bankruptcy in may,and the last wilfred school ceased operation in.
in the doe issued a report titled documentation of atb violations,based on oig reports of approximately wilfred schools.ja.the report concluded that wilfred c onsistent pattern of gross violations of doe regulations in multiple programs over multiple years indicates a strong resistance to following doe regulations for administering funds and atb student testing.violations appeared system wide.ja.the report recommended that s ince the corporation was cited as early as june for improper grading practices it is recommended that all atb applications be discharged.id.
due to these widespread findings of fraud in wilfred schools,the doe has a policy of granting all facially valid discharge claims from wilfred students.ja letter from chad keller,supervisory program mgmt.analyst,fed.student aid,dep t of,to jane greengold stevens,dir.of litig,legal assistance grp,see ja declaration of chad keller.but with the exception of former students who attended the philadelphia campus of wilfred between july,and,the doe has refused to temporarily cease collection on federally guaranteed student loans attributable to wilfred or to notify all students who attended wilfred schools of their potential eligibility for a permanent discharge if the school falsely certified their atb.see ja ja letter from janet greengold stevens,dir.of,legal assistance,to arne duncan,sec y of,dep t of educ.the doe has also continued to actively collect on loans made to former wilfred students,including by seizing their income tax refunds,garnishing the wages,and tarnishing their credit.
iii.procedural history 
plaintiffs filed this action on behalf of themselves and similarly situated wilfred borrowers,alleging that the doe violated the apa by arbitrarily and capriciously refusing to suspend collection on the wilfred loans and to notify wilfred borrowers of their discharge application rights plaintiffs moved to certify a class of all individuals who obtained federal student loans to attend wilfred after january,and whose atb was falsely certified by wilfred.the doe opposed the motion and moved to dismiss,primarily on the grounds that the secretary actions were unreviewable because they were committed to agency discretion by law,a and were not final,id.the district court granted the doe motion to dismiss and denied plaintiffs motion for class certification as moot.plaintiffs timely appealed that dismissal.
prior to oral argument,we asked plaintiffs to provide the current status of each of the named plaintiffs applications for discharge.order,salazar duncan,cir,ecf.both parties submitted letter briefs.plaintiffs informed the court that the discharge applications of all the named plaintiffs had been granted,but that at the time the complaint and amended complaint were filed,the named plaintiffs were still subject to defendant collection activities in relation to their loans.letter br.for plaintiffs appellants,salazar duncan,ecf.plaintiffs argued that the fact that the doe had subsequently granted the named plaintiffs discharge applications did not render their claims moot because their claims come within the mootness exception for inherently transitory claims.id.the doe submitted a letter brief arguing that the discharge of the named plaintiffs loans rendered the appeal moot and that the inherently transitory exception does not preserve jurisdiction because t here is nothing intrinsically fleeting about plaintiffs claims.letter br.for defendant appellee,salazar duncan,ecf.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal because plaintiffs claims come within the inherently transitory exception to the mootness doctrine.on the issues before us on appeal,we review the district court decision to dismiss the plaintiffs claims de novo and hold that the district court erred first,the presumption in favor of judicial review applies to this case.second,there is sufficient law to apply to allow for judicial review of the agency action challenged here.third,the agency decision was final.see.
i.the plaintiffs have standing and the case is not moot 
to bring a claim under the apa a plaintiff must satisfy article iii standing requirements constitutional standing and assert interests that are arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute she claims was violated statutory standing,at all times during the litigation mootness.see match e be nash she wish band of pottawatomi indians patchak,d council of la raza gonzales,d,aff sub nom.council of la raza mukasey,app x cir cook colgate,cir.
it is not contested that plaintiffs satisfied the requirements for constitutional and statutory standing at the time their complaint was filed.the standing requirements were satisfied because plaintiffs were injured by the doe active collection of their student loan debt,their injury was fairly traceable to the refusal of the doe to suspend collection and send notice,and their injury was redressable.plaintiffs are student financial aid borrowers who allege that they were falsely certified eligible by wilfred and thus are squarely within the zone of interests to be protected by a statute directed at the treatment of borrowers falsely certified as eligible to borrow.see.however,even if a party has constitutional and statutory standing when her complaint is filed,her claim can become moot during the course of the litigation.
the parties disagree about whether the plaintiffs case is moot.the doe granted all of the named plaintiffs requests to have their wilfred loans discharged after the plaintiffs filed their complaint and amended complaint.plaintiffs argue that their claims fall into the mootness exception for inherently transitory claims.the doe disputes the applicability of the inherently transitory exception to these facts.we agree with the plaintiffs that this case falls into the inherently transitory exception to the mootness doctrine and that they have standing to pursue this appeal.
the exception to the mootness doctrine for inherently transitory claims asserted by the named plaintiff s in a class action allows such claims to relate back to the time of the filing of the complaint with class allegations.see comer cisneros,cir.under that exception,a case will not be moot,even if the controversy as to the named plaintiffs has been resolved,if it is uncertain that a claim will remain live for any individual who could be named as a plaintiff long enough for a court to certify the class and there will be a constant class of persons suffering the deprivation complained of in the complaint.olson brown,cir,citing gerstein pugh,d zurak regan,cir see sosna iowa,d 
the plaintiffs claims are within the inherently transitory exception.first,it is uncertain that a claim will remain live for any individual who could be named as a plaintiff long enough for a court to address a class certification motion because the doe processes discharge applications from wilfred borrowers relatively quickly.for the seven named plaintiffs,the longest time it took for the discharge application to be granted was six months and the average was less than three months.this short time frame does not give a court enough time to consider and decide a motion for class certification.see robidoux celani,cir applying the inherently transitory exception to public assistance recipients whose applications for public assistance had been unlawfully delayed.indeed,it is virtually certain that any class member fortunate enough to learn of the availability of debt relief and to apply for it will be granted a discharge promptly,since it is doe policy to grant discharges to wilfred attendees who make a prima facie showing of eligibility without further investigation.
second,there will be a constant class of persons suffering the deprivation complained of in the complaint.the doe has stated that at least ffel program loans were issued to wilfred students between and.although not all wilfred borrowers will be eligible for a discharge,as not every person who attended wilfred did so based on a fraudulent certification of her atb,we can be confident that there is a constant class of persons suffering the deprivation alleged in the complaint,due to the large number of potential class members and the widespread nature of the fraud at wilfred.
the doe argues that plaintiffs claims became moot because plaintiffs took affirmative steps to procure a discharge of their loans,not because of the fleeting nature of the conduct giving rise to the claims,and therefore their claims do not fall into the inherently transitory exception.letter br.for defendant appellee at,salazar duncan.the inherently transitory exception is not so limited.
as this court explained in comer,n ormally,the court has held circumstances appropriate where the claims are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative individual interest expires.at internal quotation marks omitted.in robidoux,we emphasized that the plaintiffs claims are inherently transitory since the vermont department of social welfare will almost always be able to process a delayed public assistance application before a plaintiff can obtain relief through litigation.at.
the critical question for the inherently transitory exception to mootness is whether the court will have time to rule on a motion for class certification brought by a plaintiff who has standing to bring a particular claim before the claim will become moot the inquiry is not why the claim will become moot.this case demonstrates why such focus is correct.the doe suggested at oral argument that the inherently transitory exception does not apply because a borrower could manufacture a claim by decid ing to delay an application for a discharge.oral argument at,salazar duncan.the doe in effect asks plaintiffs to manipulate jurisdiction by forgoing relief to which they are entitled and continuing to suffer garnishment of their earnings and withholding of their income tax refunds.
the inherently transitory exception,which is properly focused on the time it will take for a court to review a claim a plaintiff has standing to pursue,does not require a plaintiff to forgo remedies to which she is entitled in order to seek broader remedies for the doe alleged derelictions.if the plaintiffs allegations prove to be true,to accept the doe position would acquiesce in conduct by which the doe disregards the congressional command to notify victims of fraud and suspend collection activities when it is aware of such frauds,wait for the victims to discover remedies on their own,and then provide them with a quick discharge to avoid exposure of its neglect that is precisely the sort of situation the inherently transitory exception is designed to correct.
ii.the presumption favoring judicial review applies 
there is a strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.mach mining,llc eeoc,d block cmty.nutrition,d.from the beginning our cases have established that judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of congress.bowen.acad.of family physicians,d internal alteration and quotation marks omitted.in the absence of an express statutory prohibition,the agency bears the heavy burden of overcoming the strong presumption that congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial review of its decision.dunlop bachowski,d.but the opposite presumption applies when a plaintiff seeks to require that an agency take an enforcement action because an agency decision not to prosecute or enforce,whether through civil or criminal process,is a decision generally committed to an agency absolute discretion.heckler chaney,d emphasis added.
the presumption in favor of judicial review applies to this case because plaintiffs challenge what they contend are unlawful actions that the agency has taken,and continues to take,against the plaintiffs themselves.such challenges are at the core of the judicial review function.the presumption against judicial review of decisions not to take enforcement action protects agency discretion in allocating its resources to choose their enforcement targets.see id.unlike the plaintiffs in chaney,who asked the court to compel the fda to take enforcement measures against third parties within the agency sphere of regulation,the plaintiffs here ask the court to review whether the doe acted arbitrarily and capriciously in taking enforcement actions against plaintiffs.plaintiffs would fall within chaney if they were suing to compel the doe to take action against wilfred.they are not the doe and the department of justice have long since taken action to punish wilfred.plaintiffs demand that doe stop acting to collect from them on the loans fraudulently obtained at their expense,as they contend that congress required.
the doe argues that the chaney presumption against judicial review is implicated here,because it should be applied whenever an agency decision involve s a complicated balancing of factors peculiarly within its expertise,such as how best to expend its resources.defendant appellee br.we reject this attempt to expand chaney beyond what its holding and reasoning can bear.in chaney,the court reasoned that when an agency refuses to act it generally does not exercise its coercive power over an individual liberty or property rights and an agency refusal to institute proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the decision of a prosecutor not to indict.chaney,at.in this case,the doe is already exercising its coercive power over the plaintiffs by taking actions to collect on student loan debt 
iii.congress has provided sufficiently clear standards for courts to apply 
the presumption in favor of judicial review is not absolute,but subject to a narrow exception the apa prohibition against judicial review of agency action committed to agency discretion by law.a see westchester dep t of hous.urban,cir.we must therefore consider whether the statutes and regulations at issue in this case are drawn in such broad terms that there is no law to apply.id.
to determine whether there is law to apply that provides judicially manageable standards for judging an agency exercise of discretion,the courts look to the statutory text,the agency regulations,and informal agency guidance that govern the agency challenged action.westchester,at chaney,at.agency regulations and guidance can provide a court with law to apply because,a s the supreme court noted where the rights of individuals are affected,it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their own procedures.this is so even where the internal procedures are possibly more rigorous than otherwise would be required.montilla,cir internal alteration omitted,quoting morton ruiz,d.
even when a regulation adoption was not originally required by the statute,it can supply the law to apply.
though the agency discretion is unfettered at the outset,if it announces and follows by rule or by settled course of adjudication a general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed,an irrational departure from that policy as opposed to an avowed alteration of it could constitute action that must be overturned as arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.
yueh shaio yang,d internal alteration omitted,quoting a see also service dulles,d while it is of course true that under the statute the secretary was not obligated to impose upon himself these more rigorous substantive and procedural standards,neither was he prohibited from doing so,and having done so he could not,so long as the regulations remained unchanged,proceed without regard to them.guertin united states,cir examining hud regulations to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary and capricious.
in this case,upon review of the statute,regulations,and dear colleague letters,we conclude there is sufficient law to apply to permit judicial review of the plaintiffs claims under the apa.we begin with the statutory text.the statute governing false certification discharge provides that if a borrower received a federally guaranteed student loan and if such student eligibility to borrow under this part was falsely certified by the eligible institution then the secretary shall discharge the borrower liability on the loan including interest and collection fees by repaying the amount owed on the loan.c emphasis added.as the supreme court has often explained,the use of the word shall makes the action mandatory.see,mach mining,llc.at noting that the language shall endeavor is mandatory,not precatory passenger morgan,d.this mandatory,language creates boundaries and requirements for agency action and shows that congress has not left the decision about the discharge of falsely certified student loans to the discretion of the agency.the text of the statute alone shows that congress has mandated that the agency shall act in the specified circumstances.
legislative history strongly supports our reading of the statute as a mandatory command to the agency,not a grant of unbridled discretion.lawrence mem l hosp.burwell,cv,wl,at cir,relying on legislative history that supports the court interpretation of the statute plain meaning.congress enacted the law requiring the discharge of debt based on a false certification in response to a report by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and oig audits and investigations of trade schools,which documented the widespread fraud and abuse of federal financial aid to the detriment of student borrowers,and found that such fraud was allowed to proliferate by the doe failure to perform its regulatory role.see,at.specifically,the subcommittee found that w idespread abuse and fraud occur in connection with ability to benefit students and that 
many of the program intended beneficiar i es hundreds of thousands of young people,many of whom come from backgrounds with already limited opportunities have suffered further because of their involvement with the gslp guaranteed student loan program.victimized by unscrupulous profiteers and their fraudulent schools,students have received neither the training nor the skills they hoped to acquire and,instead,have been left burdened with debts they can not repay.
the subcommittee found that fraud and abuse was able to thrive because through gross mismanagement,ineptitude,and neglect in carrying out its regulatory and oversight functions,the department of education had all but abdicated its responsibility to the students it is supposed to service and the taxpayers whose interests it is charged with protecting.id.at.the report explained that,although similar issues have been called to the attention of the doe since at least,the program failures seem only to have gotten worse.id.at.in its recommendations,the subcommittee specifically noted that 
b ecause the department oversight systems have failed,students who have not received the education promised have been left responsible for loans that they can not repay and,therefore,on which they all too often default.the department must not only increase efforts to prevent this type of abuse in the future,but also work with students to ease financial burdens imposed as a result of past abuse.
id.at emphasis added.the subcommittee report,which was strongly reflected in the provisions of the bill that became the higher education amendments of,see,at,shows that congress was deeply dissatisfied with the manner in which the doe had failed to exercise its discretion.
another bill to amend and extend the higher education act of,cong,was passed by the house,and was the basis for forming a conference committee with the senate,which agreed to the bill that became the became the higher education amendments of.see cong.rec.the house committee on education and labor issued a report on,which,like the senate report on the senate bill,expressed its intention that the discharge of falsely certified loans be mandatory.i n a case where a borrower loan is fraudulently certified,the secretary shall discharge the borrower liability by repaying the amount owed on the loan,at emphasis added.
the context provided by the legislative history lends support to our conclusion that in requiring that the secretary shall discharge a borrower liability on a student loan if the student eligibility to borrow was falsely certified,c,congress tasked the doe with a mandatory directive,and did not leave the fate of students who had been v ictimized by unscrupulous profiteers and their fraudulent schools to the discretion of the doe whose oversight systems ha d failed,at.
pursuant to the statute,the secretary is obligated to promulgate regulations to fulfill the congressional mandate that student loans obtained by false certification shall be discharged.see,b.these regulations serve as additional guidance to a court reviewing whether the agency action was arbitrary and capricious.one regulation is directed to guaranty agencies,as the entities in charge of the ffel program,and another is directed to the doe for loans under the direct loan program.
the regulation concerning the ffel program,which the doe has acknowledged also applies to the doe itself,directs that if the guaranty agency,or the doe,receives information that it believes to be reliable indicating that a borrower whose loan is held by the agency may be eligible for a false certification discharge,then the agency shall immediately suspend any enforcement efforts to collect from the borrower and inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.e ii emphasis added.the regulation for direct loans provides that if the doe determines that a borrower direct loan may be eligible for a discharge,it then promptly suspends any enforcement efforts to collect from the borrower and mails to the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of how to obtain a discharge.d emphasis added.under the regulations governing both loan programs,the guaranty agency and the doe are directed to consider information available from guaranty agencies,the secretary records,state authorities,and accrediting associations.d,e iv.
although the language in the regulations differs slightly depending on whether the loan was issued under the ffel program or the direct loan program,the obligation is the same if the determines that a borrower may be eligible for a discharge,it shall suspend any enforcement efforts and inform the borrower about how to request a discharge.the doe acknowledged that the ffel and direct loan regulations on false certification discharges have the same rules with respect to a discharge based on an improper determination of the student.
these regulations provide significant law for a court to apply in reviewing the agency action.from the regulations we learn that the doe must take certain actions once the agency determines that the borrower may be eligible for a discharge,and that in deciding if a borrower may be eligible,the agency must consider information it believes to be reliable,including information available from guaranty agencies,the secretary records,state authorities,and accrediting associations 
the doe argues that these regulations do not provide sufficient guidance for judicial review because the mandatory statute and regulations are triggered by a determination that is left to the agency discretion that the doe determines or receives information it believes to be reliable that a borrower may be eligible for discharge.defendant appellee br.it is true that when an agency nondiscretionary obligation only arises after a discretionary determination there may not be sufficient law to apply.see pub.interest research grp.whitman,cir holding that the environmental protection agency decision not to issue a notice of deficiency against a third party was not subject to judicial review because the chaney presumption against judicial review applied and the statutory obligation to issue a notice of deficiency was triggered only after a decision that was left to the epa discretion.
but even when an agency has some discretion to make an initial decision,judicial review is not precluded if the plaintiffs can show that there is sufficient law to apply to the initial decision,so that a court can evaluate the agency exercise of its discretion in deciding if the initial triggering condition has been met.for example,in westchester,the court acknowledged that the statute and regulations requiring a report satisfactory to the secretary conferred broad agency discretion as to certain questions.westchester,at.but the court rejected the contention that this discretion made the agency decision unreviewable,because the statute contained meaningful standards constraining the agency discretion and providing for judicial review.id.at.
in this case,the agency determination that a borrower may be eligible for a discharge triggers its mandatory obligations to suspend collection and notify borrowers.e ii,d.while we recognize the agency has some discretion in making the initial triggering decision,we conclude that this discretion is not unfettered.there is sufficient guidance in the regulations and informal agency guidance for a court to determine whether the agency was arbitrary and capricious in not finding that the putative class of wilfred borrowers may be eligible for a discharge,particularly in the context the statute strong mandatory direction to the agency.
dear colleague letters dcls,issued by the doe,instruct guaranty agencies and the doe concerning what evidence to consider when evaluating an application for discharge.one particularly relevant dcl is dedicated to loan discharges based on improper determination that a student had the atb from the school training.dcl,at.the guidance in this dcl expressly applies to the doe itself in evaluating false certification discharges under the direct loan program,as well as to the guaranty agencies administering loans under the ffel program.id.the department intends to apply the guidance in this letter to similar false certification discharges in the william ford federal direct loan program.dcl directs that 
i n evaluating an application for discharge,a guaranty agency or the doe must consider evidence about the testing and admission practices of the school,and inferences that can reasonably be drawn from that evidence.
s upporting evidence can include a finding by an entity or organization that had oversight responsibility over the school sfa administration or educational programs,statements or admissions by school officials with knowledge of the school practices,or statements made by other students who attended the school that are both sufficiently detailed and consistent with each other to appear reliable.those statements can include statements made in other claims for discharge relief.
the department expects a guaranty agency or the doe to obtain existing documentation available from any public or private agency that reviewed or had oversight responsibility for the school.
id.at.this same type of documentation is considered by the doe in deciding if a group discharge is war
