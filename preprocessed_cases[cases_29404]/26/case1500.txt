mario brings this appeal from an order of the juvenile court deferring entry of judgment under welfare and institutions code section et.he contends that the court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence of a knife discovered on his person by a school administrator.we have concluded that there is no appealable order on which to base the appeal,and insufficient basis on which to predicate review by extraordinary writ.accordingly,we will dismiss the appeal.
background 
the district attorney filed a petition alleging that the minor,then years of age,was a person described in section of the welfare and institutions code in that he possessed a knife with a locking blade on school property in violation of penal code sections count i,subdivision a count ii,and count iii.
the minor counsel filed a motion to suppress evidence of the offending knife.a police report indicated that the knife was discovered when a at the minor school,while investigating a report of marijuana smoke emanating from a boy room,detained the minor along with two others,and instructed him to empty his pockets.the trial court denied the motion to suppress.the minor thereupon admitted the allegations of the first two counts of the petition,and the third count was dismissed.the court then entered an order granting dej,which manifestly refers to deferred entry of judgment pursuant to welfare and institutions code sections et.the court imposed a number of probation conditions,to remain in effect until march.
discussion 
at our request,the parties have briefed the question whether an appeal will lie from an order granting deferred entry of judgment under welfare and institutions code sections et.we raised this question on our own motion because a reviewing court is without jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a nonappealable order,and has the duty to dismiss such an appeal upon its own motion.citations.adohr milk farms,love d.
the fundamental rule governing the appealability of orders is that a judgment or order is not appealable unless expressly made so by statute.citations.people mazurette cal th,d,mazurette,quoting people chi ko wong cal d,see city of los angeles schweitzer d.appellate procedure is entirely statutory and subject to complete legislative control griset fair political practices com.cal th,d,a trial court order is appealable when it is made so by statute.the question is therefore whether any statute expressly provides for an appeal from an order granting deferred entry of judgment.if the answer is negative,the appeal must be dismissed.
appeals by the minor subject of a juvenile wardship proceeding are governed by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,which authorizes appeal from a judgment in a proceeding under section or,and any subsequent order the question,therefore,is whether an order granting deferred entry of judgment is,for purposes of this statute,a judgment or order after judgment.
in general,a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ.more specifically,the judgment in a juvenile court proceeding is the order made after the trial court has found facts establishing juvenile court jurisdiction and has conducted a hearing into the proper disposition to be made.welf,after receiving and considering the evidence on the proper disposition of the case,the court may enter judgment as follows,contemplating that,after jurisdictional finding,court shall consider relevant evidence and render judgment and order of disposition in re sheila th,d dispositional order is the judgment under statute governing appeals in dependency proceedings in re melvin d.
the order before us is not a judgment in either the general or the specific sense.as its very name indicates,the order does not enter judgment but defer s such entry indefinitely,perhaps permanently.the statutes creating this procedure are not a model of clarity,but their central purpose and effect is plain enough.they empower the court,under specified conditions,and upon the minor admission of the allegations of the petition,to place the minor on probation without adjudging him or her to be a ward of the court.welf,subd.b,subd.b,subd.a.if the minor fails to perform satisfactorily,the court may lift the deferred entry of judgment,impose the judgment previously deferred,and make an appropriate dispositional order.welf,subds.a b.if judgment is not so,if the minor performs admission of the charges shall not constitute a finding that a petition has been sustained for any purpose.welf,subd.c.instead,the charges shall be dismissed,the arrest upon which the judgment was deferred shall be deemed never to have occurred,and any records in the possession of the juvenile court shall be sealed,except that the prosecuting attorney and the probation department of any county shall have access to these records after they are sealed for the limited purpose of determining whether a minor is eligible for deferred entry of judgment pursuant to section.welf,subd.c.
these provisions confirm that far from constituting an adjudication of the issues raised by the petition,the order of deferral abates the adjudicatory process in the hope that the minor will comply with the probationary conditions and thereby avoid a judgment altogether.if that occurs,the record of the proceeding will be sealed for all purposes,with one narrow exception discussed below.if the minor fails to satisfactorily comply,the court will enter judgment and make a dispositional order.in the latter instance,of course,a judgment will exist from which an appeal will lie.at the present juncture,however,there simply is no judgment from which to appeal.
the minor contends that because his appeal challenges a ruling on a suppression motion,a right to appeal is granted by the proviso in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,that a ruling on a motion to suppress shall be reviewed on appeal even if the judgment is predicated upon an admission of the allegations of the petition.this language,however,does not purport to enlarge the class of appealable judgments rather it presupposes a challenge to the order on appeal from a judgment.its literal and apparent effect is only to preserve the minor objection to an order denying a suppression motion where appellate jurisdiction is otherwise properly laid.
given the absence of statutory authorization for appeal from an order deferring judgment,we lack jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal.this conclusion finds support in mazurette,supra,cal th,d,which addressed a similar issue under the parallel provisions of the penal code.the defendant there sought to challenge the denial of a suppression motion by appealing from an order diverting her to a drug rehabilitation program and deferring entry of judgment.see.the supreme court held that the appeal was properly dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the statute governing criminal appeals contains no provision for an appeal from such an order.mazurette,supra,cal th at,d,citing and quoting.the court wrote,t here judgment from which defendant can appeal.if she successfully completes her rehabilitation,the charges will be dismissed and the slate wiped clean.if,instead,defendant fails to perform satisfactorily in her assigned program,the court shall render a finding of guilt to the charge or charges pled,enter judgment,and schedule a sentencing hearing as otherwise provided in this code,italics added.only following entry of judgment pursuant to penal code section will a judgment exist from which defendant can appeal.mazurette,supra,cal th at,d.
the minor attempts to distinguish mazurette on the ground that,in contrast to the parallel provisions of the penal code,the governing statute here uses the term probation in referring to the minor status while under an order deferring entry of judgment.welf,subd.a see also,referring to condition s and term s of probation.the minor asserts that t he result in mazurette would have been arguably different if the adult deferral statutes used similar language,because penal code section expressly authorizes a defendant to appeal from an order granting pr
