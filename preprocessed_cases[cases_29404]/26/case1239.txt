lakeisha lesesne claims the district of columbia public schools dcps violated the rights of her disabled son,under the individuals with disabilities education act,idea or the act.alleging that dcps failed to create an individualized education program iep for,lesesne filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against dcps.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dcps,and lesesne appealed.because lesesne has failed to demonstrate that was harmed by any statutory violations dcps might have committed,we affirm.
is a mentally retarded and boy.during the fall of,the social services division of the superior court of the district of columbia referred to dcps for an evaluation to determine whether he was covered by idea.see a requiring an initial evaluation to determine whether a child is covered by idea prescribing procedures for an initial evaluation a requiring an initial evaluation within days of a referral,as amended by,requiring an initial evaluation within days of a referral.the act guarantees that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education fape that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.d a see also defining child with a disability.if a child initial evaluation suggests he is entitled to a fape,idea then requires the school district to create and implement an iep,which is the primary vehicle for implementing the act.honig doe,d.the iep is p repared at meetings between a representative of the local school district,the child teacher,the parents or guardians,and,whenever appropriate,the disabled child.id.it sets out the child present educational performance,establishes annual and objectives for improvements in that performance,and describes the specially designed instruction and services that will enable the child to meet those objectives.see also b requiring a meeting to develop an iep within days following the completion of a disabled student initial evaluation.
was referred to dcps for an initial evaluation on october.over the following four months,dcps attempted to test speech as part of his evaluation,but its efforts were repeatedly thwarted by truancy and lesesne refusals to facilitate the process.in early february,lesesne and finally reported for speech testing,but before could complete the test,a police officer arrested him for assaulting his girlfriend.at some point thereafter the record is unclear as to exactly when,finally completed his speech test and his evaluation.
given the practical difficulties associated with conducting evaluation,dcps decided to begin planning his iep meeting,see b,even before had completed his testing and thus even before dcps was sure that he was covered by idea.on february,dcps was struggling to complete evaluation,and while dcps was making preliminary plans for iep houck lesesne attorney at the time contacted dcps about the need for an iep meeting.dcps told lesesne attorney about pattern of uncooperative behavior,described the portions of his evaluation that remained incomplete,and told her about dcps plans to convene an iep meeting anyway.
rather than facilitate dcps efforts to help,lesesne and her attorney instead focused their energies on litigation.on february,day immediately following her first conversation with attorney filed a request for a due process hearing with an independent hearing officer ho,pursuant to b,f.alleging that dcps had made no attempt to provide a fape for,lesesne demanded a hearing officer decision hod requiring dcps to perform all necessary evaluations of,develop his iep,determine an appropriate educational placement for him,and provide him with compensatory education.
on february,lesesne request for a due process hearing was faxed a letter of invitation to lesesne attorney,proposing three possible dates for an iep meeting.lesesne rejected all three dates by fax on february.that same day,dcps responded by suggesting three more dates,which it hoped would be more convenient for lesesne and her attorney.however,lesesne and her new attorney douglas tyrka offered no response before the ho held an administrative hearing on march.
on march,the ho issued his final ruling,which dismissed the case and denied lesesne requests for relief.the ho found that the proceeding was moot because dcps had made reasonable efforts to evaluate and to schedule an iep meeting,but both lesesne and her attorney had frustrated those efforts.the ho explained 
my only complaint is that when it looks like a solution is in play i still sitting here despite the fact that you here looking for an iep meeting,an invitation has been sent and rather than calling the school,apparently houck wrote a letter and complained about the dates instead of picking up the phone and working out dates.so i got to sit here and referee what seems not to be a very serious denial of a fape.
accordingly,the ho denied lesesne requests for relief and dismissed her due process request with prejudice.
on april,dcps again tried to contact lesesne to schedule an iep meeting.dcps wrote t his is the attempt to meet with you and your educational advocate in regards to your son sic evaluations sic we are submitting another letter of invitation.this is the final letter of invitation.we will move forward with the meeting to insure his academic success.instead of responding to dcps fourth and final invitation to convene an iep meeting,on april,lesesne filed a complaint in the district court as a parent aggrieved by the hod,i.reiterating her allegations that dcps failed to provide with a fape,lesesne complaint sought various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief,including an iep and an alternative educational placement for her son.after lesesne filed her complaint in the district court,she then filed two more due process requests with a second ho.
at some point amidst lesesne flurry of litigation activity,the parties reached an agreement on the record that purported to resolve this case.second hod at.unhelpfully,the parties failed to provide us with the text of their agreement.however,the record does reveal that the parties reached an agreement pursuant to that agreement,was transferred to an alternative educational placement dcps created and implemented an interim iep,which the parties agreed to review and revise as necessary,lesesne attorneys sent two written acknowledgments to dcps,confirming the fact that they had received and reviewed the iep and iep was in place before the beginning of the school year.the record contains no evidence that the parties ever revised iep.
on july,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of dcps.after emphasizing that is currently in a new educational placement following a second due process hearing,and after noting that the record provides no indication that either the placement is inappropriate,or that an iep has not been created,the district court held the case moot.the court further held that even if the case was not moot,violations of idea procedural requirements are actionable only if they affect a student substantive rights.because lesesne failed to show that had been harmed by any procedural violations dcps might have committed,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dcps.lesesne filed a timely notice of appeal.our review is de novo.see,goldring district of columbia.
lesesne appeal presents two issues.first,she argues that this case is not moot.second,lesesne argues that the district court inappropriately exercised hypothetical jurisdiction over the merits of her claim.while we agree with lesesne first argument,we reject the second.because the district court erred in concluding this case is moot,both it and we have jurisdiction to review lesesne claim on the merits.and because we agree with the district court merits holding,we affirm.
lesesne argues that this case is not moot because effectual relief i s possible.pet.br.at.specifically,lesesne points out that her complaint includes requests for an iep,a declaratory judgment that dcps denied fape,and any other relief the court deems ju
