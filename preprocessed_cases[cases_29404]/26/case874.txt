vice principal sherry sample had heard complaints that hopkins was spending a lot of time with the same students.appellant app.at.fearing that his actions appeared to be favoritism,sample confronted hopkins about the complaints,but hopkins always had an explanation because the same students were involved in student organizations and activities that he sponsored,such as his leadership class,student council,and his peer mediation team.he explained that he would naturally have more contact with these students,and was one of them.sample stated as follows but what i told him was,i said,you know,you spending a lot of time with the same kids.i not accusing you of anything,but it just does look right so i would recommend it.he always had a logical explanation.id.at.sample testified that prior to the complaint by mother,she had never heard rumors or reports that hopkins was having improper sexual or physical contact with students.after the investigation came to light,she said she had heard one teacher remark that they finally got him or something along those lines.id.at.there is no evidence,however,that any teacher had expressed a suspicion of sexual abuse prior to that time.

failure to receive,investigate,and act on complaints.
a school district may be found liable for a governmental custom of failing to receive,investigate and act upon complaints of sexual misconduct of its employees if the plaintiff proved the existence of an official custom of such conduct and if that custom caused the plaintiff constitutional harm.larson miller,cir en banc quoting thelma,at.to establish the custom of failure to receive,investigate,or act on complaints of constitutional violations,the plaintiff must prove a continuing,widespread,persistent pattern of misconduct by the government employee deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the conduct by the officials after the officials have notice of the conduct and a resulting injury on the part of the plaintiff.jane doe special sch,cir.
