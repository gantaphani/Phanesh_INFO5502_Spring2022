lauren summa appeals from a memorandum,order,and judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york wall,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants hofstra university hofstra or the university,david cohen,and melissa connolly,and dismissing in its entirety summa suit claiming sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,title ix of the education amendments of title ix,and corresponding provisions of the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law.we hold that summa has presented sufficient evidence to withstand a grant of summary judgment with respect to her retaliation claims,but not as to her sexual harassment claims.
background 
lauren summa was a graduate student at hofstra university from through.prior to the start of her graduate program,summa interviewed with assistant football coach john perry and was hired as a team manager.summa asserts she was hired for both the fall and spring football seasons and an email from the football office,identifying summa by name,indicated that team managers would be paid for the fall season and for the spring season.summa served as a team manager during the fall season.her job responsibilities included assisting the football coaches before,during,and after practices,during august double sessions,and on game day throughout the season.she would also travel with the team to away games on the team bus.summa boyfriend,phillip hall,was a member of the football team.
almost as soon as summa began her term as manager,the players began to act in a way that made summa feel uncomfortable.throughout august and into the fall season,players made comments regarding her boyfriend,including that she should engage in sexual relations with him on the bus and that she should sit with another player if she wanted to be with a real man,asserted that women should not be managers because they do know anything about sports,and made remarks relating to summa use of the bathroom on the team bus.comments of this sort appear to have pervaded summa tenure as team manager.
around september,summa learned that some players had created a facebook page insulting both her and her boyfriend.the page contained a fake wanted poster of summa and a missing persons photo of her boyfriend,the joke apparently being that summa kidnapped her boyfriend.the wanted poster included,among other things,aliases for summa listed as miss piggie,the wannabe big boss man,manager.the poster,thus,expressly referred to summa employment as team manager.the photo of her boyfriend included a caption stating that at the time of his disappearance,weight may have fluctuated because of excessive sexual activities.the postings upset summa,and she complained to defendant head football coach david cohen on or about september.soon after this complaint,cohen spoke with the involved players about their role in the page and ordered them to take the postings down.the players complied and the page was removed.
on november,the last day of the fall season,on the bus ride home from an away game,assistant coach perry put on the video shadowboxer,an film described as having numerous sex scenes.the players on the bus yelled whenever a sex scene aired and made a variety of lewd comments.during one particular scene in the movie when a female caucasian character began masturbating in the presence of a male african american character,eric taylor,a player on the team,turned towards summa and stated,this is what you white women want,our black dicks.that shit will make you crazy.humiliated,embarrassed,and upset,summa began crying,went to the front of the bus,and asked perry to turn off the movie.perry complied.after the coaches turned off the movie,the players yelled for perry to turn it back on,chanting we want boobies.taylor told summa to sit down and like shut the fuck up as she returned to her seat.perry told the team to quiet down and stayed near summa for the rest of the bus ride.
when the bus arrived back at school,summa immediately found cohen and reported what had happened.summa told cohen that she was tempted to report the incident to the university public safety department.cohen urged summa not to go to public safety because the incident would draw attention to the football program and told her that he would handle the incident.that day,summa went to public safety and reported what had happened on the bus.she later spoke about her experience of harassment while student manager with the dean of students,who referred her to the university equality officer,maureen murphy.
the following day,cohen spoke with taylor and a handful of other players.by that evening,cohen decided to eject taylor from the football team.the incident on the bus with summa had been the final straw that,in addition to two other incidents,resulted in taylor dismissal from the team.cohen alerted his supervisors and reported his findings on the matter and contacted summa to let her know that taylor would no longer be on the team.later that week,summa met with murphy and relayed to her the incidents of harassment summa had suffered throughout the football season,including what had happened on the november bus ride.murphy told summa that she had to file a written report.summa complied,but the report only discussed the november incident and not the other activity that summa had complained of orally to murphy.murphy only investigated the incident on the bus because it was the only one contained within the written complaint.
approximately a month after the incident,murphy sent a memorandum of her findings to the university vice president for legal affairs.the report indicated that the incident offers an opportunity for educating the coaching staff and all of the athletics staff about the university harassment policy and stated that murphy would like to schedule such a training this spring.the training was provided in august.
based on the discussions with the coaching staff during her hiring and throughout the fall and the email from the football office indicating the stipend amount for both the fall and spring,summa understood that she would also serve as team manager for the spring football season,known as spring ball,which was slated to begin in the end of march.meanwhile,anthony battaglia,the equipment manager hired in the fall of,conducted a search for students interested in being the football team manager for the spring.a few days prior to the start of spring ball in march,summa called the football office to obtain the schedule.she learned via return voicemail from cohen that the position had been filled because they had not yet heard from her.cohen later indicated that he was not certain the position had been filled at the time he left summa the voicemail.summa did not serve as team manager during the spring.
in april,in search of new employment,summa applied for a graduate assistantship position in the office of university relations,helmed by vice president for university relations,defendant melissa connolly.summa went through two interviews and,in,was offered the position by helen stefanidis,director of marketing,planning,and operations for the office.summa accepted.during this time,summa was preparing a complaint against the university alleging that her replacement as team manager amounted to unlawful retaliation for her harassment complaints.she filed the complaint on may,with the new york state division of human rights nysdhr.evelyn miller suber,director of human resources,became aware of the complaint,and the university responded on may,attaching an affidavit,dated may,signed by miller suber,regarding summa employment activities.
in june,after hofstra had become aware of summa nysdhr complaint,miller suber contacted connolly to inform her that vice presidents were required to sign off on the paperwork for the graduate assistantship position for which summa had been hired and that connolly had neglected to sign the appropriate forms.even though there was no requirement for doing so,miller suber told connolly that it was probably best practice for her to interview anybody who would be working for her office,and encouraged her to interview the graduate assistants.miller suber told connolly that when interviewing,connolly should be sure that all of the candidates working in connolly office,whether they be employees or graduate assistantships,should be able to represent the university in meetings,represent the university with external audiences,and be advocates for the university.connolly took miller suber instruction to include inquiring about conflicts.in july,stefanidis contacted summa to arrange for summa to meet with connolly.the email did not describe the meeting as an interview or say that the purpose was for connolly to determine whether summa hiring would ultimately be approved.
connolly and summa met on july.connolly felt that summa resume was imprecise.on her resume,instead of listing only her official degree program titles for her undergraduate and graduate programs of study,summa listed both the degree program or major and a particular area of interest.connolly testified that she had interpreted these listings to indicate double majors,though summa clarified at the interview what she had meant.summa had previously had her resume reviewed by the university own career department on more than one occasion and had never been told there was a problem with her presentation of both her degree program and area of interest without explicit labels so identifying them.connolly also testified that she felt summa had overstated the importance of her duties at an internship without articulating how.connolly later contacted one of summa references who reportedly gave her a lukewarm recommendation.connolly spoke with another candidate for the graduate assistantships on the phone and could not recall if she contacted that candidate references.shortly thereafter,connolly consulted miller suber about whether summa imprecision on her resume was a sufficient reason not to approve her for the position.miller suber responded that such precision was very important and that if connolly agreed as to the importance,they should not hire summa.connolly subsequently rescinded summa offer of employment.
on january,summa filed the instant lawsuit.she continued to work at hofstra until the summer of,at which point miller suber terminated summa privilege of student employment by letter because the university discovered she had some of her hours,claiming to be working at two jobs simultaneously.according to miller suber,hofstra legal department had notified her of the duplicative hours.miller suber then compared the time sheets for two of summa jobs for one pay period in july and saw duplicate billing of hours.according to the student handbook,such was prohibited and could result in the loss of working privileges,so miller suber revoked summa ability to work on campus.miller suber had never terminated any other student privilege of student employment in the past nor had she investigated any other student billing practices.according to summa,she input her hours this way because her supervisor had explicitly advised her to do so because,when working multiple jobs,the hours worked needed to be input as worked during regular business hours.summa would list work done outside of typical business hours as done during the business day,while she was at another job,in order to receive compensation for hours actually worked.
after summa filed the instant action,defendants moved for and were granted summary judgment on all counts.the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that summa had experienced a hostile work environment and,further,that even if summa had established a hostile work environment,no liability could be imputed to defendants because they had swiftly and appropriately handled her complaints.as to summa title ix harassment complaint,the district court concluded that no private right of action was available under title ix and that summa had not demonstrated harassment in her capacity as a student.the court dismissed summa three retaliation claims,concluding that she had failed to meet the criteria outlined in mcdonnell douglas green,d.summa now appeals.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards that govern the district court consideration of the motion.kaytor boat,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine disputes concerning any material facts,and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.weinstein albright,cir.we resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see castle rock entm t,carol publ g,cir.
hostile work environment claims under both title vii and the nyshrl are governed by the same standard.schiano quality payroll,cir.in order to prevail on a hostile work environment claim,a plaintiff must make two showings that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment and that there is a specific basis for imputing the conduct creating the hostile work environment to the employer.duch jakubek,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,we need not and do not determine whether summa showing of harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment under title vii or the nyshrl because we hold that the conduct in this case can not be imputed to hofstra.
assuming that summa allegations constituted a hostile work environment,there are no grounds upon which the objectionable conduct can be imputed to the university.in this case,all of the alleged harassers were players on the football team.while this circuit has not yet determined the standards for addressing harassment attributable to,we now adopt the rules of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in imputing employer liability for harassment by according to the same standards for,with the qualification that we will consider the extent of the employer control and any other legal responsibility which the employer may have with respect to the conduct of such.e.
by analogy to the rules for,see id.d,the employer will be held liable only for its own negligence,and the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer failed to provide a reasonable avenue for complaint or that it knew,or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,about the harassment yet failed to take appropriate remedial action.duch,at internal quotation marks omitted.in determining the appropriateness of an employer response,we look to whether the response was immediate or timely and appropriate in light of the circumstances,particularly the level of control and legal responsibility the employer has with respect to the employee behavior.crist focus homes,cir.
in this case,we think it apparent that the university and the head football coach had a high degree of control over the behavior of its student football players,and thus apply the test for imputing harassment by.once hofstra knew or should have known about the harassing behavior,it had a remedial obligation to address and end the harassment.we find that hofstra met its obligation.
the first time summa complained to cohen about the behavior of the football players was in late september,regarding the objectionable facebook postings.it is undisputed that cohen promptly spoke to the three players involved in making the offending postings and instructed the players to remove the posts.the players complied,and no further online postings or other public displays were directed at summa.summa next complained to cohen about the incidents surrounding the movie viewing on the team bus on november.again,it is undisputed that as soon as summa complained to assistant coach perry about the content of the movie,he turned it off.upon the players raucous reaction,perry immediately instructed them to be quiet and stationed himself near summa for the rest of the bus ride.upon arriving back at the university,summa relayed her complaint to cohen,who,within hours,investigated the incident,immediately talking with the coaching personnel who had been on that bus,and removed taylor from the football team.the fact that this incident was one of three strikes that lead to taylor expulsion does not undermine the appropriateness of cohen actions.the standard for reviewing the appropriateness of an employer response to harassment is essentially a negligence one,and reasonableness depends among other things on the gravity of the harassment alleged.torres pisano,cir citation and alteration omitted.each complaint that was brought directly to cohen attention was dealt with quickly and in proportion to the level of seriousness of the event.the fact that cohen took action at once completed within just days in all cases speaks to the appropriateness of the university response in this case.because defendants took the needed remedial action in this case,the harassment carried out by some players on the football team can not be imputed to the university and its personnel.in addition to the prompt response to the particular incidents of harassment,upon the report of the movie incident to the school eeo officer which took place after the offending player had already been expelled from the football team the university had the entire athletics staff undergo sexual harassment training before the start of the next football season.in addition to directly addressing the particular incidents of harassment of which it was aware,the university also took proactive steps to create a better environment for all employees in the future.thus,district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of hofstra and cohen with respect to summa harassment claims.
the framework laid out in mcdonnell douglas,at,governs retaliation claims under both title vii and the nyshrl.schiano,at.to make out a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must make four showings that she engaged in a protected activity her employer was aware of this activity the employer took adverse employment action against her and a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity.id.at.once a prima facie case of retaliation is established,the burden of production shifts to the employer to demonstrate that a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason existed for its action.raniola bratton,cir.if the employer demonstrates a legitimate,reason,then t he burden shifts back to the plaintiff to establish,through either direct or circumstantial evidence,that the employer action was,in fact,motivated by discriminatory retaliation.id.at.
there is no dispute that summa satisfied the second and third elements of the prima facie case contemplated by mcdonnell douglas employer knowledge and adverse employment actions.it is apparent that a number of hofstra officials including cohen,equality officer maureen murphy,and linda of the office of the dean of students were aware of summa complaints throughout and.and,at a minimum,the university legal office knew about the instant litigation.nothing more is necessary than general corporate knowledge that the plaintiff has engaged in a protected activity,gordon bd.of,cir,and it is apparent hofstra had such knowledge here.as to the third factor,hofstra concedes that each of summa asserted claims namely,the denial of the football manager position for spring ball the denial of the graduate assistantship position in the office of university relations and the termination of summa privilege of student employment constitutes an adverse employment action.
the district court nonetheless determined that summa could not prevail on any of her three retaliation claims based on her supposed failure to demonstrate that she had engaged in protected activity and the requisite causation.we conclude that the district court erred in its analysis of these mcdonnell douglas factors and that summa has made a sufficient showing on each of these factors in order to establish a prima facie case.
to establish that she engaged in protected activity,summa need not establish that the conduct she opposed was actually a violation of title vii,but only that she possessed a good faith,reasonable belief that the underlying employment practice was unlawful under that statute.galdieri ambrosini realty dev,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court erred in concluding that summa could not have reasonably believed that her complaints to public safety and the school equality officer were complaints about violations of title vii.that the school considered these complaints to be issues is of no moment,as the first element of the prima facie case explicitly contemplates the belief of the plaintiff,not of the employer.at the same time,equality officer murphy also concluded that the comment by taylor constituted sexual harassment and that the showing of the movie raised concerns that needed to be investigated.upon investigation,murphy concluded that the athletics department staff would benefit from a sexual harassment training,which was carried out the following august.in addition,regardless of the steps taken,the university definition of the incident as a issue has no bearing on the reasonableness of summa belief that it was employment related and actionable under title vii.it is clear from summa formal eeo complaint that she believed that the event was employment related.furthermore,this was an entirely reasonable belief because summa was not on the football team bus in her capacity as a graduate student,but rather was there solely in her capacity as an employee of the athletics department.
as to the assertion that no reasonable person could believe a single incident amounted to a title vii violation,we disagree.our case law,particularly howley town of stratford,cir,establishes that a single incident can create a hostile environment if it is sufficiently severe.the incident on the team bus was close enough in severity to that in howley that a reasonable person certainly could have believed that it alone was enough to satisfy the standard.finally,as summa correctly notes,the district court erroneously confined its consideration to her written complaints.the written notes of the university equality officer evidence that summa complained about the entire course of harassment over the semester.in determining the reasonableness of summa belief,the court should have considered these complaints as well because t he law protects employees in the filing of formal charges of discrimination as well as in the making of informal protests of discrimination,including making complaints to management,writing critical letters to customers,protesting against discrimination by industry or society in general,and expressing support of who have filed formal charges.matima celli,cir internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,summa belief that her may complaint to the new york state division of human rights constituted protected activity is evident not only for all of the same reasons that apply to her internal complaint,but also based upon the conclusion of the nysdhr itself,which determined that there was probable cause to proceed on summa complaint.we conclude it was objectively reasonable for summa to believe she had suffered from employment discrimination under title vii and that her complaints to her employer were directed at just this harm.we conclude that,with respect to all of her retaliation claims,summa has met the first step in making a prima facie case of retaliation by demonstrating that she had engaged in protected activity.
the district court also erred in concluding that there was insufficient evidence of causation to meet the fourth element of a prima facie case of retaliation under title vii with respect to summa loss of the football manager position and the termination of all of summa employment privileges.the district court concluded that summa could not establish that her november complaints caused her replacement as football manager because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker responsible for hiring spring managers,equipment manager battaglia,either knew about summa complaints or knew that summa had wanted to return as a manager.to the extent that decisionmaker knowledge is relevant in establishing causation,that knowledge may be satisfied by demonstrating that t
