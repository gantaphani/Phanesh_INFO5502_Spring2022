respondent betty coley contends that her former employer,petitioner baylor university,by reassigning her responsibilities to others and thus effectively demoting her,breached her contract and forced her to resign from her tenured faculty position.the trial court rendered judgment for baylor based on the jury failure to find that coley had been constructively discharged,defined in the charge as mak ing conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee position would have felt compelled to resign.the court of appeals reversed and remanded,holding that the jury should have been asked whether baylor constructively discharged coley by mak ing a material change in the position to which she was entitled under the contract.we conclude that coley presented no evidence baylor breached her contract and that the jury was properly charged on constructive discharge,and we therefore reverse and render judgment for baylor.
baylor hired coley in as a librarian in one of its libraries,the armstrong browning library the abl or library,and in informed her by letter that she had been granted tenure on the faculty of the library.the evidence shows that coley was given the rank of assistant professor.according to baylor personnel policy manual 
tenure means assurance to an experienced faculty member that may expect to continue in academic position unless adequate cause for dismissal is demonstrated in a fair hearing,following established procedures of due process.
in her brief in this court,coley tells us that she was responsible for acquiring and preserving materials,presenting the collection to students and others inside the library as well as outside,participating in professional associations,and doing scholarly research.when the director of the library left in,coley applied for the position and was allowed to assume some of its duties until roger brooks was hired as director in.
coley relationship with brooks was discordant.brooks thought her to be abrasive and difficult to work with.dissatisfied with her performance,he reassigned some of her responsibilities to himself or her.in april,while coley was on sabbatical,brooks wrote to his superior,avery sharp,the university librarian,detailing coley inadequacies.two weeks later sharp,in turn,wrote to coley as follows 
it appears that there is a history of low quantity and quality of work,behavior,rude and insulting behavior toward abl staff and members of the public,excessive absences year after year,repeated angry outbursts,public criticism of the director,the former university librarian,the central administration and the university,inadequate ability to accept supervision,poor judgment in materials purchasing recommendations,attempts to convince dealers and booksellers that you are an approved purchasing agent for the library,and inability or unwillingness to complete assigned projects.
sharp informed coley that she would not be terminated but would be given an opportunity to improve.he also told her that she would not be given a raise in salary or a promotion,and that her responsibilities,like those of other library staff,would be reviewed.effective immediately and continuing indefinitely,he concluded,you have no supervisory responsibilities,no public service responsibilities,and no budgetary responsibilities.it is not clear whether any of these were part of her responsibilities when she first received tenure,or whether she had taken them on while the director position remained vacant.
coley complained to baylor president,herbert reynolds,who told her she could pursue a formal hearing with the university grievance committee,but she never did.in august,brooks changed the title of coley position from librarian to research librarian and met with her to discuss her duties,which they both agreed were very important to the operation of the library.but in october,she wrote sharp 
during the past six years my relationship with brooks has deteriorated to such an extent that i believe he is now trying to remove me from the library.as you know,he has demoted me to research librarian and i am now subject to monthly reports to you.he has stripped me of almost every responsibility i once had in the library 
i believe his reasons for doing this are caused by a strong personality conflict between us,rather than the result of misdemeanors on my part.
she concluded that she was anxious not to cause trouble and that she wish ed to continue working here.when sharp responded that she should send a copy of her letter to brooks,she replied 
i have not sent a copy to brooks because i am anxious to avoid further confrontation.things have been much better recently in the library,and i wish them to continue.my letter was intended solely to put on record my views of the events of the past few months.
two weeks later brooks issued a memo stating that coley had been named research librarian and would be 
responsible for conducting research on topics pertaining to the collection resources,the cataloging of newly acquired and items,the cataloging of archival material pertaining to the collection early history,and the maintenance of the clippings file.
this was the position he had discussed with her in august.
coley signed a new contract with baylor dated april,continuing her at the academic rank of assistant professor for the academic year.although all of coley claims accrued prior to the academic year,none of the annual contracts governing prior years were introduced into evidence the contract does not govern coley claims,but is at best representative of the prior annual contracts.regardless,neither the contract nor the letter granting coley tenure contained any description of her position or responsibilities.the contract stated that the contract,a referenced attachment,and the baylor university personnel policy manual contain the entire agreement between the faculty member and the university.neither the attachment nor the complete manual are in the record the only portion of the manual regarding the terms of tenure is quoted above in pertinent part.
in may,coley told brooks that she might need to take disability leave.brooks passed her request on to sharp,who wrote coley that he would need a statement from her physician regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.in july,coley replied that 
the question is now moot.you will be pleased to learn that i am planning to take early retirement from baylor,not because i have finally capitulated to the decade of constructive dismissal tactics and harassment i have suffered,culminating last year during my sabbatical in your letter of april demoting me from my position as librarian that i had held for years,and placing me on what amounts to punitive probation,but because i am to be married and live in vancouver,british columbia.
a few days later she wrote brooks to formally request retirement 
you will appreciate that i have mixed emotions about leaving the abl,which for the past years has been the center of my professional and,indeed,much of my personal life.however,in view of the pressures and stress i have experienced over the past decade,especially since my sabbatical leave in,i can only anticipate with relief a happy and productive future in my new situation and environment.i have always conducted myself in the best interests of the abl,and the library will always have a special place in my affection.
i am also ambivalent about severing my long association with baylor university,which has treated me well in so many ways.i only regret that because i was denied promotion to the rank of associate professor,i am ineligible for emeritus status.
thank you for whatever role you may have played in making arrangements for my retirement possible.i should also like to acknowledge the other kindnesses you have shown me during your tenure as director of abl.
nine months after she retired,in april,coley sued baylor,brooks,and sharp.she alleged that the defendants 
circumvented coley rights and privileges as a tenured faculty member,and undertook to threaten,intimidate,and harass coley in an effort to force her to leave her employment and,finally,when she did not abandon her position,they effectively removed her from her faculty position through the guise of redefinition ultimately,the unreasonable and harassing conduct of defendants did force coley to take early retirement from the clerical position that she was forced to assume after her faculty and research position,with the academic rights attendant thereto,was redefined 
this defacto removal of her vested tenure rights,she asserted,constituted a material and substantial breach of the contractual rights conferred on coley and other tenured faculty at baylor university.
at the close of the evidence,the trial court refused coley requests that the jury be asked whether baylor breached her tenure contract and that they be instructed 
that if you find and believe from the evidence that the change in betty coley duties,as ordered by baylor agents roger brooks and avery sharp,required betty coley to take a subordinate position,or one substantially different in its work and duties from the position for which she was tenured,then you should find that betty coley was constructively and wrongfully discharged from her tenured position.
instead,the court gave the jury the following question and instruction on liability 
did baylor university constructively discharge betty coley 
an employee is considered to have been discharged when an employer makes conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee position would have felt compelled to resign.
the jury answered no.the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict for baylor,and coley appealed,but only as to baylor.
the court of appeals rejected coley contention that she was entitled to a jury question on breach of contract,noting that she states in her brief that her theory of recovery is that baylor breached her contract by constructively discharging her and agree ing with baylor that the controlling issue is whether baylor constructively discharged coley.but the court held that the jury should have been given coley requested instruction on constructive discharge that instruction,the court concluded,reflects a correct statement of law with regard to an employer rights under an employment contract to modify an employee position,and the trial court instruction did not 
the court relied on our decision in kramer wolf cigar stores there,one kramer agreed in writing to faithfully and diligently act as general manager of the dallas stores of the union cigar stores company,with headquarters at dallas,performing such duties as are usually entailed upon a general manager under like circumstances kramer agreed to the title chief clerk of union cigar only dallas store,and when two smaller stores were added,he managed all three but when union cigar instructed him to move to the smallest of the three stores,which he believed could not serve as headquarters for the business,he refused and was discharged he sued for breach of contract,alleging that union cigar had in effect removed him as general manager and reduced him to little more than a tobacco salesman union cigar answered that kramer had only been transferred,not demoted.we held that the evidence was sufficient to present the issue whether or not the defendant broke the contract by requiring of plaintiff the performance of duties substantially different from those which he had agreed to perform 
like kramer,coley alleges that she was demoted in breach of her contract.but while there is evidence that her responsibilities were altered,there is no evidence that baylor ever required her to perform any job other than assistant professor,the rank at which she was tenured and which was specified in her last annual contract.as previously noted,coley did not introduce into evidence any contract with baylor that specified her functions,either in its terms or with reference to any other materials.nor does the letter granting her tenure specify her functions.coley instead points to president reynolds testimony that a tenured faculty member at baylor would be entitled to continue to do the general kinds of things in his field that he was doing when he was given tenure.but there is no evidence that coley did not continue to do the general kinds of things she had done when given tenure.over the years,her work changed as she assumed for awhile,then relinquished,some of the duties of director,and then was assigned different duties as positions in the library were redefined.neither her tenure letter nor her academic year contract refer to her position as librarian,and her new title,research librarian,was not significantly different.she agreed with brooks that her assignments as research librarian were very important to the operation of the library.even if her work varied substantially over time and in the end was more clerical than she desired,there is no evidence that it was not the work of an assistant professor.on the contrary,the evidence establishes that,in the words of baylor personnel policy manual,she continue d in her academic position.
unlike kramer,coley also alleges another,different breach of contract that she was constructively is,that she was in effect terminated without due process by being forced to resign.this,too,would be a breach of her tenure contract,but it can not be proved merely by a material change in job assignments.rather,constructive discharge has recently been defined by the united states supreme court in pennsylvania state police suders as an employee reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions here,the trial court jury instruction was taken verbatim from pjc of texas pattern jury charges,which is derived from the suders opinion it correctly describes constructive discharge.coley requested instruction confused two different breaches of an employment contract,one when the employee duties or responsibilities are changed in violation of a contract,and the other when intolerable working conditions force the employee to resign even though termination was not contractually permitted.in essence,the instruction would have told the jury that a material change in work assignments forces resignation.not surprisingly,coley offers no authority for this proposition.it is simply incorrect.the court of appeals conclusion that constructive discharge is differently defined,depending on whether employment is by contract or,is based on a misreading of kramer and is also incorrect.
the concurring opinion finds it unnecessary to address coley argument that her requested instruction should have been given because,as baylor contends,the instruction assumed a disputed fact and therefore was not worded substantially correctly the disputed fact was whether coley had tenure in a field,such as library science,or in a particular position of employment,such as librarian of the abl.baylor and the concurrence argue that because that fact was disputed,and because the requested instruction refers only to a tenured position,the requested instruction assumed the truth of a material controverted fact we disagree.this nearly imperceptible distinction between field and position,as related to this case,was but a speck of disagreement between the parties the heart of the constructive discharge claim was whether baylor change in coley duties effectively forced her to resign.the main issue was what degree of change is necessary to prove constructive discharge a move to a subordinate position,or one substantially different in its work and duties,as coley requested the jury be instructed,or conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee position would have felt compelled to resign,as the court instructed the jury.
in rejecting the argument that coley did not preserve error,the court of appeals quoted our statement in state department of highways public transportation payne 
there should be but one test for determining if a party has preserved error in the jury charge,and that is whether the party made the trial court aware of the complaint,timely and plainly,and obtained a ruling.the more specific requirements of the rules should be applied,while they remain,to serve rather than defeat this principle 
coley requested instruction presented the principal legal is
