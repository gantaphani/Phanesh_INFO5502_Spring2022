affirmative action,equal opportunity employer 
at.department chairman michael henle and professors of mathematics jeffrey witmer and robert bosch formed an informal recruiting and hiring committee for the position.
amini was unemployed at the time and applied for the position,submitting a cover letter dated october,a short resume,and a version of his full curriculum vitae.the cover letter described the highlights of his teaching experience,awards,and his multidisciplinary work experience,and it disclosed that case western reserve university denied him a tenure position with its medical school.oberlin sent a letter dated october,informing amini that his application lacked educational transcripts and three letters of reference.in response,amini supplemented his application with three letters of reference and one transcript along with a cover letter dated november,offering to provide additional information upon request.the recommendation letters related to the appellant applications for tenure with case western reserve university and were dated may,may,and september.oberlin apparently considered the letters deserving of less weight because the applicant sent them unsealed,so they were not confidential.oberlin did not pursue the plaintiff invitation to request additional materials.
chris andrews,the ultimately successful candidate and a former oberlin college student,contacted henle in october of to demonstrate interest in applying for the open position and to request a letter of recommendation.henle already had written a letter of recommendation for andrews in connection with a position at another academic institution.andrews had received a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics from oberlin college,a masters degree in mathematics from the university of california at berkeley,and a doctorate in statistics from carnegie mellon university.he had experience teaching at oberlin college with the texts utilized by the mathematics department.completion of a national science foundation fellowship distinguished him from his peers.the father of andrews had taught as a statistician at oberlin until taking a position as the college director of athletics,which created the vacancy for a statistics professor.at the time andrews applied for his father position at oberlin,he taught at lafayette college and had not yet completed one semester there.
henle added to andrews application file by providing a letter of recommendation.he also testified that he was concerned about complications that andrews application created for the department.he explained 
q.when he called you,did you in fact encourage him to apply 
no.i was,in fact,not particularly happy he applied.
because of he had been a student here,his father had taught here.
it just created a more complicated situation around his application,around the normal application 
a he has outstanding qualifications,in my view.it just the other issues that involved his application that made me less than pleased that he was applying.
at.henle did not clearly make his feelings known to other professors involved in the hiring decision.he testified 
q.but you never objected to that in any way 
no.i had no right to do that.
okay.at least in making your concern known to other members of the department 
i do know that we had much discussion of this issue.i may just have grumbled about it.
witmer received applications prior to the application deadline.the application of an hispanic female received his attention,shown by underlining on a letter recommending her.the letter,which is reproduced here with witmer underlining,reads as follows 
eleanne solorzano,who is applying for a position in your department,has requested that i provide a letter of recommendation on her behalf.i am delighted to do so she has a solid background in applied and theoretical statistics.she has also received training in statistical consulting and statistical computing.she has been a very good student eleanne dissertation is in the area of multiple comparisons her work extends dunnett landmark work for comparing treatments with on control her research is going well and i anticipate no difficulty with her completing the dissertation in time for an august graduation.we have one paper from the dissertation tentatively accepted in the journal of statistical computation and simulation.i anticipate that three other publications will result from her dissertation.eleanne enjoys research and should be a successful independent researcher.eleanne also enjoys teaching the most recent student evaluation of her teaching revealed that students rated her as excellent,as very good,and as good,as fair,and as poor i have not observed eleanne as a statistical consultant.however,the combination of her experience as a consultant,her consulting training in our department,and her excellent teamwork skills suggest that she has potential in this area.on the personal side,eleanne is a pleasant hispanic lady,who interacts well with others though born in nicaragua,she has been in this country a long time and fits completely into our culture.she is a citizen.her spoken and written english are excellent.
the applicant pool contained eight applicants with names common among and other races hamid behmard,alireza ranjbar motlagh,kamel rekab,yanguang li,maziar quliaeinia,golam kibria,khaled hussein,and ahmed mohd abdalla hamdi.
the informal hiring committee narrowed the field of applicants to six for final consideration by the whole mathematics department.andrews remained under consideration the plaintiff did not.henle represented in an affidavit that the committee eliminated amini from consideration because he had recently been denied tenure at case western reserve university and he submitted,letters of reference.at.in fact,one letter the plaintiff submitted indicated some concern for his performance,stating the committee believes that amini,clearly an imaginative person when it comes to statistical methodology,should be encouraged to devote a little more of his unusual energy to contributions.at.witmer and bosch averred that they did not recall reviewing the plaintiff application but stated that applicants were rejected based on their relative qualifications for the position,and the race of the applicant was not a consideration.
the department then met,discussed the six finalists,provided each member an opportunity to comment on the applicants,and selected two candidates by consensus to interview for the position joy jordan and chris andrews.jordan had not yet received her doctorate degree but expected to graduate in time to fill the position.
on december,henle extended an interview invitation to andrews.he also requested teaching evaluations from andrews position.henle eventually obtained the evaluations directly from lafayette college.he did not ask any other applicant to provide such evaluations,but witmer obtained similar information about jordan by contacting professors at the university of iowa,where she taught.jordan interviewed on december,andrews had his turn three days later.andrews met with each member of the mathematics department hiring committee and other members of the oberlin faculty,totaling about eleven individuals in all over the course of the day.the full mathematics department met within a day or two of the andrews interview and decided by consensus to extend an offer to andrews.henle,witmer,and bosch stated that the hiring committee and the department considered him to be the candidate most likely to succeed as a teacher of undergraduate students and researcher in the field of statistics.
on january,the plaintiff filed a complaint against oberlin college alleging racial,national origin,and religious discrimination in violation of count and count,and age discrimination in violation of et.count.the district court granted oberlin motion to dismiss all of the claims on april.on the first appeal,this court reversed in part and remanded the race discrimination claim under section for further proceedings.the complaint referenced an attached eeoc charge that alleged i believe i was discriminated against because of my race,middle eastern,national origin,iranian,and religion,muslim,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended and my age,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act.this court concluded that the reference was sufficient to survive a rule motion.amini oberlin college,cir.
discovery was conducted,and on october,oberlin filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining claim.the district court granted the motion,and the plaintiff now appeals that judgment,arguing that he has submitted evidence demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact on his claim,and the district court erred by not considering the evidence in the light most favorable to him.amini focuses his arguments on the contention that the district court failed to properly consider that the preferential treatment enjoyed by andrews demonstrates direct evidence of discrimination and indirect evidence that the reasons for the challenged action are pretextual.oberlin counters that the district court correctly granted its motion for summary judgment but contends the plaintiff did not demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination.
