we are required to determine in this case whether the granville county north carolina board of education enjoys eleventh amendment immunity in a suit brought by an employee against it under the fair labor standards act for overtime pay.the district court,finding that the board was an arm of the state and that any monetary award would affect the state,held the board immune.because we conclude,for the reasons that follow,that the board is more like a county than an arm of the state,we reverse.
mary cash has,since,been employed as a lead secretary v at webb high school in oxford,north carolina.she alleges that during the period between and she often worked more than hours per week and was not compensated with overtime pay.she commenced this action against the granville county board of education sometimes school board under the fair labor standards act,to recover compensatory and liquidated damages,interest,costs,and attorneys fees.
the school board asserted a defense of sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.on the school board motion for summary judgment,the district court dismissed the action.in doing so,the court assumed that harter vernon,cir,our most recent opinion on whether particular governmental entities are arms of the state for eleventh amendment purposes,is no longer salient and was effectively overruled by mcmillian monroe county,d,and regents of the university of california doe,d.the district court read regents requirement that an analysis of eleventh amendment immunity consider the provisions of state law that define the agency character to be in conflict with harter holding that the most important consideration is whether the state treasury will be affected.similarly,it noted that the mcmillian court relied on the character of the sheriff office,rather than the impact of the judgment on the state treasury.the district court then concluded 
thus,while the question of funding and who would pay for any monetary award is not the central question to be answered in evaluating immunity,it must be evaluated.it is clear that local school boards receive funds from the state and local governments.however,the ability of local boards to use those funds remains controlled by the state.thus,it appears that any monetary award to plaintiff would affect the state.
therefore,combining an analysis of the organizational and financial structure of the local school boards,in light of relevant case and statutory law,defendant is an arm of the state of north carolina for purposes of this suit seeking flsa damages.as such,it is entitled to sovereign immunity from a suit for monetary relief.
from the district court judgment dismissing her claim,cash noticed this appeal.
even though the language of the eleventh amendment preserves sovereign immunity of only the states of the union it is settled that this protection extends also to state agents and state instrumentalities,regents,at.or stated otherwise,to arm s of the state and state officials,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.but eleventh amendment immunity does not extend to counties and similar municipal corporations.id.this is so,even if the counties and municipalities exercise a slice of state power.lake country estates,tahoe regional planning agency,d citing healthy.in healthy,the supreme court held that a local school board,as constituted by ohio law,is more like a county or city than it is like an arm of the state.at.accordingly,the court denied the local school board eleventh amendment immunity.
the issue before us,as articulated by the supreme court,therefore turns on whether the granville county board of education is to be treated as an arm of the state partaking of the state eleventh amendment immunity,or is instead to be treated as a municipal corporation or other political subdivision to which the eleventh amendment does not extend.healthy,at.stated otherwise,we must determine whether a north carolina county school board has the same kind of independent status as a county or is instead an arm of the state,and therefore one of the united states within the meaning of the eleventh amendment.regents,at.because this question requires interpretation of the eleventh amendment,it is a federal question that we decide de novo,even though state law must be considered in defining the school board character.see id.
before elucidating the factors necessary to resolve this question,it is worthwhile to recognize that the immunity in question derives from the original sovereignty of the states and not from the eleventh amendment.the eleventh amendment confirmed,rather than established,sovereign immunity as a constitutional principle.alden maine,d.and,it follows that the scope of the states immunity from suit is demarcated not by the text of the amendment alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design.id.at.that design reserves to states a substantial portion of the nation primary sovereignty,together with the dignity and essential attributes inhering in that status,id.at,and preserves a system in which the state and federal governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people,id.quoting printz united states,d.the states thus retain the dignity,though not the full authority,of sovereignty.id.at.central to the dignity of a state sovereignty is the proposition that the state not be amenable to suit without its consent.at the time the federal constitution was proposed,the fear expressed during the debates was that adoption of the new constitution would strip states of their sovereign immunity,thereby exposing them to lawsuits for collection of revolutionary war debts.id.at.
even with a clear understanding of the source and nature of a state sovereign immunity,no bright line of demarcation can be drawn separating state agents and state instrumentalities,which partake of the state eleventh amendment immunity,from local governmental entities,which do not.but when the factors for resolving whether a governmental entity is an arm of the state or more like a county or municipality point in different directions,our inquiry seeks guidance in the twin reasons for the eleventh amendment the states fears that federal courts would force them to pay their revolutionary war debts,leading to their financial ruin,and the integrity retained by each state in our federal system,including the states sovereign immunity from suit.hess port auth,d quoting pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.indeed,these twin reasons must dominate any analysis of whether a governmental entity is to be accorded eleventh amendment immunity.see gray laws,cir.
consistent with the twin purposes of the eleventh amendment,when we have asked the question of whether a governmental entity within a state is an arm of the state,various factors have been identified for consideration.the principal factor,upon which courts have virtually always relied,is whether a judgment against the governmental entity would have to be paid from the state treasury.see regents,at.pointing out that whether a money judgment against a state instrumentality or official would be enforceable against the state is of considerable importance hess,at.agreeing with the vast majority of circuits that the state treasury factor is the most important factor to be considered internal quotation marks omitted harter vernon,cir noting that the state treasury factor is the most important gray,at noting that the state treasury factor is generally the most important consideration internal quotation marks omitted ram ditta maryland park planning comm n,cir concluding that the state treasury factor generally is most important consideration.indeed,it is because the state treasury factor may be dispositive that it is primary.consequently,if the state treasury will be called upon to pay a judgment against a governmental entity,then eleventh amendment immunity applies to that entity,and consideration of any other factor becomes unnecessary.see hess,at.where an agency is so structured that a judgment must expend itself against state treasuries,common sense and the rationale of the eleventh amendment require that sovereign immunity attach to the agency in
