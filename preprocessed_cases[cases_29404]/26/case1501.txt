defendant and appellant fleming gray gray appeals the trial court order granting the petition of plaintiff and respondent robert krell krell for an injunction under code of civil procedure section prohibiting gray from contacting or harassing krell ordering gray to stay at least yards away from krell and krell residence and workplace and ordering gray to remove krell name from all of gray flyers,signs and other written materials.gray contends the trial court erred by issuing the injunction because the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred krell from obtaining relief in the instant action following denial of an injunction in favor of krell employer,the los angeles unified school district lausd gray conduct as a matter of law did not constitute harassment under section gray conduct involved a labor dispute and was protected under section and issuance of the injunction violated gray federal and state constitutional rights of free speech.
we hold that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not bar the issuance of an injunction in this case there was substantial evidence to support issuance of an injunction to prevent harassment under section section does not apply to the facts of this case the injunction issued,to the extent it prohibits use of krell name in all signs and written materials,was an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and to the extent the injunction imposed a distance restriction,the injunction was overbroad,given the absence of any justification in the record for such a restriction.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the matter for the trial court to determine what injunctions should issue consistent with this opinion and specifically,what distance restriction,if any,would accomplish the desired result of preventing harassment without impeding gray constitutionally protected rights of expression.
background 
gray was employed as a substitute teacher at pacoima middle school.krell is the assistant principal at the school.in june,krell investigated an incident involving gray and mario,a student in gray class,in which gray purportedly refused to permit mario to use the restroom during class.when the class period ended,gray dismissed the other students but forced mario to remain seated.mario urinated in his pants.students susana and javier corroborated mario version of the incident.without discussing the matter with gray,krell and the school principal issued a reprimand called a notice of inadequate service to gray regarding the incident.gray filed a grievance,and the lausd and gray ultimately settled the matter by removing the reprimand from gray personnel record in exchange for gray agreement not to return to pacoima middle school for substitute work.
in october,gray sent krell a letter objecting to the manner in which the investigation had been conducted and requesting compensation of a suitable amount and a written apology.krell did not agree to those requests.in january,gray began picketing and handing out leaflets on the public sidewalk in front of the school.he was quoted as saying,you watch and see what one person can do to disrupt the system.
the picket sign and leaflets contained the following message notice sometimes,a racist can even be someone who says they care about your child education.at this school,krell appears to be more interested in encouraging children to play a lottery,krell krush,than what is important to learn.at the same time when children,such as mario,susana,alex,cindy,jose attack their teacher with racist and sexist words,he is not concerned or interested.he even chooses to believe them when they tell lies about a teacher who they do like because he demands good work and discipline.that attitude by the leadership of this school is one of the reasons for the lack of discipline here and why pacoima students are one of the lowest in lausd for academic achievement.what is happening with your child gray.at about the same time,krell began receiving daily threats by telephone and mail such as die krell racist,watch your back,the windows or the street we see your car,and i know what time you go to work,has anybody tried to kill you before do you know what a gun shot sounds like 
on january,the lausd filed a petition for an injunction under section seeking,on behalf of krell,an lausd employee,an injunction prohibiting unlawful violence or threats of violence by gray the lausd action.the lausd petition was supported by the declarations of krell and other administrators at pacoima middle school expressing fear of potential injury as a result of gray actions.the petition was also supported by declarations from the parents of mario and susana stating that because of gray activities,mario and susana were afraid to go to school.after an evidentiary hearing in which the trial court found that gray conduct did not constitute unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence,the trial court commissioner scott gordon denied the petition 
on may,krell filed a petition seeking an injunction under section,which allows a person who has suffered harassment to seek an injunction prohibiting further harassment.the trial court found that gray conduct constituted harassment under section and granted the petition.the injunction provides that gray shall not contact,molest,harass,attack,strike,threaten,telephone,send any messages to,follow,stalk,destroy the personal property of,disturb the peace of,or keep under surveillance or block movements in public places or thoroughfares of krell.the injunction also requires gray to stay at least yards away from krell and krell residence and place of work,and requires gray to remove krell name from any and all of gray flyers,signs or any other written material.gray appeals from the order granting the petition for an injunction.
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court decision to grant a permanent injunction rests within its sound discretion and will not be disturbed without a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.shapiro san diego city council th,d.in determining whether the trial court abused its discretion when there are disputed factual issues,we review the trial court findings under the substantial evidence standard,resolving all factual conflicts and questions of credibility in the respondent favor and drawing all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the judgment,so long as it is supported by evidence that is reasonable,credible and of solid value.ibid schild rubin d.determined whether substantial evidence supports the requisite elements of willful harassment,as defined in code of civil procedure section.in granting krell petition for an injunction,the trial court found that gray conduct constituted harassment as defined in section we review that finding under the substantial evidence test.we review de novo questions of law,including gray arguments that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel bar krell from obtaining relief,that gray conduct was protected by section and by the federal and state constitutions,and that the injunction was constitutionally overbroad.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
res judicata and collateral estoppel 
res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits.res judicata,or claim preclusion,prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.mycogen monsanto cal th,d,mycogen.
we determine that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel bars krell action under section because the cause of action in this case and the cause of action in the lausd action are not the same,and there were no issues argued and decided in the lausd action that are dispositive in this case.therefore,we do not have to determine for purposes of res judicata or collateral estoppel whether krell was in privity with the lausd.
claim preclusion 
california law defines a cause of action for purposes of the res judicata doctrine by analyzing the primary right at stake a cause of action is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff,a corresponding primary duty of the defendant,and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.citation.i f two actions involve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even if in the second suit the plaintiff pleads different theories of recovery,seeks different forms of relief adds new facts supporting recovery.citations.citation.on the other hand,different primary rights may be violated by the same wrongful conduct.citation.le parc community workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see also mycogen,supra,cal th at,d.
the lausd action and the present action do not involve the same cause of action.the lausd action sought an injunction pursuant to section,which enables a ny employer,whose employee has suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence from any individual,that can reasonably be construed to be carried out or to have been carried out at the workplace,to seek a temporary restraining order and an injunction on behalf of the employee prohibiting further unlawful violence or threats of violence by that individual,subd.a.in this action,krell sought relief under section,which authorizes a person who has suffered harassment,subd.a to obtain an injunction against the harassing conduct.the primary right at issue in the lausd action was the right of an employer to maintain a workplace free of violence.the primary right at issue here is the right of an individual to enjoin conduct that seriously alarms,annoys,or harasses that individual.thus,res judicata does not bar the present action.
issue preclusion 
in the lausd action,the trial court found gray conduct did not constitute unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence and denied injunctive relief.gray contends that this ruling precludes krell from obtaining relief in this case because harassment,as defined in section,encompasses unlawful violence and a credible threat of violence.he is incorrect.
although the definition of harassment in section overlaps,to some extent,with section,that definition includes conduct that is outside the scope of section.section defines harassment as follows harassment is unlawful violence,a credible threat of violence,or a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms,annoys,or harasses the person,and that serves no legitimate purpose.the course of conduct must be such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress,and must actually cause substantial emotional distress to the plaintiff,subd.b.thus,in addition to unlawful violence and a credible threat of violence,section definition includes a third type of that seriously alarms,annoys or harasses,subd.b.it is this third type of conduct that is at issue in this case.
the ruling in the lausd action that gray conduct was neither violent nor a credible threat of violence did not preclude the trial court in this action from determining whether such conduct was harassing in the sense that it seriously alarms,annoys or harasses.moreover,the trial court in the lausd action expressly stated that it was not deciding whether gray conduct constituted harassment under section is between two individuals and is harassment between individuals.that is not at issue here.the reason i mention it is because there are three kinds of conduct that can be restrained under section.one is violent sic,threat of violence,or harassment.harassment being defined as any kind of conduct that does not have a legitimate purpose that would seriously annoy,harass,and cause substantial emotional distress.which is the section that the legislation gave dealing with protecting a work environment in a school certainly is under deals with sic and it is interesting the conduct that it deals with specifically indicates any employer whose employee has suffered unlawful violence or credible threat of violence from any individual can seek an injunction.so there are two forums.the first of the two enjoin sic under are there.the third is not.because the trial court in the lausd action expressly excluded from its ruling any determination of whether gray conduct was harassment under section,the ruling in the lausd action does not collaterally estop krell from adjudicating that issue here.
gray contends that his conduct constituted peaceful picketing arising out of a labor dispute and was protected by section gray further contends that this issue previously was adjudicated in his favor in the lausd action and that krell is collaterally estopped from arguing otherwise.
section provides in part a in order to promote the rights of workers to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining,picketing or other mutual aid or protection,and to prevent the evils which frequently occur when courts interfere with the normal processes of dispute resolution between employers and recognized employee organizations,the equity jurisdiction of the courts in cases involving or growing out of a labor dispute shall be no broader than as set forth in subdivision b of this section,and the provisions of subdivision b of this section shall be strictly construed in accordance with existing law governing labor disputes with the purpose of avoiding any unnecessary judicial interference in labor disputes.b the acts enumerated in this subdivision,whether performed singly or in concert,shall be legal,and no court nor any judge nor judges thereof,shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction which,in specific or general terms,prohibits any person or persons,whether singly or in concert,from doing any of the following giving publicity to,and obtaining or communicating information regarding the existence of,or the facts involved in,any labor dispute,whether by advertising,speaking,patrolling any public street or any place where any person or persons may lawfully be,or by any other method not involving fraud,violence or breach of the peace.peaceful picketing or patrolling involving any labor dispute,whether engaged in singly or in numbers 
labor dispute is defined in the statute as follows i a case shall be held to involve or to grow out of a labor dispute when the case involves persons who are engaged in the same industry,trade,craft,or occupation or have direct or indirect interests therein or who are employees of the same employer or who are members of the same or an affiliated organization of employers or employees whether such dispute is a between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employees or associations of employees b between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employers or associations of employers or c between one or more employees or associations of employees and one or more employees or associations of employees or when the case involves any conflicting or competing interests in a labor dispute of persons participating or interested therein as defined in subparagraph ii.ii a person or association shall be held to be a person participating or interested in a labor dispute if relief is sought against him or it,and if he or it is engaged in the same industry,trade,craft,or occupation in which such dispute occurs,or has a direct or indirect interest therein,or is a member,officer,or agent of any association composed in whole or in part of employers or employees engaged in such industry,trade,craft,or occupation.iii the term labor dispute includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment,or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating,fixing,maintaining,changing,or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee,subd.b.
the express purpose of the statute,consistent with its legislative history,is to promote the rights of workers to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining,picketing or other mutual aid or protection,and to prevent the evils which frequently occur when courts interfere with the normal processes of dispute resolution between employers and recognized employee organizations,subd.a sears,roebuck san diego county dist.council of carpenters,supra,cal d at.section does not apply to this case,which involves an individuals alleged harassment of another individual and which does not involve grays union or any other recognized employee organization or any terms or conditions of employment.grays status as a former employee at the school where krell is employed does not make this matter a labor dispute.because the issue of whether section applied to gray conduct was not argued and decided in gray favor in the lausd action,krell is not collaterally estopped from arguing against the application of section in this case.
section provides in relevant part a person who has suffered harassment as defined in subdivision b may seek a temporary restraining order and an injunction prohibiting harassment as provided in this section.as noted above,subdivision b of the statute defines harassment as unlawful violence,a credible threat of violence,or a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms,annoys,or harasses the person,and that serves no legitimate purpose.the course of conduct must be such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress,and must actually cause substantial emotional distress to the plaintiff,subd.b.
course of conduct is defined in section,subdivision b as follows a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time,however short,evidencing a continuity of purpose,including following or stalking an individual,making harassing telephone calls to an individual,or sending harassing correspondence to an individual by any means,including,but not limited to,the use of public or private mails,interoffice mail,fax,or computer.constitutionally protected activity is not included within the meaning of course of conduct.that picketing and leafleting are not specifically mentioned as included within the term course of conduct does not mean they are excluded.t he word including in a statute is ordinarily a term of enlargement rather than limitation.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d,see people western air lines,cal d,the statutory definition of a thing as including certain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.there is no reason why any particular form of communication can not be a course of conduct constituting harassment.
to uphold an injunction under section,we must first conclude there is substantial evidence of harassment.we must then determine that the conduct was not constitutionally protected,and thus capable of being enjoined.finally,we must determine whether the scope of the injunction is constitutional.
acts of harassment 
the trial court found that gray conduct constituted harassment,as that term is defined by section.there is substantial evidence that gray conduct qualifies as such harassment so long as it was not constitutionally protected.
krell testified that every day from january,until june,gray carried a sign and handed out leaflets in front of the school stating that krell was a racist and naming some of the school students.krell said that as a result of gray conduct and false accusations,krell was being publicly humiliated and parents and students questioned his integrity,credibility and authority.krell also testified that during this same time period,he received threatening messages with obscene accusations daily in writing and by telephone that he had never previously received such threats that gray conduct created a threatening atmosphere and that krell was fearful of his personal safety and the safety of the children attending the school.
krell added that in early january he had suffered a heart problem due to stress,and that gray conduct caused krell and others emotional distress.krell testimony was corroborated by that of the school principal,david gonzalez,who stated that gray conduct was threatening not only to krell,but to other staff members who were afraid to talk to or approach gray.he noted that gray was no longer an employee of lausd.he said that some students are fearful to attend school as long as gray remains in front of the school distributing flyers and displaying his sign,both of which contain confidential student information and derogatory information about krell and myself.gonzalez added that several parents have complained that gray is harassing the children.
here the claim is by the school district.nevertheless,adverse effects upon school children and teachers by the activities are components of that which seriously alarms,annoys,or harasses krell under section.moreover,some of gray activities,especially the disclosure of the names of the school students,not only serves no legitimate purpose under section,but may violate the rights of the students.see porten university of san francisco d.
not constitutionally protected 
the conduct here is not constitutionally protected and therefore is a course of conduct under section that can constitute harassment.the first amendment of the united states constitution provides in relevant part congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or the right of the people peaceably to assemble these rights are protected against state interference by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.de jonge oregon.article i,section,subsection a of the california constitution provides every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.
the right to free speech,however,is not absolute.near minnesota.the united states supreme court has made clear that there are circumstances in which spoken words or other forms of communication are not constitutionally protected s ince words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not against speech but against conduct a law against treason,for example,is violated by telling the enemy the nation defense secrets speech can be swept up incidentally within the reach of a statute directed at conduct rather than speech.paul,d see also roberts united states jaycees,d roberts a cts of invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods,services,and other advantages cause unique evils that government has a compelling interest to apart from the point of view such conduct may transmit.accordingly,like violence or other types of potentially expressive activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative impact,such practices are entitled to no constitutional protection gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d,in its scope,the first amendment right to freedom of speech is not unlimited.our supreme court has pointed out that the free speech clause of article i of the california constitution and its right to freedom of speech are not only as broad and as great as the first amendment,they are even broader and greater.gerawan farming,lyons,supra,cal th at,d.the court noted,however,that this general rule does not preclude the possibility of exception.ibid.the freedom of speech clause in the california constitution is,like the first amendment to the united states constitution,not absolute or unlimited.see,aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,d,aguilar los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles cal th,d,see also gerawan farming,lyons,supra,cal th at and at,fn,d.
our supreme court also has noted,m any crimes can consist solely of spoken words,such as soliciting a bribe,perjury,or making a terrorist threat,t he state may penalize threats,even those consisting of pure speech,provided the relevant statute singles out for punishment threats falling outside the scope of first amendment protection.citations.civil wrongs also may consist solely of spoken words,such as slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress.a statute that is otherwise valid,and is not aimed at protected expression,does not conflict with the first amendment simply because the statute can be violated by the use of spoken words or other expressive activity.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.if the expressive activity cause s unique evils that government has a compelling interest to prevent or produce s special harms distinct from their communicative impact,the activity is not entitled to constitutional protection.roberts,supra,at.
we conclude that gray activities are not constitutionally protected.the state has expressed,by statute and in the california constitution cal,art.i,a compelling interest in protecting individuals from harassing conduct.section is a statute enacted to protect the individual right to pursue safety,happiness and privacy as guaranteed by the california constitution schraer berkeley property owners association d.by proscribing harassing conduct.there was substantial evidence that gray expressive activities in the instant case constituted harassment under section,and that the activities did not stand alone,but constituted a course of conduct that actually cause d substantial emotional distress to the plaintiff.
moreover,because gray activities were conducted in the immediate vicinity of a school attended by children,they produced special harms distinct from their communicative impact.roberts,supra,at.the united states supreme court has recognized that there must be an accommodation between first amendment rights and the special characteristics of the school environment.grayned city of rockford,d grayned quoting tinker des moines school district,d.no one has an absolute constitutional right to use all parts of a school building or its immediate environs for his unlimited expressive purposes.grayned,supra,at,italics added.

in aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,the court noted that neither the united states constitution nor the california constitution protected harassment in violation of the fair employment and housing act feha,et.here we deal with harassment of a school employee in connection with his school activities.the united states supreme court has noted that t he ability to control and influence behavior exists to an even greater extent in the classroom than in the workplace.davis,supra.because there was substantial evidence that gray activities invaded the rights of krell and the school children and conflicted with compelling state interests,the expressive activities at issue were not constitutionally protected and fell within the course of conduct that could be enjoined under section.
constitutionality of the terms of the injunction 
gray contends the injunction granted is an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech because it seeks to prevent only speculative harm and is overly broad.gray challenges two aspects of the injunction issued distance restriction that prevents him from coming within yards of the school where he was employed and where krell presently works,and a restriction that precludes gray from naming krell in any sign,flier,or other written materials 
a prior restraint is an administrative or judicial order that restricts speech in advance of it being made.alexander united states,d.although not unconstitutional per se,a prior restraint bears a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.citations.southeastern promotions,conrad,d.not all injunctions that may incidentally affect expression are prior restraints.madsen women health center,d,fn.madsen aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
the injunction here falls within the definition of a prior restraint as a judicial order forbidding certain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.citation.alexander united states,supra,at,italics in original.to the extent the injunction precludes gray from continuing communications,it is a prior restraint.the question remains whether it is a prohibited prior restraint.a prior restraint on speech may be constitutional if it takes place under procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system.southeastern promotions,conrad,supra,at.for example,the united states supreme court repeatedly has held that an injunction prohibiting the repetition or continuation of specific expressive activity is not an unconstitutional prior restraint if the court issuing the injunction has found that specific expressive activity to be unlawful and if the injunction is clear and sweeps no more broadly than necessary.see,pittsburgh press human rel.comm,d see also aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,discussing prior restraints under federal constitution.
in aguilar,supra,cal th at page,d,a plurality of the california supreme court stated that an injunction prohibiting the use of racial epithets in the workplace was not an unconstitutional prior restraint under either the federal or state constitution,because the order was issued only after the jury determined that defendants had engaged in employment discrimination,and the order simply precluded defendants from continuing their unlawful activity.in a concurring opinion,justice werdegar suggested that more than a judicial finding of unlawfulness was necessary to enjoin speech,and that other factors in that case weighed in favor of injunctive relief,including a compelling state interest in eradicating racial discrimination the fact that the restrained speech occurred in the workplace,rather than a traditional public forum,such as a street or public sidewalk the presence of an unwilling and captive audience and the availability of alternative speech venues for the speaker.id.at,d.
the plurality and concurring opinions in aguilar support the injunction here.in the instant case,the trial court found that the speech violated section,a statute enacted to protect a compelling state individual state constitutionally protected right to safety,happiness and privacy.schraer berkeley property owners,supra,d at.there is also a compelling state interest in ensuring the functioning of schools the school children and their parents who had to come to the school were,in effect,an unwilling and captive audience and there were alternative speech venues for the the board of education and other public fora,although such fora may not have been as effective in conveying the desired message.
we recognize that we may,in the words of justice werdegar in aguilar,be sailing into unchartered first amendment waters.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of werdegar.we also note the dissents from the opinion in aguilar,although,to some extent,they are based on the position that the record was not sufficient in that case for an injunction.see id.at,d,dis.opn.of mosk,and dis.opn.of kennard.the issue of whether the reasoning set forth in aguilar may be applied to uphold an injunction restraining speech as constitutionally valid if the speech has been adjudicated to violate a specific state statutory scheme,including defamatory speech,are issues that may be resolved by cases currently pending before both the united states supreme court and the california supreme court.cochran tory,wl nonpub.opn,cert.granted september,d balboa island village lemen,d,review granted december,cal,d.nevertheless,consistent with the decision in aguilar,we believe the trial court may enjoin an act that constitutes statutory harassment subject to injunctive relief,even though the injunction may be a prior restraint on speech.
if,as the court in ag
