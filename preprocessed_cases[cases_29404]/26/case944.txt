is a bilingual student in pajaro valley unified school district pvusd,california.he has performed poorly in school,although by most measures,he is of average to intellectual ability.parents brought this action to challenge pvusd determination that did not qualify for special education under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.the special education division of the california office of administrative hearings oah upheld pvusd assessment.the district court,in turn,upheld the oah decision.
this appeal comes to us after careful consideration by an able district judge.we disagree with his assessment only to the extent that we find one claim not addressed and one report not measured for its relevance.we affirm the judgment of the district court in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
at all relevant times,was a student in pvusd.in the third and fourth grades,he struggled in school.his teachers identified attention and homework completion as problem areas.they used interventions designed to help him succeed in a regular educational program.they had limited success.was designated as at risk for retention.however,his teachers did not perceive him as a candidate for special education.
the summer before entered fifth grade,his parents brought him to a psychologist,roslyn wright,to have him evaluated for a learning disability.wright assessed using a test of intellectual ability,the wechsler intelligence scale for children,third edition wisc iii,and a battery of achievement tests,the woodcock johnson tests of achievement iii wj iii.based on the test results,wright diagnosed with a learning disability.
parents then requested pvusd to assess their son for eligibility for special education and related services under idea.pvusd psychologist administered to the kaufman assessment battery for children k abc,a comprehensive intelligence test,and the wj iii achievement tests.based on this assessment,pvusd determined that was not eligible for special education.
at the request of parents,pvusd reassessed in may of his year and reached essentially the same result as it did in its first assessment.pvusd performed a third assessment in june,resulting in recommendations for additional interventions in the general education classroom.at the end of fifth grade,pvusd again designated as at risk for retention.
in november,in the first half of year,e.parents obtained an auditory evaluation by ruth kaspar.she concluded that had an auditory processing disorder.
proceedings 
parents disagreed with pvusd assessments and,on december,filed a complaint with the special education division of the oah.the oah held a due process hearing and issued a decision in favor of pvusd on all issues.appealed the decision to the district court,where the parties filed for summary judgment.
in the district court,moved to supplement the record with evidence obtained after the conclusion of the oah hearing.this evidence included a report by cheryl jacques,a clinical psychologist,who reviewed records and conducted a battery of tests.jacques tested intelligence using the wisc iv,an updated version of the wisc iii test that wright used.based on her assessment and review of the records relating to,jacques concluded that had a specific learning disability as defined under idea.see.she also reviewed the data from prior assessments and concluded that it was puzzling that pvusd did not find that qualified for special education in.the district court denied request to supplement the record with jacques report.
the district court initially denied pvusd motion for summary judgment and remanded case to the oah for further written analysis as to some of the prior conclusions of the administrative law judge alj.in the meantime,pvusd and,on february,found him eligible for special education as of that date.pvusd did not admit that it had previously failed to locate,evaluate,and identify as a student with a disability.
the oah returned case to the district court,where argued that he was entitled to compensatory educational services,among other forms of relief,based on pvusd failure to meet its obligations to him under idea prior to its february,reassessment.the district court found that the alj amended opinion provided a sufficient basis for deciding the parties for summary judgment.it granted pvusd motion.

we first address eligibility for special education as a child with a specific learning disability.under california law in effect during the relevant period,a child is found to have a specific learning disability when it is determined that a severe discrepancy exists between the child intellectual ability and achievement in one or more of seven designated academic areas t he discrepancy is due to a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes and is not the result of environmental,cultural,or economic disadvantages and t he discrepancy can not be corrected through other regular or categorical services offered within the regular instructional program.cal.the parties dispute whether met the first and second criteria.
argues that the district court improperly concluded that he failed to establish that he suffered from a disorder in a basic psychological process.we agree.the only person who formally assessed for an auditory processing disorder was ruth kaspar.kaspar,an audiologist,diagnosed with an auditory processing disorder.the school district hired jody winzelberg,also an audiologist,as an expert witness.based on a review of kaspar report,winzelberg testified that she would characterize test results as showing some weakness in the auditory system,and that she could not rule out an auditory processing disorder diagnosis.
also argues that the district court erred in concluding that he failed to show that there was a severe discrepancy between his intellectual ability and achievement scores.in determining whether a severe discrepancy existed,pvusd used performance score of on the wisc iii test administered by wright rather than mental processing composite score of on the k abc test that pvusd itself administered.pvusd does not dispute that had it used the k abc score,it would have found a severe discrepancy.instead,pvusd argues that it made a reasonable determination that e.did not show a severe discrepancy based on all available material on contends that pvusd impermissibly considered the fact that he is bilingual and cherry picked among his test scores to reach a predetermined result.
this court has held that school districts have discretion in selecting the diagnostic tests they use to determine special education eligibility.see ford long beach unified sch,cir holding that a school district need not use any traditional iq test to assess for specific learning disability.case presents a related,but different,question does idea permit a school district to exclude the valid results of a test the district itself selected and administered this question touches on a fundamental tension in special education law that between ensuring that all disabled children have access to educational opportunity and ensuring that children are not improperly identified as disabled.this tension is particularly salient for minority students,who historically have been as disabled and disproportionally placed in segregated educational settings,due in part to biased iq tests.see,larry by lucille riles,cir diana cal.bd.of,no.c rfp,resolved through a stipulated settlement.idea mandates that states implement safeguards aimed at ensuring that testing procedures are not racially or culturally discriminatory,and that no single procedure shall be the sole criterion for determining an appropriate educational program for a child.a b.in line with this requirement,california code of regulations,title,j mandates that school districts consider all relevant material which is available on the pupil and not use any single score or product of scores,test or procedure in determining eligibility based on a specific learning disability.where a comparison of iq scores and achievement scores yields an ambiguous result,the application of a blanket rule barring a school district from considering other factors in determining whether a child has a specific learning disability would upset the balance idea attempts to achieve.accordingly,we hold that a school district,considering all relevant material available on a pupil,must make a reasonable choice between valid but conflicting test results in determining whether a severe discrepancy exists.see,tit,j.
before determining whether pvusd choice among test scores was reasonable,it is necessary to address the parties dispute over whether the district court properly excluded the assessment of conducted by jacques.idea mandates that,on review of an administrative decision,the district court shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party.i c ii.but not all evidence is additional evidence.in ojai unified sch.dist.jackson,we held that a district court need not consider evidence that simply repeats or embellishes evidence taken at the administrative hearing,nor should it admit evidence that changes the character of the hearing from one of review to a trial de novo,cir,cert.denied,quoting town of burlington dep t of,cir,aff sub nom.sch.comm.dep t of.adopting the first circuit rule in town of burlington,we held that additional evidence includes,inter alia,evidence concerning relevant events occurring subsequent to the administrative hearing.ojai,at.applying this rule,we determined that the district court properly admitted evidence related to an alternative educational placement for a disabled child.id.the placement first became available after the child administrative hearing.id.similarly,in adams oregon,we observed that evidence may shed light on the objective reasonableness of a school district actions at the time the school district rendered its decision,cir.in summary,under our precedent,evidence that is,relevant,and otherwise admissible constitutes additional evidence that the district court shall consider pursuant to i c ii.
idea requirement that courts consider additional evidence is grounded in the somewhat unusual nature of judicial review under the act.in ojai,we observed that judicial review in idea cases differs substantially from judicial review of other agency actions,in which courts generally are confined to the administrative record and are held to a highly deferential standard of review.at.under idea,the federal court has a continuing obligation to ensure that the state standards themselves and as applied are not below the federal minimums which persists despite any state administrative rulings on federal law or state recodifications of federal law.town of burlington,at.the requirement that federal courts consider additional evidence when evaluating state administrative rulings implements the intent that federal courts enforce the minimum federal standards idea sets out.
it is argued that our reading of i c ii conflicts with the fourth circuit holding in schaffer weast,cir.but in schaffer,the contention that the district court violated idea mandate that it hear additional evidence failed for the straightforward reason that the district court in fact had admitted the evidence.id.at.it simply concluded that the evidence should not determine the merits of the case.id.here,the district court did not admit jacques report and did not consider it in deciding the merits of case.
it is also argued that our opinion is inconsistent with the eighth circuit holding in west platte r ii school district wilson,cir.in west platte,the court upheld the district court exclusion of evidence of a child progress subsequent to the administrative hearing because the proponent of the evidence the school district failed to provide a solid justification for supplementing the record.id.at.the court in west platte did not cite i c ii,and the court appears not to have accounted for the unusual nature of judicial review in idea cases.see ojai,at.moreover,west platte unelaborated requirement that the school district offer a solid justification for the admission of evidence does not appear to conflict with our reading of i c ii.the determinations of a state agency are entitled to greater deference where,as in west platte,the agency finds that one of its school systems has not complied with the state implementation of the idea.see town of burlington,at.
our reading of i c ii finds support in susan wilson school district,cir,in which the third circuit ruled that a district court must exercise particularized discretion in its rulings so that it will consider evidence relevant,and useful in determining whether congress goal has been reached for the child involved.the court concluded that the district court lacked discretion to summarily exclude evidence that was not available at the time of the administrative hearing and was relevant to the district court assessment of the reasonableness of the school district decision at the time the decision was made.id.at.
similarly,in town of burlington,the first circuit declined to adopt a rule disallowing testimony by all who did,or could have,testified at the administrative hearing.at.the court commented on the particular usefulness of expert testimony to the district court in illuminating the nature of the controversy and bringing the court up to date on the child progress from the time of the hearing to the trial.id.at.
we hold that the district court applied an incorrect standard for admission of evidence in excluding jacques report.the district court excluded jacques report as not necessary to evaluate the alj determination.the proper inquiry was whether the report was relevant,and otherwise admissible.
jacques report shows that had a legally significant discrepancy between ability and achievement in.this showing may make it more likely that a legally significant discrepancy was present in.moreover,jacques observed that pvusd would have found that a severe discrepancy existed in had it used either the k abc score of or the k abc mental processing composite score of.her report concluded that it is puzzling that the district did not find eligible for special education in.
it is true that we have said that actions of the school systems can not be judged exclusively in hindsight.adams,at quoting fuhrmann hannover bd.of,cir.but that exclusive use of hindsight is forbidden does not preclude consideration of subsequent events.id.the clear implication of permitting some hindsight is that additional data,discovered late in the evaluation process,may provide significant insight into the child condition,and the reasonableness of the school district action,at the earlier date.
it might be thought that the more exacting test,developed in,is not relevant to the test could not have been used in.the school district can not be faulted for failing to use a test that was not available in.the intent of i c ii,however,is that the school district actions be reviewed with the help available in.
on remand,the district court should consider whether jacques report is relevant to the determination whether pvusd met its obligations to under the idea and is otherwise admissible.
also argues that the district court should have considered pvusd assessment finding him eligible for special education and related services on the basis of his specific learning disability.idea pro
