this is a case brought under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code et that is before us for a second time.in the first appeal,we affirmed the trial court ruling that defendant san mateo county community college district violated ceqa when it responded to changes in a campus renovation project by issuing an addendum to a mitigated negative declaration.we held that the proposed changes constituted a new project not subject to an addendum.friends of college of san mateo gardens san mateo county community college dist,nonpub.opn,wl.our state supreme court reversed after concluding that we should not have assessed whether the changes constituted a new project,but should have instead assessed whether ceqa subsequent review provisions were applicable and,if so,whether the addendum was permissible under them.friends of college of san mateo gardens san mateo county community college dist.cal th,san mateo gardens.
evaluating the project changes as directed,we now conclude that they amounted to a modified project,meaning ceqa subsequent review provisions apply.we also conclude that defendants use of an addendum violated these provisions because there is substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the project changes might have a significant effect on the environment.accordingly,we again affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the facilities master plan,the mitigated negative declaration,and the addendum.
the following factual background is taken from the supreme court opinion in san mateo gardens.unless otherwise noted,we will use the same defined terms used in that opinion.
in,defendants the san mateo county community college district and its board of trustees collectively,district adopted a facilities master plan plan proposing nearly billion in new construction and facilities renovations at the district three college campuses.at the college of san mateo college,the district plan included a proposal to demolish certain buildings and renovate others.the buildings slated for renovation included the college building complex,which includes a small concrete classroom and lab structure,greenhouse,lath house,surrounding garden space,and an interior courtyard.
in,the district published an initial study and mitigated negative declaration mnd analyzing the physical environmental effects of implementing the plan proposed improvements at the college,including the proposed rehabilitation of the building complex.the mnd stated that,with the implementation of certain mitigation measures,the plan would not have a significant effect on the environment.in,the district certified its initial study and adopted the mnd.
when the district later failed to obtain funding for the planned building complex renovations,it the proposed renovation.in may,the district issued a notice of determination,indicating that it would instead demolish,rather than renovate,the complex and replace it with parking lot,accessibility,and landscaping improvements.the district also proposed to renovate two other buildings,buildings and,that had previously been slated for demolition.
the district concluded a subsequent or supplemental environmental impact report eir was not required.it instead addressed the change through an addendum to its initial study and mnd,concluding that the project changes would not result in a new or substantially more severe impact than disclosed in the mnd.therefore,an addendum is the appropriate ceqa documentation.
the newly proposed demolition of the building complex,and particularly the demolition of the complex associated gardens,proved controversial.certain members of the public,as well as a number of college students and faculty,vocally criticized the demolition proposal at public hearings.the district nevertheless approved demolition of the building complex in accordance with the addendum.
plaintiff friends of the college of san mateo gardens friends filed suit challenging the approval.the district thereafter rescinded its original addendum and issued a revised addendum in august.the revised addendum reiterated the original addendum conclusion but bolstered its analysis.on august,after public comment and discussion,the revised addendum was adopted and demolition of the building complex was reapproved.san mateo gardens,supra,cal th at.
b.this action.
friends voluntarily dismissed its initial suit and filed the present action in september challenging the revised addendum.friends sought a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the district to set aside its approval of the building demolition project and to fully comply with ceqa by preparing an eir and adopting feasible alternatives and mitigation measures.the trial court found that the demolition project was inconsistent with the original plan and that its impacts were not addressed in the mnd.the court granted friends petition for a writ of mandate,ordering the district to refrain from taking further actions adversely affecting the physical environment at the building complex pending its full compliance with requirements of ceqa.
the district appealed,and we affirmed.friends of college of san mateo gardens san mateo county community college,supra,wl,at.we concluded as a matter of law that the district proposal was a new project,subject to ceqa initial review standards under section,rather than a modified project subject to the subsequent review provisions of section and section of the ceqa guidelines cal.code,tit,et.wl,at pp.because we concluded that the initial review provisions applied,we held that the addendum was improper and that the district was required to conduct an initial study of the project to determine whether an eir was required.wl,at.
the district sought review in the supreme court,which reversed.san mateo gardens,supra,cal th at.the supreme court explained that our approach in assessing whether the proposal amounted to a new project was incorrect and would inevitably invite arbitrary results because neither ceqa nor the cases interpreting it contain any standards for determining whether a project qualifies as new.id.at.instead of resting on whether a project is new in an abstract sense,the decision to proceed under ceqa subsequent review provisions must necessarily rest on a determination whether implicit or explicit that the original environmental document retains some informational value.id.at.such an inquiry is a predominantly factual question for the agency to answer in the first instance,drawing on its particular expertise.id.at.a court task on review is then to decide whether the agency determination is supported by substantial evidence the court job is not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument.ibid.the court emphasized that occasions when a court finds no substantial evidence to support an agency decision to proceed under ceqa subsequent review provisions will be rare,and rightly so a court should tread with extraordinary care before reversing an agency determination,whether implicit or explicit,that its initial environmental document retains some relevance to the decisionmaking process.ibid.
the supreme court also explained that our review of an agency decision that the subsequent review provisions apply is only the first step.once a court determines that substantial evidence supports that decision,the next and critical step is to determine whether the agency has properly determined how to comply with its obligations under those provisions.in particular,where,as here,the agency has determined that project changes will not require major revisions to its initial environmental document,such that no subsequent or supplemental eir is required,the reviewing court must then proceed to ask whether substantial evidence supports that determination.san mateo gardens,supra,cal th at.whether there is substantial evidence in this context involves a judicial review that must reflect the exacting standard that an agency must apply when changes are made to a project that has been approved via a negative declaration.ibid.accordingly,the supreme court remanded the case to us for further proceedings.id.at.after the court issued its remittitur,we permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs,which they have done 
discussiona.the general legal framework.
in ceqa,the legislature sought to protect the environment by the establishment of administrative procedures drafted to e nsure that the protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.no oil,city of los angeles cal d.under ceqa,a public agency generally conducts an initial study to determine if a project may have a significant effect on the environment.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.usually,when an agency proposes a project,it must prepare an eir if the project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a.but if the initial study shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment,ceqa requires the agency to prepare a negative declaration.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.i f the project has potentially significant environmental effects but these effects will be reduced to insignificance by mitigation measures that the project proponent has agreed to undertake,ceqa requires the agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration.moss county of humboldt th.
ceqa subsequent review provisions apply when an agency modifies a project after it has certified an eir or has adopted a negative or mitigated negative declaration as we explain in more detail below,these provisions require the agency to prepare a subsequent eir or negative declaration under certain circumstances.ceqa guidelines,subds.a b.they also allow the agency to prepare an addendum,rather than a subsequent eir or negative declaration,if only minor technical changes or additions are necessary or none of the conditions described in ceqa guidelines section calling for the preparation of a subsequent eir or negative declaration have occurred.ceqa guidelines,subd.b.
ceqa subsequent review provisions apply to the project changes.
our first task is to determine whether the building project is subject to ceqa initial review provisions,which do not allow for an addendum,or ceqa subsequent review provisions,which do.san mateo gardens teaches that this determination depends on whether the original environmental document in this case the mnd retains some informational value.san mateo gardens,supra,cal th at.as already stated,this is a predominantly factual question that is for the agency to answer in the first instance,drawing on its particular expertise.id.at.by preparing an addendum to the mnd,the district determined that the mnd retained informational value.our role is to decide whether substantial evidence supports the district determination.see ibid.
we conclude that it does.the plan as described in the mnd called for the demolition of up to buildings on the college campus and the renovation of several others.it also listed several mitigation measures intended to negate the demolition impact,such as reducing construction noise,preventing groundwater contamination,and protecting people from exposure to lead and asbestos.the revised plan as described in the addendum added one building complex to the demolition list building and removed two others buildings and.but the addendum did not affect the plans to demolish the other buildings or remove the measures adopted to mitigate those plans environmental effects.these circumstances constitute substantial evidence that the mnd remained relevant,thus allowing the district to proceed under ceqa subsequent review provisions.
c.the district use of an addendum contravened ceqa subsequent review provisions.
the standard of review that applies to an agency determination that major revisions to a negative declaration are not required.
as we have mentioned,our conclusion that substantial evidence supports the district decision to proceed under ceqa subsequent review provisions is only the first step.san mateo gardens,supra,cal th at.once a court determines that substantial evidence supports an agency decision to proceed under ceqa subsequent review provisions see ceqa guidelines,the next and critical step is to determine whether the agency has properly determined how to comply with its obligations under those provisions.san mateo gardens,at.
under ceqa subsequent review provisions,no subsequent eir shall be prepared for a project unless the lead agency determines,on the basis of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record that s ubstantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous eir or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.ceqa guidelines,subds.a,a.if changes to a project or its circumstances occur or new information becomes available after adoption of a negative declaration,and if no subsequent eir is required,the agency shall determine whether to prepare a subsequent negative declaration,an addendum,or no further documentation.ceqa guidelines,subd.b.an addendum to an adopted negative declaration may be prepared if only minor technical changes or additions are necessary or none of the conditions described in ceqa guidelines section calling for the preparation of a subsequent eir or negative declaration have occurred.ceqa guidelines,subd.b.ceqa guidelines section does not clearly specify when the agency must prepare a subsequent negative declaration instead of issuing an addendum or providing no further documentation.but as we discuss further below,a subsequent mitigated negative declaration is at least appropriate where a subsequent eir would otherwise be required under ceqa guidelines section but the project new significant environmental effects may be avoided through mitigation measures.
the supreme court in san mateo gardens provided guidance for how to apply the subsequent review provisions.it explained that whether major revisions will be required as a result of project changes necessarily depends on the nature of the original environmental document,whether it was an eir or a negative declaration.san mateo gardens,supra,cal th at.it further explained that the appropriate standard of review also depends on the nature of the original environmental document.although an agency determination of whether major revisions are required is reviewed for substantial evidence,judicial review must reflect the exacting standard that an agency must apply when changes are made to a project that has been approved via a negative declaration,as opposed to the deferential standard that applies when the project was originally approved by an eir.id.at see committee for of loop san francisco municipal transportation agency th,applying san mateo gardens in case where project originally approved by eir latinos unidos de napa city of napa th.in the words of the court,a negative declaration is permitted when there is no substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the environment citations,whereas an eir is required when a project and project alternatives may have significant effects citation.when there is a proposal to modify a project originally approved through an eir,no major revision to the initial eir is required if the initial eir already adequately addresses any additional environmental effects that may be caused by the proposed modification.in contrast,when a project is initially approved by negative declaration,a major revision to the initial negative declaration will necessarily be required if the proposed modification may produce a significant environmental effect that had not previously been studied.citation.indeed,if the project modification introduces previously unstudied and potentially significant environmental effects that can not be avoided or mitigated through further revisions to the project plans,then the appropriate environmental document would no longer be a negative declaration at all,but an eir.san mateo gardens,at,some italics added.in sum,an agency must prepare an eir whenever there is substantial evidence that the changes to a project for which a negative declaration was previously ap
