ronell williams plaintiff is a black male who attended lindenwood university before being expelled for disciplinary violations arising out of a party held in student housing.plaintiff appeals from a final order entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri granting summary judgment in favor of lindenwood university on plaintiff claims for breach of contract and racial discrimination.see williams lindenwood university,hereinafter slip op.for reversal,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the university because he raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether his expulsion and denial of readmission was based on his race and he produced evidence that the university proffered explanations for the expulsion and denial of readmission were pretexts for racial discrimination.for the reasons discussed below,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
jurisdiction was proper in the district court pursuant to and.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal pursuant to fed.a a.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
the facts herein are presented in the light most favorable to plaintiff,as the nonmoving party.see.c.
while plaintiff was a student at lindenwood university,he lived with chad moore,who is also black,in a mobile home used by the university for student housing the trailer.lindenwood university students who live in student housing agree to abide by certain rules,including that alcohol is not allowed on campus the alcohol policy,visitation by members of the opposite sex is prohibited the visitation rule,and that students are responsible for the actions of their guests while on campus.
on february,plaintiff,moore,two white female students named kristen bruening and stephanie denbrow together,the students,and three unidentified black males who were not students together,the nonstudents participated in a party in the trailer.there was alcohol at the party in violation of the alcohol policy.denbrow and bruening presence in the trailer was a violation of the visitation rule williams was responsible for the actions of the nonstudents while they were on campus.
denbow testified in her deposition that she initially went to the trailer that night on her own accord to do laundry,and that moore and plaintiff were both present when she arrived.bruening testified in her deposition that she accompanied denbow to the trailer,and that at approximately,both moore and plaintiff announced to them that other guests would be coming over.denbrow and bruening decided to wait in the trailer to socialize with moore,plaintiff,and others who would be arriving later that evening.more than an hour later,the nonstudents arrived at the trailer.bruening testified that there was already alcohol present before the nonstudents arrived.the uncontroverted testimony of the students at the party was that plaintiff did not ever drink any of the alcohol,while moore,denbrow bruening,and the nonstudents did drink it.the students all testified that the nonstudents did not misbehave or act inappropriately during the party or ever cause anyone to feel unsafe.moore testified that he did not see anyone in danger at the party and that no one made any sexual or inappropriate remarks.similarly,bruening testified that she never felt threatened during the party.bruening testified that,at different times,both moore and plaintiff left the party for a little while and returned later.moore testified that when he returned to the party,he turned on the stereo in his room.
at approximately,campus security officer byron steele,who is black,and another campus security officer heard noise from the trailer,determined that its occupants were in violation of lindenwood university quiet hours policy,and approached the trailer to confront them.steele testified in his deposition that when he arrived at the trailer,neither of the women appeared to be in any trouble and no one asked for any help rather,everyone was just partying and running around.steele described the nonstudents appearance as pretty nice.
steele testified that when he and the other campus security officer entered the front of the trailer,he saw moore and bruening trying to run out the back door.breuning admitted that she and moore went out the back door of the trailer when she saw security coming,and that steele had to call her at home at to let her know that he was aware she had been present at the party.moore,too,testified that he left with bruening when the campus security officers arrived,and said that he found out what happened from plaintiff when he returned to the trailer later,after the campus security officers had left.plaintiff testified in his deposition that he was cooperative with the campus security officers,answered all of their questions,and told them who the nonstudents were.steele confirmed that it was plaintiff who spoke with him and that only plaintiff took responsibility for living in the trailer.
at approximately,steele wrote out a behavioral incident report detailing his observations.in the report,steele did not mention that the nonstudents acted belligerently or violently,or that they did anything to make steele feel unsafe.
steele also reported the incident to joseph steenbergen,the lindenwood university dean of students.dean steenbergen claimed that he learned from steele that the nonstudents were members of a gang,that they said that they were going to go through the campus security officers,and that they were criminals with outstanding arrest warrants.dean steenbergen testified that steele seemed pretty scared by the incident,that the nonstudents cursed at steele,that steele thought they were going to fight,and that this was the first time steele had ever told him anything like that.
after speaking with steele,dean steenbergen expelled the students from the university.each of the students appealed their expulsion to the lindenwood university dean of admissions,david williams.dean williams heard all of the appeals and met individually with each of the four students while the university investigated the incident.moore,bruening,and denbrow were readmitted within days.plaintiff was denied readmission ostensibly because he created a dangerous situation by bringing criminals and gang members to campus and because he instigated all of the violations of lindenwood university policy.
throughout lindenwood university investigation of the incident,there arose several instances where university administrators drew conclusions about the incident which were not corroborated by the students,steele,or the behavioral incident report,and university administrators made remarks about plaintiff and the nonstudents which the students interpreted as racially discriminatory.
disputed facts about the incident 
lindenwood university officials said that steele identified the nonstudents as gang members because he saw in the trailer a photograph of them in which they appeared to be throwing gang signs.however,steele testified that he did not know whether the nonstudents were members of a gang or even if they were throwing gang signs in plaintiff photograph only that that was kind of what it looked like.steele also testified that plaintiff was not in the photograph and,when asked whether the nonstudents were the same individuals that were in the photograph,he answered i think maybe one of them.
steele also said that he did not recall plaintiff telling him that the nonstudents had outstanding arrest warrants.dean williams testified in his deposition that he found out about the alleged warrants from plaintiff only after plaintiff had already been expelled.however,plaintiff testified that he did not know one way or the other whether the nonstudents had outstanding arrest warrants and that he did not ever say that they did.moreover,even though plaintiff gave dean steenbergen the names of the nonstudents,none of the university administrators were ever able to verify with law enforcement officials that the nonstudents had outstanding arrest warrants.
another allegation consistently raised by lindenwood university administrators is that the nonstudents physically threatened the campus security officers and that steele was visibly shaken when the nonstudents bragged that they would go through the campus security officers.however,there is no support for this allegation in the record.denbow,who was present throughout the entire exchange,said that she did not see or hear the nonstudents threaten or confront the campus security officers.she added that the nonstudents did not act belligerently to the campus security officers,but were rather quite polite to them,and that steele did not appear to be scared at any point.plaintiff testified that he did not hear the nonstudents ever say that they were going to go through the campus security guards.even steele testified that he did not hear the statement about running through these guys,and assumed that the other campus security officer apparently had heard it

dean williams comments 
bruening testified that she twice met with dean williams about the incident.bruening testified that during the first meeting,dean williams asked her what she was doing hanging around with all those black guys and whether her parents knew that she was hanging around with those black guys.bruening testified that,at the second meeting,dean williams told her she should not have been hanging around with all these black guys.
similarly,denbow testified that during her meetings with dean williams,he told her she could have gotten raped because she did not know plaintiff guests,asked her what her father would think of her hanging around with those black guys,and used the term gang bangers to describe plaintiff and the nonstudents.denbow testified that dean williams otherwise did not ask anything about the party.denbow testified that she got the impression from dean williams that he wanted to make her feel like it was wrong for her be there with black men,and that he did not think she should be hanging out with any black men,as opposed to the particular people at the party.denbow testified further that she believed dean williams would have been less concerned if everything was the same except that the nonstudents were white.denbow testified that dean williams told her somebody was trying to roll a marijuana joint at the party,but that she did not see that occurring 
plaintiff testified that,when he met with dean williams,dean williams took only ten minutes to read his letter of appeal before denying it,and that dean williams told him that he was not smart enough to attend lindenwood university.
president spellman comments 
bruening testified president spellman told her he was concerned about her personality because she was hanging around with those black guys.denbow testified that she got the impression from president spellman that he was saying she was a floozy and a whore because she was hanging out with a bunch of black guys.
dean steenbergen comments 
denbow testified that,on the way to a meeting with dean williams,in the context of explaining to her why the university did not want to readmit plaintiff,dean steenbergen told her that plaintiff previously had been caught selling drugs.
moore testified that dean steenbergen told him that he did not care about the party or the girls,only that plaintiff brothers were present.moore testified that dean steenbergen used the term gang bangers to describe the nonstudents,and that dean steenbergen told him that the nonstudents could just leave that shit in louis.moore testified that,when dean steenbergen came to the trailer to inform him that he had been readmitted to lindenwood university but was on probation,dean steenbergen accused moore and plaintiff of possessing stolen property.dean steenbergen refused to leave the trailer until he had placed numerous phone calls to independently verify that moore and plaintiff had not stolen their appliances and other belongings.
plaintiff testified that he answered every question dean steenbergen asked throughout the investigation,including the identities of the nonstudents and students present at the party.dean steenbergen admits that plaintiff identified the nonstudents,but said that plaintiff cooperation did not change lindenwood university decision to expel and not readmit plaintiff.
on january,plaintiff filed this action against lindenwood university in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri alleging violations of.on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lindenwood university,holding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that lindenwood university was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because plaintiff failed to set forth a prima facie case of racial discrimination.see slip op.at stating that plaintiff offered no evidence of intentional discrimination and no evidence that lindenwood university actions were pretext for discrimination.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment.see scroggins university of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,no genuine issue of material fact exists.see.the moving party bears the burden of proving that the material facts are undisputed.see mems city of paul,cir.t he evidence offered by the party is to be believed and all justifiable inferences therefrom are to be drawn in the light most favorable to that party.raddatz standard register,d.the nonmoving party may not rest upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings rather,the nonmovant must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.id.the drawing of reasonable inferences from the facts is a function reserved for the fact finder.see anderson liberty lobby,d explaining that district court should not weigh evidence or attempt to determine truth of matter on motion for summary judgment.
the purpose of is to prohibit discrimination in the performance,modification and termination of contracts and to protect the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms and conditions of the contractual relationship.b.because plaintiff discrimination claim is based on inferences to be drawn from circumstantial evidence,it is governed by the familiar analysis.carter louis,cir carter.to establish a prima facie claim of racial discrimination under,the plaintiff must show that he is a member of a racial minority,the defendant intended to discriminate against him on the basis of race,and the discrimination concerned an area enumerated by the statute.see mian donaldson,lufkin jenrette securities,cir.once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of racial discrimination,the burden shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions to rebut the presumption of discrimination.see carter,at.then,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant proffered reason was a pretext for unlawful discrimination.see id.the ultimate question of law is whether the evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff,citing rothmeier investment advisers,cir.we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the evidence is sufficient to create genuine issues of material fact with respect to plaintiff prima facie case and the issue of pretext.
prima facie case 
first element of prima facie case 
the first element of the prima facie claim of racial discrimination undisputably is met because plaintiff,a black male,is a member of a racial minority.
second element of prima facie case 
plaintiff alleged that lindenwood university intentionally expelled him and then refused to readmit him because of his race.in support of this allegation,plaintiff offered several specific examples of lindenwood university officials emphasizing the race of plaintiff and the nonstudents and showing a discriminatory attitude about that race in the context of the investigation that led to the university decisions to expel and not readmit plaintiff.see browning president riverboat,cir explaining that
