barbara casey,a longtime new mexico public servant,seeks damages from the west las vegas independent school district and various of its officials,alleging that they demoted and eventually fired her in retaliation for exercising her first amendment rights.having moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment in the district court,defendants appeal to us.while this case awaited oral argument,the supreme court issued garcetti ceballos,d,which profoundly alters how courts review first amendment retaliation claims.casey now concedes that a portion of one claim is barred by garcetti.we agree and find certain other portions also precluded by the supreme court recent ruling.still,we find that at least one aspect of one of casey claims survives to trial.
a former new mexico state legislator and school teacher,casey served as superintendent of the west las vegas independent school district district from january until april.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to her as the party opposing summary judgment,she fairly establishes the following 
upon becoming superintendent,casey assumed responsibility for serving as the chief executive officer ceo of the district head start program,a federally funded initiative aimed at providing educational opportunities,meals,and health care services to children between three and five years of age.the district head start program traditionally received approximately million annually from the federal government,but prior to the school year,federal authorities determined that the district head start program had major deficiencies and threatened to suspend its funding.appellants app.at.
to help address these problems,in june,the district hired jacqueline padilla at casey recommendation to manage the head start program.padilla became the district head start director,reported to casey,and made a number of changes aimed at bringing the district program into compliance with federal regulations and ensuring its continued funding.id.at.by the winter of,a federal oversight agency determined that the district program had indeed achieved substantial compliance with federal mandates.id.
sometime during the period december,padilla informed casey that her staff had begun to uncover evidence that as many as of the families enrolled in the district head start program appeared to have incomes that were too high for them to qualify for participation.casey learned that some families had intentionally omitted family income information or inflated the size of their family in order to enroll their children in the program.worried that these problems threatened the district progress and risked its future funding,casey reported them to walter adams,the west las vegas school board board president and one of the defendants before us.adams allegedly responded that casey should not worry about the issue.several more times between january and april,casey raised the issue with adams and,in executive sessions of the board,the other individual defendants.each time,she was told variously not to worry about it,to leave it alone,or not to go there.see id.at.
casey became concerned that,given the board inaction,she had a duty as head start executive director to report this wrong doing sic to federal authorities.see appellees br.at,see also appellants app.at.casey thus instructed her subordinate,padilla,to approach the federal head start regional office in dallas and relay her findings.this padilla did.eventually,on august,the united states department of health human services hhs determined that certain enrollments in the district head start program were indeed improper and ordered the repayment of more than half a million dollars in federal aid.
during the school year,casey also informed the board that it was violating the new mexico open meetings act by making personnel and other decisions in executive session without proper notice and meeting agendas.because defendants apparently ignored her warnings,on approximately march,casey filed a written complaint with the new mexico attorney general office.on march,the attorney general office wrote to adams outlining the particulars of casey complaint,enclosing a copy of the complaint,and requesting a response.after receiving the board response and completing its review of the matter,the attorney general office determined that the board had in fact violated the open meetings act and ordered corrective action.
finally,casey brought to the board attention a number of other issues during the school year regarding the district operations that,she believed,violated federal or state laws.these included,by way of example,an allegation that the district hired employees without advertising vacancies or conducting a review process,and that it improperly handled a case where a teacher and school principal were carrying on an affair.
on april,the board demoted casey to assistant superintendent.while there is some lack of clarity regarding exactly when the school board further decided not to renew casey contract for the school year,the facts before us suggest that this may have occurred as early as april or as late as may.see appellants app.at i was demoted by defendants to the position of associate superintendent on april.on may,defendants voted not to renew my contract of employment for any position in the school district.id.at minutes,regular board meeting,april,board unanimously voted not to renew the employment contract with barbara casey as superintendent and to immediately reassign casey from her present position to the position of assistant superintendent through the remainder of the fiscal year id.at letter from superintendent arturo gurule to casey i regret to inform you that on sic the may,west las vegas school district board meeting,you r employment contract for the school year was not renewed.
following her termination,casey filed an action against the district,the new superintendent,and individual members of the board alleging,inter alia,that she was dismissed in retaliation for exercising her first amendment rights.the defendants unsuccessfully sought summary judgment in the district court with respect to casey first amendment claims based on qualified immunity and now pursue this appeal raising the same defense immediately prior to appellants submission of their reply brief,the supreme court handed down garcetti and,accordingly,we sought and received supplemental briefing from the parties to help us in assessing the impact of the supreme court new guidance.
we review the district court denial of summary judgment de novo.see medina cram,cir.when a defendant asserts qualified immunity at summary judgment,the responsibility shifts to the plaintiff to meet a heavy burden,id.internal quotation marks omitted,demonstrating,first,that the defendant actions violated a constitutional or statutory right and,second,that the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct.in assessing whether the right was clearly established,we ask whether the right was sufficiently clear that a reasonable government officer in the defendant shoes would understand that what he or she did violated that right.if the plaintiff fails to satisfy either part of the inquiry,we must grant the defendant qualified immunity.
in analyzing a public employee first amendment retaliation claim,the supreme court has instructed that we must first decide whether the speech at issue touches on a matter of public concern and,if so,we must then proceed to ask whether the employee interest in commenting on the issue outweighs the interest of the state as employer.see dill city of edmond,cir citing pickering bd.of,d and connick myers,d.the problem in any case,the supreme court observed,is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the employee,as citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering,at.how exactly we are to weigh and balance the radically incommensurate interests at stake in pickering second prong is a matter of great debate and little certainty 
the supreme court last term in garcetti did revisit pickering first prong,however,and added some clarity to the question when a public employee speaks as a citizen rather than as an employee.specifically,the court held that when public employees speak pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.garcetti.at.the rationale for this rule is that r estricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.it simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.id the question for us on pickering first prong is thus significantly modified and we are obliged to ask whether casey met her burden by providing evidence that her expressions were made in her capacity as a citizen and not pursuant to her official duties.
in this case,we are presented with three specific sets of communications that casey cites as the bases for her first amendment retaliation claims,those regarding i the head start program,ii the new mexico open meetings act,and iii miscellaneous other violations of state or federal law,hiring employees without advertising vacancies or conducting a review process,and improperly handling claims of misconduct by teachers and principals.
miscellaneous violations.in her brief addressing the impact of garcetti,casey thoughtfully concedes that any action based on this category of statements is now barred as a matter of law.as casey puts it,these statements fell within the scope of her duties as superintendent because they were aimed solely to the school board to which she reported and her job admittedly included advis ing defendants about the lawful and proper way to conduct school business.see appellees brief at.we agree with casey and hold these statements no longer actionable after garcetti for both of the reasons she articulates.
head start.casey statements with respect to the head start program themselves are of two types.the first,and the bulk of her comments,involve statements directed to the school board conveying concern about the district lack of compliance with federal regulations.in our view,these statements do not form the basis for a colorable first amendment retaliation claim after garcetti for reasons casey has already identified.that is,these comments were directed only to her supervisors and,in each instance,casey sought to raise concerns about the legality of the district operations.as before,because advising her employer on the lawful and proper way to conduct school business was admittedly part of her portfolio,we can not help but conclude that casey made these statements pursuant to her official duties.see garcetti.at see also mills city of evansville,cir holding that an employee internal discussions advising superiors about the employing institution policies are barred as a basis for a first amendment retaliation claim by garcetti.
one remaining statement about the head start program that might give rise to a cause of action concerns casey instruction to padilla that the latter should contact federal authorities and convey their mutual concerns about the legality of the district head start operations.here,casey did not advise her employers but instead went very much around them.the question before us is whether,in doing so,casey used padilla as her agent to engage in protected citizen whistleblowing,or whether casey acted pursuant to her official duties in ordering a subordinate to report the district regulatory noncompliance to federal authorities.
interestingly,the parties before us both made arguments in their principal briefs filed before garcetti that cut against the result they wish this court to reach after garcetti.in their principal brief before garcetti,the defendants argued that casey acted ultra vires and in a disruptive manner by reporting the alleged head start violations to the federal office for her part,casey argued in her principal brief that she became concerned that she had a duty as head start executive director to report this wrong doing sic to federal authorities.appellees br.at,emphasis added.after garcetti,the parties seemed to swap positions to meet their respective litigation objectives.in their reply brief filed after garcetti,defendants point to the ostensibly undisputed fact that casey alleged speech was engaged in as superintendent or ceo of the head start program,not as a citizen.appellants reply br.at.casey,meanwhile,now asserts that in reporting the head start violations she was acting solely in her capacity as a citizen,not as an employee.see appellees br.at.
the parties,of course,can hardly be blamed for shifting positions in their briefs in response to new pronouncements of law.but the underlying discovery facts can not be so altered and they seem clear enough to us to establish that casey was acting pursuant to her official duties.black defines the relevant term as meaning i n compliance with in accordance with.black law dictionary ed.and it is undisputed that casey was designated by the board as the ceo and person primarily responsible for the sound administration of the district head start program.in accepting this assignment,casey necessarily assumed certain responsibilities,pleasant and unpleasant,and these included acting pursuant to,or in compliance with,certain federal regulations.rules issued by hhs expressly state that families with children enrolled by head start grantees must meet specific income eligibility requirements.see.the regulations also indicate that a grantee failure to comply with such eligibility requirements may result in a denial of refunding or termination.id.at.further,at the time these events took place,individuals,like casey,with knowledge of financial irregularities risked civil and criminal liability by remaining silent in the face of such knowledge in deposition,casey effectively acknowledged these facts,conceding that her responsibilities as executive director included a duty to report the district noncompliance to federal authorities because she would be held legally responsible for having knowledge of something that was wrong and not reporting that.appellants app.at.
buttressing the conclusion that casey acted in accordance with,if not compelled by,her office,she also stated in sworn testimony that her order to padilla was aimed at fix ing the problem before it got worse.id.at.that is,casey merely wanted to get direction from somebody and find out what to do in reporting the district irregularities.id.at.none of this suggests ultra vires conduct but rather an individual striving diligently to fulfill a federal regulatory obligation directly bearing on her by virtue of the office she held.it is also notable that casey acted not on her own in this matter,but thought it sufficiently a part of her job duties to report the district financial irregularities to hhs that she deemed it appropriate to order a subordinate,padilla,to contact head start officials nor did the latter blanch at casey direction or give any other intimation that she thought she or casey might be acting beyond the scope of their employment.
while we feel obliged after garcetti to conclude that casey actions were taken pursuant to her official position,we do not mean to suggest that every agent who disregards a principal instructions not to disclose information is barred from suit by garcetti.to the contrary,we are confronted in this case with a rather narrower and subtler set of facts in which the plaintiff job,as the chief overseer of head start for the district,included the sound administration of federal funds federal law directed the disclosure of any irregularities in the use of such funds the plaintiff conceded that her job duties required her to report to federal authorities and she acted in a manner consistent with this admission.see mcgee public water supply,cir the court rejected argument that he acted outside the scope of his job duties by voicing concerns abo
