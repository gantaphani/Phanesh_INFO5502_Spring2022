plaintiff and appellant the committee for responsible school expansion appeals from a judgment entered following the denial of its petition for writ of mandate seeking to enjoin defendant and respondent the hermosa beach city school district the school district from expending school bond money to construct a gymnasium.appellant contends that the california constitution prohibits the expenditure because construction of a gymnasium was not among the list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded in the bond ballot measure approved by the voters.see cal,art.xiiia,subd.b b.
we find no merit to this contention.the school district satisfied the constitution accountability requirements by preparing and making available the required list of projects,which included a gymnasium.neither the state constitution nor the education code requires that the list of specific school facilities projects to be funded through a bond measure be included on the ballot.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on july,the school district board of trustees approved a resolution ordering an election on the question of whether million in school district bonds should be issued the resolution.the resolution stated that the election would be subject to the provisions of proposition.two exhibits were attached to the resolution.exhibit a contained the text of the ballot measure that would be submitted to the voters,which provided to improve the quality of education,shall the hermosa beach city school district be authorized to finance classroom modernization upgrade electrical systems to improve access to technology make health,safety,and security improvements upgrade plumbing,heating,ventilation,and air conditioning systems construct classrooms and science labs acquire property,and qualify for state funds up to by issuing in bonds,within maximum legal interest rates,with annual audits,a citizens oversight committee and no money for administrators salaries exhibit b,entitled full text ballot proposition,first indicated that the text of exhibit a would be presented to the voters it then outlined the needs that the school district board of trustees had evaluated and specified a list of school and classroom improvements on which bond funds would be spent.included on the list was c onstruct a gymnasium for school and community use.
in accordance with the resolution,measure j,entitled hermosa beach city school district special election,appeared on the november,ballot the text of measure j was identical to exhibit a of the resolution.the text of exhibit b did not appear on the ballot.within the ballot,county counsel impartial analysis of measure j provided in part as required by law,the board of trustees of the district has adopted a list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded by the sale of the bonds.the board of trustees will conduct annual,independent financial and performance audits to ensure that funds received from the sale of the bonds will have been expended only on the specific projects listed,and will appoint a citizen oversight committee to inform the public on expenditures.ballot arguments both in favor of and in opposition to measure j discussed that the bonds would be used to build a gymnasium.the argument in favor of measure j stated that the measure would improve hermosa beach schools by b uilding a new facility for school and community use,while the argument against the measure several times criticized the use of bond funds for a costly gym.
measure j passed,garnering percent of the vote.for the next two years,the school district and the community developed a plan for the expenditure of the measure j funds.the resulting project included the construction of a gymnasium,multipurpose facilities,science laboratories,classrooms,a library and storage areas at the hermosa valley school.in march,the school district certified an environmental impact report eir for the project.
on april,appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the legality of the school district approval of the plan for development of the gymnasium and seeking a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the school district to set aside and vacate any project approvals.its first amended petition,filed two weeks later,added a cause of action alleging that t he school board march,authorization of the expenditure of measure j funds on a gymnasium project that was not disclosed to voters on the ballot violates the requirements of the california constitution and the strict accountability in local school construction bonds act of.
in august,the trial court denied appellant request for a preliminary injunction.in concluding that appellant was unlikely to succeed on the merits,the trial court found that measure j was in compliance with the california constitution,as there was no requirement that the list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded must appear in the ballot.see cal,art.xiiia,subd.b b.the trial court reasoned that the fact a list of projects was prepared and available to voters,coupled with the repeated references to a gymnasium in the ballot arguments,adequately satisfied the constitution accountability requirements.
following briefing in october,the trial court denied appellant petition for writ of mandate in november it did not revisit the issue of whether measure j violated the california constitution,finding that it had already sufficiently addressed that issue in connection with the denial of the preliminary injunction.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellant challenges the judgment,asserting that the trial court erred in finding that measure j satisfied the constitutional requirement that a school bond proposition include a list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded cal,art.xiiia,subd.b b.we find no error.
in reviewing a trial court judgment on a petition for writ of ordinary mandate,the appellate court applies the substantial evidence test to the trial court factual findings,but exercises its independent judgment on legal issues,such as the interpretation of statutes.citation.abbate county of santa clara th,d.thus,to the extent that the trial court decision does not turn on disputed facts,we review de novo the trial court interpretation of the constitutional provisions at issue.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d,san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d san lorenzo.our independent reading of the california constitution yields the same conclusion as the trial court nothing mandates that the accountability requirements set forth in article xiiia,section,subdivision b,including a list of specific school facilities projects,be made a part of the ballot.see also,specifying bond measure ballot requirements.the inclusion of the project list in the resolution,coupled with a discussion of that list in the ballot pamphlet,more than satisfied the constitutional provisions.
applicable constitutional and statutory provisions governing school bond financing.
the usual method of funding new school construction in california has been for school districts to obtain voter approval for the issuance of general obligation bonds the bonds are repaid by an annual levy of an ad valorem tax on real and certain personal property located within the area of the district.citation.san lorenzo,supra,th at,d.school bond financing is governed by various provisions of constitutional and some statutory.ibid.
proposition,also known as the smaller classes,safer schools,and financial accountability act,amended the california constitution in november to create an exception to the one percent limit on ad valorem taxes on real property and to reduce from two thirds to percent the number of voters required to approve any bonded indebtedness proposed to be incurred by a school district for the construction,reconstruction,rehabilitation,or replacement of school facilities,as approved by voters,cal,art.xiiia,subd.b see also ridgecrest charter school sierra sands unified school dist.th,d.
because the resolution of this matter hinges in large part on the language of the relevant constitutional provision,we quote it at length.california constitution article xiiia,section,subdivision b provides that the one percent limitation on any ad valorem tax on real property shall not apply to ad valorem taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on any of the following bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district,community college district,or county office of education for the construction,reconstruction,rehabilitation,or replacement of school facilities,including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities,or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities,approved by percent of the voters of the district or county,as appropriate,voting on the proposition on or after the effective date of the measure adding this paragraph.this paragraph shall apply only if the proposition approved by the voters and resulting in the bonded indebtedness includes all of the following accountability requirements a a requirement that the proceeds from the sale of the bonds be used only for the purposes specified in article xiiia,section b,and not for any other purpose,including teacher and administrator salaries and other school operating expenses.b a list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded and certification that the school district board,community college board,or county office of education has evaluated safety,class size reduction,and information technology needs in developing that list.c a requirement that the school district board,community college board,or county office of education conduct an annual,independent performance audit to ensure that the funds have been expended only on the specific projects listed.d a requirement that the school district board,community college board,or county office of education conduct an annual,independent financial audit of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds until all of those proceeds have been expended for the school facilities projects.italics added.
legislation implementing proposition is codified in sections through of the education code.san lorenzo,supra,th at,fn,d.pertinent here,education code section provides in addition to the ballot requirements of section for bond measures pursuant to this chapter,the ballot shall also be printed with a statement that the board will appoint a citizens oversight committee and conduct annual independent audits to assure that funds are spent only on school and classroom improvements and for no other purposes.education code section,which remained unchanged after the enactment of proposition,specifies the form of the ballot for a bond election the words to appear upon the ballots shall be and,or words of similar import.a brief statement of the proposition,setting forth the amount of the bonds to be voted upon,the maximum rate of interest,and the purposes for which the proceeds of the sale of the bonds are to be used,shall be printed upon the ballot.no defect in the statement other than in the statement of the amount of the bonds to be authorized shall invalidate the bonds election.
appellant brought this action pursuant to education code section,which authorizes a n action to obtain an order restraining and preventing any expenditure of funds received by a school district through the sale of bonds authorized by this chapter pursuant to paragraph of subdivision b of section of article xiiia of the california constitution where it appears that the expenditure is in violation of or for purposes other than those specified by the california constitution,article xiiia,section,subdivision b,subd.a.
ii.the school district measure j satisfied the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.
because measure j passed by less than a majority,the requirements imposed by proposition apply.cal,art.xiiia,subd.b san lorenzo,supra,th at,fn,d ridgecrest charter school sierra sands unified school,supra,th at,d.according to appellant,those requirements mandate that the list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded be included on the ballot.cal,art.xiiia,subd.b b.as it is undisputed that measure j did not include that omitted the construction of a gymnasium among the projects asserts that the school district should be enjoined from expending any funds raised by measure j on a gymnasium.see.we disagree.
to interpret both constitutional and statutory provisions,we first look to their plain language.delaney superior court cal d,penner county of santa barbara th,d.words used in a statute or constitutional provision should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.citation.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute or of the voters in the case of a provision adopted by the voters.lungren deukmejian cal d.
according to the plain language of article xiiia,section,subdivision b of the california constitution,a school district bond indebtedness for certain school facilities projects may be approved by only percent of the voters if the proposition approved by the voters and resulting in the bond indebtedness includes a set of four enumerated accountability requirements.cal,art.xiiia,subd.b.those requirements are that the proceeds from the sale of the bonds be used only for the purposes specified in that section and not for any other purpose,such as salaries or operating expenses a list of the specific school facilities to be funded and the school district certification that it has evaluated certain factors in developing that list that the school district board conduct an annual,independent performance audit to ensure that the funds have been expended only on the specific projects listed and that school district board conduct an annual,independent financial audit of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds until all proceeds have been expended.cal,art.xiiia,subd.b a d.
the constitution is to be interpreted by the language in which it is written,and courts are no more at liberty to add provisions to what is therein declared in definite language than they are to disregard any of its express provisions.citations.delaney superior court,supra,cal d at.the constitution plainly requires that the proposition,not the ballot,include these accountability requirements.section of article xiii makes no mention of either the term ballot or measure.there is a distinct difference between a proposition and a ballot measure.the election code imposes a limitation on ballot measures,subd.a the statement of all measures submitted to the voters shall be abbreviated on the ballot.the statement shall contain not more than words of each measure to be voted on,followed by the words,yes and no.in view of this limitation,it would be virtually impossible for a school district to set forth its compliance with all accountability requirements in a ballot measure.
even more importantly,legislation enacted in connection with the passage of proposition cited by neither that the list of specific school facilities to be funded need not appear on the ballot.education code section became operative when the voters approved proposition.stats,ch,assem.bill.unofficially labeled additional ballot requirement,it provides in addition to the ballot requirements of section and the ballot provisions of this code applicable to governing board member elections,for bond measures pursuant to this chapter,the ballot shall also be printed with a statement that the board will appoint a citizens oversight committee and conduct annual independent audits to assure that funds are spent only on school and classroom improvements and for no other purposes.in pertinent part,education code section requires that a brief statement of the proposition,setting forth the amount of the bonds to be voted upon,the maximum rate of interest,and the purposes for which the proceeds of the sale of the bonds are to be used,shall be printed upon the ballot.see also,same requirements for a ballot proposition.none of these provisions states that either the list of specific school facilities projects or the s
