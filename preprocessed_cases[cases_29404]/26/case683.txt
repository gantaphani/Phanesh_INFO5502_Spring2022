in this case we review the denial of a claim for attorneys fees under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.the district court denied the claim because although linda and gene,parents of william,prevailed in part in a state administrative agency hearing challenging certain aspects of william educational program,their success on the merits was de minimis.we affirm.
background 
william is an autistic child who attends the rice lake area school district the district in barron county,wisconsin.from age three to six he attended the district early childhood program located in red cedar hall,a facility that offers a,prevocational curriculum to disabled students.william attended kindergarten at tainter elementary school,and for the first grade he was placed at red cedar hall and at tainter elementary.from the second through the fifth grades,william attended tainter elementary.
william intellectual and social development are significantly delayed.according to the district,in august,when william was twelve years old and preparing to enter sixth grade,his reading and math skills were between the to grade level.the district determined that william expressive language and communication abilities were approximately at the level of a to,and that in terms of daily living skills such as personal hygiene,dressing,and eating,he functioned at the age of a child.william is cheerful and compliant but seldom initiates verbal exchanges and takes cues from peers inconsistently.william was sometimes disruptive in class and was removed from his regular classroom on some occasions.
on april,the district convened an individualized education program iep meeting to determine william continuing eligibility for special education,develop an iep,and determine his placement for the school year.william parents participated in the iep team meeting.the parents and the district had come to very different views about the appropriate placement for william.the district believed that william would receive little or no educational benefit from being placed at rice lake middle school because the regular curriculum is too complex and for him.although the special education teachers at the middle school acknowledged that william could work on some of his objectives and goals within a regular classroom,they pointed out that none of william own objectives and goals are part of the regular curriculum.
the iep that was developed for william offered placement at red cedar hall and at the middle school.the description of the special education program in the iep is the same for both locations and indicates that william will receive an individually designed program for autism serviced through the cognitive disabilities program.under the iep,william will receive special education of the time and will participate with nondisabled peers whenever appropriate.the iep also provides that autism training will be offered for the staff that work with william,including participation in autism workshops and training,the amount and frequency of which were to be determined as opportunities arise and are deemed appropriate.
william parents were dissatisfied with the iep and requested a due process hearing before the wisconsin division of hearings and appeals.they challenged the iep on three grounds.first,they argued that william placement at red cedar hall denied him the right to receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment as guaranteed by the mainstreaming provision contained in a a.linda rice lake area sch,d.william parents sought an order placing william at the middle school.second,the parents contended that william iep did not contain sufficient particulars about the instructional training services to be provided to the staff.the parents asserted that rather than simply state that such services be provided as needed,the iep should specify the amount and frequency of instructional training services that would be provided.third,the parents requested that the district retain an independent consultant to train staff on how to implement william iep.id.
after a hearing and the filing of posthearing briefs,the administrative law judge alj issued a decision on the merits of the parents claim.that decision is the focus of this attorneys fees dispute.the alj concluded that william would not receive a satisfactory education in the regular education classroom setting at the middle school during the morning because the regular education class is substantively unrelated to the goals and objectives of his iep.id.at.accordingly,the alj held that placing william at red cedar hall for half of the school day was acceptable.id.the alj also concluded,however,that the iep did not identify with sufficient particularity the available and appropriate opportunities for william to interact with nondisabled peers during his half days at the middle school,instead stating only that he would participate with nondisabled peers whenever appropriate.id.at.the alj found this lack of specificity to be inconsistent with the mainstreaming standard and ordered the iep team to reconvene to determine what mainstreaming opportunities are appropriate for william and to revise the iep and placement offer to include such opportunities to the maximum extent appropriate.id.at.
with respect to the staff training issue,the alj also found the language in william iep too vague and directed the iep team to revise the iep so that it clearly states the amount and frequency of autism training that will be provided to the staff who work with william.id.finally,the alj rejected the parents request that the district be ordered to hire an independent consultant to train william teachers.id.
william parents then filed the present action in the district court seeking attorneys fees pursuant to i b as the prevailing party in the agency proceeding.the parties did not contest the conclusions reached by the alj.the only issues before the court were whether william parents prevailed in the legal sense in the agency proceeding,and if so,what amount,if any,would constitute a reasonable fee award.id.at.
the district court held that although the parents did not prevail on the issues of william placement and the retention of an independent consultant,they were entitled to prevailing party status to the extent that the alj ordered the iep revised to provide greater specificity regarding staff training.id.at.but the court held that the plaintiffs success before the alj was de minimis because the issue of greater specificity in the iep was merely a secondary concern and the alj decision did not require the district to provide william with any new or additional services.id.at.the court thus declined to award attorneys fees,citing farrar hobby,d,which holds that a plaintiff who formally but only nominally prevails may be denied recovery of attorneys fees.william parents appealed.
ii.discussion 
the idea contains a provision that permits an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party in any action or proceeding brought under this section,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party,i b.idea provision allows an award of reasonable attorneys fees to the party who prevails in an administrative proceeding as well as an action in court.lagrange sch.dist.the parties do not disagree about the district court determination that the parents prevailed at the due process hearing on the issue of greater specificity in william iep regarding teacher training.the only dispute on appeal is whether,having determined that the parents had prevailing party status,the district court erred in denying them attorneys fees because their success on the merits was de minimis.
a party prevails for purposes of federal statutes when he or she obtains actual relief on the merits of a claim that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.farrar,at.however,the supreme court in farrar held that i n some circumstances,even a plaintiff who formally pr
