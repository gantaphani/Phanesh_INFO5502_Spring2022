after wanda ashman spent years as a limited term employee lte at the university of wisconsin in madison,she convinced her superiors that her job should be made permanent and should include the benefits which go with permanent employment.a hiring process was put in place,apparently with the intent that ashman be hired as a permanent employee.the process broke down,however,because at about the same time that a job was being created for her,ashman took her fight for better conditions for ltes to the chancellor of the university and to a local newspaper.the result was that someone else got the newly created,job.ashman sued under,contending that the defendants retaliated against her for speaking out about the issue of the university treatment of ltes,in violation of her first amendment rights.the defendants moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion.today we resolve ashman appeal of that decision.
ashman employment with the college of agriculture and life sciences cals at the university began in.in,she began working with a computer program called the degree automated reporting system dars.she was also responsible for maintaining the department web site.it was in september that ashman talked with her richard barrows,the associate dean of the cals,and janine jensen,the student services coordinator of the department of academic student affairs for that her job was undervalued and undercompensated.she had not received a raise in her hourly wage for over years,and she was an lte for years.barrows and jensen agreed to convert her position to a permanent position.to comply with hiring procedures,they had to develop a job description and post the position for contractual transfers.ashman gave them a copy of her resum√©,a description of the essential responsibilities of her job,and a list of qualifications or skills needed in the job.she estimated that percent of her time was with the degree reporting system and percent with webmaster duties.
apparently,the whole point of the recruitment process was to create a permanent position which would reflect ashman job duties and then to give her the job.she acknowledges that this purpose may have been a questionable practice under the state civil service rules,but,she says,we should not hold that against her.ashman position was reclassified to information services is resources technician and posted on april.
at about this time,the plan to give ashman the job started to unravel.on april,ashman met with chancellor john wiley and members of the student and labor action coalition to discuss the plight of ltes at the university and possible legislation to eliminate the oxymoron of,limited term positions and to make the positions permanent.ashman discussed her view that the university misused ltes in general.
the next day,ashman told barrows and jensen about the meeting with chancellor wiley.she told them that even though her position was going to be made permanent,she wanted to help other ltes.she also told them that it was possible that there would be an article in isthmus,a local newspaper,about the topics covered in the meeting she warned barrows and jensen that she was not sure whether the article would be factual or inflammatory.also,in may,ashman met with members of the coalition and wisconsin state representative jean hundertmark regarding the university use of ltes.
on june,the isthmus article was published.it stated,wanda ashman is fed up.for nearly nine years she has been employed in training as a computer code writer for the college of agriculture and that the uw was being dishonest and irresponsible by not classifying her and others like her as permanent employees.the article pointed out that ltes do not receive benefits such as health care,paid vacation or sick days,and retirement savings.
after the article was published,jensen told one of ashman coworkers,sue gisler,that barrows was really furious and angry about the article,a fact gisler also observed for herself.gisler heard barrows complain at staff meetings that ashman had made the college look bad.another of ashman coworkers,sue brusveen,also heard barrows say he was not happy about the story in isthmus.both gisler and brusveen said that barrows treated ashman differently after she called attention to the lte issue.both women concluded that ashman did not get the position as is resources technician because of her complaints.
on june,barrows and jensen cancelled recruitment for the position.the reason they gave for their action was that they were going to adopt a proposal from the department of information technology doit for a data base web site.this,they said,would require revamping the position.ashman,however,contends that the change would make little difference in job duties because doit would set up the data base and the technician would have little to do but update it.barrows and jensen also changed the job description the percentages of time spent on the duties of the job were in a way which did not make sense to ashman.ashman informed barrows of her concerns about the new job description.nevertheless,the revised job description was forwarded to human resources to be used as a basis for developing an examination for the position.
in july,barrows sent a memo to the human resource office asking that both he and jensen be removed from the hiring process for the is resources technician position.there is evidence,however,that jensen did not withdraw from the hiring process but participated in the development of the examination.the degree of her participation is disputed.ultimately,the examination was prepared and consisted simply of an objective inventory questionnaire,in which applicants were asked whether they possessed certain kinds of knowledge,skills,and experience.ashman ranked out of persons taking the exam and was not among the top candidates,who were invited to interview for the position.it is ashman view that the exam did not reflect the duties of the job she had been performing for years.
nevertheless,ashman employment was terminated and another woman was hired who had no experience with the dars system,which continued to be part of the job.the new hire was required to attend special training courses to learn the program.
ashman claim that she was retaliated against in violation of her rights under the first amendment requires first a finding that her speech was constitutionally protected.to be protected,an employee speech must be that of a citizen on a matter of public concern.connick myers,d pickering bd.of educ.of twp.high sch.dist,d.it is uncontested in this case that ashman alleged misuse of ltes by the a matter of public concern.
the next step requires that ashman show that her speech was a motivating factor,that it played a substantial part in her rejection and termination.spiegla hull,cir.if she succeeds,the employer can still prevail if it can show either that its interest in efficiently providing services outweighs the employee rights or that it would have taken the adverse employment action even in the absence of the protected speech.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d gustafson jones,cir.the questions before us involve only whether ashman speech played a substantial part in the employment decision and,if so,whether the university would have taken the same actions without the speech.the fundamental issue,however,is whether,on the facts of this case,these questions can be resolved on summary judgment.
we review summary judgment decisions de novo.to prevail on her appeal,ashman must convince us that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to each question.mcgreal ostrov,cir.we construe all facts in the light most favorable to ashman,the party opposing summary judgment,and we draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.id.we are particularly leery of resolving issues involving a state of mind on summary judgment.alexander wisconsin of health family,cir.in fact,in mcgreal,at,we quoted pfizer,international rectifier,cir,which stated that s ummary judgment is notoriously inappropriate for determination of claims in which issues of intent,good faith and other subjective feelings play dominant
