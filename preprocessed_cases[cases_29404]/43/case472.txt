background 
on april,the decedent clara jenkins jenkins,was reported missing by her family members.visinaiz,her friend,had informed her family members that he was concerned about her as he had not seen her or spoken with her since april,in his home.vii tr.at.visinaiz asked his neighbor nephi,jenkins relative,to contact jenkins other relatives,and they filed a missing person report.
two officers from the bureau of indian affairs bia,officer mountain lion and officer,arrived at visinaiz residence that same day.visinaiz told the officers that he and jenkins had been drinking hard alcohol and beer since early on in the day of april.visinaiz told the officers that he had last seen her around the following morning,at which time she had left his residence as a result of an argument over money.vi tr.at.the officers were told that jenkins had taken a red blanket with her and walked to one of visinaiz neighbors homes.
later on the evening of april,visinaiz was visited by two other law enforcement agents.he told them that he had fought with jenkins that night because he would not allow her to drive her vehicle while under the influence.see v tr.at.one of these officers,federal bureau of investigation fbi special agent wright,found a note on jenkins fence post written by visinaiz,suggesting that jenkins had left his house of her own accord.the following day,agents and officers searched the area to the southeast of visinaiz property,recovering a blue air mattress,a faded carpet,and a black plastic tarp below some logs.v tr.at.blood was recovered from each item,which was later determined to belong to jenkins,and hair strands were found inside the air mattress,which were later determined to belong to visinaiz.v tr.at vi tr.at.
on april,a search warrant was executed at visinaiz home blood and tissue were found on the wall and floor.vi tr.at.after dna analysis,these materials were determined to belong to jenkins.id.at.on may,jenkins body was discovered in the white river near visinaiz home,weighted down by cinder blocks tied together at jenkins hands and ankles.vi tr.at.after an autopsy,the medical examiner determined that jenkins died from at least four blunt force traumas to the head,causing three skull fractures.id.at.jenkins was approximately years old,had two surgically repaired knees,was approximately feet tall and weighed around pounds,and often used a walker.see vi tr.at.
visinaiz filed a stipulation of facts before trial in the form of two affidavits,the second affidavit and stipulation amended the first in a material way.xi exs.in the first,filed november,visinaiz stated that after an afternoon and evening of drinking in his home,he and jenkins began to argue,whereupon she threw an empty ounce bottle of beer at him,striking him in the head.upon being struck,visinaiz stated that he became momentarily dazed,and threw a log from the nearby wood burning stove at a lamp directly behind jenkins,in an attempt to scare her.according to the first stipulation and affidavit,though,the log accidentally struck jenkins in the head,and she fell to the floor,where she struck her head again and died.in the second stipulation and affidavit,filed july,visinaiz stated that after being struck by the empty ounce bottle,he saw jenkins cock her arm as if to throw a ounce glass at him,and he approached her and repeatedly struck her head with a log.she thereafter fell to the floor,apparently dead.
visinaiz testified that he became afraid and upset,and started worrying about reprisal from the decedent family because he had with the decedent relatives and based on his life experience,reservations could be fairly dangerous places.vii tr.at.he stored the dead body of his former friend in a crawl space underneath his home.he then attempted to clean the house,in order to remove evidence.he awoke the next morning,saturday,and penned the note to jenkins,placed it on the fence post,where it was later discovered by agent wright.after awaking on sunday,with the dead body still in his crawl space,visinaiz wrapped jenkins body in the air mattress and tarp,attached the cement blocks to her wrists and ankles,placed her in her van,and drove her body to the white river.he removed the coverings and dumped her body in the water.he later admitted to hiding the coverings under some wood.vii tr.at.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
visinaiz argues on appeal that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of second degree murder.visinaiz moved for a judgment of acquittal after the guilty verdict which the district court rejected based upon the manner of the victim death,specifically multiple blows to the head,and the affirmative steps that visinaiz took to cover up his crime,including weighting the victim body with cement blocks and sinking her in a nearby river.ii doc.at.c.
we review the record for sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states hamilton,cir.in so doing,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and determine whether a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal citations and quotations omitted.
in order to convict visinaiz of second degree murder in indian country under a,a,the government is required to prove that he killed jenkins,acted unlawfully,acted with malice,is an indian,and committed the crime within indian country.see a,a 
with regard to the first element,we find that the evidence is surely sufficient to support the jury finding that visinaiz killed jenkins.indeed,visinaiz himself admitted several times to killing her,as well as to striking her on the head repeatedly.vii tr.at,v tr.at.
with regard to the second element,that visinaiz acted unlawfully in killing jenkins,the evidence is again sufficient to support the jury finding that the killing was unlawful,without excuse or justification.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,a jury could find that the government proved that visinaiz did not act in,because he either did not believe,or could not reasonably believe,that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury,such that it was necessary for him to use force likely to cause the death or serious bodily injury of the victim.the jury could consider that jenkins was years old,was approximately five feet tall and weighed around pounds,had two surgically repaired knees,and often used a walker.see vi tr.at.jenkins was severely intoxicated,and had been ingesting prescription sedative medication.id.at.visinaiz,on the other hand,was years old at the time,is five foot ten inches,and weighed approximately pounds.vi tr.at.even assuming visinaiz was hit by an empty ounce bottle and suffered a laceration,he struck jenkins at least four times in the head with a log.see vii tr.at.
with regard to the malice element,the evidence is sufficient to support the jury finding that the killing was committed with the required mens rea.malice,as defined for purposes of second degree murder,requires either general intent to kill,or intent to do serious bodily injury depraved heart recklessness,or a killing in the commission of a felony that is not among those specifically listed in the first degree murder statute.united states serawop,cir citing united states pearson,cir.
in this case,visinaiz admitted to killing jenkins by striking her repeatedly on the head with a log until she died.vii tr.at,v tr.at.the medical examiner evidence indicated that the numerous blows to the head struck in a downward direction,and at least one was from behind.vi tr.at.there was no indication of any defensive wounds on jenkins body.id.at.
visinaiz argues that jenkins had assaulted him numerous times before,and thus this was simply another instance where he was forced to defend himself,or in the alternative,his justified reaction to adequate provocation while in the heat of passion.but visinaiz himself admits that there was evidence which could have supported a finding of second degree murder.aplt.br.at.he admitted that he killed the victim,and that he buried her body.vii tr.at,aplt.br.at.he further admitted to lying numerous times to the police,and the jury did have evidence of the victim blood on his walls.aplt.br.at.he further concedes,as he must,that the jury could have discounted his testimony.id.at.
taking into account the object used,the amount of force used,and the disparity of mobility,age,and strength between visinaiz and jenkins,the jury had sufficient evidence to find that visinaiz acted with the requisite mens satisfy this element of second degree murder.we also note that a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the government proved the absence of heat of passion,based upon the circumstances of the killing,visinaiz admissions of culpability including concealment,and the calm of his initial denial.visinaiz argues that certain facts other than his testimony render the evidence insufficient including the basis for his fear of reprisal,the circumstances surrounding his change in accounts,and the decedent propensity for drunkeness and violence.aplt.br.at.none of these items alone or in combination on this record render the evidence insufficient when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.
jury instructions 
visinaiz argues on appeal that the various aspects of the district court jury instructions,viewed collectively,constituted plain error.criminal defendants are entitled to jury instructions upon their theory of defense provided there is evidentiary and legal support.united states lofton,cir.upon the failure to so instruct,we will find reversible error.see also bird united states.jury instructions are reviewed to determine whether,as a whole,the instructions correctly state the governing law and provide the jury with an ample understanding of the issues and the applicable standards.united states smith,cir internal citation and quotations omitted.
visinaiz argues that the district court erred in formatting the instructions for second degree murder and the lesser included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.aplt.br.at.visinaiz also argues that the district court erred in failing to allow the jury to consider the facts associated with an involuntary manslaughter conviction unless it first determined that he was not guilty of murder or voluntary manslaughter.id.
visinaiz failed to object to these instructions at trial,and with good reason.as we discuss below,the contentions on appeal are patently meritless.when no objection to a jury instruction was made at trial,the adequacy of the instruction is reviewed de novo for plain error.united states marshall,cir.d b.thus,visinaiz must demonstrate that the jury instruction contains error,that is plain,and that the error affects substantial rights.smith,at.if this is shown,we may exercise discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotations omitted see also united states lott,cir.
heat of passion 
the clarity of the jury instructions is essential in a murder case.lofton,at.this is especially true where the defendant has raised a heat of passion defense.id.as is well known,the prosecution in a criminal case is required to prove every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.see in re winship,d.to obtain a murder conviction,the prosecution must show that the defendant acted with malice aforethought.lofton,at see also a.
the distinction between malice and heat of passion led the supreme court to hold that in order to obtain a murder conviction,the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented.see mullaney wilbur,d see also lofton,at.indeed,the heat of passion defense is directly in opposition to malice,that is,it serve s to negative malice.patterson new york,d see also serawop,at.
visinaiz argues that under lofton,the district court instructions in this case did not allow him to present his theories of defense.we find this argument less than colorable,for even assuming that visinaiz presented evidence for a heat of passion defense,jury instruction quite plainly reads 
the third element the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant acted with malice aforethought the defendant has raised the defense that he acted in the heat of passion and not with malice.heat of passion includes rage,resentment,anger,terror and fear.heat of passion may be produced by fear as well as by rage.in order to satisfy this element,the government must prove the absence of heat of passion beyond a reasonable doubt,before you may find that the defendant acted with malice.
ii doc,instr.emphasis supplied.as such,the district court instruction clearly required that a jury finding of second degree murder mandated that the government prove the absence of heat of passion beyond a reasonable doubt.
visinaiz also takes issue with the definition of the heat of passion instruction contained in the voluntary manslaughter instructions.see ii doc,instr.he contends that the instruction should have contained cool down language to distinguish the heat of passion felt by initial provocation,from,renewed,angry and aggressive thought.aplt.br.at.according to visinaiz,the absence of the cool down language precluded jury consideration of the evidence suggesting heat of passion.this must be instruction adequately defined heat of passion as such a state of passion,or hot blood,or rage,anger,resentment,terror or fear as to indicate the absence of deliberate design to kill or as to cause one to act on impulse without reflection.ii doc,instr.suffice it to say,there is no error in instructions or,plain or otherwise.
visinaiz also argues that the district court instructions and verdict form constituted structural error because they precluded the jury from considering lesser included offenses until the greater offense of second degree murder was considered.this reads too much into lofton.the problem in lofton was that the jury was not adequately instructed that the government had to prove the absence of heat of passion in the murder instruction.lofton,at.given proper instructions,it was entirely proper to have the jury consider the second degree murder charge first.
involuntary manslaughter 
visinaiz argues that the district court erred in failing to adequately instruct the jury on the distinction between the malice present in second degree murder and the malice present in involuntary manslaughter.once again,we review for plain error.smith,at.
there is a similarity between second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter,insofar as they both involve the unlawful killing of a human being.see brown,at see also united states wood,cir.the difference between these two crimes lies in their respective required mental states for culpability.see serawop,at brown,at wood.second degree murder requires a showing of malice,whereas involuntary manslaughter requires a showing of gross negligence.that is to say,both involve unlawful acts,but while second degree murder is that of a depraved heart and reckless and wanton or a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care,involuntary manslaughter amounts to gross negligence or a wanton or reckless disregard for human life.brown,at internal quotations omitted see also wood at united states soundingsides,cir.we have repeatedly held that the substantive distinction between these two crimes is the severity of the reckless and wanton behavior.brown,at emphasis supplied.
in this case,after extensive consultation with counsel,the district court responded as follows to a jury question regarding the meaning of intent to kill.
s econd degree murder is a general intent crime requiring malice aforethought,an element that may be established,among other ways,by evidence of conduct which is reckless and wanton,and a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care,of such a nature that the jury is warranted in inferring that the defendant was aware of the serious risk of death or serious bodily harm.
i nvoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice in the commission in an unlawful manner,or without due caution and circumspection of a lawful act which might produce death.the defendant acts must amount to gross negligence,defined as wanton or reckless disregard for human life,and he must have had either actual knowledge or reason to know that his conduct was a threat to the lives of others.
the substantive distinction is the severity of the reckless and wanton behavior second degree murder involves reckless and wanton disregard for human life that is extreme in nature,while involuntary manslaughter involves reckless and wanton disregard that is not extreme in nature.
of course,you need to look at all of the instructions in this case in reaching a verdict.
viii at emphasis supplied.the jury instructions that dealt with involuntary manslaughter,instructions,clearly comport with what is required in order to correctly state the governing law and provide the jury with an ample understanding of the issues and the applicable standards.smith,at internal citation and quotations omitted.the court response was not in error,plain or otherwise.what is particularly troubling about the complaint on appeal about this instruction is that counsel,who made his concerns known to the court and approved this instruction after the court incorporated modifications,now contends that this instruction is particularly egregious in light of his comments,undecipherable,vague,violative of due process,and structural error.such an approach reminds us that all too often items claimed as plain error on appeal take on a significance and characterization they never had below.it is also apparent that this is a particularly egregious case of invited error.for while it is clear that visinaiz objected to instruction predecessor,see vii at,the district court then adopted visinaiz proffered instruction on imperfect.if there is any error here,a challenge thereto is precluded as invited error.see united states burson,cir.but we see no error in the imperfect instruction and its relationship to involuntary manslaughter.ii doc,instr.
visinaiz also argues that the district court did not place his defense theories squarely before the jury.aplt.br.at.this argument is also without merit.first,instruction clearly states that visinaiz has been charged with second degree murder and has raised the defense of.if you find that the government has disproved the theory of beyond a reasonable doubt,you should continue to consider the alternative defense of imperfect.ii doc,instr.the jury was also instructed adequately as to the requirements of the law of i t is not required that the defendant be in actual danger or great bodily injury.if he honestly and reasonably believes that he is in apparent imminent danger,that his life is about to be taken or that there is a danger of serious bodily harm,that is sufficient.ii at,instr.
the district court further instructed you are reminded that the burden of proof remains at all times on the government t hus,before you may convict,you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has satisfied its burden that the defendant did not act in.id.finally,in the event that even more indicia of the instruction validity are required,we note that the court instructed therefore,if you have a reasonable doubt whether or not the defendant acted in,your verdict as to murder and the lesser included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter must be not guilty.id.we reject the contention that the jury was inadequately presented with visinaiz theories of defense.further,we strongly suggest that counsel carefully consider the merits of an argument before including it in his brief.
prosecutor comments 
visinaiz next claims that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during his closing argument by allegedly advising the jury that the government only needed to prove the defendant gross negligence,misstating the law for involuntary manslaughter,implying that because visinaiz claimed,imperfect and voluntary manslaughter were not legal possibilities,and misstating that visinaiz lack of motive was irrelevant to the malice determination.aplt.br.at.
as visinaiz did not object at trial,we review this claim only for plain error.see united states,cir.plain error must be so egregious as to result in a miscarriage of justice.see united states russell,cir quoting united states young,d.we review the prosecutor comments within the context of the entire case,at.
the first remark that visinaiz argues is reversible error was that the government needed only to prove visinaiz gross negligence for a conviction.here,the portion of the closing argument apparently relied upon by visinaiz is less than persuasive.the prosecutor did say that gross negligence must be shown for involuntary manslaughter.further,he did so in arguing why the jury should find that visinaiz acted with malice,and that the jury should therefore find him guilty of second degree murder,and not the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.see viii tr.at.as such,there is simply no error with regard to this prosecutorial statement.
second,visinaiz argues that the prosecutor misstated the applicable law of involuntary manslaughter,constituting reversible error.aplt.br.at.this argument is too without merit.insofar as the prosecutor can be said to have been stating the law at all,his argument that visinaiz actions on the night of the murder do not amount to imperfect,because there was no threat in the first place,is nowhere near reversible plain error.see viii tr.at.
visinaiz next asserts that the prosecutor argument that the defendant either acted in or in the heat of passion,and not both,constituted reversible plain error.aplt.br.at.of course,the arguments of the prosecutor are simply that,arguments,and not evidence,and the jury was so instructed.ii instr.here,the prosecutor did nothing more than argue to the jury that,on the basis of the government evidence,the jury should find that visinaiz is only entitled to either the heat of passion defense or,and not both.see united states gauvin,cir.therefore,we find no error with regard to the prosecutor argument here.
visinaiz final argument of misconduct focuses on his allegation that the prosecutor misled the jury by misstating the law in implying at closing argument that visinaiz lack of motive was irrelevant to the jury determination of malice.aplt.br.at.but the prosecutor never told the jury that motive was irrelevant.on the contrary,he argued that it was the government evidence of visinaiz lack of motive that indicated malice.viii tr.what makes this such a brutal killing is the fact there is no motive,it chilling.that what makes it malice,that what makes it murder.as such,there is no error in this prosecutorial statement.
visinaiz argues that taken cumulatively,these prosecutorial comments and arguments constitute plain error.see aplt.br.at.on the contrary,we need not conduct a cumulative error analysis as suggested by visinaiz.a cumulative error analysis merely aggregates the individual errors found harmless,and therefore not reversible,and it analyzes whether their cumulative effect on the outcome of the trial is such that collectively they can no longer be determined to be harmless.gauvin,at see also united states rivera,cir en banc.we have not found any individual error at all,a
