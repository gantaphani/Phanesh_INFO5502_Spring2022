factual and procedural summary 
in june,the department of children and family services dcfs filed a welfare and institutions code section petition on behalf of born in and born in.the petition alleged mother had a long history of substance abuse,and father had failed to provide for 
mother claimed she had choctaw indian ancestry.the court ordered dcfs to provide icwa notices to the choctaw tribes and the bureau of indian affairs bia.in july,dcfs sent notices to the choctaw nation of oklahoma,the mississippi band of choctaw indians,the jena band of choctaw indians,as well as the bia and the united states department of the interior.the notice identified mother father richard and paternal grandmother martha as choctaw.
father claimed he may have cherokee ancestry through his paternal,but no living relatives could provide information about it.the court ordered that notice be sent to the bia and the cherokee tribes.at the adjudication hearing in october,dcfs complained father had not cooperated with its efforts to gather further information.in father presence,his attorney stated on the record,dad says he got no icwa the court found icwa did not apply to father,noting father had retracted his earlier claim of cherokee ancestry.the court sustained an amended version of the section petition,ordered the children placed with father,and ordered the case transferred to a different department.
in january,dcfs filed a section petition,alleging father could not provide for the children.the court detained the children and granted the parents monitored visitation.the new judicial officer to whose department the case had been transferred could not determine from the record whether the icwa notice had been deemed complete as to both parents and ordered dcfs to file the choctaw and cherokee tribes responses.dcfs reported that icwa already had been found not to apply to father,and that the three choctaw tribes had responded the children were not eligible for membership.the court nevertheless continued the matter for proper icwa notices,adding in the minute order that the notices were incomplete and father name was misspelled.
in march,dcfs renoticed the bia and the choctaw tribes,and for the first time noticed the eastern band of cherokee indians,the united keetowah band of cherokee indians in oklahoma,and the cherokee nation of oklahoma.in april,the court sustained the section petition,removed the children,and ordered reunification services for the parents.the orders were stayed,awaiting the tribes responses to the icwa notices.dcfs all march notices in june.between march and june,it received responses from all noticed tribes that the children were not eligible for membership.the cherokee nation response listed the names of additional ancestors on mother side,including and as mother paternal,as well as several birthdates that did not appear in the icwa notices.the court found the notices incomplete because they did not include the names of any of father ancestors,or the birth date of martha,mother paternal grandmother.the court ordered dcfs to prepare new notices using the parents birth certificates.
in september,dcfs mailed out new icwa notices that included the children and parents birth certificates.on mother side,the notices added the birth date of mother father,and alternative last names for her paternal grandmother martha,martha,and martha.the notices also included the names of father parents.in response,the cherokee nation requested the date of birth and complete name of father father,who was included in the notice by his first and last name.other than arranging for a single visitation with the children in june,father had not been in contact with dcfs since december.the social worker advised the cherokee nation she could not provide any additional information.all tribes sent negative responses to the september icwa notices.
the court terminated reunification services as to both parents in december,but stayed the orders for resolution of icwa notice issues since mother and another relative had provided additional documentation about mother paternal grandmother.the documents pertained to the grandmother efforts to enroll one of her sons in the choctaw nation.they suggested that the grandmother may have been enrolled as martha or mattie that her parents,and,may have been enrolled as well and that was enrolled as a freedman rather than as a citizen.dcfs renoticed the choctaw and cherokee tribes,attaching the documents to the notice and listing them in a cover letter.the court acknowledged that dcfs had sent the documents to the tribes.all tribes sent negative responses to the december notices.
during the january hearing,mother provided the court with her aunt enrollment number.dcfs provided this information to the choctaw nation by telephone and letter.the choctaw nation again responded that the children were not eligible for membership.the response stated the choctaw nation has exhausted all resources and we have determined icwa will not and does not apply,the tribe feels that we have done a thorough job and sees no reason to continue any future inquiries.in an correspondence in march,the contact person at the choctaw nation confirmed the tribe will not spend any more time on this case as it is futile and reminded dcfs that eligibility for membership is determined by the tribe and is entitled to deference and full faith and credit.
the court found the icwa notices to the cherokee tribes complete in february.at the april hearing,mother submitted evidence that and other ancestors were listed on the choctaw nation freedmen roll.the court initially indicated its intent to order that the choctaw nation be renoticed with this evidence.dcfs reminded the court that the tribe had made it clear it would not spend any more time on the case,and the court decided not to order a further notification.over mother objection,the court found that the icwa notices to the choctaw tribes were proper and complete,and that icwa did not apply to the case.
at subsequent hearings,mother represented that she was attempting to gain enrollment in the choctaw nation.at the section hearing in october,she requested a continuance to obtain further information.the court denied the request,noting mother had not provided an enrollment card,and the tribe had discouraged further inquiries.it also denied mother section petition,which alleged mother recently had enrolled in a drug program.father was not present at the hearing.the court terminated parental rights,freeing the children for adoption by their foster parents.
the parents appealed.
