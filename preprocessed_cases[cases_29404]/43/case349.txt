facts and proceedings 
in march,bruce,a resident of the fort peck indian reservation in northeast montana,choked her son,cylus,and in so doing,bruised his face and neck.on september,a grand jury indicted bruce for assault on a child less than years of age on an indian reservation,in violation of and a.the indictment stated,that on or about march,at or near wolf point,in the state and district of montana,and within the exterior boundaries of the fort peck indian reservation,being indian country,the defendant,violet bruce,did assault another,an indian person who had not attained the age of years,all in violation of and a.the indictment,thus,alleged that the victim was an indian person,but said nothing about bruce status.
bruce admitted that she choked cylus but,on her attorney advice,she pled not guilty.during the district court proceedings,bruce repeatedly argued that she was indian.before trial,she moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it should have been brought under,which applies to certain crimes by indians,rather than,which excepts crimes by indians against indians.the court denied the motion.
at trial,bruce only defense was her claim of indian status.at the close of the government case,bruce again raised the argument in a motion for judgment of acquittal under,which the district court also denied.at the close of all of the evidence,the court considered her indian status defense at length.bruce introduced evidence that she is chippewa that her mother is an enrolled member of the turtle mountain tribe of oklahoma that she was born on an indian reservation that she currently lives on the fort peck indian reservation that two of her children are enrolled members of an indian tribe that she has been treated by poplar indian health services and the spotted bull treatment center that whenever she was arrested it had to have been by a tribal person and that she has been arrested by tribal authorities all her life.the district court concluded that,under,bruce indian status was an affirmative defense on which bruce had the burden of production and that she had not borne this burden.accordingly,the court declined to submit the issue to the jury.
a jury convicted bruce of violating and the district court sentenced her to three years probation.following her conviction,bruce unsuccessfully moved to arrest the judgment under.on the basis of her claimed indian status.in support of her motion,bruce introduced additional evidence showing that in she was treated as an indian child by the fort peck tribal court,exercising jurisdiction pursuant to the indian child welfare act.after her motion was denied,bruce took this appeal.

discussion 
federal criminal jurisdiction in indian country 
the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over indians and indian country is a complex patchwork of federal,state,and tribal law,which is better explained by history than by logic.duro reina,d.the historical background of federal criminal jurisdiction in indian country can be traced to colonial times,when indian territory was entirely the province of the tribes and the tribes were understood to possess jurisdiction over all persons and subjects present on indian lands.see william canby,american indian law in a nutshell.this policy continued until shortly after the ratification of the constitution,when congress extended federal jurisdiction to committing crimes against indians in indian territory.stat.stat.stat.congress further extended criminal jurisdiction in to cover crimes committed by indians and in indian country notably,congress excepted offenses,or crimes in which both the victim and perpetrator were indian.stat.
the act served as the predecessor to,which is sometimes called the indian general crimes act igca.section makes federal enclave criminal concrete body of law governing areas within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the united applicable to crimes committed in indian country.see defining indian country.section provides in full 
except as otherwise expressly provided by law,the general laws of the united states as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the united states,except the district of columbia,shall extend to the indian country.
this section shall not extend to offenses committed by one indian against the person or property of another indian,nor to any indian committing any offense in the indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe,or to any case where,by treaty stipulations,the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the indian tribes respectively.
in its original form,the igca ensured that federal criminal laws reached committing crimes in indian country,while at the same time preserving the right of the tribes to punish their own.see oliphant suquamish indian tribe,d.
the igca excepts from federal criminal jurisdiction three categories of offenses that might otherwise be thought to be within the jurisdiction of the tribes offenses committed by one indian against the person or property of another indian,offenses committed by an indian who has been punished by the tribe,and cases secured by treaty to the exclusive jurisdiction of a tribe.although the plain language of covers crimes in indian country committed by against,mull united states,cir,the supreme court has held that states retain exclusive jurisdiction over general crimes committed by against in indian country.organized vill.of kake egan,d new york ex rel.ray martin.draper united states.united states mcbratney.thus,under the igca,the criminal laws of the united states apply to offenses committed in indian country by against indians and by indians against section establishes federal jurisdiction over interracial crimes only.united states prentiss,cir per curiam en banc.
the exception in the igca preserves the right of tribal courts to try offenses committed in indian country by indians against indians,while recognizing that indian tribes generally do not have jurisdiction over.see oliphant,at.see also recognizing the inherent power of indian tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all indians.the supreme court has interpreted the exception as manifesting a broad congressional respect for tribal sovereignty in matters affecting only indians.see united states quiver.broadly interpreting the offense exception to extend to adultery involving an indian participant.
following the supreme court decision in ex parte crow dog,which held that neither federal nor tribal courts had jurisdiction to try an indian for the murder of another indian on a reservation,congress revisited this policy.congressional displeasure with the crow dog decision led to the passage of a second statute,designed to establish as federal crimes,fourteen named offenses committed by indians in indian country.see united states broncheau,cir,cert.denied,d.as relevant for our purposes,provides 
any indian who commits against the person or property of another indian or other person any of the following offenses,namely an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of years shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses,within the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states.
a.enacted in,the indian major crimes act imca guaranteed that indians committing major crimes against other indians would be treated with the same rigor as offenders.see oliphant,at.the imca,the court has recognized,is a carefully limited intrusion of federal power into the otherwise exclusive jurisdiction of the indian tribes to punish indians for crimes committed on indian land.united states antelope,d quoting keeble united states,d assault against an individual who has not attained the age of years is one of the enumerated crimes that the imca covers.
we have recognized that the limited intrusion on indian sovereignty in the imca is itself confined to federal enclave law.in united states begay,cir,we rejected the claim that indians may not be charged for any criminal conduct beyond those crimes enumerated in the indian major crimes act.we concluded that the imca only concerns the application of federal enclave law to indians and has no bearing on federal laws of nationwide applicability that make actions criminal wherever committed.id.citing united states top sky,cir.thus,we held that federal criminal laws of general,nationwide as the federal conspiracy statute,to indians unless a treaty specifically exempts them.id.at citing united states burns,cir.
despite these intrusions,tribal courts retain jurisdiction to punish certain crimes occurring in indian country.however,under the indian civil rights act,et.icra,tribal courts may not impose punishment greater than a year imprisonment or a fine,or both.id.tribal courts may generally punish offenses committed by members of the tribe and may prosecute misdemeanors against indians who are not members of that tribe.see also united states lara,d rejecting a challenge to the icra amendment and upholding the authority of congress to permit tribes,as an exercise of their inherent tribal authority,to prosecute indians,but declining to reach the question of whether the constitution due process or equal protection clauses prohibit tribes from prosecuting a citizen of the united states.because the tribe jurisdiction stems from its inherent authority,rather than federal delegation,successive prosecution by a tribe and the federal government does not run afoul of the double jeopardy clause,as the two are dual sovereigns.id.at.nonetheless,congress has statutorily forbidden a successive prosecution in federal court brought pursuant to after the tribe has imposed punishment for the offense.
in addition to federal and tribal jurisdiction,there are statutes in which congress has unambiguously confer red jurisdiction on the state over major offenses committed by or against indians on indian reservations.negonsott samuels,d construing the kansas act.aside from statutory grants,the effect of the supreme court decision in mcbratney,at,is to recognize state jurisdiction for crimes committed by against on indian territory.
we can summarize these rules concerning criminal jurisdiction in indian country as follows 
crimes in which both the perpetrator and victim are indian are subject to a federal jurisdiction under if the crime charged is one of the fourteen enumerated crimes and conviction may extend to lesser included offenses,or if the federal statute is one of general applicability b state jurisdiction where authorized by congress and c tribal jurisdiction,perhaps running concurrent with either federal or state jurisdiction,although punishment is limited to no more than one year and.
crimes in which the perpetrator,but not the victim,is indian are subject to a federal jurisdiction under except where the tribe has already imposed punishment or the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction through treaty,or if the crime is one of the fourteen enumerated crimes,with conviction perhaps extending to lesser included offenses,and pursuant to federal criminal laws of general applicability b state jurisdiction where authorized by congress and c tribal jurisdiction,perhaps running concurrently with either federal or state jurisdiction,although punishment is limited to no more than one year and 
crimes in which the victim,but not the perpetrator,is indian are subject to a federal jurisdiction under,as well as pursuant to federal criminal laws of general applicability,and b state jurisdiction where authorized by congress.
crimes in which both the perpetrator and victim are are subject to state jurisdiction or federal criminal laws of general applicability.
see united states johnson,cir julie wrend clay smith,american indian law deskbook.
we note that the complex scheme established by congress creates obvious gaps in federal jurisdiction to punish crimes in indian country.for example,a may be charged under when the victim is an indian if his victim is a,he generally must be charged under state law.an indian may be charged with a host of federal crimes under if his victim is a,but generally only with major crimes under if his victim is an indian.see antelope,at.rejecting an equal protection challenge to.
the one point that emerges with clarity from this otherwise bewildering maze of rules is that the question of who is an indian bears significant legal consequences.importantly,from a defendant perspective,unless state jurisdiction is specifically authorized by congress,or he is charged pursuant to a generally applicable federal criminal statute,an indian person charged with committing a crime against another indian person that is not listed in is subject only to the jurisdiction of the tribe the offender may only be punished for up to one year or fined,or both.once an indian person is punished by a tribe for an offense covered by,federal courts may no longer impose any punishment for that offense.thus,indian status carries certain benefits in the context of federal criminal adjudications.
indian status also bears significance independent of criminal jurisdiction.the host of federal statutes and service programs designed to benefit indians are rife with classifications used to designate the special position of a formerly sovereign people.see antelope,at.felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law ed.these include,to name a few,the indian civil rights act,the indian health care improvement act,id.the indian education act,id.the indian alcohol substance abuse act,id.and the indian child welfare act,id.see morton mancari,d literally every piece of legislation dealing with indian tribes and reservations single s out for special treatment a constituency of tribal indians living on or near reservations.accordingly,some commentators have even gone so far as to characterize indian status as a property interest.see gail sheffield,the arbitrary indian the indian arts and crafts act of,at.although the requirements may vary depending upon the purpose for which indian status is claimed,courts can not be ignorant of the collateral consequences their rulings might have in future proceedings.it is against the backdrop of these formal and functional considerations that we must discern the precise relationship between and two bifurcated statutory remnants of a complicated jurisdictional history.
indian status as a defense to 
bruce contends that,because she and her victim are both indians,her indictment should have been brought pursuant to,rather than.in order to resolve this contention,we must first determine what effect one claimed indian status has in a prosecution brought pursuant to.
in united states hester,cir,we held that the government need not allege the status of the defendant in an indictment under section,nor does it have the burden of going forward on that issue.id.at.rather,o nce the defendant properly raises the issue of his indian status,then the ultimate burden of proof remains upon the government.id.citing united states guess,cir.section thus requires that bruce not only raise her indian status but also that she carry the burden of production for that issue indian status,after hester,is in the nature of an affirmative defense.to satisfy her burden,bruce must come forward with enough evidence of her indian status to permit a to decide the issue in her favor.no court has yet specified the quantum of evidence that must be offered in order to satisfy this production burden.nonetheless,once she meets this burden,the government retains the ultimate burden of the obligation to persuade the trier of fact of the truth of the proposition,office of workers comp.programs,dep t of labor greenwich collieries,d that the exception she claims is inapplicable.see martin ohio,d powell,dissenting noting that when an affirmative defense does negate an element of the crime the state must prove the nonexistence of the defense beyond a reasonable doubt emphasis in original citing in re winship,d patterson new york,nn,d noting that the trend over the years appears to have been to require the prosecution to disprove affirmative defenses beyond a reasonable doubt guess,at explaining the general rule that once a criminal defendant satisfies his burden of production with respect to an affirmative defense,the prosecution must prove the inapplicability of this defense beyond a reasonable doubt.
bruce argues that the district court erred by refusing to submit the issue of her indian status to the jury because she presented enough evidence to meet her burden of production.the government responds that bruce did not meet her burden,or alternately,that,assuming bruce is indian,the prosecution under was harmless because her conduct was equally illegal under.
determining who is an indian 
the term indian is not statutorily defined,but courts have judicially explicated its meaning.broncheau,at.the generally accepted test for indian status considers the degree of indian blood and tribal or government recognition as an indian.united states keys,cir quoting broncheau,at see also united states rogers,how.interpreting the meaning of indian under the trade and intercourse act of,the precursor of the major crimes act,not to apply to a white man who had been adopted into the cherokee tribe a person claiming indian status must satisfy both prongs.the first prong requires ancestry living in america before the europeans arrived,but this fact is obviously rarely provable as such.see canby,supra,at.because the general requirement is only of some blood,evidence of a parent,grandparent,or who is clearly identified as an indian is generally sufficient to satisfy this prong.see also vezina united states,cir women to chippewa indian held to be indian sully united states,cir indian blood held sufficient to be indian cloud united states,of yankton sioux blood sufficient to satisfy the first requirement of having a degree of indian blood goforth state,requirement of indian blood satisfied by testimony that person was slightly less than cherokee indian makah indian tribe clallam county,makah blood sufficient to satisfy indian blood requirement.
the second prong of the or federal government recognition as an indian probes whether the native american has a sufficient link to a formerly sovereign people.cloud.at.when analyzing this prong,courts have considered,in declining order of importance,evidence of the following tribal enrollment government recognition formally and informally through receipt of assistance reserved only to indians enjoyment of the benefits of tribal affiliation and social recognition as an indian through residence on a reservation and participation in indian social life.united states lawrence,cir citing cloud.at.
bruce presented evidence to establish both her indian blood and recognition.with respect to indian blood,she offered evidence that she is chippewa indian and introduced a certificate of indian blood confirming this fact.she also offered evidence that her mother is an enrolled member of the turtle mountain tribe of oklahoma,and that two of bruce children are enrolled members of an indian tribe with respect to recognition,she presented evidence that she was born on an indian reservation and currently lives on one that she participates in indian religious ceremonies that she has,on several occasions,been treated at indian hospitals and that she was arrested tribal all her life.
the district court,applying the test for determining indian status,concluded that bruce had provided evidence to establish the first prong,her indian blood.her status,therefore,turned on whether a tribe or the federal government had recognized her as an indian.the district court cited the fact that she was not enrolled in a tribe and failed to present evidence that the federal government had recognized her to be an indian.on the basis of this evidence,it found that bruce had not met her burden on this prong and concluded that she had not satisfied her burden of production as to the affirmative defense.
we disagree.tribal enrollment is the common evidentiary means of establishing indian status,but it is not the only means nor is it necessarily determinative.broncheau,at accord antelope,at.e nrollment in an official tribe has not been held to be an absolute requirement for federal jurisdiction citations omitted keys,at while tribal enrollment is one means of establishing status as an indian under,it is not the sole means of proving such status.citation omitted ex parte pero,cir the lack of enrollment is not determinative of status t he refusal of the department of interior to enroll a certain indian as a member of a certain tribe is not necessarily an administrative determination that the person is not an indian.cloud.at a person may still be an indian though not enrolled with a recognized tribe.nor have we required evidence of federal recognition.rather,we have emphasized that there must be some evidence of government or tribal recognition.see keys,at concluding that where child was shown to have indian blood and was treated by tribe as a member of the tribe,district court properly found that she was an indian accord ex parte pero,at lewis state,idaho.this stems from the recognition that one of an indian tribe most basic powers is the authority to determine questions of its own membership.see santa clara pueblo martinez,d united states wheeler,d cherokee intermarriage cases.roff burney.
motivated in part by equal protection concerns,the dissent proposes a new test for determining indian status one that would conflate our rogers inquiry and multifaceted recognition guidelines into a single question whether the individual is enrolled or eligible for enrollment in a federally recognized tribe.from a purely conceptual standpoint,we agree that eligibility for enrollment provides a simpler framework within which we might judge indian status as a political affiliation with a formerly sovereign people.nonetheless,it is not the test that we have adopted,and until either congress acts or the supreme court or an en banc panel of our court revises the recognition prong of the rogers test,we are bound by our prior jurisprudence.in particular,we are bound by the body of case law which holds that enrollment,and,indeed,even eligibility therefor,is not dispositive of indian status.broncheau,at keys,at.in sum,we are not permitted to hold that these cases do not mean what they say 
consequently,we find united states keys,particularly instructive.keys,a,was charged under with assault of his daughter,who possessed indian blood.keys argued that the government had failed to prove that his daughter,who was not enrolled,was an indian presumably on the theory that after mcbratney,at,assault committed by a against a victim could be charged under state law,but not under.the magistrate found that the tribal court had exercised jurisdiction over keys daughter,and that she had been provided medical services by an indian hospital.the magistrate concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that,under such circumstances,she was a de facto member of the tribe.id.at.without considering whether she was eligible for enrollment,we concluded that her indian status was amply demonstrated.id.at 
because of the procedural posture of the case with which we are presented,we are not required to decide whether bruce conclusively established that she was an indian.rather,we must merely determine whether she brought forward enough evidence of tribal recognition to permit her defense to be heard by the jury.we conclude that she did.
bruce produced evidence that she had participated in sacred tribal rituals,including at least one sweat lodge ritual that she was born on an indian reservation and continues to reside on one that two of her children are enrolled members of an indian tribe and that she has been treated by poplar indian health services and the spotted bull treatment center.more significantly,her mother testified that whenever she was arrested it had to have been by a tribal person and that she has been arrested by tribal authorities all her life.the precise testimony was as follows 
q.when violet was young,did she have issues or problems with the tribal authorities 
not really.but she was arrested tribal all her life.
well,that what i want to talk about.what does that mean that she was arrested tribal 
a.she got out of hand and someone had to come and get her,arrest her.and it had to have been a tribal person.
and that would be drinking behavior and such 
yeah.fighting with her sister.
now,the tribal authorities would step in and take charge of the situation 
and did that involve dealing with the tribal authorities 
and was violet treated as an indian person during those times 
by the tribe 
this testimony is significant because,as we have discussed,the tribe has no jurisdiction to punish anyone but an indian.oliphant,at.
in sum,bruce brought forward testimony to establish that she was arrested tribal her entire life and that whenever she had a brush with the law it had to be with tribal authorities.although not introduced as artfully by her counsel as it could have been,bruce has put the question of tribal criminal jurisdiction on the table,and,in so doing,raised strong evidence of tribal recognition.the assumption and exercise of a tribe criminal jurisdiction,while not conclusive evidence of indian status,significantly bolsters the argument that bruce met her burden of producing sufficient evidence upon which a jury might rationally conclude that she was an indian.
we caution that bruce was only required to meet a production burden.when combined with the testimony as to her chippewa blood line,the cumulative effect of the additional evidence of tribal recognition does at least that.to decline to find sufficient evidence of indian status on these facts is to shift the burden to the defense.bruce burden is one of mere production.
accordingly,we hold that bruce brought forward sufficient evidence that,if believed,would permit a jury rationally to conclude that bruce was indian 
harmless error 
having determined that the court erred in declining to submit the issue of bruce indian status to the jury,we must now determine whether that error was harmless.see fed.crim.a any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.the government argues that it makes no difference whether a jury could have concluded that bruce was indian because that would only mean that her conduct violated,rather than.effectively,the government argues that because her victim was an indian,her crime must be chargeable under either or,and bruce indian status is therefore irrelevant.although the government argument finds some support in the cases examining this issue,we find these cases distinguishable and the argument unpersuasive.
in henry united states,cir,modified,cir,we concluded that when an indictment charged a violation of but the government actually prosecuted the case under,the error was harmless.in henry,the indictment listed but alleged that the defendant was indian.see henry,at.the court instructed the jury that the defendant indian status was an element of the offense,and the jury found that the government had proven that the defendant was indian beyond a reasonable doubt.see id.although the indictment read,the defendant was in all other respects prosecuted under,and not.thus,henry dealt with little more than a scrivener error.
in united states heath,cir,we concluded that an indictment under,alleging that both the victim and the defendant were indian,was sufficient to support a conviction under.the facts in heath were quite unusual.heath had initially stipulated that she was an indian which would have subjected her to however,on appeal she argued that,by act of congress,the klamath tribe was dissolved,and she was no longer entitled to claim indian status at the time of her offense.see.we agreed that she was no longer an indian,but held that the error in the indictment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,considerable emphasis was placed on heath stipulation that she was an indian,id.at,as well as the indictment proper reference to the victim indian status,which,given the termination of heath indian status,was a for her conviction under.id.at.moreover,as heath clearly implies,a denial of indian status operates as a jurisdictional element under,which is generally resolved by a judge,rather than an affirmative defense,which must be submitted to the jury after the defendant carries his production burden importantly,however,in neither henry nor heath was the question of indian status contested at trial.
while other circuits have reached the same conclusion under similar circumstances,only one case involved an objection timely filed.in united states white horse,cir,the eighth circuit held that a charge brought under rather than was not plainly erroneous because b etween them,the statutes apply to all defendants whatever their race or ethnicity.id.at see also id.at noting that objection was not raised at trial.the tenth circuit in prentiss,concluded that,although the status of the victim and defendant are essential elements of crimes which must be alleged in the indictment,the failure of the indictment to allege those elements was harmless error.see also id.at reasoning that the indictment should be construed liberally because the defendant challenge was belated.in united states john,cir,the fifth circuit,without commenting on the timeliness of the motion,concluded that an indictment erroneous reliance on,rather than,was harmless where the applicable federal enclave law was also referenced such that it was clear that the indictment asserted jurisdiction under as an unstated premise.
close examination demonstrates that none of these cases involves a timely challenge to a prosecution both instituted and actually conducted pursuant to the wrong statute.yet,their reasoning is alluring because does not dispute that she committed the underlying act of choking her guilty under either or either she is an indian or she is not.see white horse,at.given all of the evidence offered at trial,the conclusion that the district court reached the correct result despite its error seems almost inescapable.see,united states rubenstein,cir frank,dissenting famously characterizing this approach to harmless error review as follows if we,sitting on a reviewing court,believe,from merely reading the record,that a defendant is guilty,then we hold that an error even if it may seriously have prejudiced the jury against the defendant,is to be regarded as harmless.
nonetheless,this logic belies harmless error scrutiny.in reviewing nonconstitutional error on direct appeal under rule a,we adhere to the analysis first provided by the supreme court in kotteakos united states.see also brecht abrahamson,d reaffirming the kotteakos standard united states brooke,cir stating that the standard for nonconstitutional error on direct review is governed by kotteakos.in rejecting the premise underlying the correct result,that a defendant has not been harmed by error if he should have been convicted in any reaffirmed a touchstone principle of appellate review i t is not the appellate court function to determine guilt or innocence.nor is it to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out those judgments are exclusively for the jury.kotteakos,at.citations omitted.instead,kotteakos offered the following standard 
if,when all is said and done,the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury,or had but very slight effect,the verdict and the judgment should stand but if one can not say,with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.
id.at.the court emphasized that whether conviction would,or might probably,have resulted in properly conducted trial is not the criterion rather,we are merely to inquire whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.id.at.emphasis added.
using this framework,it is clear that our answer to the question of what would have happened without the error should not be based on our own satisfaction with the verdict,or even whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have reached the same verdict absent the error.the issue,rather,is what the jury actually would have done without the error.see wayne lafave,jerold israel nancy king,criminal procedure b ed.it is against this backdrop that we judge the harm caused to bruce by the trial court erroneous decision to prevent bruce from reaching the jury on the question of her indian status.
we note that congress has set forth,in and,two different mechanisms for asserting federal criminal jurisdiction.we have previously concluded that the defendant indian status is an essential element of a offense which the government must allege in the indictment and prove beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states james,cir concluding that where the defendant challenges the indictment before trial,the failure to allege indian status is fatal to an indictment under broncheau,at implying that the defendant indian status is one of the necessary elements to be proven by the government in a prosecution.our conclusion that bruce met her burden of production under implies a finding that the jury could rationally acquit on the basis that the government failed to disprove her claimed indian status.this does not equate to a finding that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that bruce is indian,as required by.by prosecuting bruce under,rather than,the government did not have to prove that bruce was an indian.in so doing,the government released itself of its obligation to prove an element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.the trial court error was,thus,not anymore harmless than a failure to prove that the victim was indeed a child under the age of.absent proof of bruce indian status,there is no federal crime under.
moreover,were we to find harmless error in this the defendant has objected from the outset that she could not be charged under would have merged the two statutes into one.we would be inviting the government to charge under either statute,calculating that one of the provisions is likely to apply.this is not without consequences.because requires proof of fewer elements,the government would always have an incentive to indict under that section,thereby shifting the costs of producing evidence of indian status to the defendant.
furthermore,as we have discussed,bruce status as an indian vel non has consequences for any future prosecutions,and may also have collateral consequences in future hearings where indian status is at issue.to offer a single example,prior tribal punishment,as noted previously,is an affirmative defense to a prosecution instituted pursuant to.see stating that t his section shall not extend to any indian committing any offense in the indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe.were we to find harmless error in this case,it is not clear on what basis this affirmative defense could ever be raised in a prosecution brought against an indian person under,so long as the crime could have been charged under.in sum,we simply can not conclude,based upon the record,that the district court error did not have a prejudicial effect on the outcome of the proceeding.see kotteakos,at.
we note,however,that this statutory framework creates an obvious and troubling conundrum.it is entirely probable that the government may be simultaneously unable either to prove or disprove a claim of indian status,effectively foreclosing conviction under either statute.this is especially likely given that the burden of proof required for a defendant to place indian status at issue in a case may be as low as a preponderance,whereas the burden of proof required for the government to both disprove indian status under and to prove indian status under is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.we are also aware of the additional expenditure of government resources required to reindict bruce under a different provision and to retry her with the same evidence,but we decline to challenge the government charging decision.see prentiss,at.judicial correction of indictments that erroneously misrepresent a defendant indian status presents the possibility of future adverse collateral consequences outside the criminal context,and improperly shifts the burden of proof otherwise applicable to the parties within the criminal arena.
in addition,where indictment is required,judicial correction of this sort serves to usurp the uniquely protective role of the grand jury the fifth amendment vests the grand jury with responsibility for determining whether there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and for protect ing citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions.united states calandra,d.the grand jury is part of the prosecutorial process,butz economou,d,and we may not direct its activities.see united states dionisio,d.accordingly,we may not presume to correct the decisions of the grand jury by altering the sections charged under the united states code,except through our judgments,any more than we can,except through our judgments,correct the prosecutorial decisions of the executive.see united states williams,d united states nixon,d confiscation cases,wall.
while we are not ignorant of the troublesome nature of our judgment,we remain bound by the language and structure of these two statutes.the federal crimes at issue here are solely creatures of statute,staples united states,d.subject to constitutional limitations not implicated here,a federal appellate authorized to define the elements of a federal criminal offense.whalen united states,d.it is likewise up to congress to correct any awkwardness in the interrelation of the acts it promulgates.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this decision.
i part company because until now,no one has ever held that an adult may be an indian for purposes of legal status,not for purposes of ethnicity when she is neither enrolled as a member of a tribe nor eligible for membership,nor entitled to tribal or government benefits to which only indians are entitled our law does not require us to allow bruce to put her legal status as an indian into thus to shift the burden to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she is not an the absence of any evidence that she is at least eligible for tribal membership or recognition and it makes no sense to do so,for the majority contrary rule allows bruce,on the same set of facts,to be both an indian who can not be prosecuted under and not an indian who can not be prosecuted under.
the facts are undisputed.the evidence shows that 
bruce mother,who is enrolled in the turtle mountain tribe,is indian 
bruce is chippewa 
bruce currently lives on the reservation of the fort peck tribe 
bruce associates with indian persons 
bruce has three children,two of whom are indian and are enrolled in a tribe 
bruce engaged in one sweat lodge a ceremony that has religious significance 
bruce was arrested tribal all her life 
there is no evidence 
that bruce is an enrolled member of any tribe 
that bruce is recognized as a tribe member by any tribe or the federal government 
that bruce enjoys any benefits of tribal affiliation 
that bruce is eligible for tribal membership 
that bruce has voted in tribal elections,that she has held tribal office,that she has served on tribal juries,that she has received payments or allotments made only to indians,or that she is employed by a tribal organization.
i agree with the district court that,as a matter of law,this evidence does not permit a jury to find that bruce has legal status as an indian.
the federal enclave act,provides for the prosecution of crimes committed in indian country by against indians,but its coverage does not extend to offenses committed by one indian against the person or property of another indian,in turn,provides that an indian who commits certain major crimes against the person or property of another indian may be prosecuted under the general laws of the united states.neither section defines indian.however,courts generally follow the rogers test which considers the degree of indian blood and tribal or government recognition as an indian.united states keys,cir.we have held that the defendant legal status as a is not an element or an essential jurisdictional fact that must be charged in an indictment under.united states hester,cir.rather,as we explained in adopting the framework that controls prosecutions and this case,
i t is far more manageable for the defendant to shoulder the burden of producing evidence that he is a member of a federally recognized tribe than it is for the government to produce evidence that he is not a member of any one of the hundreds of such tribes.we accordingly hold that the government need not allege the status of the defendant in an indictment under section,nor does it have the burden of going forward on that issue.once the defendant properly raises the issue of his indian status,then the ultimate burden of proof remains,of course,upon the government.
id.at emphasis added.
while we have stated in different contexts that enrollment is not the exclusive way to show that one is indian we have recognized that tribal membership is the common thread and evidentiary means of establishing indian status.see broncheau,at observing this,and noting that the defendant admitted he was enrolled and never suggested he did not understand the term indian as it applied to him.so far as i can tell,no court has ever held that an adult could have indian legal status who was neither enrolled or eligible for enrollment,nor entitled to tribal or government benefits due only to indians indeed,at a minimum,eligibility for be constitutionally required to avoid equal protection problems because otherwise,enforcement of federal criminal laws would arguably be based on an impermissible racial classification.see antelope,at.holding that there was no constitutional problem because defendants were not subjected to federal criminal jurisdiction under on account of their indian race,but because they are enrolled members of the coeur tribe keys,at noting that antelope had upheld prosecution on equal protection grounds because the term indian describes a political group or membership,not a racial group.
it is difficult to fathom what the recognition prong of rogers means if not enrollment or eligibility for enrollment in a tribe,or receipt of tribal or federal benefits to which only indians are entitled.indian ties can not be enough,because one can have ties without legal status.as the supreme court observed in duro reina,m any reside on reservations,and have close ties to tribes through marriage or long employment.indeed,the population of on reservations generally is greater than the population of all indians,d.
but the majority are enough for purposes of,no reason of logic,linguistics,or grammar suggests that ties should not also be enough for purposes of yet clearly they are not.to the contrary,we have held for purposes of that a terminated klamath indian is no longer an indian because she lost her indian legal status upon termination.united states heath,cir hester,at so noting.if that is so,then it makes no sense for an indian who has never had tribal membership and is ineligible for it to have legal status as an indian.a court can not rationally hold that both things are true.
united states keys,cir,which the majority points to as instructive,op.at,is different.there,the question of indian status arose with respect to a old girl who was not enrolled in the tribe.however,we decided that her lack of enrollment did not control the determination of her indian status because she could not have enrolled herself,her mother was an enrolled member of the colorado river indian tribe,the girl had colorado river indian blood,the girl custody was litigated in the colorado river indian tribal court which exercised jurisdiction over her and continued to do so at the time of the federal action,and the allegations that formed the gravamen of the federal prosecution were investigated by colorado river indian police.id.at.bruce situation differs because she is an adult who could have enrolled herself if she were eligible,she has chippewa blood which is not the bloodline of the ford peck tribes,and she was not under the jurisdiction of any tribal court at the time of the federal action.
in sum,the district court got the test right,correctly construed the facts in the light most favorable to bruce,and concluded that,as a matter of law,the evidence adduced by bruce does not permit a reasonable inference that she has indian legal status.applying the rogers test,the district court acknowledged evidence of some indian blood possessed by bruce.this evidence shows that she is chippewa,but there is no evidence that this meets the quantum of blood requirement for recognition by that tribe.as judge canby notes in his nutshell,tribes have different blood requirements for enrollment many require tribal blood,and at least one requires william canby,american indian law in a nutshell ed.regardless,there is no evidence that bruce is enrolled as a member of the turtle mountain her mother is of the sioux or assiniboine tribes which are the two tribes at ford peck,where bruce now lives,or of any chippewa tribe.there is no evidence that she is eligible for membership.there is no evidence that bruce holds herself out as indian although she enrolled two of her three children,she has not enrolled or for all that appears,ever tried to enroll herself.
this indicates that she either knows that she can not be a tribal member,or does not wish to identify herself as one.there is no evidence that she has received benefits,payments,or allotments to which only an indian is entitled.nor is there any evidence that bruce has taken part in tribal affairs by voting,serving on juries,or holding office.there is no evidence that fort peck has been involved in her life in a significant enough way to constitute recognition and conversely,visiting a sweat lodge with her mother on one occasion does not manifest participation in indian life or heritage to any substantial extent.the only evidence of bruce legal status as an indian comes from the fact that her mother is an enrolled member of the turtle mountain tribe,bruce was arrested tribal,was married for a time to an indian,has two enrolled children,lives on the fort peck reservation which is home to tribes with which she has no blood relationship,and socializes with others on the reservation because of her children.this could well be true of a lot of people,for many live on indian reservations,where they too get in trouble,socialize with indians,marry indians,and have children who are recognized as indian.these facts alone do not raise an inference that bruce has been recognized by any tribe or the government.
accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that bruce failed to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that she has legal status as an indian.i would not cut a new path that allows someone to have the legal status of an indian,and not an indian,on the same set of facts that does not include enrollment,eligibility for enrollment,or entitlement to indian benefits as a common denominator.i therefore dissent.
the scope of the statute was expanded significantly by the supreme
