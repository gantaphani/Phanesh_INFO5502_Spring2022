amended opinion 
joseph lee seymour was charged in a indictment with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor and with aggravated sexual abuse of an adult by force.a jury convicted seymour on both counts.the district court sentenced seymour to months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.seymour now challenges the admission of evidence regarding uncharged prior sexual assaults against two other adult victims to prove the charge,the exclusion of testimony relating to whether the adult victim in the present case consented to sexual behavior with seymour,the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the charge,and the length of his sentence.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
seymour,a native american,has lived on or near the hannahville indian community reservation in michigan for most of his life.at the age of,he witnessed a truck strike and kill his father.in his early teens,seymour began abusing alcohol and drugs.
the alleged victims in the present case,and,are mother and daughter.is the wife of one of seymour brothers.in,who was then ten years old,reported that seymour,her uncle,had fingered her three years earlier.during the course of the subsequent investigation,reported that seymour had sexually assaulted her as well in.seymour was charged in august of with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor,in violation of c count i,and with aggravated sexual abuse of an adult by force,in violation of a count ii.the government alleged that he had used his finger to penetrate the genital opening of,a female indian,who had not attained the age of twelve years,with the intent to gratify his sexual desire in or about.it further alleged that seymour had used force to make intentional contact between his penis and the vulva of,a female indian in or about.seymour pled not guilty to both counts.
three months prior to trial,the government informed seymour that it planned to introduce evidence that he had engaged in unlawful sex acts with three other women,and.the government argued that this evidence was admissible under rule of the federal rules of evidence,which permits the introduction of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault if the defendant is charged with an offense of sexual assault.seymour objected to the introduction of this evidence,which consisted of two allegations of forceful sexual penetration and one allegation of unwanted sexual contact.he argued that the introduction of this evidence would lead to prejudice and confusion of a magnitude sufficient to substantially outweigh its probative value under rule of the federal rules of evidence.
the district court held that the testimony regarding the alleged prior sexual assaults was admissible to prove both counts against seymour.it further denied seymour request during the trial for the court to provide a proper,appropriate instruction in order to avoid some of the prejudice and certainly the confusion that the jury is going to find from the admission of such testimony.
seymour trial began in december of.the government first offered the testimony of,who was then years old.testified that,late on the night of the alleged sexual assault,seymour knocked on her mother bedroom window.he was intoxicated.she,her brother,her sister,and their mother,were all sleeping in large bed.seymour asked if he could spend the night.according to,she was left alone in the bed with seymour when the rest of her family moved to the living room couch.her direct examination proceeded in relevant part as follows 
q okay.do you remember uncle joe touching you 
q did he touch you inside of your underpants 
a yes,he did.
q what did he touch in there 
a he touched me with his hands.
also testified that seymour touched her in t he front private.when the government asked her if seymour touched her in the same place that you would wipe after you go pee,she answered yes.
testified that she left the bedroom after the encounter and told her mother that she did not want to sleep in the room with seymour.he spent the rest of the night alone on the couch.did not report what had occurred to anyone,however,until because she thought she was going to get in trouble.
on,seymour counsel established that when reported in that she had been fingered three years earlier,she did not know what the word meant,but she had heard it used on television.also said that she did not know where on her private area seymour had touched her,and she did not remember whether seymour had used his hand or his finger,or if any part of his hand had gone inside of her.
then testified how she herself was sexually assaulted by seymour several months before the alleged assault on.this incident also occurred in bedroom.she testified that seymour removed her clothing and then had intercourse with her,even though she tried to push him away.according to,she did not report the rape out of embarrassment,and she subsequently allowed seymour to share a bed with her daughter because she did not think that he would harm her children.also corroborated testimony that later left the bedroom and said that she did not want to sleep in the same room as seymour.
the district court further permitted the admission of evidence of prior uncharged sexual assaults against two other women,and.a third woman,who had filed an charge against seymour in,was likewise going to testify against him,but ultimately did not take the stand.testified that,in,an intoxicated seymour found her on a bed at the home of seymour mother,forcibly removed her shorts,pushed her underwear across right on the side,and raped her.at the time,was pregnant with the child of patrick seymour,one of joseph seymour brothers,and she asked the prosecutors not to pursue the case.
in addition,who was seymour stepsister,alleged that seymour had forced himself on her while she was talking with him in her bedroom in september of.according to,seymour inserted his finger in my vagina,and the experience was painful.reported the incident to the hannahville police,but did not pursue charges against seymour.
the district court admitted the testimony of and under rule of the federal rules of evidence because the court found that the alleged prior sexual assaults occurred close enough in time to the charged sexual assaults and with enough frequency to be sufficiently probative.both before testimony and again after closing arguments,however,the court instructed the jury that evidence of the uncharged acts was not sufficient in and of itself to prove seymour guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes charged in the indictment.
at the close of the government case,seymour moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on both counts,alleging that the government had failed to show that a crime had been committed against either or.he also moved to dismiss count i on the ground that the government had failed to prove penetration,one of the elements of the charge.the court denied both motions.seymour then introduced several witnesses who testified that the children in his extended family enjoyed playing with and being by seymour.mark seymour,another of defendant brothers,testified that seymour and spent social time together after the alleged rape,and that mark had observed them flirting and sitting on each other lap.according to mark,never seemed afraid of seymour,and the two enjoyed joking around together.
jenny little also testified on seymour behalf.she told the jury that she had seen and seymour kissing and touching each other around the time of the alleged rape of little described finding seymour and in bed together during a party,laughing and giggling.seymour was not permitted,however,to present the testimony of david joslin,who had provided a written statement attesting that he had seen and seymour acting romantically on a night two years after the alleged rape had occurred.the district court excluded joslin testimony pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of evidence,based on the government argument that the evidence was an improper attack on character for truthfulness.
after seymour presented his case,he renewed his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.he also renewed his motion to dismiss count i,arguing,as before,that there was no evidence that he had penetrated.the district court again denied the motions,and the jury convicted seymour on both counts as alleged in the indictment.seymour was sentenced to two concurrent terms of months imprisonment,a sentence at the upper end of the applicable range under the united states sentencing guidelines.acknowledging that it must consider both the guidelines and the factors enumerated in a,the district court based its sentence on seymour lengthy criminal record,proof from this case that the defendant had several other victims of this type of conduct,the need to afford adequate deterrence to this kind of criminal conduct,and the need to reflect the seriousness of these two offenses for which the defendant has been convicted.but the court denied the government request for an order of restitution,which would have compensated the victims for their losses,because the presentence report psr did not detail any costs incurred for medical or psychological examinations.seymour timely appealed his convictions and sentence.
ii.analysis 
admission of the uncharged prior sexual assaults to prove count i 
in regard to count i,seymour challenges the admission of the alleged,uncharged prior sexual assaults against the adult females and on two alternate grounds.he first argues that,when a defendant is on trial for child molestation,rule of the federal rules of evidence limits the admission of evidence of prior sexual offenses to those against other children.seymour contends that rule is the exclusive rule governing cases,and not the more general rule.he therefore argues that the jury should have considered the testimony of and only with respect to count ii,the charge,and that a limiting instruction should have been provided to this effect.
alternatively,seymour contends that evidence admitted under either rule must be subjected to the balancing test in rule.see,united states benais,cir we have stated that evidence found admissible under rule or its close analog,rule evidence of similar crimes in child molestation cases,may still be subject to exclusion under rule if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.seeley chase,cir a court must apply rule to evidence submitted under rule or rule united states crawford,cir applying rule to evidence submitted under rule united states lemay,cir same united states lawrence,wl,at cir.july,unpublished applying rule to evidence submitted under rule.seymour argues that the district court erred when it determined that the testimony of prior uncharged sexual assaults against adults was not unduly prejudicial with respect to the charge.such evidence could not fail to reverberate in the minds of the jury,according to seymour,and thus no jury instruction could neutralize the prejudicial effect of its admission.
standard of review 
seymour did not raise below his present contention that the evidence of prior sexual assaults against adult victims and was inadmissible under rule to prove count i,the charge.instead,he argued that the testimony of and would unfairly prejudice him and confuse the jury under rule.if a defendant does not state the specific ground for his evidentiary objection,and that ground is not apparent from the context,we review a newly raised objection under the standard.see united states haywood,cir holding that an objecting party is required to state the specific ground of objection only if the ground was not apparent from the context quotation marks and citation omitted.
the objection that seymour now presents on appeal was not apparent from the context of the case or from the statements made below relating to this evidence.even though the government stated in its motion in limine that seymour will undoubtedly argue that sexual assault of an adult is different than child sexual abuse,he never made this argument to the district court when objecting to the admission of and testimony.we therefore review his present objection under the standard.
the inquiry involves the following process under rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure 
first,we are to consider whether an error occurred in the district court.absent any error,our inquiry is at an end.however,if an error occurred,we then consider if the error was plain.if it is,then we proceed to inquire whether the plain error affects substantial rights.finally,even if all three factors exist,we must then consider whether to exercise our discretionary power under rule b,or in other words,we must decide whether the plain error affecting substantial rights seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

the question of whether the district court erred in allowing and testimony as relevant evidence regarding the sexual assault against,a minor,turns on a proper interpretation of the interaction among rules,and of the federal rules of evidence.rules and,enacted in,were designed to protect the public from crimes of sexual violence by permitting in sexual assault and child molestation cases evidence that the defendant has committed offenses of the same type on other occasions.cong.rec,daily ed,statement of molinari.as such,they create an exception to the general ban on propensity evidence contained in rule b.see id.the new rules will supersede in sex offense cases the restrictive aspects of federal rule of evidence b and authorize admission and consideration of evidence of an uncharged offense for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.quotation marks omitted.
rule provides that i n a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault,evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible,and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.a.sexual assault is defined in rule d as any conduct proscribed by chapter of title,united states code,which includes offenses against both adults and minors.rule,standing alone,is thus broad enough to permit evidence of prior sexual offenses against adults in a case of child molestation.
seymour argues on appeal,however,that rule rule the admissibility of the evidence in question to prove the charge in count i because rule is more specifically applicable to sexual assaults against minors.rule provides that i n a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of child molestation,evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of child molestation is admissible,and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.a.child molestation includes both conduct proscribed in chapter of title,if committed against a child,and offenses involving child pornography.rule eliminates the rule requirement that the alleged sexual contact have occurred without consent.compare.d with.d.but both rule and rule contain a clause stating that t his rule shall not be construed to limit the admission or consideration of evidence under any other rule.c,c.we thus find no incompatibility between the two rules.
rule,which balances the probative value of relevant evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,applies to evidence that would be otherwise admissible under either rule.the district court in this case properly conducted a rule analysis of the testimony regarding the alleged uncharged sexual assaults against and in relation to the charge.was only seven years old at the time of the alleged assault,and thus the testimony of the adults and was less probative as propensity evidence with respect to count i.but the testimony of and was markedly similar to the claims of and,and this similarity enhances its probative value.see johnson elk lake sch,cir holding that where the past act is demonstrated with specificity and is substantially simila
