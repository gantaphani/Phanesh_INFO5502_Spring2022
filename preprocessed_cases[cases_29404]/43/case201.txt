this appeal analyzes whether the bureau of indian affairs bia acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it concluded that,according to tribal law,it had no authority to intervene in a tribal membership dispute,in which more than people were disenrolled from the pala band of mission indians pala band or band.we conclude that it did not,and affirm the decision of the district court.
facts and procedural background 
the pala band is a indian tribe located in northern san diego county.the secretary of the interior created the pala reservation in the late nineteenth century,pursuant to the mission indian relief act of.see escondido mut.water fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir,rev in part on other grounds by escondido mut.water la jolla band of mission indians.
in,congress passed the indian reorganization act ira.indian reorganization act,ch,stat.codified as amended at.the ira granted each indian tribe the right to organize for its common welfare,and adopt an appropriate constitution and bylaws,to be approved by the secretary of the interior.a.by its terms,the ira does not apply to reservations wherein a majority of the adult indians,voting at a special election duly called by the secretary of the interior,shall vote against its application.id.the secretary of the interior was directed to call such an election within one year after june.id.the secretary called such an election,and the pala band voted against adopting the ira on december.theodore haas,ten years of tribal government under,indian serv.
articles of association 
notwithstanding its decision to vote against the ira in,the pala band chose to organize its government.in,it adopted articles of association as the band governing document.the articles created an executive committee,comprised of six elected officers,and a general council,which included all adult members of the tribe.the articles granted the general council the power t o enact ordinances governing future membership,loss of membership and adoption of members into the band.
shortly thereafter,the general council enacted a membership ordinance the ordinance,pursuant to the authority granted to it in the articles.under the ordinance,a person seeking membership in the band would apply to the executive committee,which would make a report and recommendation to the regional director of the bia.if the band recommended denying the application,the applicant could appeal to the regional director,who would then make a recommendation,and send a report to the commissioner of the bia.if the commissioner was satisfied that the applicant met the enrollment criteria,he was to notify the appellant in writing and the executive committee shall enter the applicant name on the membership roll.in other words,pursuant to the articles of association and the ordinance,the executive committee made recommendations,but the bia was granted ultimate authority over whether an applicant was enrolled.
plaintiffs are descendants of margarita britten margarita,a pala indian who was born in.their eligibility to be enrolled as members of the pala band depends on whether margarita was a full or pala indian margarita was originally considered to be pala indian,and thus her did not have the minimum blood quantum to be eligible for membership in the band.
the first eligibility dispute regarding margarita descendants proceeded pursuant to the ordinance.in,the general council concluded that the evidence suggesting that margarita was actually a pala indian was more accurate,and voted to change her status accordingly.the general council recommendation was sent to a bia regional director,tom dowell,who recommended against enrolling her descendants because there was insufficient evidence to establish margarita blood quantum.director dowell decision was appealed to the assistant affairs in,who reversed that finding and concluded that margarita should be considered a pala indian.pursuant to the ordinance,the executive committee was then compelled to add margarita,with the requisite blood quantum,to the band membership rolls.
ii.pala constitution 
on november,the pala band held a general election in which the tribe voted to adopt a new constitution to supplant the articles of association.the pala band submitted the constitution to the bia for approval in march.the most relevant change was that the executive committee not the general council would have authority to amend replace its existing enrollment ordinance with an ordinance governing adoption,loss of membership,disenrollment,and future membership.the agency recommended some changes,and the final version of the constitution was completed in.the constitution provided that it would become effective immediately after its approval by a majority vote of the voters voting in a elections sic at which this constitution is approved by the bureau of indian affairs.
on november,at a special meeting,with a quorum of the general council present,the council passed resolution to adopt the pala tribal constitution to supersede the articles of association.the resolution noted in a preambulatory clause that on november,the tribe had voted to revise the pala tribal articles of association into the pala tribal constitution,suggesting that the vote in was sufficient to approve the new constitution.
the band submitted the constitution to the regional director of the bia,who recommended further changes in a letter,the regional director noted that b ased on a recent opinion by the regional solicitor of a tribe document,it was determined that bureau review and approval was not required.she also noted that the pala general council had already adopted the constitution by resolution dated,suggesting that in the bia estimation,resolution was sufficient to adopt the constitution.nonetheless,the regional director wrote that if the band decided to incorporate the bia recommendations and changes,the bia would approve it retroactive to the date of resolution.the chairman of the executive committee responded that the band did not want to incorporate the bia suggestions,but would like to have the constitution immediately approved nonetheless.on july,the bia issued a certificate of approval stating that the constitution of the pala band of mission indians is hereby approved retroactive to the date of adoption on november.
there is some dispute concerning whether the general tribal membership had notice that the constitution was the new governing document of the tribe.the pala band appears to have been less than meticulous in using the correct terminology to refer to the governing documents for example,the band website in stated that it was organized under articles of association.however,the facts indicate that in the years following resolution,the tribal membership was at least on constructive notice that the constitution had been adopted.
as an initial matter,resolution was voted on during a meeting of the general council,at which a quorum was present.every adult member of the tribe is a member of the general council it is comprised of the same group of people that would have been eligible to vote on the constitution in a more formalized election.the meeting was announced prior to its occurrence.minutes were taken of that meeting,and plaintiffs do not allege that they were unable to access records of the meeting,resolution,or the constitution.
additionally,subsequent references and amendments to the constitution indicate that the general membership was on notice of the constitution.in another general council meeting on june,a member offered a motion that at eighteen you get a copy of the tribal constitution.the general council voted in favor of the motion,and the minutes reflect action instructions to send a copy to all tribal members eighteen and over.
in a meeting on july,the general council meeting minutes reflect that motions were passed by the general council to put constitutional amendments on the ballot.those amendments included changes to the term limits,qualifications,and residency requirements for members of the executive committee.the minutes reflect that in an election,the band had voted to adopt those amendments to the pala constitution.
iii.the ordinance 
pursuant to its authority under the constitution,the executive committee adopted a new enrollment ordinance in the ordinance to replace the ordinance.its prefatory language stated that the committee did not intend to alter or change the membership status of individuals whose membership has already been approved and who are currently listed on the membership roll of the pala band.nevertheless,the operative language of the ordinance gave the executive committee the power to reevaluate an applicant based on misrepresented or omitted facts that might have made ineligible for enrollment,and remove such members from the rolls.a person who has received an adverse decision from the executive committee may appeal to the regional director,who is tasked with reviewing the decision and making a recommendation to the executive committee.after receiving the recommendation,the executive committee shall meet and consider that recommendation and make a final decision on the appeal of the decision.the decision of the executive committee shall be final.thus,the ordinance gave the executive committee ultimate authority over enrollment decisions,and relegated the bia to an advisory role.
iv.plaintiffs disenrollment 
in june,the executive committee revisited the enrollments of eight of margarita at the request of pala tribal members,invoking its authority pursuant to the ordinance.it concluded that those eight descendants should be disenrolled,citing the recommendation of former regional director dowell,who concluded that there was insufficient evidence to declare margarita a pala indian.shortly thereafter,the executive committee sent similar disenrollment notices to of margarita descendants.the notices stated that an appeal could be filed with the regional director.
the first eight members to be disenrolled appealed to the regional director,who recommended that the band reverse its decision.however,the regional director noted that she only had advisory authority under the ordinance.a few months later,the regional director made a substantively identical recommendation with regard to the remaining individuals who had been disenrolled.the executive committee did not follow the regional director recommendations to margarita descendants.
the assistant secretary indian affairs affirmed,concluding that applicable tribal law established a limited role for the regional director to make recommendations on tribal action on enrollment appeals,but the law reserves ultimate authority with the band.in reaching this conclusion,the rejected plaintiffs arguments that the constitution,which provided the basis for the ordinance granting enrollment authority to the executive committee,was void.he concluded that any challenge to the agency approval of the constitution was,since more than six years had passed since the bia approval of it in.the also determined that even if a challenge was not,the agency was nevertheless correct when it chose to tread lightly and not overly scrutinize the procedures used by the tribe to ratify the constitution in order to avoid unnecessary intrusion in tribal.the accepted the band position that resolution,adopted at a general council meeting with a quorum present,was a sufficient election to adopt the constitution.in the alternative,the concluded that the general election in november,when the tribe approved the adoption of a constitution,was sufficient to make the constitution the valid governing document of the tribe.
because he had concluded that the constitution was valid,the did not reach the merits of plaintiffs claim that the executive committee wrongly disenrolled them.the affirmed the regional director reasoning that under the ordinance,the bia did not have authority to compel the executive committee to change its decision.finally,the declined to add two minor children to the agency appeal,because they had not sought relief from the regional director,and therefore their claims were not within the scope of the issues pending in the agency appeal.
of the disenrolled members then commenced a declaratory relief action in district court against the secretary of the interior,the,the regional director,and other federal officials.they invoked a,alleging that the decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants,holding that the agency did not act arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to any of its decisions.plaintiffs then filed this timely appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.chemeheuvi indian tribe jewell,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citing fed.civ.a.
the propriety of the bia approach hinges on whether the articles of association and the ordinance continue to govern the band and its membership disputes.if they do,the bia has the authority to make final decisions with regard to enrollment in the band.on the other hand,if those documents were supplanted by the constitution and ordinance,the bia only has an advisory role and can not compel the executive committee to plaintiffs.
in this appeal,plaintiffs argue that the bia conclusion that the constitution and ordinance were the governing law to be applied was arbitrary and capricious that the federal government general trust responsibility toward native americans requires the bia to take action to protect plaintiffs and their membership rights and that the decision by the,which ruled that margarita was a pala indian,has binding and preclusive effect on the band.they also challenge the decision not to join the two minors in the agency appeal.
in response,defendants argue that we are without jurisdiction to review the decision at all,because tribal disputes are generally beyond federal adjudication,and because any decision made by the was committed to agency discretion by law.they also defend the decision regarding the applicability of the constitution on the merits.
we consider the contentions of the parties in turn.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
defendants contend that we do not have jurisdiction to review this case because federal courts can not adjudicate tribal membership decisions,and in the alternative,because the decision was committed to agency discretion by law.we find neither argument meritorious.
tribal membership disputes 
tribal enrollment decisions are generally beyond the power of federal courts to review.a tribe right to define its own membership for tribal purposes has long been recognized as central to its existence as an independent political community.santa clara pueblo martinez.tribes are immune from federal court jurisdiction in disputes regarding challenges to membership in the tribe,and may not be sued for a reversal of an intratribal membership enrollment decision.lewis norton,cir.
nor may a plaintiff make an end run around tribal sovereign immunity by simply naming a federal agency in a lawsuit instead of a tribe.id.at.in lewis,after a tribe denied the plaintiffs application for enrollment,the plaintiffs immediately filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the bia in the district court.id.at.that action sought an order instructing the bia to compel the tribe to enroll the plaintiffs.id.the plaintiffs had not sought any relief from the bia before filing suit.see id.at.the court held that this was a transparent effort to do an end run around sovereign immunity,and again held that federal courts have no jurisdictional basis to directly review a tribe enrollment decisions.id.
a different scenario arises when a suit is not a direct challenge to a tribe enrollment decision,but is instead a challenge to agency action under the administrative procedures act apa.when a plaintiff has previously sought relief from the bia,federal jurisdiction is proper to the extent that the plaintiff seeks review of the agency decision under the apa arbitrary and capricious standard.alto black,cir.
a factual pattern similar to the one before us here arose in cahto tribe of laytonville rancheria dutschke,cir.the cahto tribe general council voted to disenroll tribal members.id.at.one of the disenrolled members appealed to the regional director,who directed the tribe to place the disenrolled members back on the membership roll.id.at.as in this case,the merits of cahto tribe focused upon whether the tribe governing documents authorized the bia to compel the tribe to the plaintiffs.id.at.on appeal,we held that the federal courts had jurisdiction to review the bia decision,including the question of whether the bia had jurisdiction under tribal law to review the disenrollment decisions.id.in alto,we made explicit what was implicit in cahto tribe that the propriety of agency action is a federal question over which we have jurisdiction,even where the agency applied tribal law in the context of a membership dispute.at.
application of the apa 
f inal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court is subject to judicial review.judicial review under the apa is not proper,however,if the agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.the apa creates a strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action.bowen.acad.of family physicians.the question is whether the decision is a final agency action,and whether that agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.
final agency action 
the did not take affirmative action to compel the band to plaintiffs instead,it declined to intervene on behalf of plaintiffs in the enrollment dispute.defendants contend that because the failed to act in the plaintiffs interest,its decision does not constitute final agency action from which legal consequences will flow.this is incorrect.under the apa,we have jurisdiction to review more than just affirmative agency action.agency action in the statute includes the whole or part of an agency rule,order,license,sanction,relief,or the equivalent or denial thereof,or failure to act.see b referring to section for the definition of agency action.the bia denial of relief to plaintiffs,and its failure to act on their behalf,is a final agency action subject to judicial review.
committed to agency discretion by law 
judicial review of a final agency action is not proper if the agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a heckler chaney,b efore any review at all may be had,a party must first clear the hurdle of a.the supreme court has cautioned that this exception is very narrow,and is applicable only where statutes are drawn so broadly that there is no law to apply.moapa band of paiute indians dep t of interior,cir.quoting citizens to preserve overton park volpe.preclusion of judicial review is not lightly inferred,and usually will not be found absent a clear command of the statute.id.citing barlow collins.
at oral argument,defendants contended that the reason there is no law to apply is because the ira,with its prescribed procedures for enacting tribal governing documents,does not apply to the pala band.instead,the asia acted according to the agency general powers over indian affairs.the bia enabling statute gives the commissioner of indian affairs under the direction of the secretary of the interior the management of all indian affairs and of all matters arising out of indian relations.thus,defendants contend that because the enabling statute is so general,there is no law to apply and their actions are committed to agency discretion by law.
we agree that the ira does not apply to the pala band and thus,to the extent plaintiffs rely upon language from that statute to support their position,they are in error.however,we disagree that the enabling power in is so broad and so unmoored from any legal standards that the bia discretion under that section is unreviewable.
application of the ira 
in the early twentieth century,the federal government policy toward native american tribes encouraged individual land ownership and assimilation of native americans into general american society.see bugenig hoopa valley tribe,cir.en banc.that approach was unsuccessful,and congress changed its policy to instead promote tribal sovereignty and,principally through the passage of the ira.id.
plaintiffs draw upon the ira because it includes procedures for tribes to adopt governing documents,and for the secretary of the interior to approve them see.a tribe may adopt a constitution at a special election authorized and called by the secretary,according to rules promulgated by the agency.a.if it does so,the secretary shall approve the constitution unless she finds that it is contrary to applicable laws.id.d.a tribe also retain s inherent sovereign power to adopt governing documents under procedures other than those specified by the agency.id.h.tribes that adopt constitutions pursuant to other procedures are not guaranteed approval by the secretary,but the secretary has discretion to approve them nonetheless.see cal.valley miwok tribe united states,cir.the secretary properly exercises discretion not to approve a governing document when it does not reflect the involvement of the whole tribal community.id.
however,the ira,including the provision requiring secretarial approval of organizational documents,does not automatically apply to all tribes.by its terms,it does not apply to reservations wherein a majority of the adult indians,voting at a special election duly called by the secretary of the interior,shall vote against its application.the parties do not dispute that when the pala band held such an election in,it voted against becoming an ira tribe.
as noted,the pala band adopted governing documents in,and worked with the bia to approve them.however,such actions do not make the ira applicable to the band.in united states anderson,cir,a member of the fort peck tribes argued that a provision of the ira supported his position on a taxation issue.we rejected his argument on the ground that the ira does not apply to the fort peck tribes because they voted against the act.id.at.although they later chose to adopt a tribal constitution and have since behaved and been treated by interior exactly as if they were ira tribes,the language of the ira does not disappear from our view simply because the interior chooses to wink.id.we noted that if the fort peck tribes wish to be relieved from the effects of their negative vote,they must seek such relief from congress.id.like the fort peck tribes,the pala band appears to have been treated as if it was an ira tribe for much of its history.however,the fact remains that the band is not an ira tribe,and the ira,including any procedural protections for the adoption of governing documents,does not apply.
general enforcement power 
instead of acting pursuant to the ira,the bia acted under its broad powers over indian affairs articulated in.the commissioner of indian affairs shall,under the direction of the secretary of the interior have the management of all indian affairs and of all matters arising out of indian relations.defendants argue that in choosing to respect the constitution,the agency was making an executive,decision of one sovereign government recognizing another.thus,they contend that their decision was committed to agency discretion by law because there is no law to apply.
defendants are correct that no specific federal law governed when reviewing the executive committee decision.nevertheless,the agency did review and apply tribal law.the regional director letter concluded that the ordinance does provide authority to the bureau of indian affairs to review and make a recommendation on enrollment appeals to the executive committee and does not provide the bureau of indian affairs the authority to decide enrollment appeals.the made a threshold decision that the constitution and therefore the ordinance were legitimate,but that too was based on an examination of tribal law.he noted that the constitution must be approved at a election,and analyzed whether a meeting of the general council was a sufficient election according to the articles of association,the constitution,and the band practice.
in alto,we held that the bia decision on an enrollment issue is not committed to agency discretion by law
