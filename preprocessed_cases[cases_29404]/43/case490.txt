background 
on appeal of the grant of a motion for summary judgment,we affirm unless the appellant points to evidence in the record establishing a genuine issue of material fact.c.we review the evidence,however,in the light most favorable to the appellant.simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.
petersen was an employee of the udoc at the central utah correctional facility cucf from september until november.during that time she advanced in rank,eventually becoming a lieutenant in.in february she became the program coordinator at the cucf,the position she held during all the events material to this appeal.as program coordinator,petersen was responsible for organizing prison events.she supervised many cucf employees,including james mooney,a native american who served as the native american career rehabilitative specialist.
petersen immediate supervisor was captain craig burr,who reported to greg jacquart.this trio worked on the staff of defendant robert tansy,deputy warden over the housing and programming department.the warden was defendant fred vanderveur the udoc director was defendant terry bartlett.
the chief malefactor in petersen account is tansy.according to her,tansy employed an abrasive and authoritarian management style and inspired fear in his subordinates.his communications with other employees frequently involved profanity and,more significantly for our case,racial epithets.he used the term lazy indian,and,when speaking of mooney,asked whether the natives were restless and then let out war whoops when petersen did not respond.
petersen alleges that her opposition to racial and religious discrimination against mooney led to retaliation by the defendants.the precipitating event,according to petersen,was a meeting in tansy office on march.tansy told burr and petersen that mooney,a probationary employee,was due for a midterm evaluation.petersen questioned the necessity of the evaluation,as she was unaware of mooney probationary status.but tansy insisted that mooney was on probationary status and,unlike career employees who received only an annual review,mooney needed the midterm evaluation.tansy instructed burr and petersen to review mooney personnel file and consider it when filling out the evaluation papers.
once she and burr left tansy presence,petersen again began to question the propriety of the evaluation.she no longer voiced concerns about the timing of the evaluation,but instead took issue with being told to review the personnel file.she told burr that she thought employee evaluations were supposed to be based on the supervisor individual recollection and impressions of the employee work performance,and not on what was in a file.accordingly,petersen never looked at the contents of the file.she did,however,sit down with burr that afternoon for nearly an hour and a half to discuss mooney evaluation while burr read aloud discipline reports from the personnel file.when burr called on petersen the next day to help him finish mooney evaluation,she refused,telling him only that she could not take part in something so wrong treacherous and deceitful.
shortly thereafter,petersen ran into lynn vanderveur,the wife of warden vanderveur.seeing that petersen was upset,vanderveur asked what was wrong.petersen just broke down and told her that she thought tansy was engineering a failing report for mooney.petersen mentioned nothing about racial or religious discrimination.
petersen later learned that vanderveur had spoken of petersen concerns with her husband,who had then talked with tansy.on march,believing that vanderveur talk with tansy might make tansy upset with her,petersen went to tansy office to smooth things over.but when she explained that she thought it improper for a supervisor to direct the outcome of an employee evaluation,tansy launched into a tirade,calling petersen a liar and telling her that her days are numbered.he also threatened to take her out of the information loop with respect to all aspects of her job.during the meeting petersen never expressed concern that tansy might be discriminating against mooney based on his race or religion.
petersen testified that almost immediately after her meeting with tansy,her superiors took her out of the information loop she further testified that burr and jacquart later informed her that tansy had told them to do just that.yet she provided only one example of being denied information she testified that she was not told of a may,banquet until the day before the event.
on may,petersen made her first accusations of religious and racial discrimination by tansy.mooney had been terminated on april and had filed for unemployment benefits.in connection with the unemployment compensation claim,a udoc attorney called petersen,seeking her testimony regarding the circumstances of mooney dismissal.petersen refused to provide any information,stating that,if i tell you why mooney was fired,i will surely lose my job because i know why he was fired and i do want to go there.when the conversation ended,petersen called warden vanderveur.she told him that she ca go there and expressed a concern that if she testified,she would get in even more hot water.she also said,and now you want me to go up against another state entity and tell them that the reason this man is fired is because my deputy warden did like him and he did like to have to deal with native americans so that he had him fired and he did bring his boat back.the mention of the boat was a reference to an episode in which mooney had offered to pick up tansy boat for him in texas but did not follow through.vanderveur told her that she should settle down and that an assistant to udoc director bartlett would be contacting her to make arrangements for her testimony in a telephone hearing the following monday.
for the remainder of the work day petersen evaded bartlett assistant.after work she attended the cucf volunteer banquet.at the event bartlett found petersen and asked why she was refusing to talk to the udoc attorney.she told him that she worried about the security of her job if tansy were to discover that she spoke out against him.she also told bartlett that she thought tansy might be upset if he found out about their conversation.she mentioned her observations of racist behavior by tansy and said tansy made fun of native americans and was discriminatory towards mooney.in response,bartlett assured her that he would not allow any retaliation and told her to contact him directly if she ever experienced retaliation.
within the next few days petersen had a telephone conversation with warden vanderveur.petersen again described tansy behavior in performing war whoops,stating that all indians are lazy,and asking are the natives restless tonight petersen also said that she felt tansy had been deceitful doing his stuff behind mooney back,not being open,how he had i was supposed to create or finish,finalize this evaluation with information i had no knowledge of.vanderveur agreed that mooney had been railroaded.
on june,petersen was informed that she was going to receive a lateral transfer.she complained to bartlett office,expressing her opinion that the transfer was retaliation by tansy.bartlett was not in the office,but his assistant noted that tansy had not obtained the proper signatures to authorize the transfer.petersen was not transferred.
at the end of june an assistant to bartlett requested petersen to submit a written memorandum specifying all her complaints regarding tansy behavior.her response was more than six pages long.on the fourth page it states tansy spoke of mooney in a demeaning way.he made digs at the native american beliefs and ways.otherwise,it contains no language indicating concern about racial or religious discrimination.the focus of the memorandum is tansy alleged,obscene,and offensive management style,and petersen fear that her act of complaining to one of tansy superiors would bring his wrath upon her,threatening her job in the same way it threatened mooney.
after receiving the memo,bartlett ordered an investigation of petersen allegations.although petersen asserts that the investigation was conducted as an investigation of sexual harassment in order to discredit her,she provides no evidence of any negative consequences to her arising from the investigation.the investigation report was submitted to bartlett on august.it concluded that tansy,while a strict supervisor,was not in violation of any udoc harassment policy guidelines or rules.upon completion of the investigation,petersen was removed from tansy chain of command,eliminating his supervisory authority over her.during the latter half of and much of,tansy missed a substantial amount of work due to illness.
in january petersen applied for one of three openings for the rank of captain.of applicants,petersen was one of interviewed and tested.her score for the written exam and interview totaled,ranking her seventh among the candidates.when the final selection was made in june,the three with the highest,and the promotions.the record contains no evidence describing the udoc promotion procedures.when asked about her knowledge of such procedures,petersen testified,i do know.
meanwhile,petersen and mooney had filed this action on may.then,on november,petersen resigned her position at the cucf.she moved to oregon to join her husband,who already resided there.on september,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to petersen claims but denied the motion with respect to some of mooney claims.mooney claims were then settled,while petersen appealed.
ii.title vii claim 
petersen brings her claim against the udoc under a,which states 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment,for an employment agency,or joint committee controlling apprenticeship or other training or retraining,including training programs,to discriminate against any individual,or for a labor organization to discriminate against any member thereof or applicant for membership,because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter title vii,or because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this subchapter.
emphasis added.we have recognized the following three elements for such a retaliation claim the plaintiff engaged in protected opposition to discrimination the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action and there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.ferguson constr,cir.
the heart of petersen claim is tansy alleged retaliation after she refused to cooperate on the evaluation of mooney and tansy learned that she had complained to warden vanderveur wife about his treatment of mooney.what makes this retaliation claim problematic is that on neither occasion did petersen mention racial or religious discrimination by tansy.we must therefore consider whether the absence of a reference to unlawful discrimination precludes petersen retaliation claim.for the following reasons,we conclude that the absence of such a reference can preclude a retaliation claim because an employer can not engage in unlawful retaliation if it does not know that the employee has opposed or is opposing a violation of title vii.
opposition to an employer conduct is protected by a only if it is opposition to a practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.title vii does not prohibit all distasteful practices by employers.tansy could be unconscionably rude and unfair to mooney without violating title vii.in this case tansy treatment of mooney would constitute an unlawful employment practice under title vii only if tansy had the requisite is,only if tansy mistreated mooney because of mooney race or religion.accordingly,petersen opposition to tansy treatment of mooney would be protected opposition only if her opposition were based on tansy unlawful intent.to oppose plain vanilla rude and unfair conduct by tansy is not to oppose conduct made an unlawful practice by title vii.we should note,however,that petersen opposition could be protected even if she were wrong about whether tansy had in fact engaged in a violation of title vii it would be enough if she had a good faith belief that title vii ha d been violated.love of,cir.
it therefore follows that petersen superiors could not know that she was engaging in protected opposition unless they knew that her opposition was based at least in part on tansy bigoted motives.if,for all they knew,petersen was opposing tansy treatment of mooney simply because the treatment violated established practices and was unfair to mooney,they would not know that petersen was oppos ing a practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.
it is crucial,however,whether petersen superiors knew that she was engaging in protected opposition.section a bars retaliation by an employer only if it is because the employee has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.an employer action against an employee can not be because of that employee protected opposition unless the employer knows the employee has engaged in protected opposition.see williams rice,cir plaintiff must show that the individual who took adverse action against him knew of the employee protected activity gallagher kleinwort benson gov t,complaint of unequal pay did not suggest gender discrimination.as a result,retaliation against petersen would be prohibited by a only if the superior retaliating against her knew that her opposition to tansy treatment of mooney was motivated by a belief that he was engaging in racial or religious discrimination.
we believe that this result is compelled not only by the natural reading of the statutory language,but also by the purpose of the provision.the purpose of a is to let employees feel free to express condemnation of discrimination that violates title vii.that purpose is hardly served by imposing sanctions upon employers who take action against employees who never communicate their concern about unlawful discrimination.
we can now readily dispose of petersen title vii retaliation claim.to overcome the udoc motion for summary judgment,petersen needed to produce evidence that both the udoc took adverse employment action against her and the motive for the adverse action was her opposition to tansy racial or religious discrimination against mooney.she failed to meet her burden.
to begin with motive,petersen testified that on march,tansy called her a liar,announced that her days are numbered,and threatened to take her out of the information loop.at that time,however,petersen had not communicated to anyone her belief that tansy had discriminated against mooney on racial or religious grounds.tansy was expressing his anger at petersen for complaining of his treatment of mooney,but her complaint was not,as far as he knew,protected action under title vii.thus,his retaliation would not violate a.
to establish a title vii retaliation claim,petersen would need to prove that when tansy allegedly followed through on his threats against petersen,he not only had this lawful retaliatory motive but was additionally motivated by his learning later that petersen had complained of his discrimination against mooney on religious or racial grounds.see hawkins pepsico,cir plaintiff produced no evidence to show that disparate treatment by supervisor was due to race rather than supervisor admittedly low regard for plaintiff job performance.but petersen presented the district court with absolutely no evidence of such an additional motive.nor is there evidence that any of petersen other superiors ha
