discussion 
our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the board is limited.we must affirm the decision unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.delong challenges the board interpretation of.her challenge raises a question of law,which we review de novo.see nebblett office of pers.
delong argues that the board interpretation of is unconstitutional because it denies her the due process protections guaranteed by the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.specifically,she contends that the board interpretation violates her substantive due process rights by creating an impermissible irrebuttable presumption that she is unfit for continued employment because of her past conviction.delong argues that the board erred in interpreting as applying to current employees whose criminal conduct occurred prior to the effective date of the act because the statute does not contain clear language demonstrating that congress intended the act to have retroactive effect.she also argues that the statute should be interpreted as requiring hhs to conduct an individualized hearing to consider mitigating circumstances when a current employee is found to violate the minimum standards of character in the act.
in response,hhs argues that the board interpretation of accords with the plain language of the act.hhs asserts that the statute itself requires it to investigate the character of current employees and to ensure that all employees in covered positions meet the minimum standards of character.with respect to delong substantive due process argument,hhs argues that the act minimum standards of character bear a rational relationship to a legitimate government indian children from abuse by federal employees.therefore,hhs contends,the act does not violate delong substantive due process rights.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with hhs that the plain language of requires that the agency apply the act minimum standards of character to current employees and that the agency remove from positions covered by the act any employees who fail to meet those standards.we also agree with hhs that this interpretation of does not render the act unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fifth amend
