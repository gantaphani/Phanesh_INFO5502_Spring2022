george akootchook,mary akootchook,daniel akootchook,sergie alexanderoff,and adeline jim as heir of george jim,are five native alaskans who challenge the department of interior decision denying their applications for land allotments under the alaska native allotment act.the department concluded that the claims to allotments were not valid because,prior to withdrawal of the land from the public domain,the individuals did not use the land independent of their families.for the reasons stated,we affirm the district court dismissal of the action.
facts and procedural history 
the general allotment act provided indians not residing on a reservation with the opportunity to apply for a allotment on unsurveyed and otherwise unappropriated land of the united states.in,congress passed the alaska native allotment act anaa to clarify the rights of indians and eskimos to apply for allotments of unappropriated,vacant,and unreserved nonmineral land in alaska.to be eligible,the applicants had to show substantially continuous use and occupancy of the land for a period of five years prior to the date the land was withdrawn from the public domain.the department regulations implementing the anaa provide 
the term substantially continuous use and occupancy contemplates the customary seasonality of use and occupancy by the applicant of any land used by him for his livelihood and and that of his family.such use and occupancy must be substantial actual possession and use of the land,at least potentially exclusive of others,and not merely intermittent use 
the alaska native claims settlement act repealed the anaa in,but preserved all applications for allotments pending before the department of the interior on december,
appellants applied for allotments under the anaa in the early.the department,through the interior board of land appeals ibla,denied the applications because appellants had not used the claimed land for a continuous period of five years prior to withdrawal of the land from the public domain.however,in,after the ibla had denied each appellant application,this court held,in pence kleppe that the ibla processes for reviewing applications did not meet due process requirements.pence held,as relevant here,that applicants are entitled to an opportunity for an oral hearing before a neutral prior to any decisions on their applications these hearings are known as pence hearings.in,the interior department changed its interpretation of anaa,requiring only that the qualifying use and occupancy of the land commence prior to withdrawal,rather than requiring five years of use prior to withdrawal 
because of pence,appellants were entitled to hearings on their reopened applications.but before these hearings occurred,two different groups of alaskan natives filed class action lawsuits in the district court.the first suit,shields united states asserted that the ibla refusal to approve applications for allotments in certain national forests when the applications relied on ancestral use prior to opposed to personal arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.the district court rejected the class claim and this court affirmed it is undisputed that george jim,was a member of the shields class.the second class action,akootchook united states,was initiated by george akootchook and three other applicants not involved in this appeal.they asserted that the ibla refusal to approve applications for allotments in certain wildlife refuges when the applications relied on ancestral use prior to opposed to personal also arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.the district court rejected the class claim,and this court affirmed it is undisputed that mary and daniel akootchook and sergie alexanderoff were members of the akootchook class.
between and,after the shields and akootchook decisions,appellants received their pence hearings.at their hearings,appellants time relying on the interior department,although their personal use and occupancy may not have extended five years before withdrawal,their personal use and occupancy commenced prior to the withdrawal of the lands that they sought.the ibla nonetheless denied all five applications,determining that,prior to the withdrawal of the lands in question,appellants had only used the lands as minors and under the control and supervision of their parents according to the ibla,appellants did not begin to use the lands as independent citizens in their own right until after the lands were withdrawn.because department decisions and policy required independent use of the land separate from any use as a minor when accompanying a parent or an elder,the appellants could not establish the required use.
appellants filed an action in district court,jointly challenging the denial of their applications.the district court did not reach the merits,but ruled that the present claims were barred by the res judicata effect of the earlier class action suits it reasoned that george jim,claim that his personal use and occupancy entitled him to an allotment could have been presented in the shields class action.similarly,the court held that the other appellants claims could have been presented in the akootchook class action.the district court then dismissed the claims with prejudice.we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal under.we affirm the district court dismissal of the action,although for different reasons.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment on res judicata grounds de novo in reviewing decisions of the ibla,we exercise a limited standard of review and will reverse only if the decision is arbitrary,capricious,not supported by substantial evidence,or contrary to law this court carefully search es the entire record to determine whether it contains such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and whether it demonstrates that the decision was based on a consideration of relevant factors.
discussion 
res judicata 
the united states argued in the district court,as it does here,that the res judicata effect of the shields and akootchook class actions bars appellants pursuit of this case.the united states contends that the class actions and the present case satisfy the three prerequisites for the application of claim preclusion as stated in frank united airlines,those prerequisites are an identity of claims in the two actions a final judgment on the merits in the first action and identity or privity between the parties in the two actions.because we do not believe that there are identical claims in the class actions and the present case,thereby not satisfying the first element of the frank analysis,we disagree with the district court res judicata finding.
the akootchook action was filed as a class action under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.that rule provides for class action adjudication if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.the class in akootchook consisted of native alaskans whose ancestors had used and occupied the lands in question for generations but who had been denied allotments because they could not establish personal use of the land before it was withdrawn their claim was that they were entitled to allotments because their ancestors had used and occupied the land prior to withdrawal of the land from the public domain 
the claim of appellants differs from that in akootchook because appellants are not asserting rights to allotments based on ancestral use of the land but rather on their own personal use of the land when they were children.the present claim could not fit under the rule b class action because very few of the class members personally used the lands before they were withdrawn relief for this claim would not be appropriate for the class as a whole the only claim common to the class was the ancestral use claim.thus,the only adverse governmental action common to the class as a whole was the denial of the ancestral use claim.litigation of appellants perso
