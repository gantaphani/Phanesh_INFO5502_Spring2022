at first glance,there appears to be something odd about a court of law in a diverse nation such as ours deciding whether a specific individual is or is not an indian.yet,given the long and complex relationship between the government of the united states and the sovereign tribal nations within its borders,the criminal jurisdiction of the federal government often turns on precisely this a particular individual counts as an it is this question that we address once again today.
as our court has noted before,the law governing t he exercise of criminal jurisdiction over indians and indian country encompasses a complex patchwork of federal,state,and tribal law,which is better explained by history than by logic.united states bruce,cir quoting duro reina,d.from that history,and from various cases we have decided over the years,our circuit has distilled a specific test for determining whether an individual can be prosecuted by the federal government under,a statute governing the conduct of indians in indian country.we announced that test in united states bruce,cir,a case that both parties agree controls our analysis today.because the evidence adduced during christopher cruz trial does not satisfy any of the four factors outlined in the second prong of the bruce test,we hold that,even when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,his conviction can not stand.the district court failure to grant cruz motion for judgment of acquittal was plain error,and accordingly we reverse.
cruz was born in to roger cruz and clara clarice bird.his father is hispanic and his mother is blackfeet indian and blood indian.the blackfeet are a federally recognized tribe based in northern montana the blood indians are a canadian tribe.given his parents heritage,cruz is blackfeet indian and blood indian.
for a period of three or four years during his childhood,cruz lived in the town of browning,montana on the blackfeet reservation.between the age of seven and eight,he moved off the reservation and spent the next ten years living first with his father in great falls,montana and subsequently with his uncle in delano,california.neither great falls nor delano is located on an indian reservation or otherwise located in indian country in,cruz returned to montana,living for a period of time in the town of cut bank,which is located just outside the boundaries of the blackfeet reservation.shortly before the incident underlying this case,cruz moved back to browning,where he rented a room at the town motel.
on december,cruz and a group of friends spent a part of the evening drinking in his room at the town motel.while standing outside the motel talking on a cordless phone to his girlfriend,cruz was approached by eudelma white grass,who had been drinking in a neighboring room and was heavily intoxicated.an altercation took place in which white grass was severely injured.
cruz was arrested and charged with a ssault resulting in serious bodily injury,a,which is a federal offense when committed by an indian on an indian reservation.he pled not guilty and went to trial,where his indian status was a contested issue.at the close of the government,cruz moved for judgment of acquittal,contending that the government failed to establish his indian status by proof beyond a reasonable doubt the district court denied the motion.cruz subsequently took the stand in his own defense and was ultimately convicted.he now appeals,arguing that there was insufficient evidence that he is an indian under and that the district court committed reversible error when instructing the jury as to how to determine his indian status.
the standard of review to be applied on appeal is contested by the parties.we begin by observing that,even though the question of indian status operates as a jurisdictional element under,bruce,at,de novo review is not appropriate given the posture of this case.although jurisdictional questions are ordinarily reviewed de novo,when a defendant brings a motion for acquittal in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a jurisdictional element,we owe deference to the jury ultimate factual finding see united states gomez,cir citing united states,cir.accordingly,if such a challenge is properly made,we review the district court decision under the standard applied to challenges whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis omitted see united states,cir see also united states morgan,cir noting applicability of this standard to jurisdictional elements.
here,however,cruz challenge made at the close of the prosecution was not preserved because no new challenge was made following submission of all of the evidence.the proper way to challenge the sufficiency of the government evidence pertaining to a jurisdictional element is a motion for acquittal under rule,presented at the close of the government.morgan,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states nukida,cir.but should such a motion be denied,it must be renewed following submission of all the evidence or it is deemed waived.united states,cir.cruz failed to renew his motion.as a result,the standard of review in this case rises to the at least theoretically more stringent plain error standard.id.at we say theoretically because,while review appears more stringent in theory,it is hard to comprehend how a standard can be any more stringent in actuality than that ordinarily applied to challenges.as we observed in 
u nder our ordinary standard applicable when the defendant makes all the proper can not reverse unless there is a clear showing as to insufficiency we must affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found the evidence sufficient.thus,it is difficult to imagine just what consequences flow from our application of the plain error standard or to envision a case in which the result would be different because of the application of one rather than the other of the standards.
at.our case law,however,has repeatedly parsed the increasingly thin differences between standards of review,slicing ever finer and finer distinctions whose practical consequences are seemingly minuscule,if not microscopic.as a result of these exercises in abstraction,our standards of review continue to multiply,the relationships between them growing more obscure with each iteration.still,because an existing decision of this court has clearly held that review applies when a jurisdictional element is the subject of an unrenewed motion for acquittal,we dutifully apply that standard in this case.see morgan,at see also united states singh,cir.
under review,reversal is permitted only when there is error that is plain,affects substantial rights,and seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d.when a conviction is predicated on insufficient evidence,the last two prongs of the olano test will necessarily be satisfied a defendant substantial rights,as well as the fairness and integrity of the courts,are seriously affected when someone is sent to jail for a crime that,as a matter of law,he did not commit,or when the court,as a matter of law,has no jurisdiction to try him for the alleged offense.see united states dominguez benitez,d quoting kotteakos united states.see also united states,cir noting that even under plain error review,a court should not affirm a conviction and send a defendant to prison or his death if the record clearly showed that the evidence was insufficient quoting,at united states mize,cir e rroneous instructions concerning the essential jurisdictional element of the crime charged affect substantial rights of the defendant.therefore,the analysis in this case turns primarily on the first two olano prongs was the denial of cruz motion for judgment of acquittal error,and was it plainly so because cruz elect ed to present evidence on his own behalf all the the evidence presented by the be considered in this analysis.united states alexander,cir.
a defendant indian status is an essential element of a offense which the government must allege in the indictment and prove beyond a reasonable doubt.bruce,at.we recently established the test for determining an individual indian status under in united states bruce,cir,and the same test applies to the determination of indian status under companion statute.the bruce test requires that the government prove two things that the defendant has a sufficient degree of indian blood,and has tribal or federal government recognition as an indian.id.at,quoting united states keys,cir.
cruz concedes that he meets the first prong of the test since his blood quotient is percent blackfeet.only the second prong,therefore,is at issue here.in bruce we outlined four factors that govern the second prong those four factors are,in declining order of importance,evidence of the following tribal enrollment government recognition formally and informally through receipt of assistance reserved only to indians enjoyment of the benefits of tribal affiliation and social recognition as an indian through residence on a reservation and participation in indian social life.id.at quoting united states lawrence,cir accord.united states ramirez,cir 
taken in the light most favorable to the government,the record reveals the following facts related to cruz indian status 
cruz is not an enrolled member of the blackfeet tribe of indians or any other tribe.
cruz has descendant status in the blackfeet tribe as the son of an enrolled member his mother,which entitles him to use indian health services,to receive some educational grants,and to fish and hunt on the reservation.
cruz has never taken advantage of any of the benefits or services to which he is entitled as a descendant.
cruz lived on the blackfeet reservation from the time he was four years old until he was seven or eight.he rented a room in a motel on the reservation shortly before the time of the offense.
as a descendant,cruz was subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the tribal court and was at one time prosecuted in tribal court.
cruz attended a public school on the reservation that is open to and worked as a firefighter for the federal bureau of indian affairs,a job that is also open to.
cruz has never participated in indian religious ceremonies or dance festivals,has never voted in a blackfeet tribal election,and does not have a tribal identification card.
analyzing this evidence,it is clear that cruz does not satisfy any of the four bruce factors.as to the first and most important factor,it is undisputed that cruz is not an enrolled member of the blackfeet tribe or any other tribe.in fact,cruz is not even eligible to become an enrolled member of the blackfeet tribe,as he has less than one quarter blackfeet blood,which is the minimum amount necessary for enrollment see blackfeet const.art.ii,amd.iii,c.our dissenting colleague would hold that the government has plainly met its burden under bruce because it has established that cruz has descendant status and has therefore been recognized by the tribal authorities.dissenting op.at.the government,however,has expressly waived any argument that cruz satisfies the first bruce factor,and does not contend that his descendant status,in and of itself,is a factor we should consider in performing the bruce analysis rather,the government argument is that descendant status is relevant only insofar as it renders someone eligible to receive certain assistance reserved for native americans,language that directly tracks the second bruce factor,except for substituting eligible to receive for actually receives.however,as we explain below,mere eligibility for benefits is of no consequence under bruce.given bruce clear admonition that tribal enrollment,and therefore a fortiori descendant status,is not dispositive of indian status,at,we reject the dissent argument that mere descendant status with the concomitant eligibility to receive benefits is effectively sufficient to demonstrate tribal recognition.to do otherwise would elevate tribal status to a dispositive determinant of indian status,as bruce explicitly forbids.furthermore,given the government explicit waiver of the argument,to hold as the dissent suggests would violate our longstanding general rule that we will not decide questions not raised by the parties before us.see,kimes stone,cir united states ziegler,cir kozinski,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc we apply the waiver rule with some vigor against criminal defendants we should be no less vigorous in applying it against the government.internal citation omitted.
nor is there any evidence that cruz satisfies the second most important factor,government recognition through receipt of assistance reserved only to indians.bruce,at emphasis added.to the contrary,the only evidence in the record demonstrates that the opposite is true cruz testified that he had never received any benefits from the blackfeet tribe,and the government did not present any evidence to the contrary nor did cruz enjoy any benefits of tribal affiliation,as required by bruce third most important factor.there is no evidence that he hunted or fished on the reservation,nor has it been suggested that his employment with the bia was related to or contingent upon his tribal heritage the only evidence supporting any of the bruce factors is that,for less than a quarter of his short life,cruz lived on the blackfeet reservation but even this only partially supports the government position under the fourth bruce factor,which also requires a showing of participation in indian social life.id.testimony both from cruz and from a government witness indicated that cruz does not practice indian religion,has never in any way participated in native religious ceremonies,does not participate in indian cultural festivals or dance competitions,has never voted in a blackfeet election,and does not carry a tribal identification card.the government did not present any evidence suggesting that cruz participated in any way in indian social life.
in sum,the evidence in this case,when taken in the light most favorable to the government,demonstrates that cruz satisfies at best only a small part of the least important of the four bruce factors.he does not satisfy any of the factors in full,and there is not even a scintilla of evidence suggesting that he satisfies a single one of the three most important factors.were we to hold that evidence satisfying merely a portion of the least important bruce factor is,in itself,sufficient to support a conviction,we would be ignoring bruce mandate in various respects,including its requirement that the factors be considered in declining order of importance.id.the first three factors could not realistically be deemed more important than the fourth if a partial satisfaction of the fourth could outweigh the complete failure to satisfy any of the first three.
the government does not dispute our assessment of the record.rather,in light of the near total lack of evidence that could satisfy the bruce test as it is written,it urges us to expand bruce by holding that mere eligibility for assistance reserved to indians is sufficient under the second bruce factor but this is not what bruce says.bruce says that the second factor requires a showing of receipt of assistance reserved only to indians.id.emphasis added.we are not empowered to ignore such clear language in our circuit precedent,see miller gammie,cir en banc,especially when construing a statute that creates a carefully limited intrusion of federal power into the otherwise exclusive jurisdiction of the indian tribes,bruce,at emphasis added quoting united states antelope,d.
even were we free to follow the government recommended course,we would not.the four factors that constitute the second bruce prong are designed to probe whether the native american has a sufficient link to a formerly sovereign people.bruce,at quoting cloud united states.bruce intentionally requires more than a simple blood test to determine whether someone is legally deemed an indian.given that many descendants of indians are eligible for tribal benefits based exclusively on their blood heritage,the government argument would effectively render the second bruce factor a de facto nullity,and in most,if not all,cases would transform the entire bruce analysis into a blood test.id.at.for similar reasons,we can not accept our dissenting colleague argument that the sole test under bruce second prong is whether the tribal authorities recognize someone as an indian,not whether he considers himself one.dissenting op.at second emphasis added.under bruce,the extent to which an individual considers himself an by deciding,for example,to reside on a reservation,to participat e in indian social life,or to recei ve assistance reserved only to indians,bruce,at most certainly relevant in determining his indian status.the dissent simply ignores the fact that bruce clearly requires an analysis from the perspective of both the tribe and the individual.
the government and our dissenting colleague also argue that the fact that cruz was prosecuted by the blackfeet tribal court demonstrates that he is an indian because a tribe has no jurisdiction to punish anyone but an indian.id.at see dissenting op.at.this argument is meritless for multiple reasons.first and foremost,the record in this case is incredibly thin with respect to cruz contact with the tribal justice system all we know is that he has been prosecuted.there is no evidence regarding the nature of that prosecution,to what stage,if any,it proceeded,and certainly the record does not indicate whether cruz was ever determined for purposes of that prosecution to be an indian.finally,the record does not suggest that the prosecution resulted in a conviction.based on the evidence contained in the trial record,which is all that we may consider,cruz case may well have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction after a finding that he is not an indian 
furthermore,while the government makes much of the fact that the court in bruce considered the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over the defendant throughout her entire lifetime relevant,it fails to recognize the significantly different posture of that case.bruce addressed a prosecution under.however,under,the question of indian status is an affirmative defense.id.at citing united states hester,cir.generally,the defendant must prove the elements of an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence,unless some other standard is set by statute united states beasley,cir see also united states,cir affirmative defense of insanity requires clear and convincing evidence.by contrast,under indian status is an essential element of the offense which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in every case.bruce,at emphasis added.all that bruce held was that t he assumption and exercise of a tribe criminal jurisdiction bolster ed the argument that bruce met her burden of producing sufficient evidence for an affirmative defense.id.at.the court explicitly caution ed that bruce was only required to meet a production burden,which it later described as a mere burden of production.id.emphasis added.the burden here,by contrast,is on the government to prove cruz indian status beyond a reasonable doubt.in this context,a showing that a tribal court on one occasion may have exercised jurisdiction over a defendant is of little if any consequence in satisfying the status element in a prosecution.
because the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the government does not demonstrate that cruz is an indian or that he meets any of the bruce factors,no rational trier of fact could have found that the government proved the statutory element of beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,the district court denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal was error.where the government has failed to show that any of the bruce factors has been satisfied,we have no trouble concluding that the error was clear and obvious.olano,at.as described earlier,a conviction that erroneously rests on insufficient evidence necessarily implicates substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness and integrity of the judicial process.accordingly,the denial of cruz motion for acquittal was not only error,but was plain error.we reverse the decision below and instruct the district court to grant the motion for judgment of acquittal 
for the reasons stated above,the decision below is reversed and the judgment of conviction vacated.the district court is instructed to grant the motion for judgment of acquittal.
because defendant has the requisite amount of indian blood,the only question is whether he has tribal or government recognition as an indian.united states bruce,cir quoting united states broncheau,cir for the generally accepted test,derived from united states rogers,how.he plainly does.the record discloses that the blackfeet tribal authorities have accorded cruz descendant status,which entitles him to many of the benefits of tribal membership,including medical treatment at any indian health service facility in the united states,certain educational grants,housing assistance and hunting and fishing privileges on the reservation.
that cruz may not have taken advantage of these benefits does matter because the test is whether the tribal authorities recognize him as an indian,not whether he considers himself one.that they do is confirmed by the fact that,when he was charged with an earlier crime on the reservation,the tribal police took him before the tribal court rather than turning him over to state or federal authorities.how that case was finally resolved is irrelevant what matters is that the tribal authorities protected him from a state or federal prosecution by treating him as one of their own.finally,cruz was living on the reservation when he was arrested,another piece of evidence supporting the jury verdict.
the majority manages to work its way around all of this evidence by taking a stray comment in bruce to the effect that certain factors have been considered in declining order of importance and turning it into a balancing test.but bruce was not announcing a rule of law it was merely reporting what it thought other courts had done c ourts have considered,in declining order of importance,evidence of four factors.at.bruce did not adopt this as any sort of standard,nor did it have any cause to do so,as nothing in bruce turned on the relative weight of the factors.the majority strains hard to make this part of bruce holding,but a fair reading of the opinion discloses that it not even dicta because it descriptive rather than prescriptive.we recognized this the last time we applied the test by omitting any reference to the declining order of importance.see united states ramirez,cir.
bruce borrowed the declining order of importance language from united states lawrence,cir,and lawrence itself was quoting the observation of a district judge in an earlier case,cloud united states.the district judge in cloud did not cite most of the cases he relied on,so it hard to tell whether his observation is correct,but he did offer a note of caution that my colleagues overlook these factors do not establish a precise formula for determining who is an indian.rather,they merely guide the analysis of whether a person is recognized as an indian.id.at.
this is the opposite of what my colleagues do today they turn the four factors into a rigid balancing test,with the various prongs reinforcing or offsetting each other,depending on how they are analyzed.this is not what the judge in cloud had in mind,and certainly nothing like what bruce adopted as the law of our circuit.it is an invention of the majority in our case,designed to take power away from juries and district judges and give it to appellate judges.nothing in the law,dating back to the supreme court opinion in rogers,justifies this fine mincing of the evidence.the question we must answer is whether there is enough evidence from which a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that cruz was recognized as an indian.clearly there was,and that the end of our task.
the majority misreads bruce and misrepresents my position given bruce clear admonition that tribal enrollment,and therefore a fortiori descendant status,is not dispositive of indian status,we re
