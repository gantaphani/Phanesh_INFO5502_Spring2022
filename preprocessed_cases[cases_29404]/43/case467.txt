the nation submitted expert testimony,which the secretary does not dispute,that the value marketed by the nation station results from the business generated by the casino and from employees of the casino and the nation government and residents,vol.ii,at.this conclusion is supported by the undisputed evidence that percent of the nation station fuel customers are casino patrons and casino employees and another eleven percent live or work elsewhere on the reservation,vol.v,at aple.br.at.the nation expert also reported that the station is a business because,b ut for the casino,there would not be enough traffic to support it in its current location,vol.ii,at.
the nation station sells fuel at fair market prices.therefore,it can not and does not advertise an exemption from state fuel taxes.the nation expert concluded that the nation is not marketing a tax exemption because the price of fuel at the nation station is set above cost,including the nation tax,and within cents per gallon of the price prevailing in the local market.id.at.the nation also submitted two from the station manager and one from the nation treasurer and tax support this conclusion.id.at,vol.iii,at.the secretary has not controverted the nation expert opinion or the nation affidavits and does not argue that the nation sells fuel below market prices.

discussion 
in this dispute,the nation challenges the amendment to the kansas motor fuel tax act.stat.ann.to.pursuant to this amendment,the kansas department of revenue began collecting,for the first time,a tax on motor fuel distributed to indian lands.the kansas legislature structured the tax so that its legal incidence is placed on distributors.stat.ann.c sac and fox nation of missouri pierce,cir.but,the distributors are allowed to pass the tax directly to retailers,like the nation station.stat.ann.every distributor paying such tax or being liable for the payment shall be entitled to charge and collect an amount,including the cost of doing business that could include such tax on motor sold or delivered by such distributor,as part of the selling price.the nation brought suit to enjoin the secretary from imposing the tax on the nation fuel,and the district court granted summary judgment for the secretary.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.gossett oklahoma ex rel.bd.of regents for langston,cir sac and fox,at.
the nation asks us to invalidate the tax as it applies to the nation fuel under two independent but related doctrines.first,the nation argues that federal law preempts the tax because federal and tribal interests against state taxation outweigh kansas interests in imposing the tax.second,the nation argues that the tax is invalid because it impermissibly infringes on its rights of.either of these doctrines would be sufficient to invalidate the kansas fuel tax as applied here.white mountain apache tribe bracker,d.
we first address whether the tax is preempted by federal law.the constitutional source of federal preemption is article i,section,clause,which provides the congress shall have power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.when preemption analysis is applied to indian cases,we consider the unique origins of tribal sovereignty and how it differs from state sovereignty.bracker,at.specifically,a mbiguities in federal law have been construed generously in order to comport with the traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence.id.at.citing mcclanahan state tax comm of arizona,and,d.state jurisdiction is preempted by the operation of federal law if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law,unless the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertions of state authority.new mexico mescalero apache tribe,d.
in cases like a tribe is challenging a state tax t he initial and frequently dispositive question is who bears the legal incidence of a tax.oklahoma tax comm chickasaw nation,d.if the legal incidence of an excise tax rests on a tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside indian country,the tax can not be enforced absent clear congressional authorization.id.at.however,where,as here,the legal incidence of the tax rests on,no categorical bar prevents enforcement of the tax if the balance of federal,state,and tribal interests favors the state,and federal law is not to the contrary,the state may impose its levy id.
although the secretary argues that the balancing of interests test should be abandoned,citing justice now chief justice rehnquist partial dissent in washington confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation,d,circuit precedent requires us to use this balancing test.see sac and fox,at.the balancing test is not dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty,but has called for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake,an inquiry designed to determine whether,in the specific context,the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.bracker,at.
applying these principles,we conclude that the kansas tax,as applied here,is preempted because it is incompatible with and outweighed by the strong tribal and federal interests against the tax.the nation interests are particularly strong.tribes have a recognized interest in raising revenues for essential governmental programs,and that interest is strongest when the revenues are derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the tribes and when the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services.colville,at.
here,the nation fuel revenues are derived from value generated primarily on its reservation.in determining reservation value,the unique facts of this case require us to look beyond the physical fuel the nation receives its fuel in ready to sell condition and to view the nation fuel sales as an integral and ess
