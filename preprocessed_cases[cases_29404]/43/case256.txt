we must once again address the subject of tribal court jurisdiction over disputes arising when choose to do business in indian country.underlying this jurisdictional question is a dollar development contract involving the building and operation of a tourist destination overlooking one of the world great wonders,the grand canyon.the skywalk is a viewing platform suspended feet over the rim of the grand canyon with the colorado river flowing thousands of feet below.
grand canyon skywalk development,llc gcsd,a nevada corporation,entered into a contract with sa nyu wa snw,a tribally chartered corporation of the hualapai indian tribe.when a dispute arose over the contract,gcsd sued snw in hualapai tribal court to compel arbitration.while arbitration proceeded,the hualapai tribal council exercised eminent domain and condemned gcsd intangible property rights in the contract,which practically speaking left snw,as a tribal corporation,in contract with the hualapai tribe.
gcsd responded by filing suit against snw in the united states district court for the district of arizona seeking declaratory judgment that the hualapai tribe lacked the authority to condemn its intangible property rights and injunctive relief.the district court denied the temporary restraining order tro to enjoin snw based on the principle of comity and required gcsd to exhaust all possible tribal court remedies before proceeding in federal court.the district court relied on our decision in water wheel camp recreational area,larance,cir,and also concluded there was not a sufficient basis to apply the bad faith or futility exceptions.for the same reasons cited by the district court,we affirm.
on december,gcsd and snw entered into a development and management agreement to establish a glass bridge tourist overlook and related facilities known as the skywalk on remote tribal land.in addition,gcsd agreed to provide shuttle services from locations outside the reservation to the skywalk.the parties signed an amended agreement on september,and later created a trust to manage the shared revenues on march.
gcsd filed a complaint in hualapai tribal court on february,seeking to compel snw to engage in arbitration pursuant to their agreement dispute resolution clause.snw objected,but nonetheless participated,and on february,an american arbitration association arbitrator set deadlines for a joint prehearing schedule and resolution of any outstanding discovery disputes,including depositions and subpoenas.
as arbitration proceeded,the hualapai tribal council passed resolution on april,enacting of the hualapai law and order code,which codified the tribe power to invoke eminent domain to condemn property for public use.on february,acting under,the tribal council passed resolution to acquire gcsd contractual interest in the skywalk agreement under the power of eminent domain and to do all things necessary to accomplish th at purpose.the hualapai tribal court followed by issuing a tro against gcsd,and snw filed a declaration of taking with the tribal court.
gcsd responded on two fronts it filed an expedited motion for a tro in district court to stop the eminent domain proceedings,and it opposed the taking in hualapai tribal court.after multiple hearings,the district court denied gcsd tro by invoking the principles of comity and ordered gcsd to exhaust tribal court remedies prior to review in federal court.gcsd timely appealed on march.
we have jurisdiction under a as an appeal from denial of injunctive relief.although tros are not typically appealable interlocutory orders,we may review a tro that possesses the qualities of a preliminary injunction where the district court holds an adversary hearing and the basis for the court order was strongly challenged.serv.emps.int l union union of healthcare workers,cir.we review questions of tribal court jurisdiction and exhaustion of tribal court remedies de novo and factual findings for clear error.smith salish kootenai,cir philip morris usa,king mountain tobacco,cir 
snw argues,for the first time on appeal,that collateral estoppel bars gcsd from raising similar jurisdictional questions on appeal that it raised before the district court in an earlier case dismissed without prejudice.because gcsd argument fails on the merits,we need not consider either whether snw waived this argument by failing to raise it in the district court or whether collateral estoppel applies here.
federal law has long recognized a respect for comity and deference to the tribal court as the appropriate court of first impression to determine its jurisdiction.see farmers union ins.crow tribe of indians,d iowa mut.ins.laplante,d burlington crow tribal council,cir.as support for this premise,the supreme court cites congress commitment to a policy of supporting tribal and a policy that allows the forum whose jurisdiction is being challenged the first opportunity to evaluate the factual and legal bases for the challenge and judicial economy,which will best be served by allowing a full record to be developed in the tribal court.farmers,at.
we have interpreted national farmers as determining that tribal court exhaustion is not a jurisdictional bar,but rather a prerequisite to a federal court exercise of its jurisdiction.crow tribal council,at.therefore,under national farmers,the federal courts should not even make a ruling on tribal court jurisdiction until tribal remedies are exhausted.stock west,confederated tribes of the colville reservation,cir.however,there are four recognized exceptions to the requirement for exhaustion of tribal court remedies where 
an assertion of tribal jurisdiction is motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted in bad faith the action is patently violative of express jurisdictional prohibitions exhaustion would be futile because of the lack of adequate opportunity to challenge the court jurisdiction or it is plain that no federal grant provides for tribal governance of nonmembers conduct on land covered by montana main rule.
burlington red wolf,cir citations omitted.gcsd raises bad faith,futility,and plain lack of tribal governance in support of its position.we review each of these exceptions in turn but ultimately conclude that none offers a sufficient basis to avoid exhaustion of tribal court remedies in this case.
the supreme court has suggested that a federal court need not wait until tribal remedies have been exhausted to consider a case if an assertion of tribal jurisdiction is motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted in bad faith.farmers,at internal citation omitted.black law dictionary defines bad faith as d ishonesty of belief or purpose.ed.national farmers used the passive voice and neither we,nor the supreme court,have expressly stated who must act in bad faith for it to apply.we now hold that where,as here,a tribal court has asserted jurisdiction and is entertaining a suit,the tribal court must have acted in bad faith for exhaustion to be excused.bad faith by a litigant instituting the tribal court action will not suffice.
the source of the bad faith exception in the tribal court context is national farmers,at,which imported it from juidice vail,d.in juidice,the state court issued a commitment order,and the defendant was arrested after he failed to attend a deposition,appear for a hearing,and pay a fine.id.at.rather than appeal his case in state court,he filed a claim in district court.id.at.upon review,the supreme court held that a federal court must abstain from making a determination during a state proceeding based on the principle of comity unless the proceeding was motivated by a desire to harass or was conducted in bad faith.see id.at.the court looked to the proceeding and the court overseeing that proceeding to make its determination.see id.at holding that the bad faith exception may not be utilized unless it is alleged and proved that the state courts are enforcing the contempt procedures in bad faith or are motivated by a desire to harass.the defendant there alleged bad faith by the plaintiffs,which the court explicitly held insufficient to trigger the exception.see id.holding that the exception was not triggered because w hile some paragraphs of the complaint could be construed to make bad faith allegations as to the creditors,there are no comparable allegations with respect to appellant justices who issued the contempt orders.analogizing to this case,it must be the hualapai tribal court that acts in bad faith to avoid the requirement to exhaust tribal court remedies.
additionally,a broader interpretation would unnecessarily deprive tribal courts of jurisdiction and violate the principles of comity that underlie the exhaustion requirement.a party would need only allege bad faith by the opposing party,or a third party,to remove the case to federal court.comity principles require that we trust that our tribal court counterparts can identify and punish bad faith by litigants as readily as we can.gcsd proposed reading of the exception would swallow the rule and undermine the supreme court general principle of deference to tribal courts.
gcsd points to two ninth circuit cases in support of its broader interpretation of who may act in bad faith to trigger the exception,but neither is dispositive of the issue.in a a concrete,white mountain apache tribe,the appellants argued that enforcement of a statutory scheme had been in bad faith,cir.we rejected the argument because there was no evidence of bad faith in the record.see id.similarly,in atwood fort peck tribal court assiniboine,we considered and rejected the bad faith exception in a single sentence by stating that t here has been no showing that the defendant asserted tribal jurisdiction in bad faith or that she acted to harass the plaintiff,cir.although both of these decisions looked beyond the tribal court for their bad faith analysis,the topic received only a cursory review and was quickly dismissed.neither case defined the scope of bad faith,and more importantly,neither case applied the bad faith exception.ultimately,where a tribe has an established judicial system as here,the interpretation most faithful to national farmers is that it must be the tribal court that acts in bad faith to exempt the party from exhausting available tribal court remedies.
the facts of this case do not support a finding of bad faith on the part of the tribal court.gcsd urges us to determine that the hualapai tribal court evaluation the proffered testimony of its author,executive director joseph myers,and other evidence proved that the tribal court and tribal council were inextricably intertwined such that bad faith by the tribal council could be imputed to the tribal court.however,the proffered evidence does not conclusively support that claim.the majority of the statements in the evaluation are broad generalizations or guiding principles.two specific findings directly refute gcsd contentions no interviewee stated that there was any direct interference in court matters by tribal council members and t he judiciary is separate and apart from the tribal council.additionally,the tribal council act of bringing in an external auditing organization lends credibility to the tribal court system as a whole.
gcsd challenges the district court refusal to hear testimony from the evaluation author,myers.a district court evidentiary rulings should not be reversed absent clear abuse of discretion and some prejudice.jasper,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.for us to reverse a decision as an abuse of discretion,we must have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached.united states comprehensive drug testing,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied gcsd request to introduce myers testimony.gcsd requested an emergency evidentiary hearing but failed to notify the court of its intention to introduce witness testimony.as a result,snw did not have an opportunity to subpoena defense witnesses.out of fairness to snw and due to the urgency of a tro proceeding,the court accepted only myers written report.the court reviewed the published evaluation and left open the possibility of an additional evidentiary hearing if necessary.
ultimately,the court denial of the admission of his actual testimony was not an abuse of discretion because the evaluation documented myers findings and provided a balanced review of the hualapai judiciary.when considered together,the submitted evidence does not establish that the tribal court operated in bad faith or is controlled by the tribal council in its decision making.
futility is also a recognized exception to the requirement to exhaust court tribal remedies.where exhaustion would be futile because of the lack of adequate opportunity to challenge the court jurisdiction,a party is excused from exhausting claims in tribal court.red wolf,at.generally,this exception applies narrowly to only the most extreme cases.see johnson gila river indian,cir delay called into question the possibility of tribal court remedies krempel prairie island indian,cir exhaustion not required where there was no functioning tribal court.
gcsd has failed to show that the hualapai tribal court does not offer an adequate and impartial opportunity to challenge jurisdiction.although hualapai law and order code k originally precluded a judge pro tem from hearing condemnation cases,the tribal court remedied this separation of powers issue by invalidating that section and appointing a neutral pro tem judge to hear this case.the hualapai adjudicatory process has continued,as evidenced by submitted tribal court and tribal court of appeals orders.both parties to this appeal are participating in those proceedings the tribal court determined it has jurisdiction to review the condemnation act under the catchall section of the hualapai law and order code,d,which states the tribal court may be guided by common law as developed by other tribal,federal or state courts where no law is directly on point.even the evaluation offered as evidence by gcsd as proof of futility includes statements such as,t he hualapai tribal court is a functional,established system with court procedures and t he judiciary is separate and apart from the tribal council.
the submitted evidence supports the district court finding that the tribal court operates independently from the tribal council and the evidence presented does not meet the narrow futility exception.gcsd is actively litigating its case in hualapai tribal court,contradicting its argument that it has not had an adequate opportunity to challenge the court jurisdiction.red wolf,at.
finally,we turn to the third issue raised on appeal,whether the tribal court plainly lacked jurisdiction over this case.the supreme court stated in strate a contractors that where it is plain that no federal grant provides for tribal governance of nonmembers conduct on land covered by montana main rule,it will be equally evident that tribal courts lack adjudicatory authority over disputes arising from such conduct,d montana described a general rule that,absent a different congressional direction,indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on land within a reservation.id.at.we hold that this strate exception does not apply here to deny the tribal court of its initial jurisdiction.
the tribal court does not plainly lack jurisdiction because montana main rule is unlikely to apply to the facts of this case.furthermore,the district court correctly relied upon water wheel,which provides for tribal jurisdiction without even reaching the application of montana.even if the tribal court were to apply montana main rule,gcsd consensual relationship with snw or the financial implications of the agreement likely place it squarely within one of montana exceptions and allow for tribal jurisdiction 
montana united states,d,is the pathmarking case concerning tribal civil authority over nonmembers.strate,at.but as the district court properly determined,a tribe inherent authority over tribal land may provide for regulatory authority over on that land without the need to consider montana.see water wheel,at.as a starting point,we recognize the rule that indian tribes possess inherent sovereign powers,in
