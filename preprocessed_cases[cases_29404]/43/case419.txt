the lummi indian tribe appeals from the final judgment entered in favor of the lower elwha band of,the jamestown band of,the port gamble band of and the skokomish indian tribe collectively the four tribes.the district court concluded that judge boldt,in united states washington,boldt,hereinafter decision i,aff,cir,did not intend for the lummi usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations to include the strait of juan de fuca,admiralty inlet or the mouth of the hood canal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we conclude that judge boldt intended to exclude the strait of juan de fuca and the mouth of the hood canal and include admiralty inlet in the lummi usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
this appeal involves the scope of fishing rights secured by the lummi indian tribe in the treaty of point elliott.tribes who were party to the treaty,including the lummi,reserved the right to fish at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations.act of,art.v,stat.the term usual and accustomed grounds and stations includes every fishing location where members of a tribe customarily fished from time to time at and before treaty times,however distant from the then usual habitat of the tribe,and whether or not other tribes then also fished in the same waters.decision i.at.
the united states filed the underlying action in decision i,on its own behalf and as trustee for several western washington indian tribes,to enforce compliance by the state of washington with treaty fishing rights.see decision i.at.as part of decision i,judge boldt determined the various tribes usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations.with respect to the lummi,judge boldt described their usual and accustomed grounds and stations as follows 
prior to the treaty of point elliott,the lummi,semiahmoo and samish indians had been engaged in trade in salmon,halibut and shellfish with other indians and with.this trade continued after the treaty.at the time of the treaty they maintained prosperous communities by virtue of their ownership of lucrative saltwater fisheries.the single most valuable fish resource was undoubtedly the sockeye,which the lummis were able to intercept in the straits on the annual migration of the sockeye from the ocean to the fraser river.lummi indians developed a highly efficient technique,known as reef netting,for taking large quantities of salmon in salt water.aboriginal indian reef netting differs from present methods and techniques described by the same term.the lummis had reef net sites on orcas island,san juan island,lummi island and fidalgo island,and near point roberts and sandy point.when nature did not provide optimum reef conditions the indians artificially created them.reef netting was one of the two most important economic activities engaged in by these indians,the other being the sale of dog fish oil.these indians also took spring,silver and humpback salmon and steelhead by gill nets and harpoons near the mouth of the nooksack river,and steelhead by harpoons and basketry traps on whatcom creek.they trolled the waters of the san juan islands for various species of salmon.
in addition to the reef net locations listed above,the usual and accustomed fishing places of the lummi indians at treaty times included the marine areas of northern puget sound from the fraser river south to the present environs of seattle,and particularly bellingham bay.freshwater fisheries included the river drainage systems,especially the nooksack,emptying into the bays from boundary bay south to fidalgo bay.

almost fifteen years after decision i,the four tribes initiated subproceeding by filing a request for determination,pursuant to the continuing jurisdiction of the court the four tribes sought a determination that the lummi were violating decision i by fishing in areas outside of their adjudicated usual and accustomed grounds and stations,specifically in the strait of juan de fuca,admiralty inlet and the mouth of the hood canal.the four tribes claim these same fishing areas as part of their usual and accustomed grounds and stations.
the four tribes and the lummi both moved for summary judgment as to whether the disputed areas were contained within the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations.judge coyle,a visiting judge assigned to preside at many of the decision i subproceedings,determined that judge boldt had not intended the disputed areas to be included within the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations.on february,judge coyle granted the four tribes motion for summary judgment and denied the lummi motion.although no apparent issues remained pending,a final judgment was not entered.
instead,the lummi filed an amended response to the four tribes request for determination and a for determination on april,the sought a determination that the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations should be expanded to include the three disputed areas 
based on the lummi expansion theory,several years of discovery ensued,after which the parties again filed for summary judgment.by this point,subproceeding had been transferred to judge rothstein.on february,judge rothstein denied both summary judgment motions.judge rothstein concluded that,despite the weakness of the lummi evidence,genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether the disputed areas should be added to the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations.
during the next few years,the parties were heavily involved in the litigation of other subproceedings.consequently,the trial in subproceeding was repeatedly delayed.in the meantime,an opinion was filed in muckleshoot tribe lummi indian tribe,cir.
one month prior to the now trial date of june,the lummi moved to vacate that date and to reopen discovery,arguing essentially that muckleshoot required reframing of the issues.according to the lummi,the correct focus was no longer whether the disputed areas should be added to the usual and accustomed grounds and stations,but rather whether judge coyle correctly determined in that the areas were not intended by judge boldt to be included in the findings of decision i.the lummi argued that judge coyle impermissibly relied on evidence that was not presented to judge boldt in order to determine judge boldt intent.
the four tribes opposed the lummi motion,and moved to dismiss the lummi for determination.judge rothstein denied the lummi motion to vacate the trial date and later entered an order setting a briefing schedule to resolve the outstanding issues.the lummi then moved to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.
on september,judge rothstein denied the lummi alternative motions and granted the four tribes motion to dismiss.judge rothstein applied the law of the case doctrine and accepted judge coyle decision that judge boldt did not intend to include the strait of juan de fuca,admiralty inlet or the mouth of the hood canal in the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations.final judgment was entered on september,dismissing subproceeding.the lummi timely appeal.
at the outset,the four tribes raise two arguments as to why we should not review judge coyle summary judgment order,which established that judge boldt did not intend to include the disputed areas within the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations.first,the four tribes argue that the order was final in,thus any attempt by the lummi to appeal now is untimely.second,the four tribes argue that judge rothstein application of the law of the case doctrine insulates judge coyle order from review.we address each argument in turn.
according to the four tribes,judge coyle decision was a final one,from which the lummi may no longer appeal.thus,the four tribes argue that we are limited to reviewing only judge rothstein application of the law of the case doctrine and not the merits of the usual and accustomed grounds and stations dispute.
section confers jurisdiction on us to hear appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.does advanced textile,cir quoting coopers lybrand livesay,d.we observe that a ruling is final for purposes of if it is a full adjudication of the issues,and clearly evidences the judge intention that it be the court final act in the matter.national distribution agency nationwide mut.ins,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the lummi contend that magistrate judge weinberg minute order is evidence that judge coyle subsequent order was not intended to be final.according to the lummi,the minute order contemplated the filing of amended pleadings after the summary judgment motions were resolved.this contention is unavailing.the order states that r esponses to the lummi amended pleadings are not due until after a decision on the motions.the order does not state that the amended pleadings themselves may be filed after disposition of the summary judgment motions.moreover,when read in context,it is clear that magistrate judge weinberg minute order was intended to save the parties the effort and expense of preparing additional discovery and responses,if such were not necessary.once judge coyle granted the four tribes summary judgment,further litigation was no longer necessary.
even though judge coyle disposition of the summary judgment motions left no issues to be resolved,the lummi amended their pleadings to assert a for determination both parties then continued to actively litigate,with no opposition from the district court most importantly,no final judgment was entered.see.every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.
although rule requires the entry of a separate document,the existence of such a document is not a prerequisite to appellate jurisdiction under.see bankers trust mallis,d per curiam.nevertheless,rule serves to protect parties from uncertainty.see,ingram acands,cir a party should not have to run the risk that the order he may choose to appeal from may not be the same order a court of appeals decides he should have chosen.
in light of the purpose of rule,we conclude that judge coyle summary judgment order was not final because no separate judgment was entered.
the four tribes next argue that judge rothstein application of the law of the case doctrine insulates judge coyle summary judgment order from review.this argument also lacks merit.judge coyle decision,which was not final,merged into the final judgment entered on september,and may be challenged in this appeal.see hook.dep t of corrections,cir a party does not lose the right to appeal an interlocutory order by not immediately appealing and waiting for the final judgment.the interlocutory order merges in the final judgment and may be challenged in an appeal from that judgment.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we address the merits of this appeal.the lummi challenge both judge coyle summary judgment order and judge rothstein refusal to revise that order.we address each argument in turn.
the lummi argue that judge coyle erred in granting summary judgment to the four tribes because judge boldt intended to include the strait of juan de fuca,admiralty inlet and the mouth of the hood canal within the lummi usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations.this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.see balint carson city,cir en banc.
the question before judge coyle was whether the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations,as expressed in finding of fact of decision i the marine areas of northern puget sound from the fraser river south to the present environs of seattle included the disputed areas.the phrase used by judge boldt is ambiguous because it does not delineate the western boundary of the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations when interpreting an ambiguous prior judgment,the reviewing court should construe a judgment so as to give effect to the intention of the issuing court.muckleshoot,at quoting narramore united states,cir.
to determine whether judge boldt intended to include the disputed areas within the lummi usual and accustomed grounds and stations,judge coyle looked at the evidence presented to judge boldt,specifically those exhibits which judge boldt referred to in findings of fact and.these exhibits consisted of summaries and reports prepared by barbara lane,a noted anthropologist who testified as an expert witness in decision i,as well as maps that she relied on in her testimony.these exhibits were submitted for judge coyle review via a declaration prepared by lane.in that declaration,lane identified and authenticated the exhibits.lane also made the following statements with respect to what she intended at the time of decision i 
the straits referred to in my exhibit,at not specifically denominated therein,were haro,rosario and georgia straits and i did not intend the reference to include the strait of juan de fuca.
at the time of my reports and testimony,i had not reached,expressed or intended any conclusion that the usual and accustomed fishing grounds and stations of the predecessor indians to the present lummi tribe included the strait of juan de fuca,the open marine water beyond the immediate near shore area southwesterly of the san juan islands and westerly of northern whidbey island,or the admiralty inlet passageway along the west side of whidbey island.
in the time available before the presently scheduled court hearing on this subproceeding,i am unable to formulate a conclusion on existence or extent of fishing activity by those lummi predecessors in those waters.
i do not consider the term northern puget sound as used in the court finding or any other language in the court findings to include the strait of juan de fuca,or the hood canal area waters southerly of a line from olele point to the tip of foulweather bluff.
the lummi argue that judge coyle improperly considered lane declaration because it constituted testimony which,after muckleshoot,is not proper evidence of judge boldt intent.muckleshoot a different subproceeding,but one which also involved the lummi and to treat the definition of the phrase present environs of seattle first articulated by lane in her august deposition as having been adopted by judge boldt in is pure speculation.accordingly,the district court erred by considering lane testimony as evidence of judge boldt intended meaning.at.elsewhere in muckleshoot,the court approved of the statement that the only matter at issue is the meaning of judge boldt finding and the only relevant evidence is that which was considered by judge boldt when he made his finding.id.at.in the final sentence of the opinion,however,the court left open the possibility that extrinsic evidence might be appropriately considered in determining judge boldt intent while evidence that was before judge boldt when he made his finding is obviously relevant,there may be other evidence indicative of the contemporary understanding of the present environs of seattle.id.at.
the facts of muckleshoot are distinguishable.there,lane testimony was the only authority capable of clarifying the meaning of that phrase present environs of seattle.muckleshoot,at.here,although judge coyle considered lane declaration,it is clear that he did not rely on it.instead,he focused directly on the exhibits attached to lane declaration,and,which were presented to judge boldt in decision 
judge coyle order makes it clear that he properly relied on evidence that was put before judge boldt,and not upon testimony.for instance,judge coyle stated that the court examines the evidence presented to judge boldt in connection with the underlying proceeding.emphasis added.judge coyle also concluded that t here is no question in the court mind from the evidence presented to judge boldt that the lummis usual and accustomed fishing places were not intended to include the strait of juan de fuca.emphasis added.we hold that judge coyle opinion does not run afoul of muckleshoot because there is no indication that judge coyle imputed lane intentions to judge boldt.
the lummi also argue that judge coyle erred by not considering all of the evidence submitted to judge boldt in decision i in context.the lummi contend that judge boldt int
