vernon lee bad marriage,bad marriage appeals his sentence imposed following his guilty plea to a charge of assault resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of a and.finding no error,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
bad marriage was indicted in march on a charge of aggravated sexual assault in violation of a and.following a plea agreement,he was charged in a superseding information with assault resulting in serious bodily injury.he pled guilty to that charge.
the incident giving rise to the charge occurred on january.bad marriage was released from tribal jail to attend an alcoholics anonymous meeting.instead,he went to the home of leeta old chief,his girlfriend.after having consensual sex,they drove to visit friends.there an argument ensued between the couple and bad marriage began hitting old chief.the couple then drove to the rodeo grounds where bad marriage severely kicked and beat old chief.bad marriage and old chief then had anal sex.old chief initially told fbi agents that she had been raped but later retracted this claim.once old chief told law enforcement officers that she would no longer be willing to testify that bad marriage had raped her,the government dismissed the indictment in exchange for bad marriage guilty plea to the information charging assault resulting in serious bodily injury.
the district court sentenced bad marriage under the sentencing guidelines.the court ruled,based on policy statement,that the criminal history level iii both the seriousness of bad marriage past criminal conduct and the likelihood that he would commit future crimes.it sentenced bad marriage to months in prison,the high end of the sentencing range determined under the guidelines with his offense score and adjusted criminal history level.bad marriage appealed the sentence,contending that his criminal history did not consist of serious offenses warranting a departure under.this court reversed and remanded for resentencing,holding that an upward departure pursuant to was not justified by the facts.united states bad marriage,cir bad marriage i.
in imposing sentence on remand,the district court provided a lengthy statement of reasons,starting with an analysis of the ninth circuit decision.it read that decision as resting on the fundamental premise that the sentencing guidelines were binding on the court.united states booker,however,changed that,establishing that application of the guidelines could not be mandatory,d.under booker,the court is required to take into account the guidelines as well as the sentencing considerations contained in a.the court then enumerated the factors it considered in arriving at the sentence in addition to the advisory guidelines calculation,including the defendant extensive criminal record,the absence of assurance that the defendant will not offend again given the opportunity,the defendant capacity to commit brutal and degrading acts of violence,and the substantial blunt force injury inflicted by the defendant kicking the victim with heavy hiking boots.in sum,the court concluded,the defendant is an extremely dangerous person capable of inflicting severe harm on vulnerable and defenseless persons,calling for a sentence that recognizes the brutality of the assault and the need to protect the public in the future.the court then sentenced bad marriage to months in prison.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the mandate and law of the casea.law of the case 
bad marriage principal contention is that the district court failed to comply with this court mandate.that mandate was to resentence bad marriage within the appropriate range.bad marriage i,at.bad marriage reads the mandate as requiring imposition of a sentence based on offense level sixteen and criminal history category iii resulting in a range of to months.we disagree.
the court opinion does not elucidate the appropriate range.its resentencing mandate was based on its determination that the upward adjustment of bad marriage criminal history was not justified.id.at.its decision rested on its interpretation of,departures based on inadequacy of criminal history category policy statement,and that section application to the facts of the case although there is a degree of overlap between the factors bearing on criminal history and those relevant under,the court did not decide whether other factors relevant to the guidelines calculation could have justified an upward departure.see,extreme conduct policy statement court may increase the sentence above the guidelines range for conduct unusually brutal or degrading to the victim.
on remand,the district court looked to the guidelines as advisory but made no reference to bad marriage criminal history category.when defense counsel,in the course of his argument,asked the court to apply category iii in its guidelines calculation,the court did not respond,neither rejecting nor granting this request.the district court stated reasons for imposing its sentence were,in substance,to punish the defendant for committing a brutal assault on a defenseless person and to protect the public from similar conduct in the future.although the court,free of the constraint of the guidelines,imposed a more severe sentence on remand,we find nothing in the record to suggest that the sentence contravened the mandate.
b.the effect of booker 
even if we were to read bad marriage i to hold that on the facts no upward departure from the guidelines range is justified,the law of the case doctrine does not bar the sentence.under the law of the case doctrine,a court is ordinarily precluded from reexamining an issue previously decided by the same court,or a higher court,in the same case.minidoka irrigation dist.dep t of interior,cir quoting old person brown,cir.the doctrine is subject to three exceptions,only one of which is relevant here,to wit,where intervening controlling authority makes reconsideration appropriate.id.
the opinion in bad marriage i was issued on december.on january,the supreme court decided booker,d.the booker decision fundamentally changed the sentencing regime under which bad marriage i was decided,making the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory.at district courts must consult the guidelines but are not bound by them if bad marriage i is read to establish the law of the case under a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime,booker,which leaves guidelines as advisory only,is intervening controlling authority displacing prior law of case 
ii.other contentions on appeal 
bad marriage other contentions may be readily disposed of.
he contends first that the retroactive application of booker to increase his sentence for a offense violates the ex post facto clause of the constitution.we squarely rejected this claim in united states dupas,cir,for three reasons the booker opinion specifically makes the advisory guidelines regime applicable to pending cases retroactive sentence enhancements,as opposed to retroactive increases in the scope of criminal liability,do not offend the ex post facto prohibition and although application of booker could result in an increased sentence,the statutory maximum penalty gave sufficient notice to satisfy due process.id.at.
next,bad marriage contends that the sentence was unreasonable.he relies on the court statement in bad marriage i that it found nothing in the record to suggest that the standard range set by the sentencing guidelines would be an inadequate deterrent.id.at.that statement is not helpful to bad marriage.it referred to the calculation of the appropriate criminal history category.as previously discussed,bad marriage i decided that an upward adjustment of the criminal history category was not justified it did not decide the appropriate sentencing range.the district court followed the proper procedure in arriving at its sentence,taking into account the guidelines and considering the factors,in particular the seriousness of the offense,a a noting the brutality of the assault on a defenseless person,and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.a c.while we recognize that the sentence is above the advisory guidelines range,that alone,without a factual showing,is insufficient to make it unreasonable.
finally,bad marriage contends that the imposition of the longer sentence following his successful appeal raises a presumption of vindictiveness.he argues that the presumption applies here because the district court in increasing the sentence did not rely on any new or additional evidence.but the presumption applies only when there is a reasonable likelihood that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.alabama smith,d internal citation omitted.it is overcome when the reasons for imposition of a more severe sentence affirmatively appear.id.at.quoting north carolina pearce,d.those reasons affirmatively appear here.when the district court imposed the original sentence,it was constrained by the mandatory guidelines.at resentencing,as the court explained,that constraint had been removed freeing it to use its discretion to impose a sentence it deemed appropriate.its reasons for the particular sentence are fully explained on the record.we conclude that the change in circumstances together with the court explanation for its sentence suffice to remove any taint of vindictiveness.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,the judgment and sentence are affirmed.
in my view,the district court did not accord the prior panel opinion in united states bad marriage,cir bad marriage i,the respect it is due.instead,the district court ignored bad marriage i legal rulings and analysis of the record,which it was not entitled to do.the majority approves of the district court maneuver,perhaps sharing the district court discomfort with the analysis and holding of bad marriage whether or not that discomfort is understandable,we can not run an orderly justice system if such around appellate decisions in the same case are permitted.i therefore respectfully dissent.
in bad marriage i,we held that an upward departure pursuant to section of the united states sentencing guidelines was not warranted by the facts,and struck down vernon lee bad marriage month sentence.see id.at.we reasoned,in part,that bad marriage criminal history did not warrant such a long sentence and that a sentence of that length would not serve the goals of rehabilitating bad marriage and protecting the public.see id.at.on remand,the district court correctly observed that after united states booker,d,the guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.it then imposed a longer sentence than it had previously,justifying the length of the sentence with reference to,inter alia,bad marriage extensive criminal history and the need to protect the public.in so doing,the district court completely disregarded our determinations in bad marriage i regarding the weight that should be attached to bad marriage criminal history and the potential efficacy of a long sentence,given bad marriage alcoholism.i would hold that the district court abused its discretion because it disregarded those determinations.
under the law of the case doctrine,a decision by this court must generally be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.see lindy pen,bic pen,cir.for the doctrine to apply to a particular issue,that issue must have been decided explicitly or by necessary implication in the previous disposition.liberty mut.ins.eeoc,cir.this general decisions of this court must be followed in subsequent subject to several exceptions.as pertinent here,the law of the case need not be followed when intervening controlling authority makes reconsideration appropriate.old person brown,cir see also id.listing two other exceptions the decision is clearly erroneous and its enforcement would work a manifest injustice,and substantially different evidence was adduced at a subsequent trial internal quotation marks omitted united states lummi indian tribe,cir listing four other exceptions the first decision was clearly erroneous,the evidence on remand was substantially different,other changed circumstances exist,or a manifest injustice would otherwise result.we review a district court failure to apply the doctrine of the law of the case for abuse of discretion.see united states alexander,cir.
related to the law of the case doctrine is the rule of mandate,which states that a lower court may decide any issue not foreclosed by this court mandate.see herrington county of sonoma,cir.this court may,however,limit the scope of the issues for which we remand.united states matthews,cir en banc.when we clearly indicate our intention to do so,the district court ordinarily lacks authority to consider any issues not within the scope of the remand.see united states pimentel,cir per curiam.
we have stated that t he rule of mandate is similar to,but broader than,the law of the case doctrine and that a district court,upon receiving the mandate of an appellate court can not vary it or examine it for any other purpose than execution.united states cote,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have not had occasion to address the extent to which the exceptions in the law of the case doctrine also apply to the mandate rule.nor does the majority opinion examine whether the analysis is different under the two doctrines.see majority op.at.
i believe that the analysis probably is different under the two doctrines,as each serves a different function.both doctrines serve an interest in consistency,finality and efficiency.see bean calderon,cir milgard tempering,selas,cir.the mandate rule,however,also serves an interest in preserving the hierarchical structure of the court system.see mirchandani united states,cir.for that reason,i would think that exceptions to the law of the case doctrine such as manifest injustice,see old person,at lummi indian tribe,at,do not apply to the mandate rule,and that the change in law doctrine applies only to the limited extent that the mandate need not be followed when it requires a district court to do something that is illegal in light of intervening controlling authority.in such a case,the interest in preserving our hierarchical structure must give way to the interest in assuring that courts do not act unlawfully.
bad marriage i remand ed to the district court for resentencing within the appropriate range.bad marriage i,at.had the district court resentenced bad marriage prior to the supreme court decision in booker,the district court would have been required to sentence bad marriage to a term within the appropriate range,between and months see also id.at noting that the sentencing guidelines set a range of to months for a defendant with bad marriage offense and criminal history level.the district court so recognized,stating that if it were resentencing bad marriage under the regime,the guideline range that would be mandatory to be applied would be the to months.
bad marriage i mandate requiring the district court to issue a sentence within a particular range was,however,based on the assumption that the guidelines were mandatory,an assumption no longer valid.had the district court followed the mandate,the sentence would have been illegal,because it would have been imposed pursuant to a mandatory guidelines regime.i therefore agree with the majority that,the district court did not need to follow this particular directive in bad marriage 
i disagree with the majority,however,that our inquiry ends there.bad marriage i established more than the simple proposition that bad marriage should have been sentenced to to months under a mandatory guidelines regime.in addition,as relevant here,bad marriage i established that t o sentence bad marriage to a longer prison term on the basis of bad marriage record would serve no useful purpose.at.
the bad marriage i court based its conclusion on two grounds.first,the court observed that t he underlying purposes of sentencing include not only punishment and deterrence,but also the provision of treatment to a defendant in need of it.id.citing a d.second,and related,the court determined that prison alone will neither rehabilitate an individual critically in need of substance abuse treatment,nor,in the long run,protect society against him.bad marriage is such an individual.id.at.
