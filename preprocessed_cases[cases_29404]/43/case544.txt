this case involves a petition by mashpee wampanoag tribal council,for recognition by the united states as an indian tribe.the secretary of the interior appeals an order of the district court finding the bureau of indian affairs bia unreasonably delayed acting upon the petition,in violation of the administrative procedure act,b,and requiring the bureau to decide the matter within one year.because we believe the district court misapplied the law of agency delay,we send the case back to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
a american indian tribe is entitled to significant privileges,including exemption from state and local jurisdiction including laws regulating gambling and the right of its members to participate in an array of welfare programs.although the congress has recognized tribes through legislation in recent years,it is ordinarily up to the secretary of the interior,through a painstaking bureaucratic process,to determine whether the united states will recognize the sovereignty of a putative tribe.see generally part.
mashpee is a corporation that represents the interests of some residents of cape cod,massachusetts.its quest for federal recognition began in the,when it first notified the bia of its intent to seek recognition.it filed a formal letter of intent,however,only in.see.then,perhaps because it was distracted by its efforts to gain recognition through litigation,see,mashpee tribe sec y of the interior,cir seeking recognition and title to certain lands pursuant to indian nonintercourse act,mashpee did not file its petition with the bia for another decade in september.after an initial review,the bia branch of acknowledgment and recognition bar in july sent mashpee a letter of obvious deficiency requesting additional information.see b.mashpee took four and a half years to respond.upon receipt of the response in january,the bar notified mashpee that it was placing the petition on its list of applications ready,waiting for active consideration.
the ready list is a queue,with priority established on a basis.no statute or regulation specifies how quickly the queue must move along in contrast to the timeframe for processing a petition once it is under active consideration,see id.h l and the pace is glacial.as of august there were petitions on the list,six of which had been waiting there for at least five years.accounting office,indian issues improvements needed in tribal recognition process.the gao estimated that it could take years to resolve all the petitions then awaiting active consideration.id.at.
frustrated by that prospect,mashpee sued the secretary,claiming unreasonable delay in violation of the apa and seeking an order compelling the bia to act upon the petition.the district court,after weighing the considerations relevant to such a claim,as summarized in telecommunications research action center fcc,trac,granted summary judgment for mashpee,ordered the bia immediately to place mashpee petition on active consideration,and required the secretary to issue a final decision within one year.mashpee wampanoag tribal council,norton,d.the secretary appeals.
ii.analysis 
the secretary disputes the district court jurisdiction to hear mashpee claim of unreasonable delay,its conclusion that the bia had not acted upon mashpee petition within a reasonable time,and its order compelling the bia to take a decision within one year.before we consider those issues,however,we must consider mashpee claim that this appeal is untimely.
timeliness 
the secretary filed a notice of appeal days after the district court denied her motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order.ordinarily that would satisfy the appellate filing deadline.see fed.a a iv time period in which to file appeal runs from entry of order disposing of motion to alter or amend judgment.in this case,however,mashpee argues the secretary may not invoke the tolling provision of frap because her motion for reconsideration was both untimely,see.e setting deadline,and defective in that it did not state with particularity the grounds therefor,see.b.
a motion under rule e must be filed within days of the challenged order,not including weekends,certain specified national holidays including christmas day and new year day,or any other day appointed as a holiday by the president.a.in this case,the district court granted summary judgment on december.the secretary filed her motion on january.excluding weekends,christmas day,and new year day,that was days after the court issued its order.
whether the secretary motion for reconsideration was timely,therefore,depends upon whether christmas eve should also be excluded from the computation as a day appointed as a holiday by the president.as the secretary points out,president bush directed that all executive branch departments and agencies of the federal government shall be closed and their employees excused from duty on december,with exceptions for national security.exec.order.the president order also provided that december would fall within the scope of various laws governing holiday pay and leave for federal workers.id.by virtue of the executive order,the secretary maintains,christmas eve was a day appointed as a holiday by the president.
we have not previously had occasion to consider whether a day has been appointed as a holiday within the meaning of rule a,and the parties have been unable to cite any particularly helpful authority,albeit not for want of trying.true,as mashpee points out,the seventh circuit has suggested that for the president to declare a holiday he must use that word.see latham dominick finer foods.but the actual holding in that case was that the disputed motion was timely because the courthouse was closed on the day in question as it was in this case.on the precise issue before us,whether a day on which the president closes the offices of the executive branch qualifies as a legal holiday under rule a,neither latham nor any other case cited by the parties provides much guidance.
the purpose of the rule,however,is guidance enough.rule generally is intended to provide reasonable flexibility concerning the measurement of time periods under the federal rules of civil procedure,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed rule a specifically is intended to alleviate the hardship of allowing days of rest to shorten already tight deadlines.advisory committee note.when the president gives all employees in the executive branch a day off,we believe rule a contemplates a break for federal litigators.to penalize the secretary rather drastically,by dismissing her appeal because the president did not use the word holiday in the executive order would quite plainly run counter to the purpose of the rule.we conclude that christmas eve,should be excluded in calculating the period within which the secretary had to file her motion hence,the motion was timely.
we also find the secretary motion for reconsideration sufficiently particular to toll the deadline for filing an appeal.because of the tolling function of certain motions,there is good reason to ensure they not be devoid of content,filed only to stop the clock.here,as mashpee argues,the bulk of the secretary motion for reconsideration was dedicated to explaining why the secretary needed another week to file her supporting memorandum.
the motion was not so devoid of detail,however,as to fall below the standard of specificity set by rule,namely,that a motion shall state with particularity the grounds therefor.the secretary objected,on the ground that the issue was not briefed,to 
the court conclusion that b y failing to appeal from judge urbina order in another recognition case,bia essentially conceded that the otherwise dispositive fourth trac factor the effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of a higher or competing priority is of no weigh sic at all.
by claiming that a specific holding of the district court was erroneous,and stating at least one basis for its claim of error,the secretary provided more detail than was held insufficient in the cases upon which mashpee relies.see,talano northwestern med.faculty,cir argument that
