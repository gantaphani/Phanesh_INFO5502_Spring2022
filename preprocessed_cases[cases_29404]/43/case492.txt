this civil rights appeal raises the following notable issue whether deposition corrections are subject to a sham affidavit analysis.we answer this question in the affirmative.as to the merits of plaintiff constitutional challenge,arising from the termination of his employment with the jackson county,kansas road and bridge department the department,we conclude that plaintiff has failed to show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his termination was racially motivated in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,or intended to punish speech protected by the first amendment.thus,the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
rick burns,the plaintiff in the instant case,is native american and an enrolled member of the pottawatomie indian tribe.from until january,burns was employed by the department,first as a truck driver and then as a operator.in november,burns supervisor ed bruns wrote to the department employees reminding them of the time they were required to be on the job and that travel time was not compensated.a month later,burns and several other department employees met with county counselor ed dunn to discuss whether they would be covered by workers compensation insurance for any accidents that occurred on the way to work.during this meeting,burns allegedly made a remark about the county commissioners to the effect that you ca teach the dumb son of a bitches anything.appellant app.at.
following this meeting with dunn,supervisor ed bruns implemented a new pay plan that divided employees into a and b categories,with the a category employees receiving higher pay.some employees,including burns,believed that bruns had placed the employees who went to talk to dunn in the b category because they were troublemakers.id.at.burns confronted bruns about the new pay plan,but bruns provided no explanation.
on january,county commissioner john grau came to burns house at burns request,to discuss certain concerns burns had regarding the department.in addition to the new pay plan,burns was concerned about why the department had traded a bulldozer for a caterpillar and why the department had traded a ford pickup for a chevy pickup.burns considered it strange that the department purchased the new caterpillar without testing it first.regarding the pickup trade,burns considered it suspicious that the bridge foreman,who had often ridden in the old ford pickup,purchased the ford when the department put it up for sale.
at his meeting with grau,burns began by discussing the equipment purchases.the conversation then turned to the new pay plan,and burns asked grau who was responsible for the decision.grau responded you can blame it on me.pressed further by burns,grau explained that we all made it.id.at.by all accounts,burns then became angry and called grau a lying motherfucker.appellant br.at appellees br.at.
what happened next is disputed by the parties.burns claims that grau lunged at him,backing burns up against grau truck,and burns put up his hand to keep him away.appellant app.at.burns also alleges that grau called him a no good indian.id.george uhl,another employee who was present during the meeting between grau and burns,confirms burns account of the altercation.grau gives a different account of events claiming that burns was the aggressor and that burns grabbed grau in the neck and shoulder area.grau denies calling burns a no good indian.id.at.both parties agree that the rest of the conversation was less heated and the two men parted in a seemingly amicable manner.
following this altercation,grau called supervisor ed bruns and reported what had happened,telling bruns that rick had asked him to stop by and he stopped by and rick got hot and cussed him and calling him names sic and grabbed him.id.at.grau told bruns what profane epithet burns had used,and explained that burns had been the aggressor,grabbing grau close to his neck and shoulder.grau explained to bruns that burns was upset about the pay plan and the equipment purchases,and told bruns that uhl had been present and shared some of the same concerns.on january,bruns met in person with grau,bridge foreman terry mick,and county counselor dunn.grau related the altercation in more detail,but said nothing about having called burns a indian.id.at.
after this meeting,supervisor bruns decided to terminate burns.on january,burns received the following letter from bruns 
the actions that you were involved in with jackson county commissioner john grau on january,near your home,were of such a serious nature as to result in the immediate termination of your employment with the jackson county road and bridge department.
such actions as reported to me would constitute gross misconduct,the threatening or committing of physical violence against the person of john grau,and other violations of your employment.
i want to advise you that you may have a hearing before the board of county commissioners concerning this termination of your employment.if you desire a hearing,please request one within ten days upon the receipt of this letter by calling the jackson county clerk office.
id.at.supervisor bruns never indicated that he was irritated by the fact that burns or anyone else had complained about trading a pickup truck,the purchase of a bulldozer,or the pay plan.
burns requested,and received,a hearing before the jackson county board of commissioners board,held on february.grau,the chairman,turned the meeting over to commissioner ellen schirmer because he had been involved in the incident,but grau did not abstain from voting.before voting,the commissioners consulted the minutes from a previous meeting,at which the board had delegated to the department supervisor the power to hire and fire department employees.after the minutes were reviewed,commissioner ogden moved to not terminate rick burns,but the motion died for the lack of a second.id.at.commissioner grau then moved to terminate rick burns.ellen schirmer seconded and the motion carried.ogden voted against the motion.id.thus,burns termination was upheld by a vote 
after the board declined to reinstate him,burns filed suit under and against the board,supervisor bruns,and commissioners grau and schirmer.in this suit,burns claims that his discharge was in retaliation for his exercise of first amendment rights on account of his native american heritage and therefore a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment defendants moved for summary judgment,which was granted by the district court.burns now appeals the grant of summary judgment to the defendants.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.simms,at.however,
a lthough the movant must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,he or she need not negate the nonmovant claim.once the movant carries this burden,the nonmovant can not rest upon his or her pleadings,but must bring forward specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial as to those dispositive matters for which he or she carries the burden of proof.the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmovant position is insufficient to create a dispute of fact that is genuine an issue of material fact is genuine only if the nonmovant presents facts such that a reasonable jury could find in favor of the nonmovant.if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute,we determine whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.
id.quotations and citations omitted.in first amendment cases in particular,an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.schalk gallemore,cir quotation omitted.
we proceed to consider the merits of burns claim under.burns raises two separate constitutional claims,which we now address.first,burns asserts that he was terminated because of his native american ethnicity,in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that burns had failed to show intentional discrimination under the test articulated by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d.
in reaching the conclusion that burns was not terminated because of his native american ethnicity,the district court relied in part on an apparent concession made by burns during his deposition.at his deposition,burns was questioned about the reasons for his termination,as follows 
do you think you were terminated because you part native american 
q.why do you think you were terminated 
that the question i never really ever get answered 
what your own opinion,though why do you believe you were terminated do you think it was because you called grau a lying motherfucker 
yeah,i say so.
appellant app.at emphasis added.in his deposition corrections filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e,burns changed the answers underlined above to no,i do think that was the only reason,and yeah,i say that was part of it.id.at.the district court disregarded burns attempt to rewrite portions of his deposition,citing franks nimmo,cir,and other cases.id.at.franks and the other cases cited by the district court deal with what are generally referred to as sham affidavits.
there is authority for the proposition that in determining whether a material issue of fact exists,an affidavit may not be disregarded because it conflicts with the affiant prior sworn statements.franks,at see also miller robins,cir holding that a n inconsistent affidavit may preclude summary judgment if the affiant was confused at the deposition and the affidavit explains those aspects of the deposition testimony charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at a witness affidavit will not be automatically excluded because it conflicts with the witness earlier or later deposition.we will disregard a contrary affidavit,however,when it constitutes an attempt to create a sham fact issue.franks,at.factors to be considered in determining whether an affidavit presents a sham issue include whether the affiant was during his earlier testimony,whether the affiant had access to the pertinent evidence at the time of his earlier testimony or whether the affidavit was based on newly discovered evidence,and whether the earlier testimony reflects confusion which the affidavit attempts to explain.id.
burns argues that franks and other cases dealing with sham affidavits are not relevant to the instant case,because he modified his statements not in a subsequent affidavit,but in an errata sheet submitted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e.we reject this distinction.in the recent case of garcia pueblo country club,cir,this court discussed the purpose of rule e.quoting greenway int l paper,we noted that t he rule can not be interpreted to allow one to alter what was said under oath.if that were the case,one could merely answer the questions with no thought at all then return home and plan artful responses.depositions differ from interrogatories in that regard.a deposition is not a take home examination.garcia,at quotation omitted.we stated that w e do not condone counsel allowing for material changes to deposition testimony and certainly do not approve of the use of such altered testimony that is controverted by the original testimony.id.
we see no reason to treat rule e corrections differently than affidavits,and we hold that burns attempt to amend his deposition testimony must be evaluated under franks.none of the three franks factors is satisfied in the instant case.first,burns was at his deposition.second,burns corrections were not based on any newly discovered evidence.third,although burns asserts that he was confused at his deposition,his answers to the direct questions posed by counsel do not reflect any obvious opposed to indecisiveness or the corrections would need to clarify.thus,the district court correctly disregarded burns testimony.see franks,at.
disregarding burns deposition corrections,however,does not automatically lead to the conclusion that he conceded his case in the uncorrected answers.earlier in his deposition,burns was asked if he told commissioner ogden why he was terminated 
q.did you tell ogden why you were terminated 
i do really know why i was terminated.
q.the letter tells you that you were terminated for your conduct on the meeting with grau on the,does it 
yeah,but that,that ai what happened.
appellant app.at emphasis added.at this point,burns testified that his actions at the meeting with grau were not the cause for his termination burns testimony at his deposition was internally inconsistent,and,given the summary judgment posture of this case,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to burns.see simms,at.thus,we hold that burns did not concede his case at his deposition,and we now evaluate whether burns has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the alleged racial motivation for his termination.
a plaintiff alleging discrimination on the basis of race may prove intentional discrimination through either direct evidence of discrimination,oral or written statements on the part of a defendant showing a discriminatory motivation or indirect,circumstantial evidence of discrimination.kendrick penske transp,cir.burns argued before the district court that grau alleged statement that he was a no good indian,together with two remarks about indians allegedly made by schirmer,constituted direct evidence of discrimination.the district court rejected this argument,and burns does not challenge this ruling on appeal.
a plaintiff who lacks direct evidence of discrimination may show discrimination through indirect evidence by relying on the framework articulated by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas,at.while mcdonnell douglas involved a title vii claim,its analysis applies equally to claims of race discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.english.dep t of,cir.
in order to survive summary judgment,a plaintiff relying on mcdonnell douglas bears an initial burden of establishing a prima facie case intended to eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory reasons that might account for the adverse employment action.id.at.if a prima facie case is made,the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the plaintiff.id.if the defendant successfully meets its burden of production,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to put forth evidence sufficient to allow a jury to find that the defendant reason is pretextual,that it is unworthy of belief.id.this requires a showing that the tendered reason for the employment decision was not the genuine motivating reason,but rather was a disingenuous or sham reason.mcknight kimberly clark,cir quotation omitted.
defendants do not dispute that burns has made a prima facie case,and the burden accordingly shifts to defendants to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge.defendants point to testimony by supervisor bruns that he fired burns for his altercation with grau,as well as the termination letter citing burns alleged threats of violence or actual violence against grau as a reason for his termination.this is a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for discharge.thus,the question is whether the proffered reason is pretextual.as evidence of pretext,burns points to comments allegedly made by commissioner schirmer as well as the no good indian comment allegedly made by commissioner grau.
burns cites two comments attributed to commissioner schirmer as supporting his contention that he was terminated on account of his race.first,burns testified at his deposition that
