king mountain tobacco company and the confederated tribes and bands of the yakama indian nation collectively appellants sued the attorney general of the state of washington for declaratory and injunctive relief from washington escrow statute.the escrow statute requires king mountain to place money into escrow to reimburse the state for health care costs related to the use of tobacco products.the amount placed in escrow is based on the number of cigarette sales made that are subject to state cigarette taxes.appellants argue that the yakama treaty of is an express federal law that exempts the yakama people from washington escrow statute.the state argues that the treaty does not preclude it from regulating tobacco products sold nationally and that,as a nondiscriminatory state law that is not expressly preempted by federal law,the escrow statute applies to king mountain.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state,and appellants appeal.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the treaty between the confederated tribes and bands of the yakama indian nation and the united states was negotiated and signed in.see treaty with the yakamas,stat.under the treaty,the people of the yakama nation agreed to cede a majority of their lands to the united states in return for certain reserved rights.id.the yakama nation also agreed to live on reserved lands held in trust by the united states.id.
king mountain tobacco company 
king mountain tobacco company is owned and operated by delbert wheeler,an enrolled member of the yakama nation.king mountain initially obtained all of its tobacco from an entity in north carolina.today,king mountain grows some of its tobacco and manufactures its tobacco products,in part,on trust lands within the boundaries of the yakama nation.in,approximately of the tobacco used in king mountain products was grown on trust lands.by,that amount had risen to.in,it rose again,to.
king mountain ships its tobacco crop to tennessee where it is threshed.from there,the tobacco is sent to a factory in north carolina where more tobacco is added to the reservation tobacco.this process is called blending.after blending is complete,the tobacco is sent back to the reservation.king mountain sells cigarettes and other tobacco products on the reservation,throughout washington,and in about sixteen other states.
washington escrow statute 
in,states,the district of columbia,and five united states territories settled a lawsuit against four major cigarette manufacturers,creating a master settlement agreement msa.the msa requires the manufacturers to make substantial annual cash payments to the settling states and territories,in perpetuity,to offset the increased cost to the health care system created by smoking.in return,the manufacturers obtained a release of specified past and future claims against them.
not all cigarette manufacturers joined the msa,either initially or later.the states feared that these manufacturers npms would become insolvent against future liability for health care costs.because of this concern,many states adopted escrow statutes.the escrow statutes require npms to either join the msa or pay into a qualified escrow fund.see.b.
washington adopted an escrow statute to offset health care costs caused by npms.id.for each qualifying unit of tobacco sold,npms must make a payment into an escrow fund.id.b.the npms earn interest on the escrow account balances.id.b.the money in the escrow account may be released only to pay a judgment or settlement as a refund to the npm for overpayment to the account or as a refund to the npm after the funds have been in the account for years.id.
king mountain initially complied with washington escrow statute but in,it filed this lawsuit to contest its obligation to comply.
c.the district court order 
appellants and the state filed for summary judgment in district court.appellants offered evidence of the yakama people understanding of the treaty to support their claim that the treaty is an express federal law that exempts king mountain activities from state economic regulation.the district court made findings regarding how washington escrow statute operates and regarding king mountain business.
the district court began its analysis by observing it is that a state can regulate i transactions conducted by native americans ii sales to persons other than native americans and iii impose certain requirements upon native americans in regulating those sales.it also explained,quoting mescalero apache tribe jones,absent express federal law to the contrary,indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.
the district court found that king mountain operations involve extensive activity and that the cigarettes and tobacco products produced by king mountain are not principally generated from the use of reservation land and resources.rejecting king mountain argument to the contrary,the district court concluded washington escrow statutes are state laws of general application.applying mescalero,the court ruled that king mountain ha d not met its burden of showing express federal law exempting its business from state regulation nor did it offer case authority invalidating application of any state escrow statute based on an indian treaty or any other federal law.the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment and denied appellants motion.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court order granting summary judgment de novo.ramsey united states,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.we also review de novo the interpretation and application of treaty text.cree flores,cir cree ii.underlying factual findings,including findings of historical fact,are reviewed for clear error.id.
discussion 
appellants argue that summary judgment in favor of the state was improper because the district court failed to consider evidence showing how the yakama people understood the treaty in.they also argue that the yakama treaty is express federal law exempting the yakama people from the washington escrow statute.in response,the state counters that its escrow statute is a nondiscriminatory law that applies to the yakama people activities because there is no express federal law that prevents its application.
the supreme court has explained absent express federal law to the contrary,indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.mescalero,at.accordingly,our court has explained a state authority to tax tribal members is limited depending on the subject and location of the tax.ramsey,at.we also have explained that federal laws,such as treaties,ordinarily must be interpreted in the light most favorable to indians 
when a court interprets a state taxation of indians activities,the court determines if there is an express federal law prohibiting the tax.the federal law must be interpreted in the light most favorable to the indians,and extrinsic evidence may be used to show the federal government and indians intent.unlike the federal standard,there is no requirement to find express exemptive language before employing the canon of construction favoring indians.
id.at.but even though legal ambiguities are resolved to the benefit of the indians,courts can not ignore plain language that,viewed in historical context and given a fair appraisal,clearly runs counter to a tribe later claims.or.dep t of fish wildlife klamath indian tribe,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
washington escrow statute is a nondiscriminatory law and king mountain activities are largely.
as an initial matter,mescalero requires that we determine whether washington escrow statute is discriminatory and whether king mountain activities go beyond the boundaries of the reservation.see at.appellants argue that washington escrow statute is discriminatory,without explaining what the statute discriminates against their citation to hunt washington state apple advertising commission,is inapposite because they provide no evidence to suggest that the washington escrow statute treats cigarette manufacturers differently than manufacturers.we conclude the district court correctly determined that washington escrow statute is nondiscriminatory.
appellants also argue that the district court erred by creating a new rule requiring courts to determine whether a product is principally generated from reservation land before extending the treaty protections.the district court found that king mountain operations involve extensive activity.it also found that the cigarettes and tobacco products produced by king mountain are not principally generated from the use of reservation land and resources.this was a proper application of mescalero by the district court,not a new test.it was appropriate for the court to make a preliminary determination about whether king mountain activities were for purposes of applying the test from mescalero.see ramsey,at.
the district court found that king mountain ships its tobacco crop to tennessee where it is threshed.then the tobacco is sent to a factory in north carolina where more tobacco is purchased and blended with reservation tobacco.in,less than half of the tobacco in king mountain products was grown on the reservation.after the blending process,the tobacco is sent back to the reservation,where much of it is made into cigarettes.king mountain sells its tobacco products throughout washington and in about sixteen other states.appellants do not argue that any of the district court factual findings were clearly erroneous,see cree ii,at,and we find no support for appellants implied argument that the district court clearly erred by finding that king mountain activities were largely.
having concluded that washington escrow statute is nondiscriminatory and that king mountain tobacco related activities take place largely,mescalero requires that we decide whether there is an express federal law that exempts king mountain activities from state economic regulation.see mescalero,at see also ramsey,at,cree waterbury,cir cree i.
b.the plain text of the yakama treaty does not create a federal exemption from washington escrow statute.
appellants argue that the district court erroneously applied the standard for determining whether a federal law,rather than a state law,applies to an indian tribe.they also argue that the yakama treaty is express federal law that exempts king mountain from washington escrow statute.the state responds that the district court correctly applied the mescalero test and concluded that the treaty is not an express federal law that exempts king mountain from state economic regulations.we agree with the state.
contrary to king mountain position,the district court did not apply the express exemptive language test for determining whether a federal law applies to the tribe.see ramsey,at explaining the differences between the express exemptive language test,which applies to federal laws,and the express federal law test,which applies to state laws.the district court applied the test from mescalero to determine whether there was an express federal law exempting king mountain business from state regulation.the district court did not engage in an exhaustive review of the meaning the yakama would have given to the treaty as of because it reasoned that king mountain can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that washington escrow statutes are in conflict with the treaty or federal law which would entitle plaintiffs to relief.
because the washington escrow statute is a nondiscriminatory law,appellants bear the burden of proving that the yakama treaty is an express federal law that exempts it from washington escrow statute.see,washington confederated tribes of colville indian reservation,the tribes,and not the state as the district court supposed,bear the burden of showing that the state recordkeeping requirements which they are challenging are invalid.a treaty can constitute such an express federal law.cree i,at.as we have noted,there is no requirement to find express exemptive language before employing the canon of construction favoring indians under the state standard.ramsey,at.but t he canon of construction regarding the resolution of ambiguities in favor of indians does not permit reliance on ambiguities that do not exist nor does it permit disregard of the clearly expressed intent of congress.south carolina catawba indian tribe,see also klamath indian tribe,at e ven though legal ambiguities are resolved to the benefit of the indians,courts can not ignore plain language that,viewed in historical context and given a fair appraisal,clearly runs counter to a tribe later claims.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the indian canon of construction does not alter the outcome in this case because the relevant text of the yakama treaty is not ambiguous and the plain language of the treaty does not provide a federal exemption from the washington escrow statute.
article ii of the yakama treaty does not constitute an express federal law that exempts king mountain from washington escrow statute.
article ii of the yakama treaty establishes the physical boundaries of the yakama reservation and prohibits from inhabiting reservation land unless an exception applies.article ii of the treaty reads in relevant part 
there is,however,reserved,from the lands above ceded for the use and occupation of the aforesaid confederated tribes and bands of indians,the tract of land included within the following boundaries,to wit description of the physical boundaries of the reservation 
all which tract shall be set apart and,so far as necessary,surveyed and marked out,for the exclusive use and benefit of said confederated tribes and bands of indians,as an indian reservation nor shall any white man,excepting those in the employment of the indian department,be permitted to reside upon the said reservation without permission of the tribe and the superintendent and agent.and the said confederated tribes and bands agree to remove to,and settle upon,the same,within one year after the ratification of this treaty.in the mean time it shall be lawful for them to reside upon any ground not in the actual claim and occupation of citizens of the united states and upon any ground claimed or occupied,if with the permission of the owner or claimant.
treaty with the yakamas,art.ii,stat.
appellants argue that,under the treaty the yakama people were to be the sole residents of the reserved lands use and occupation and were to be the sole beneficiaries of the resources cultivated on the reserved lands exclusive use and benefit.they conclude that as understood by the yakama,the treaty would preserve the tribe traditional practices of using their lands for growing tobacco and trading that product with other yakama and alike,without economic restrictions.
article ii defines the geographic boundaries of the yakama reservation,and reserves it for yakama use and benefit,while prohibiting from living on the reserved land.the use and occupation phrase describes the agreement that the reserved land would be dedicated for the yakama to live on and work on there is,however,reserved,from the lands above ceded for the use and occupation of the aforesaid confederated tribes and bands of indians,the tract of land included within the following boundaries.id.emphasis added.the exclusive use and benefit language concerns who may live on reservation land all which tract shall be set apart and,so far as necessary,surveyed and marked out,for the exclusive use and benefit of said confederated tribes and bands of indians,as an indian reservation nor shall any white man be permitted to reside upon the said reservation without permission id.emphasis added.
there is no ambiguity in article ii requiring us to decide how the treaty would be interpreted with regard to the rights of the yakama to trade outside the reservation.washington escrow statute does not interfere with
