background 
the alaska native claims settlement act,stat,codified at supp.iii,extinguished all claims of aboriginal title in alaska.ancsa divided alaska into twelve geographic regions and established a regional corporation for each.ancsa also established about village corporations,one for each native village entitled to receive land and funds under ancsa.then ancsa gave the village corporations the surface estates of about million acres of land.ancsa gave the regional corporations million acres of land in fee as well as the subsurface estates and timber rights for the million acres of the village corporations.bay view is a village corporation.
i required each regional corporation to share with the other regional corporations all revenues received by each regional corporation from the timber resources and subsurface estate patented to it pursuant to this act.section j required each regional corporation to share with the village corporations in the region a percentage for the first five years and thereafter of its income from certain sources,including revenues received under i.
the tax basis for the land or interests in land,such as timber,was set at the fair value of such land or interest in land at the time of receipt.c supp.iii.accordingly,the tax basis for the native corporations regional and village corporations assets were set in the early when they received the assets.the deficit reduction act defra exempted the native corporations from defra ban on sales of net operating loss nol deductions.when native corporations sold their natural resources in the,they often incurred operating losses because the value of those resources had decreased between the early and the.the native corporations sold these nols to profitable private corporations.the private corporations typically paid the native corporations about for a loss.these sales continued until,when the law changed to forbid further nol sales by native corporations.see technical and miscellaneous revenue act of,stat.
none of the regional corporations included the revenues received from nol sales in revenue sharing distributions.in,bay view filed a class action suit in the district of alaska seeking to compel the regional corporations to share the nol proceeds.the district court dismissed the action,holding that the village corporations could not enforce the ancsa provision against the regional corporations.bay view,ahtna,civ,july.while bay view appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit was pending in,congress amended.this new section i expressly states that revenues under do not include benefits received from losses incurred by a regional corporation.in other words,the new i clarified that the regional corporations do not have to share nol proceeds.the ninth circuit affirmed based on the amendment,noting that the new i was fully retroactive.bay view,ahtna,cir.
bay view then filed an action against the united states in the court of federal claims alleging that the amendment was a taking,a breach of trust,and a breach of contract.bay view argued that the amendment to section i of ancsa was a compensable taking under the fifth amendment.specifically,bay view contended that it had compensable vested rights in the regional corporations revenue from the nol sales under the provisions of ancsa.bay view considers nol revenue a shareable asset arising from natural resources under ancsa.
the court of federal claims held that the amendment was not a taking because the revenues received from nol sales were not revenues from the timber resources and subsurface estate.it further held that ancsa did not create a trust relationship mandating a payment of money for breach of trust.finally,the court of federal claims held that ancsa was not a contract or a treaty.even if ancsa was a contract or treaty,the trial court reasoned,the united states committed no breach because the regional corporations had never had an obligation to share nol revenues.accordingly,the court of federal claims dismissed the taking and breach of contract claims for failure to state a claim and dismissed the breach of trust claim for lack of jurisdiction.bay view timely appealed to this court,which has exclusive appellate jurisdiction.a.

in a takings analysis,a court first determines whether the plaintiff possesses a valid interest in the property affected by the governmental action,whether the plaintiff possesses a stick in the bundle of rights.if a plaintiff possesses a compensable property right,a court proceeds to determine whether the governmental action at issue constitutes a taking of that stick.karuk tribe of cal.ammon,citing m j coal united states.
under ancsa,a regional corporation must share revenue received from the timber resources and subsurface estate patented to it pursuant to this act.i supp.iii emphasis added.thus,bay view entitlement to compensatory property in this case depends on whether the money received by regional corporations from nol sales was from the underlying timber resources within the meaning of the statute.
in a distant sense,the nol proceeds have some connection to the timber resources.specifically,the sale of the resources generated nols the subsequent sale of nols produced these proceeds.the sale of the nols themselves,however,is a separate business transaction without any direct relationship to the tangible resources patented to the regional corporations.the regional corporation realized revenue from sale of nols because they found buyers and successfully negotiated sales of these intangible financial interests.the nols only existed in the first place because the regional corporations enjoyed a favorable tax status.accurately characterized,the nol proceeds are a product of the tax status of the regional corporations,not the product of timber resources.thus,applying the terms of ancsa,the nol sales generated revenues from sales of financial interests related to tax status,not from tangible timber or mineral estates.
stated in other words,private corporations that purchased nols from the regional corporations did not acquire any interest in timber or subsurface estates.rather,these private corporations paid for the right to consolidate their tax returns with the regional corporations to reduce their own tax liability.thus,the court of federal claims determined correctly that nol proceeds do not constitute revenues from the timber resources and subsurface estate.
