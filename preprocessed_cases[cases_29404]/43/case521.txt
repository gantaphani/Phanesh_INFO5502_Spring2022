since the days of john marshall,it has been a bedrock principle of federal indian law that every tribe is capable of managing its own affairs and governing itself.cherokee nation georgia,pet.see also worcester georgia,pet.stating that tribes are distinct,independent political communities,retaining their original natural rights.but tribes that want federal benefits must adhere to federal requirements.the gateway to some of those benefits is the indian reorganization act of the act,which requires tribes to organize their governments by adopting a constitution approved by the secretary of the interior secretary.see.
this case involves an attempt by a small cluster of people within the california valley miwok tribe cvm to organize a tribal government under the act.cvm chairwoman,silvia burley,and a group of her supporters adopted a constitution to govern the tribe without so much as consulting its membership.the secretary declined to approve the constitution because it was not ratified by anything close to a majority of the tribe.burley and her cvm sued the united states,claiming that the secretary refusal was unlawful and seeking a declaration that cvm is organized pursuant to because we conclude that the secretary lawfully refused to approve the proposed constitution,we affirm the district court dismissal of burley claim.burley also argues that the district court erred in denying her motions for leave to file supplemental claims for relief.we conclude that any such error was harmless.
indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory they are a separate people possessing the power of regulating their internal and social relations.united states mazurie,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.to qualify for federal benefits,however,tribes must meet conditions set by federal law.the most important condition is federal recognition,which is a formal political act confirming the tribe existence as a distinct political society,and institutionalizing the relationship between the tribe and the federal government.cohen handbook of federal indian law,at ed.the federal government has historically recognized tribes through treaties,statutes,and executive orders,but it does so today primarily by a standardized application process administered by the secretary.see generally pt.see also id.listing the factors the secretary must consider when deciding whether to recognize a tribe.among the federal benefits that a recognized tribe and its members may claim are the right to receive financial assistance under the snyder act,see authorizing the secretary to direct,supervise,and expend funds for a range of purposes including health and education,and the right to operate gaming facilities under the indian gaming regulatory act,see et 
once recognized,a tribe may qualify for additional federal benefits by organizing its government under the act.section of the act authorizes any tribe to adopt a constitution and bylaws,subject to the approval of the secretary of the interior.navajo tribe of indians,d.organization under vests in a tribe the power t o employ legal counsel to prevent the sale,disposition,lease,or encumbrance of tribal lands,interests in lands,or other tribal assets without the consent of the tribe and to negotiate with the federal,state,and local governments.e.and some governmental benefits may flow only to tribes organized under the act.for example,in this case the california gaming control distributes an annual payment to all tribes in the cvm allotment of approximately million when it learned that cvm was unorganized 
section of the act provides two ways a tribe may receive the secretary approval for its constitution.the first is,in effect,a safe harbor.section a says 
any indian tribe shall have the right to organize for its common welfare,and may adopt an appropriate constitution and bylaws,and any amendments thereto,which shall become effective when 
ratified by a majority vote of the adult members of the tribe or tribes at a special election authorized and called by the secretary under such rules and regulations as the secretary may prescribe and 
approved by the secretary pursuant to subsection d of this section.
a.pursuant to subsection a,the secretary has promulgated several rules governing special elections.see generally pt.compliance with these rules is a prerequisite for the secretary approval of a proposed constitution.among other things,the rules define voter eligibility,id,create boards,id,establish voting districts,id,describe procedures,id,stipulate conditions for election notices,id,set poll opening and closing times,id,and describe the criteria for ballots,id.according to subsection d,once shown that the proposed constitution is the product of the a process,the secretary shall approve the constitution within days after the election unless the secretary finds that the proposed constitution is contrary to applicable laws.d 
section h provides a second way to seek the secretary approval for a proposed constitution.unlike the extensive procedural requirements of a,under h a tribe may adopt a constitution using procedures of its own making 
notwithstanding any other provision of this act each indian tribe shall retain inherent sovereign power to adopt governing documents under procedures other than those specified in this section.
h.but this greater flexibility in process comes with a cost.section h does not provide a safe harbor.as discussed in detail in part iii,the central issue in this case is the extent of the secretary power to approve a constitution under this section.
cvm is a federally recognized indian tribe.see indian entities recognized and eligible to receive services from the united states bureau of indian affairs.it has a potential membership of but its current tribal by handpicked by only a tiny minority this case is the latest round of sparring between burley and the federal government over whether the tribe is organized under the act.burley efforts to organize the tribe began in when,pursuing the safe harbor procedure of a,she and a group of her supporters adopted a constitution and requested the secretary to call an election for its ratification.section c required the secretary to call an election on the proposed constitution within days.for reasons not apparent from the record,the secretary never called the election.rather than press the matter,burley withdrew her request for a vote on the constitution.
a second effort to organize came in,when burley group adopted a new constitution for the tribe.this time,burley bypassed the a process and instead sent the constitution directly to the secretary for approval.the secretary informed her that the constitution was defective and the tribe still unorganized.
perhaps relying on the old adage,burley made a third attempt in early.meanwhile,congress passed the native american technical corrections act,which added h.the secretary then responded to burley by rejecting her proposed constitution and explaining that she would need to at least attempt to involve the entire tribe in the organizational process before the secretary would give approval 
where a tribe that has not previously organized seeks to do so,the secretary also has a responsibility to determine that the organizational efforts reflect the involvement of the whole tribal community we have not seen evidence that such general involvement was attempted or has occurred with the purported organization of your tribe to our knowledge,the only persons of indian descent involved in the tribe organization efforts,were you and your two daughters.

burley,in cvm name,then sued the united states for its failure to recognize the tribe as organized.she also twice motioned for leave to file supplemental claims for relief.the district court dismissed the original complaint for failure to state a claim and also denied the motions for leave.
