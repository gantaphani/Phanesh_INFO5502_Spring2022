background 
as noted in our prior opinion,establishes federal jurisdiction over interracial crimes,those in which the defendant is an indian and the victim is a,or.see prentiss i,at see also felix cohen handbook of federal indian law at rennard strickland et,robert clinton,criminal jurisdiction over indian lands a journey through a jurisdictional maze.although the indictment in this case did not specify the status of either the victim or the defendant,the government now points to evidence regarding both elements.
with regard to the victim,the government observes that the parties presented the following stipulation to the jury 
the residence located at route,box tp,tesuque pueblo,new mexico,which defendant ricco devon prentiss resided on november and,is within the confines of the tesuque pueblo in indian country the above described residence owned by domingo vigil who is a member of the tesuque pueblo sic this stipulation may be entered into evidence as a trial exhibit.
rec.vol.iii,at.the named residence was the one involved in the alleged arson.
after reading the stipulation,the trial judge asked,so this takes from the jury the question of whether this occurred on indian land is that correct id.emphasis added.the prosecutor replied,yes,your honor,this is under.id.the court then stated,well,okay,so part of the instructions i give you will say that this incident occurred within the exterior boundaries of the tesuque pueblo in indian country,and that will one of the elements that the government has to prove,so that part of it has now been proved by this stipulation the parties entered into.so it no longer a question that you all say,well,was this indian land or not it was on indian land.id.at emphasis added.
the court instructions to the jury adopted this approach.they stated 
i n order for you to find the defendant guilty of arson as charged in the indictment,you must be convinced that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements t he defendant set fire to or burned,or attempted to set fire to or burn,a building or structure t hat building was within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states i n setting the fire or in burning the building or structure,the defendant acted willfully or maliciously.you are instructed that the tesuque pueblo is within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.
rec.vol.i,doc,inst.
aside from the stipulation,the only other evidence noted by the government as to the indian status of the alleged victims is brief testimony that vigil and cynthia dorame were members of the tesuque pueblo.see aple,filed july,at stating that lieutenant vigil of the tesuque pueblo police department testified that both prentiss wife,cynthia dorame,who lived in the house,and domingo vigil,who owned the house,were members of the pueblo and that dorame testified that she was a member of the pueblo.
as to the status of prentiss,the government relies solely on the testimony of lieutenant vigil.he stated that prentiss was not a member of the tesuque pueblo.
ii.discussion 
in light of this evidence,the government maintains,the indictment failure to allege the indian statuses of the victim and the defendant did not contribute to the jury determination that prentiss violated and.in order to prevail on that argument,the government is required to demonstrate that,in light of the evidence presented at trial,no jury could reasonably find that the victim of the crime was not an indian and that prentiss was not a.see neder,at.in other words,the se omitted element s must be uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence,such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error.id.at.see also united states,cir concluding that an indictment failure to allege an element of an offense was harmless because t here is no question that the petit jury would have found the omitted element had it been asked to do so,cert.denied,d 
the government argument turns on the meaning of the term indian under.as the parties note,that term is not defined in the statute or in related statutes addressing criminal jurisdiction in indian country.see cohen,supra,at stating that s everal important indian statutes,such as the federal criminal jurisdiction statutes,use the word indian without further definition.clinton,supra,at stating that the question of indian status for purposes of criminal jurisdiction is perplexing and that n o statutory definition currently exists to guide courts and practitioners in determining indian status under the federal criminal jurisdiction statutes.
in the absence of a statutory definition,this circuit has applied a test for determining whether a person is an indian for the purpose of establishing federal jurisdiction over crimes in indian country.we have concluded that,f or a criminal defendant to be subject to,the court must make factual findings that the defendant has some indian blood and is recognized as an indian by a tribe or by the federal government.scrivner tansy,cir quoting united states lawrence,cir that test has been applied by many other courts.see,united states keys,cir applying test in order to determine the status of the victim in a prosecution under united states torres,cir concluding that jury instruction setting forth that test was in accord with present federal law regarding what constitutes an indian for purposes of united states broncheau,cir applying and stating that the term indian has been judicially explicated over the years and that the test has been generally followed by the courts cloud united states,applying test state sebastian,applying two part test and stating that g enerally,the first racial prong of this test must be met as well as the second,prong lapier mccormick,expressly adopt ing the test,rejecting the defendant argument that he was an indian,and concluding that,as a result,the state court had jurisdiction over a criminal prosecution see generally cohen,supra,at lacking criteria other than the words of the statute,the courts have taken the position in this situation that the term indian means an individual who has indian blood and who is regarded as an indian by his or her tribe or indian community.a leading scholar has expressed support for this approach.see clinton,supra,at t he inquiry in all cases where indian status is in issue for jurisdictional purposes should be whether the person has some demonstrable biological identification as an indian and has been socially or legally recognized as an indian.emphasis added.
the test is derived from united states rogers,how.interpreting a predecessor of,the supreme court held that the defendant adoption into an indian tribe as an adult did not establish that he was an indian for
