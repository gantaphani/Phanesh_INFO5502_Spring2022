we hold that an unincorporated indian tribe such as appellee is not a citizen of a state within the meaning of the federal diversity statute,a,and thus can not sue or be sued in diversity.the district court dismissal of this action for want of subject matter jurisdiction is affirmed.
facts and procedural background 
appellee table mountain rancheria table mountain is a federally recognized indian tribe located in fresno county,california,where it owns and operates a casino on reservation land.neither the tribe nor the casino is incorporated under federal,state or tribal law.the parties entered a contract through which appellant american vantage companies,american vantage,a nevada corporation,provided gaming management and consulting services to the tribe in connection with operation of the casino.the contract states that the tribe waives its sovereign immunity from suit solely for the purposes of enforcement of the terms of this agreement and that either party to this agreement may seek appropriate relief in a united states district court,unless the parties agree to an alternate forum,for the breach of the agreement.the tribe also executed a promissory note in favor of american vantage.
table mountain unilaterally terminated the contract in,a year before its expiration,prompting american vantage to file suit against table mountain in federal district court in california for breach of contract and for amounts allegedly due under the promissory note.american vantage complaint asserted subject matter jurisdiction solely on the basis of diversity of citizenship.the district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint without prejudice for want of subject matter jurisdiction,holding that the parties were not diverse within the meaning of a because an indian tribe is not a citizen of any state.the court also invited the parties to file additional pleadings setting forth a basis for jurisdiction.in response,american vantage moved to amend its complaint and to join the casino as an additional defendant.again,it asserted only diversity jurisdiction.the district court reiterated its ruling that diversity jurisdiction did not exist as to the tribe ruled that the casino,an unincorporated arm of the tribe,likewise could not be sued in diversity and dismissed the action with prejudice.american vantage timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.

discussion 
diversity jurisdictiona.
we must determine whether the table mountain tribe or its casino,each of which is unincorporated,is subject to diversity jurisdiction the diversity statute,makes no mention of indian tribes.american vantage,however,contends that an indian tribe is subject to diversity jurisdiction under a,which creates jurisdiction over actions involving citizens of different states.the parties agree that american vantage is a citizen of nevada but dispute whether the tribe and the casino are citizens of california within the meaning of a.
most courts to have considered the the first,second,eighth and tenth that unincorporated indian tribes can not sue or be sued in diversity because they are not citizens of any state.ninigret dev.narragansett indian wetuomuck hous,cir holding that the presence of an indian tribe destroys complete diversity because a n indian tribe is not considered to be a citizen of any state accord romanella hayward,cir per curiam gaines ski apache,cir standing rock sioux indian tribe dorgan,cir viejas group baron long capitan grande band of digueno mission indians,d,calumet gaming,kickapoo tribe,holding that court lacked diversity jurisdiction over gaming consultant state law claims against indian tribe for breach of consulting agreement and default on loan abdo fort randall casino,holding that neither indian tribes nor a tribally owned and operated casino are citizens of state for purposes of diversity william canby,american indian law ed hereinafter canby an indian tribe that is not incorporated is not a citizen of any state and can not be sued in federal court on the basis of diversity.felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law reprint ed.
against this weight of authority,a few district courts have decided otherwise.see warn band of cherokee indians,holding that the court had diversity jurisdiction over a breach of contract claim by a against the tribe and tribal council members tribal smokeshop,tribes,d,stating that indian tribes are deemed to be citizens of the state in which they are located for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction.
american vantage points out that the decisions underlying the majority rule offer little in the way of reasoning in support of their conclusion that an indian tribe is not a citizen of any state.we nonetheless agree that the majority of courts have decided this question correctly and adopt the majority rule.we base our conclusion on several considerations.first,as dependent domestic sovereign nations,indian tribes are not state citizens.second,despite ample opportunity,congress has not seen fit to confer state citizenship on indian tribes.finally,because our holding is consistent with every other circuit to address this issue,we advance the interest of uniformity in a uniquely federal area of law.
dependent domestic sovereigns 
first,the rule that a tribe is not a citizen of any state is supported by the status of indian tribes as dependent domestic sovereigns.tribes are,foremost,sovereign nations.they retain their original natural rights as aboriginal entit ies antedating the federal and state government s.romanella,at.second,indian tribes are domestic dependent nations.tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe,d.there exists a unique relationship between the federal government and indian tribes,and the federal government possesses plenary power over tribes.see,washington confederated bands and tribes of yakima indian nation,d marshall,dissenting describing the unique relationship between the federal government and the indian people united states wheeler,d stating that indian tribes sovereignty exists only at the sufferance of congress and is subject to complete defeasance.
the status of indian tribes as sovereign entities,and as federal dependents,contradicts conventional notions of citizenship in general and state citizenship in particular.a citizen is a person who is a member of a political community,owing allegiance to the community and being entitled to enjoy all its civil rights and protections black law dictionary ed.tribes fall outside this definition.rather than belonging to state political communities,they themselves are distinct,independent political communities.santa clara pueblo martinez,d quoting worcester georgia,pet.tribes also owe no allegiance to a state.because congress possesses plenary power over indian affairs,south dakota yankton sioux tribe,d,indian tribes fall under nearly exclusive federal,rather than state,control.washington confederated tribes of colville reservation,d i t must be remembered that tribal sovereignty is dependent on,and subordinate to,only the federal government,not the states.moreover,tribal sovereignty and federal plenary power over indian affairs,taken together,sharply circumscribe the power of the states to impose responsibilities on indian tribes.see canby,supra,at observing that tribal sovereignty has operated to a considerable degree as a shield against intrusions of state law into indian country boyer indian tribes,idaho,summarizing traditional view that state law has no force and effect,except as granted by federal law,within the territory of an indian tribe in matters affecting indians.thus,for instance,states possess limited power to assert jurisdiction on indian land and to tax and regulate indian affairs 
furthermore,domestic sovereigns are not citizens of states for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.the domestic sovereigns can not sue or be sued in diversity,romanella,at,because they are not citizens of any state.moor county of alameda,d.the rule that american vantage urges would result in disharmony in the treatment of domestic sovereigns 
congressional intent 
second,congress has not manifested an intent to confer state citizenship on indian tribes.for much of this nation history,indians as persons were not considered citizens of a state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.iowa mut.ins.laplante,d.that changed in,when congress extended federal citizenship to indians.id.by operation of the fourteenth amendment,that act also created state citizenship for indians.id.in contrast to congress treatment of indians as individuals,no act of congress has spoken to,let alone created,state or national citizenship for indian tribes.
we also find it implausible that congress intended the diversity statute to reach unincorporated indian tribes.when the diversity statute was first enacted in,it made no mention of indians,and it is unlikely that congress had the future status of the indian tribes in mind.superior oil merritt.in the ensuing years,congress indisputably has had indian tribes in mind,and has amended the diversity statute on numerous occasions.yet the statute continues to make no mention of indian tribes.notably,congress has revisited the diversity statute several times since the courts have construed a to exclude indian tribes,but has manifested no inclination to overrule that interpretation.see,stat,title ii,a,a,a,stat,title ii,a,stat.
we also find instructive the maine indian claims settlement act of.the settlement act expressly subjects maine indian tribes to diversity jurisdiction.akins penobscot nation,cir.had congress believed the diversity statute covered indian tribes,the explicit command of the settlement act,providing that maine tribes may sue and be sued in the courts of the united states to the same extent as any other entity or person residing in the state of maine may sue and be sued in those courts,d,would have been superfluous.it is a principle of statutory construction that legislative enactments should not be construed to render their provisions mere surplusage.dunn commodity futures trading comm n,d.we will not,therefore,read d as a redundant enactment of a.
uniformity of federal law 
third,although we are by no means compelled to follow the decisions of other circuits,there is virtue in uniformity of federal law as construed by the federal circuits.james sunrise,cir.where,as here,every other circuit to have addressed an important question of federal law has reached a common result,we give some weight to the interest in uniformity.
we therefore join four other circuits in holding that an unincorporated indian tribe is not a citizen of any state within the meaning of a table mountain,as an unincorporated tribe,is not a citizen of california or any other state,so complete diversity in this action does not exist.american vantage can not alter that fact by joining the tribe casino as an additional defendant.the casino,as an unincorporated arm of the tribe,also is a stateless entity.see ninigret,at we see no reason why an arm of the tribe,not separately incorporated should be treated any differently from the tribe for jurisdictional purposes.gaines,at 
american vantage argues in the alternative that table mountain or the casino is a citizen of california because it has waived immunity from suit,behaves like a corporation or is an unincorporated association.we reject each of these arguments as well.
waiver of immunity 
relying on the historical progression of indian law,american vantage contends that table mountain should be considered a citizen of california because it waived sovereign immunity for disputes arising from the contract.american vantage says,in essence,that a tribe should be treated as a corporation and thus as a citizen when it consents to suit.
we acknowledge there is an historical connection between waiver of immunity and incorporation of indian tribes.when congress enacted section of the indian reorganization act of,giving tribes the power to incorporate,it did so in part to enable tribes to waive sovereign immunity,thereby facilitating business transactions and fostering tribal economic development and independence.see mescalero apache tribe jones,d majority opinion stating purpose of act to encourage tribal enterprises to enter into the white world on a footing of equal competition internal quotation marks and citations omitted id.at.douglas,dissenting in part observing that one of the primary purposes of the act was to permit indian tribes to equip themselves with the devices of modern business organization,through forming themselves into business corporations,parker drilling metlakatla indian,observing that congress enacted section r ecognizing that the protection of sovereign immunity would put the indian tribe at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining credit and entering into business transactions.but we reject the notion that this historical connection between waiver of immunity and incorporation means that a waiver of immunity creates de facto incorporation,let alone de facto state citizenship.
a tribe that elects to incorporate does not automatically waive its tribal sovereign immunity by doing so.see parker drilling.at see also ransom regis mohawk educ.cmty.fund,canby,supra,at.and it is not the act of waiving immunity that makes the incorporated tribe a citizen of its state of incorporation,but rather its voluntary acceptance of the rights and responsibilities attendant to formal incorporation.today,under modern indian law,a tribe may elect to waive immunity without table mountain did here see canby,supra,at a tribe may waive its sovereign immunity by contract.but that election is not tantamount to a tribal decision to submit to corporate obligations as if it had also elected to incorporate.we therefore reject the contention that a tribe waiver of sovereign immunity creates state citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes.see weeks,oglala sioux hous,cir holding that a tribal agency waiver of sovereign immunity does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal court.
acting in a commercial capacity 
american vantage next argues that the casino,although not incorporated,should be treated as a thus as a it is acting like a corporation.again,american vantage cites no persuasive authority supporting its argument two circuits have addressed similar arguments and rejected them.in ninigret dev.narragansett indian wetuomuck hous,cir,the first circuit held that an unincorporated housing authority functioning as an arm of a tribe was not a citizen of any state for jurisdictional purposes even though it embarked upon a series of business transactions.id.at.the tenth circuit in gaines ski apache,cir,addressed a negligence action against a tribe for an accident occurring at ski apache,the tribe unincorporated,ski resort.rejecting the argument that the resort was subject to diversity jurisdiction because it was the functional equivalent of a corporation,id.at,the court observed that the supreme court has rejected attempts to treat entities in the nature of corporations as corporations for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.id.at citing united steelworkers of am.bouligny,d t he relevant question for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is whether ski apache has been incorporated,not whether it is an economic enterprise of the tribe.id.
the supreme court decision in kiowa tribe manufacturing technologies,d,buttresses the reasoning of the first and tenth circuits.there,a payee brought suit to recover on a promissory note executed by an indian tribe,and the tribe moved to dismiss based on sovereign immunity.the payee argued that the tribe should be prevented from taking advantage of immunity from suit because the note was related to commercial activities.conceding that it might be unfair to unsuspecting tort victims and business partners to permit a tribe to engage in commercial activities while retaining sovereign immunity,id.at,the court nonetheless held that a tribe is not stripped of sovereign immunity merely because it engages in commercial activities.id.at.that reasoning applies with equal force here.a tribe does not shed immunity merely by embarki
