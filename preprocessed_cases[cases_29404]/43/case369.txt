this is a case about the ancient human remains of a man who hunted and lived,or at least journeyed,in the columbia plateau an estimated to years ago,a time predating all recorded history from any place in the world,a time before the oldest cities of our world had been founded,a time so ancient that the pristine and untouched land and the primitive cultures that may have lived on it are not deeply understood by even the most men and women of our age.seeking the opportunity of study,a group of scientists as plaintiffs in this case brought an action against,inter alia,the united states department of the interior,challenging various indian tribes claim to one of the most important american anthropological and archaeological discoveries of the late twentieth century,and challenging the interior department decision honoring the tribes claim.the discovery that launched this contest was that of a human skeleton,estimated by carbon dating to be to years old,known popularly and commonly as kennewick man,but known as the ancient one to some american indians who now inhabit regions in washington,idaho,and oregon,roughly proximate to the site on the columbia river at kennewick,washington,where the bones were found.from the perspective of the scientists plaintiffs,this skeleton is an irreplaceable source of information about early new world populations that warrants careful scientific inquiry to advance knowledge of distant times.yet,from the perspective of the tribes the skeleton is that of an ancestor who,according to the tribes religious and social traditions,should be buried immediately without further testing.
plaintiffs filed this lawsuit seeking to stop the transfer of the skeleton by the government to the tribes for burial,and the district court held in favor of the the secretary of the interior and the tribes appeal.we have jurisdiction under and affirm the judgment of the district court barring the transfer of the skeleton for immediate burial and instead permitting scientific study of the skeleton.
in july,teenagers going to a boat race discovered a human skull and bones near the shore of the columbia river just outside kennewick,washington the remains were found on federal property under the management of the united states army corps of engineers corps and,at the request of the county coroner,were removed for analysis by an anthropologist,james chatters,pursuant to an archaeological resources protection act of arpa,permit.because of physical features such as the shape of the skull and facial bones,anthropologists at first thought the remains were those of an early european settler.but the anthropologists then found a stone projectile point embedded in the skeleton upper hip bone.the object design,when viewed with and ct scans of the hip,resembled a style that was common before the documented arrival of europeans in the region.further study of the remains revealed characteristics unlike those of a european settler,yet also inconsistent with any american indian remains previously documented in the region.a minute quantity of metacarpal bone was radiocarbon dated.the laboratory estimated the age of the bones to be between and years old 
the skeleton attracted attention because some of its physical features,such as the shape of the face and skull,differed from those of modern american indians.many scientists believed the discovery might shed light on the origins of humanity in the americas.on august,douglas owsley,division head for physical anthropology at the smithsonian institution in washington,made arrangements for chatters to bring this important find to the smithsonian national museum of natural history for further study 
indian tribes from the area of the columbia river opposed scientific study of the remains on religious and social grounds four indian groups the tribal claimants demanded that the remains be turned over to them for immediate burial.the tribal claimants based their demand on the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra,et.the corps agreed with the tribal claimants and,citing nagpra,seized the remains on september,shortly before they could be transported to the smithsonian.the corps also ordered an immediate halt to dna testing,which was being done using the remainder of the bone sample that had been submitted earlier for radiocarbon dating.after investigation,the corps decided to give the remains to the tribal claimants for burial.as required by nagpra,the corps published a notice of intent to repatriate human remains in a local newspaper on september,and september.
the scientists and others,including the smithsonian institution,objected to the corps decision,arguing that the remains were a rare discovery of national and international significance.in late september and early october,several scientists asked major general ernest herrell,commander of the corps north pacific division,to allow qualified scientists to study the remains.
the scientists did not convince the corps to permit them to study the remains,and commenced this litigation on october,in the united states district court for the district of oregon.in an opinion issued june,the district court denied the corps motion for summary judgment,finding that the corps had acted before it had all of the evidence,did not fully consider or resolve certain difficult legal questions,and assumed facts that proved to be erroneous.bonnichsen ii.the district court vacated the corps earlier decision on disposition of the remains and remanded the case to the corps for further proceedings.id.at.the district court also denied,without prejudice,plaintiffs motion to study the remains and directed the corps to consider,on remand,whether to grant p laintiffs request under arpa for permission to study the remains.id.at.
on march,the corps and the secretary of the interior entered into an agreement that effectively assigned to the secretary responsibility to decide whether the remains were native american under nagpra,and to determine their proper disposition.the department of the interior then assumed the role of lead agency on this case.
almost two years after this matter was remanded,the secretary experts began to examine the remains in detail.the experts estimated that kennewick man was to tall,to years of age when he died,and to years old when the projectile point became embedded in his hip.the experts could not determine,from examination of the skeleton alone,when kennewick man lived.however,analysis of sediment layers where the skeleton was found supported the hypothesis that the remains dated back not less than years ago and kennewick man could have lived more than years ago the date indicated by the initial radiocarbon dating of the skeleton.further study of the sediment was recommended,but the corps decision to bury the discovery site in april prevented completion of those studies 
the experts compared the physical characteristics of the,measurements of the skull,teeth,and corresponding measurements from other skeletons.they concluded that kennewick man remains were unlike those of any known population,american indian or otherwise.
the secretary experts cautioned,however,that an apparent lack of physical resemblance between the kennewick man remains and american indians did not completely rule out the possibility that the remains might be biologically ancestral to modern american indians.moreover,although kennewick man morphological traits did not closely resemble those of modern american indian populations,the secretary experts noted that kennewick man physical attributes are generally consistent with the very small number of human remains from this period that have been found in north america.
relying solely on the age of the remains and the fact that the remains were found within the united states,on january,the secretary pronounced kennewick man remains native american within nagpra meaning.and on september,the secretary determined that a preponderance of the evidence supported the conclusion that the kennewick remains were culturally affiliated with indian tribes.for this reason,the secretary announced his final decision to award kennewick man remains to a coalition of the tribal claimants.the corps and the secretary also denied plaintiffs request to study the remains.
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the district court challenging the secretary decisions.the district court again ruled in plaintiffs favor.as pertinent to this appeal,the district court vacated the secretary decisions as contrary to the administrative procedure act,a apa,on the ground that the secretary improperly concluded that nagpra applies bonnichsen iii,d.the district court also held that,because nagpra did not apply,plaintiffs should have the opportunity to study kennewick man remains under arpa.defendants and the tribal claimants appealed,and we stayed the district court order granting study of the remains pending our decision herein 
we first address an issue of jurisdiction.the tribal claimants argue that we lack jurisdiction because plaintiffs alleged injuries are not redressable by court action,and plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims alleging violations of nagpra because plaintiffs do not seek to invoke interests within the zone of interests protected by nagpra.
as a general rule,the three constitutional standing requirements are imposed by the case or controversy provision of article iii 
that the plaintiff have suffered an injury in fact that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
bennett spear,d.the tribal claimants do not dispute that plaintiffs meet the first two constitutional standing requirements,and we so hold.but the tribal claimants argue that plaintiffs do not meet the third requirement.the tribal claimants contend that plaintiffs can not show that the alleged injury,losing the opportunity to study kennewick man remains,would be redressed by a favorable court decision because,the tribal claimants contend,nagpra,not arpa,applies to this case,precluding redress of plaintiffs alleged injury.stated another way,defendants theory is that plaintiffs injury is not redressable because plaintiffs are not entitled to relief.
this argument is incorrect.the question in deciding whether a plaintiff injury is redressable is not whether a favorable decision is likely but whether a favorable decision likely will redress a plaintiff injury.see bennett,at.in deciding whether a plaintiff injury is redressable,courts assume that plaintiff claim has legal merit.see hall norton,cir the purpose of the standing doctrine is to ensure that the plaintiff has a concrete dispute with the defendant,not that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail against the defendant.were the rule otherwise,courts would never have jurisdiction to entertain a lawsuit that appeared,at the pleading stage,and before evidence was considered,likely to fail on the merits.such a rule would be illogical.
here,if nagpra does not apply as we must assume in determining whether plaintiffs have standing,arpa applies,per the district court ruling.kennewick man remains are of archaeological significance and were collected pursuant to an arpa permit.neither appellant disputes that arpa gives plaintiffs the opportunity to study kennewick man remains if nagpra does not apply.we conclude that it is likely that plaintiffs injury will be redressed by a favorable decision on the nagpra issue,and thus plaintiffs have constitutional standing.
second,the tribal claimants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims alleging violations of nagpra because plaintiffs do not seek to invoke interests within the zone of interests that nagpra protects.the tribal claimants urge that congress enacted nagpra only with the interests of american indians in mind,so only american indians or indian tribes can file suit alleging violations of nagpra.we reject this argument.
the zone of interests test invoked by the tribal claimants is a prudential standing requirement,independent of the three immutable constitutional standing requirements of article iii.see bennett,at.congress can modify or abrogate the zone of interests test,see,and congress did exactly that in nagpra broadly worded enforcement section.that statute,provides that t he united states district courts shall have jurisdiction over any action brought by any person alleging a violation of this chapter.section by its terms broadly confers jurisdiction on the courts to hear any action brought by any person alleging a violation.id.emphasis added.
the supreme court has held that such broad statutory language effectively negates the prudential zone of interests test.in bennett,the court decided to take the term any person at face value,and held that any person could enforce the endangered species act,which provides that any person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf to enjoin any person alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter.at.g.in trafficante metropolitan life ins,d,the court held that standing was expanded to the full extent permitted under article iii by the civil rights act of.that statute provided,a ny person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice may sue.a ed.emphasis added.
like the statutes at issue in bennett and trafficante,of nagpra contains the broad any person formulation and includes no textual limitation on federal court jurisdiction.moreover,does not contain the more restrictive formulations congress sometimes uses to limit standing.see,b authorizing suit only by competitors,customers,or subsequent purchasers.we hold that does not limit jurisdiction to suits brought by american indians or indian tribes.any person means exactly that,and may not be interpreted restrictively to mean only any american indian person or any indian tribe.
it is true that plaintiffs are seeking to prevent the secretary from repatriating human remains,rather than to compel the secretary to repatriate them.but the any person formulation applies to all causes of action authorized by.the formulation applies not only to actions against the secretary asserting of nagpra,but also to actions against the secretary asserting.see bennett,at.t he any person formulation applies to all the causes of action authorized by the endangered species act not only to actions against the secretary asserting underenforcement but also to actions against the secretary asserting overenforcement.we conclude that we have jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims that nagpra was violated 
our review of the secretary decision to transfer kennewick man to the tribal claimants is governed by the apa,which instructs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
nagpra vests ownership or control of newly discovered native american human remains in the decedent lineal descendants or,if lineal descendants can not be ascertained,in a tribe affiliated with the remains.a.nagpra mandates a analysis.the first inquiry is whether human remains are native american within the statute meaning.if the remains are not native american,then nagpra does not apply.however,if the remains are native american,then nagpra applies,triggering the second inquiry of determining which persons or tribes are most closely affiliated with the remains.
the parties dispute whether the remains of kennewick man constitute native american remains within nagpra meaning.nagpra defines human remains as native american if the remains are of,or relating to,a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous to the united states.the text of the relevant statutory clause is written in the present tense of,or relating to,a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous.thus the statute unambiguously requires that human remains bear some relationship to a presently existing tribe,people,or culture to be considered native american.
it is axiomatic that,in construing a statute,courts generally give words not defined in a statute their ordinary or natural meaning.united states,d see also williams taylor,d holding that courts give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import internal quotation marks omitted.
in the context of nagpra,we conclude that congress use of the present tense is significant the present tense in general represents present time.pence and emery,a grammar of present day english ed.congress,by using the phrase is indigenous in the present tense,referred to presently existing tribes,peoples,or cultures.we must presume that congress gave the phrase is indigenous its ordinary or natural meaning,at.we conclude that congress was referring to presently existing indian tribes when it referred to a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous to the united states.emphasis added 
nagpra also protects graves of persons not shown to be of current tribes in that it protects disjunctively remains of,or relating to current indigenous tribes.thus,nagpra extends to all remains that relate to a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous to the united states,see defining human remains as native american if they are of,or relating to,a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous to the united states emphasis added.
our conclusion that nagpra language requires that human remains,to be considered native american,bear some relationship to a presently existing tribe,people,or culture accords with nagpra purposes.as regards newly discovered human remains,nagpra was enacted with two main goals to respect the burial traditions of american indians and to protect the dignity of the human body after death.nagpra was intended to benefit modern american indians by sparing them the indignity and resentment that would be aroused by the despoiling of their ancestors graves and the study or the display of their ancestors remains.see,at for many years,indian tribes have attempted to have the remains and funerary objects of their ancestors returned to them.emphasis added.
congress purposes would not be served by requiring the transfer to modern american indians of human remains that bear no relationship to them.yet,that would be the result under the secretary construction of the statute,which would give native american status to any remains found within the united states regardless of age and regardless of lack of connection to existing indigenous tribes the exhumation,study,and display of ancient human remains that are unrelated to modern american indians was not a target of congress aim,nor was it precluded by nagpra.
nagpra was also intended to protect the dignity of the human body after death by ensuring that native american graves and remains be treated with respect.see,at the committee believes that human remains must at all times be treated with dignity and respect,at some indian representatives testified that the spirits of their ancestors would not rest until they are returned to their homeland emphasis added.congress purpose is served by requiring the return to american indians of human remains that bear some significant relationship to them.
despite the statute language and legislative history,the secretary argues that the district court interpretation improperly collapses nagpra first inquiry asking whether human remains are native american into nagpra second inquiry asking which american indians or indian tribe bears the closest relationship to native american remains.the secretary is mistaken.though nagpra two inquiries have some commonality in that both focus on the relationship between human remains and indians,the two inquiries differ significantly.the first inquiry requires only a general finding that remains have a significant relationship to a presently existing tribe,people,or culture,a relationship that goes beyond features common to all humanity.the second inquiry requires a more specific finding that remains are most closely affiliated to specific lineal descendants or to a specific indian tribe.the district court interpretation of nagpra preserves the statute two distinct inquiries.because the record shows no relationship of kennewick man to the tribal claimants,the district court was correct in holding that nagpra has no application.
the secretary finally argues that,under chevron natural res.def.council,d,we must defer to the secretary interpretation of native american.the secretary by regulation has defined native american to mean of,or relating to,a tribe,people,or culture indigenous to the united states.d.the secretary regulation,enacted through notice and comment rulemaking,defines native american exactly as nagpra defines it,with one critical exception the regulation omits the present tense phrase that is.compare a culture that is indigenous to the united states emphasis added with d a culture indigenous to the united states emphasis added.we hold,for the reasons discussed above,that nagpra requirement that native american remains bear some relationship to a presently existing tribe,people,or culture is unambiguous,and that the secretary contrary interpretation therefore is not owed chevron deference.see chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.see also wilderness soc y united states fish wildlife,wl,at cir,en banc if,under these canons,or other traditional means of determining congress intentions,we are able to determine that congress spoke clearly,then we may not defer to the agency contrary interpretation.moreover,the secretary regulation conflicts with nagpra plain language and so is invalid for that reason.see whitman am.trucking ass ns,d holding that chevron deference is due only to a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted pub.employees ret.of ohio betts,d n o deference is due to agency interpretations at odds with the plain language of the statute itself.finally,the common maxim of statutory construction that we must give effect,if possible,to every word congress used is fatal to the secretary attempt to amend nagpra by removing the phrase that is.see bennett,at.it is the cardinal principle of statutory construction that courts must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.we hold that,notwithstanding d,nagpra requires that human remains bear a significant relationship to a presently existing tribe,people,or culture to be considered native american.the district court did not err in reaching that conclusion.
the requirement that we must give effect,if possible,to every word congress used supports our holding that human remains must be related to a currently existing tribe to come within nagpra protection.under the secretary view of nagpra,all graves and remains of persons,predating european settlers,that are found in the united states would be native american,in the sense that they presumptively would be viewed as remains of a deceased from a tribe indigenous to the united states,even if the tribe had ceased to exist thousands of years before the remains were found,and even if there was no showing of any relationship of the remains to some existing tribe indigenous to the united states.such an extreme interpretation,as was urged by the secretary here,see supra note,would render superfluous nagpra alternative relating to method for establishing remains as native american,if remains are of,or relating to,a tribe that is indigenous to the united states.if accepted,the secretary interpretation would mean that the finding of any remains in the united states in and of itself would automatically render these remains native american.this interpretation would leave no meaning for the relating to clause,unless we were to interpret the clause to cover remains found outside the united states.but we can not conclude that congress intended an absurd result,for congress could not be considered to have jurisdiction over disposition of human remains found in some other country.by reading nagpra definition of native american literally,meaning is given to each of its terms.some remains may be covered because they are remains of a tribe,people,or culture that is indigenous,while other remains may be covered because they are related to a currently existing indigenous tribe,people,or culture.
our analysis is strengthened by contrasting the statutory definition of the adjective native american to the statutory definition of the noun native hawaiian.under,native american means of,or relating to,a tribe,people or culture that is indigenous to the united states.emphasis added.under,native hawaiian means any individual who is a descendant of the aboriginal people who,prior to,occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now constitutes the state of hawaii.emphasis added.
the united states is a political entity that dates back to.owings speed,wheat.this term supports that congress use of the present tense that is indigenous referred to tribes,peoples,and cultures that exist in modern times,not to those that may have existed thousands of years ago but who do not exist now.by contrast,when congress chose to harken back to earlier times,it described a geographic location the area that now constitutes the state of hawaii rather than a political entity the united states.
our conclusion that nagpra requires human remains to bear some relationship to a presently existing tribe,people,or culture to be considered native american is also reinforced by how nagpra defines sacred objects.nagpra defines sacred objects as specific ceremonial objects which are needed by traditional native american religious leaders for the practice of traditional native american religions by their present day adherents.c emphasis added.a literal reading of this definition reveals that any artifact to be deemed a sacred object must be connected to the practice of an american indian religion by peoples.this reading is consistent with our reading of native american that is,just as there must be a relationship between an artifact and a presently existing peoples for the artifact to be a sacred object under nagpra,there must be a relationship between a set of remains and a presently existing tribe,people,or culture for those remains to be native american under nagpra.
although nagpra does not specify precisely what kind of a relationship or precisely how strong a relationship ancient human remains must bear to modern indian groups to qualify as native american,nagpra legislative history provides some guidance on what type of relationship may suffice.the house committee on interior and insular affairs emphasized in its report on nagpra that the statute was being enacted with american indians identifiable ancestors in mind.see,at indian representatives testified that the spirits of their ancestors would not rest until they are returned to their homeland emphasis added id.at for many years,indian tribes have attempted to have the remains and funerary objects of their ancestors returned to them.emphasis added.human remains that are to years old and that bear only incidental genetic resemblance to american indians,along with incidental genetic resemblance to other peoples,can not be said to be the indians ancestors within congress meaning.congress enacted nagpra to give american indians control over the remains of their genetic and cultural forebearers,not over the remains of people bearing no special and significant genetic or cultural relationship to some presently existing indigenous tribe,people,or culture.
the age of kennewick man remains,given the limited studies to date,makes it almost impossible to establish any relationship between the remains and presently existing american indians.at least no significant relationship has yet been shown.we can not give credence to an interpretation of nagpra advanced by the government and the tribal claimants that would apply its provisions to remains that have at most a tenuous,unknown,and unproven connection,asserted solely because of the geographical location of the find.
finally,we address the secretary determination that kennewick man remains are native american,as defined by nagpra.we must set aside the secretary decision if it was arbitrary or capricious because the decision was based on inadequate factual support.see a.we review the full agency record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the agency decision that kennewick man is native american within nagpra meaning.here,after reviewing the record,we conclude that the record does not contain substantial evidence that kennewick man remains are native american within nagpra meaning 
the administrative record contains no alone substantial kennewick man remains are connected by some special or significant genetic or cultural relationship to any presently existing indigenous tribe,people,or culture.an examination of the record demonstrates the absence of evidence that kennewick man and modern tribes share significant genetic or cultural features 
no cognizable link exists between kennewick man and modern columbia plateau indians.when kennewick man remains were discovered,local coroners initially believed the remains were those of a european,not a native american,because of their appearance.later testing by scientists demonstrated that the cranial measurements and features of kennewick man most closely resemble those of polynesians and southern asians,and that kennewick man measurements and features differ significantly from those of any modern indian group living in north america 
scant or no evidence of cultural similarities between kennewick man and modern indians exists.one of the secretary experts,kenneth ames,reported that the empirical gaps in the record preclude establishing cultural continuities or discontinuities,particularly before about ames noted that,although there was overwhelming evidence that many aspects of the plateau pattern were present between and,the empirical record precludes establishing cultural continuities or discontinuities across increasingly remote periods.he noted that the available evidence is insufficient either to prove or disprove cultural or group continuity dating back earlier than,which is the case with regard to the kennewick man remains,and that there is evidence that substantial changes occurred in settlement,housing,diet,trade,subsistence patterns,technology,projectile point styles,raw materials,and mortuary rituals at various times between the estimated date when kennewick man lived and the beginning of the plateau culture some to years ago.
ames conclusions about the impossibility of establishing cultural continuity between kennewick man and modern indians is confirmed by other evidence that the secretary credited.for example,the secretary acknowledges that the record shows that there were no villages or permanent settlements in the columbia plateau region years ago and that human populations then were small and nomadic,traveling long distances in search of food and raw materials.the secretary experts determined,and the secretary acknowledged,that it was not until to years ago that populations began to settle into the villages and bands that may have been the antecedents of modern indian tribes something like those encountered by european settlers and colonists.as the secretary summarized,c ultural discontinuities are suggested by evidence that the cultural group existing years ago was likely small in size and highly mobile while the plateau culture consisted o f larger,more sedentary groups.
the secretary also acknowledges that there is very little evidence of burial patterns during the period and significant temporal gaps exist in the mortuary record for other periods.so,even if we assume that kennewick man was part of a stable social group living in the area,it still would be impossible to say whether his group burial practices were related to modern tribes burial practices.the secretary also noted that the linguistic analysis was unable to provide reliable evidence for the period.
the secretary only evidence,perhaps,of a possible cultural relationship between kennewick man and american indians comes in the form of oral histories.one of the secretary experts,daniel boxberger,concluded that modern day plateau tribes oral of which can be interpreted to refer to ancient floods,volcanic eruptions,and the highly suggest
