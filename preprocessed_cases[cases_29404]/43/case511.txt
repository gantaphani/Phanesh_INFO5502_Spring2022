plaintiffs sac and fox nation of missouri,iowa tribe of kansas and nebraska,prairie band of potawatomi indians,and bill graves,the governor of the state of kansas,appeal the district court dismissal of their action.plaintiffs sought to prevent the secretary of the interior from taking a tract of land in downtown kansas city,kansas,into trust on behalf of the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma,and approving gaming activities on that tract of land under the indian gaming regulatory act igra.the district court dismissed the action for failure to join the wyandotte tribe as a necessary and indispensable party.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,and reverse the district court dismissal.with respect to the merits of plaintiffs actions,which we reach because the district court issued alternative holdings,we conclude.imposed a nondiscretionary duty on the secretary to acquire land in trust for the wyandotte tribe the secretary was not required to comply with the national environmental policy act or the national historical preservation act before acquiring land pursuant to.because the exercise of the secretary duty to acquire the land was nondiscretionary the secretary acted arbitrarily in determining that only.funds were used to acquire the tract of land in downtown kansas city and the secretary erred in approving gaming activities on the acquired tract of land.we remand the case to the district court with directions to enter partial judgment consistent with our holdings and to remand in part to the secretary for further consideration of whether.funds were used for the acquisition.
the underlying facts of this case are largely uncontroverted.between and,the wyandotte tribe the wyandottes ceded much of their territory in southeastern michigan and northern ohio to the united states.this culminated with the signing of a march,treaty in which the wyandottes ceded all of their remaining land in michigan and ohio in return for certain payments and a promised acre reservation west of the mississippi river.in december,the wyandottes acquired from the delaware nation of indians sections of land acres in kansas situated at the point of the junction of the missouri and kansas rivers an area now known as wyandotte county,kansas.in,the united states reimbursed the wyandottes for the purchase of the kansas land to fulfill its obligation under the treaty.
in,the wyandottes entered into another treaty with the united states and agreed to dissolve the tribe,become united states citizens,and cede all of their lands to the united states,which in turn would divide the land among the former members of the tribe.the treaty contained one relevant exception to the wyandottes cession agreement the portion now enclosed and used as a public,shall be permanently reserved and appropriated for that purpose.admin.record at.that tract,known as the huron cemetery,is the focal point of this litigation.
the treaty resulted in the splintering of the wyandottes into two who accepted citizenship and those who did not.those who accepted citizenship and received portions of the ceded land are known as the absentee or citizen wyandots the small group approximately who did not accept citizenship and did not receive any of the ceded land were officially reconstituted by congress in as the wyandotte tribe the reconstituted tribe settled in oklahoma on land that had formerly belonged to the seneca indians.
in,congress approved an act granting authority to the secretary of the interior to sell the huron cemetery.act of june,stat.the sale never occurred,however,and in,congress repealed the authority to sell.act of,stat.in,congress appropriated for the preservation and improvement of the huron cemetery owned by the government of the united states,the use of which was conveyed by treaty to the wyandotte tribe of indians.act of,stat.in,the united states and the city of kansas city,kansas,entered into a personal care contract for maintenance of the huron cemetery.the contract provided that the city of kansas city would forever maintain and care for the cemetery,furnish police protection in and around the cemetery,and furnish electrical energy free of charge for maintenance of the electric lights inside the huron cemetery.see pls.br.at.
in,consistent with the policy of promoting assimilation of tribal members,congress enacted a law providing for the termination of federal supervision over the trust and restricted property of the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma and the individual members thereof,and for a termination of federal services furnished to such indians because of their status as indians.admin.record at,stat.in pertinent part,the law directed that the huron cemetery be sold by the united states.
title to the tract of land in kansas city,kansas,that was reserved for a public burying ground under article of the treaty dated january,with the wyandotte tribe shall be transferred or sold and the proceeds from any sale of the land may be used to remove and reinter the remains of persons who are buried there,to move any monuments now located on the graves,and to erect at reasonable cost one appropriate monument dedicated to the memory of the departed members of the wyandotte tribe.
the sale of the huron cemetery never occurred.this was due,apparently in part,to litigation filed against the united states by a group of absentee wyandots and the city of kansas city,kansas.the result,under the language of the act,was that the wyandotte tribe was never actually terminated.id.at upon removal of federal restrictions on the property of the tribe,the secretary shall publish in the federal register a proclamation declaring that the federal trust relationship to the affairs of the tribe and its members has terminated.in,congress enacted a law reinstating to the wyandotte tribe all rights and privileges that it might have lost under the act,stat codified at.
in,congress enacted legislation providing for the appropriation and distribution of money in satisfaction of judgments awarded to the wyandottes by the indian claims commission and the court of claims.see,stat.the judgments were compensation for lands in ohio that the wyandottes had ceded to the united states in the under the law,congress directed that of the allocated funds be used and distributed in accordance with a series of directives.key among the directives,for purposes of this case,was one providing that a sum of of such funds shall be used for the purchase of real property which shall be held in trust by the secretary for the benefit of such tribe.admin.record at stat.
in,congress enacted the igra.generally speaking,the igra prohibits gaming on lands acquired by the secretary in trust for the benefit of an indian tribe after october.a.one exception allows gaming on trust lands acquired by the secretary after october,if the lands are located within or contiguous to the boundaries of the reservation of the indian tribe on october.id.a.the general prohibition of gaming on lands acquired by the secretary in trust can also be avoided if 
the secretary,after consultation with the indian tribe and appropriate state,and local officials,including officials of other nearby indian tribes,determines that a gaming establishment on newly acquired lands would be in the best interest of the indian tribe and its members,and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community,but only if the governor of the state in which the gaming activity is to be conducted concurs in the secretary determination.
id.b a.there are also other exceptions that are not relevant here.
due to its meager financial resources and the dim prospects for gaming on its oklahoma reservation,the wyandottes began a series of efforts aimed at conducting gaming activities at various sites in kansas.in the early,the wyandottes attempted,unsuccessfully,to have the secretary take into trust on behalf of the tribe a parcel of land in park city,kansas.in,the wyandottes attempted,again unsuccessfully,to claim they were entitled to receive as excess property a former federal courthouse located in downtown kansas city,kansas,near the huron cemetery.
in april,the wyandottes authorized their chief to purchase four tracts of land in downtown kansas city,kansas,all of which abutted the huron cemetery.included among those tracts was a acre tract referred to by the parties as the shriner tract,upon which stands the former shrine temple.the tribal resolutions specifically referenced.the law providing for the use of in allocated funds to purchase land for the wyandottes,and provided that the purchase of the property would use funds distributed to the wyandottes under section b of the statute.the resolution also announced the wyandottes intent to conduct gaming on the property after its acquisition.
on january,the wyandottes filed with the secretary a fee to trust land acquisition application for the four tracts of land.the application indicated that the wyandottes planned to develop and operate a square foot class ii and class iii gaming facility on the land.admin.record at.on february,the associate solicitor for the division of indian affairs at the department of interior issued an opinion that the provisions of.mandated the secretary to acquire the tracts of land in trust on behalf of the wyandottes.at.this opinion further concluded that,because the acquisition was mandated and thus,neither the provisions of the national environmental policy act of nepa,et,nor the provisions of the national historic preservation act nhpa,et,applied.finally,the opinion concluded that the huron cemetery was a reservation for purposes of igra,and that the wyandottes could conduct gaming on the property pursuant to a,as long as they met the other applicable requirements of igra.the associate solicitor subsequently reaffirmed these conclusions in response to an inquiry from the director of the indian gaming management staff for the bia and challenges by the plaintiffs.in doing so,he emphasized that any future actions regarding the acquired property would require compliance with the nepa and the nhpa.
in,the wyandottes narrowed the scope of their acquisition request to the shriner tract.it is unclear from the record precisely why they did so.after reviewing the associate solicitor opinions,the director of the indian gaming management staff for the bia recommended to the assistant secretary for indian affairs that the shriner tract be taken into trust for the wyandottes.the assistant secretary concurred in the recommendation and directed the bia area director for the muskogee area office to take action.on june,pursuant to applicable department of interior regulations,the department of the interior published in the federal register a notice of intent to take the shriner tract into trust for the benefit of the wyandottes.see b.the purpose of the notice was to allow interested parties to seek judicial review of the proposed action.
on july,plaintiffs filed this action against the secretary in federal district court challenging his decision to acquire the shriner tract in trust for the wyandottes and his conclusion that the wyandottes could lawfully conduct gaming on the acquired property under igra.within hours of filing suit,plaintiffs sought and received a temporary restraining order tro preventing the secretary from taking the shriner tract into trust on behalf of the wyandottes.
the wyandottes immediately moved to intervene to challenge the tro.the wyandottes also filed a notice of interlocutory appeal seeking to appeal the tro.on july,this court dissolved the tro,noting that documents submitted by the wyandottes indicated that if the contract for sale of the shriner tract was not closed that same day,the right of the secretary to acquire that property in trust would expire.at.in order to preserve the status quo,this court dissolved the tro subject to the conditions which constitute the law of this case,that the respective rights of the parties to obtain judicial review of all issues which have been raised in the complaint below shall be preserved,including standing of all parties,jurisdiction,compliance by the secretary with all requirements of law,and the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.id.at.following the issuance of this court order,the secretary consummated the proposed transaction by purchasing the shriner tract and taking it into trust on behalf of the wyandottes.
after engaging in limited discovery,plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to reverse the secretary taking of the property into trust for the wyandottes and to obtain a declaratory judgment that the huron cemetery was not a reservation of the wyandottes for purposes of igra.the district court rejected plaintiffs motion and dismissed the action.in doing so,the district court concluded that the wyandotte tribe wa s a necessary party to th e litigation under.a,and that the wyandotte tribe wa s a sovereign entity capable of asserting sovereign immunity.at.the court also concluded that,even though the wyandottes voluntarily intervened as a defendant,there had been no clear or unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity as to either taking the shriner tract into trust or declaring the huron cemetery to be reservation land.id.at.further,the court concluded the wyandottes were an indispensable party because a ny judgment against the wyandotte tribe in its absence would be extremely prejudicial to its land and economic interests,a judgment issued absent the presence of the wyandotte tribe would only lead to litigation attacking the judgment,and thus could be considered inadequate,there may be an alternative venue for tackling the issues of casino gambling on the shriner tract and the status of the huron cemetery because the secretary had indicated that some statutory considerations may apply to future actions relating to the property and the negotiation and approval of gaming compacts remain ed to be done.id.at.
the district court issued alternative holdings on the merits of all but one of the issues raised by the plaintiffs.first,the court agreed with the secretary that he was required by.to acquire the shriner tract in trust for the wyandottes.second,the court rejected plaintiffs assertion that the secretary acted arbitrarily or capriciously by failing to scrutinize whether.funds were actually used to purchase the shriner tract.the district court noted that the secretary had accepted the representation of the wyandottes on this matter and there was evidence in the record reflecting the tribe commitment to use.funds for the purchase.third,the court rejected plaintiffs argument that the secretary acted improperly by acquiring the shriner tract without engaging in any nepa or nhpa analysis.the court concluded that,because the secretary was performing a nondiscretionary duty by taking the tract into trust for the tribe,neither the nepa nor the nhpa applied to the decision.finally,the district court refrained from deciding the question of whether the huron cemetery constituted a reservation for purposes of igra.in doing so,the court stated it was convinced that the issue c ould be determined in another judicial forum under different circumstances which d id not require a court to ignore settled case law regarding sovereign immunity and the waiver of sovereign immunity.id.
we begin by addressing whether the wyandotte tribe is a necessary and indispensable party to this action.the question of whether an absent party is necessary indispensable is resolved by applying rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.davis united states,cir see rishell jane phillips episcopal mem l med,cir indicating that a court must determine whether the party in question is necessary under rule a before proceeding to decide whether the party is indispensable under rule b.a district court rule determinations are reviewed by this court under an abuse of discretion standard.id.any legal conclusions underlying a district court rule determinations,however,are reviewed de novo.id.
rule a defines those persons who should be joined as parties to an action and thus are considered necessary parties to the action 
a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
it appears from the record that the district court based its rule a ruling in large part upon assertions from the wyandotte tribe and the secretary that the wyandotte tribe was a necessary party to this action.at.we conclude that application of rule a demonstrates the wyandotte tribe is not a necessary party to this action.
the first consideration under rule a is whether,in the absence of the wyandotte tribe,complete relief could be accorded among the persons already parties to the action.in our view,the answer is clearly yes.because plaintiffs action focuses solely on the propriety of the secretary determinations,the absence of the wyandotte tribe does not prevent the plaintiffs from receiving their requested declaratory relief,a determination that the secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously a in taking the shriner tract into trust for the wyandotte tribe,b by failing to conduct an nepa or nhpa review,c by failing to confirm that.funds were used,and d by concluding the huron cemetery was a reservation for purposes of igra.moreover,we are not persuaded there is a likelihood of further lawsuits involving essentially the same subject matter.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure at ed.
the second consideration under rule a is whether the wyandotte tribe claims an interest relating to the subject of this action and,if so,whether disposition of this action in the wyandotte tribe absence may as a practical matter impair its ability to protect that interest or subject any of the persons already parties to a substantial risk of inconsistent obligations.it is undisputed the wyandotte tribe has an economic interest in the outcome of this action.more specifically,the wyandotte tribe ability to conduct gaming activities on the shriner tract will survive only if all of the secretary determinations regarding the shriner tract are upheld.the potential of prejudice to the wyandotte tribe interests is greatly reduced,however,by the presence of the secretary as a party defendant.as a practical matter,the secretary interest in defending his determinations is virtually identical to the interests of the wyandotte tribe see rishell,at see also washington daley,cir concluding indian tribes were not necessary parties to actions filed by state of washington against secretary of commerce challenging regulation allocating groundfish catches to tribes,inasmuch as the secretary and the tribes had virtually identical interests and the united states could therefore adequately represent the tribes james moore,moore federal practice,at ed the fact that the absent person may be bound by the judgment does not of itself require his joinder if his interests are fully represented by parties present.further,we are not convinced that the secretary or any other party to this suit would be subjected to a substantial risk of multiple or inconsistent obligations in the absence of the wyandotte tribe.as noted above,nothing in the record indicates the possibility of additional lawsuits involving this same subject matter.see wright,supra,at the key is whether the possibility of being subject to multiple obligations is real an unsubstantiated or speculative risk will not satisfy the rule a criteria.
even assuming,arguendo,the wyandotte tribe could be considered a necessary party under rule a,we are not persuaded the wyandotte tribe is an indispensable party under rule b.a necessary party can be considered an indispensable party only if,in equity and good conscience,a court should not allow the action to proceed in the party absence.b.to make this determination,a court must balance the following four factors set forth in rule b 
f irst,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
applying these factors,we conclude the district court abused its discretion in finding the wyandotte tribe was an indispensable party.with respect to the first factor,it is true that the wyandotte tribe has an economic interest in proceeding with gaming activities on the shriner tract.as previously noted,however,the potential of prejudice to that interest is offset in large part by the fact that the secretary interests in defending his decisions are substantially similar,if not virtually identical,to those of the wyandotte tribe.further,we note that the wyandotte tribe has filed pleadings at virtually all stages of this litigation and has consistently offered its views regarding why the secretary actions were appropriate.because the potential for prejudice is minimal,we need not be concerned with the second factor,which addresses the availability of means for lessening or avoiding prejudice.rishell,at.with respect to the third factor,a judgment rendered in the wyandottes absence would be adequate in our view because,regardless of the presence or absence of the wyandottes,the claims in this action turn solely on the appropriateness of the secretary actions,and the secretary is clearly capable of defending those actions.moreover,as noted above,the absence of the wyandotte tribe does not prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining the relief requested in their complaint.finally,and perhaps most important,there does not appear to be any alternative forum in which plaintiffs claims can be heard.although it is possible the secretary might later require nepa or nhpa compliance in order for the wyandotte tribe to take action with respect to the shriner tract,the instant action is the only opportunity for plaintiffs to challenge the remainder of the secretary determinations.see kescoli babbitt,cir noting that a court should be extra cautious before dismissing an action pursuant to rule b if no alternative forum exists rishell,at noting that t he absence of an alternative forum would weigh heavily,if not conclusively against dismissal.
in summary,we conclude the district court erred in characterizing the wyandotte tribe as a necessary and indispensable party and dismissing the plaintiffs action under rule.
we turn to the merits of plaintiffs action.plaintiffs challenge the secretary determinations that acquisition of the shriner tract was mandated by.nepa and nhpa analyses were unnecessary prior to acquisition of the shriner tract and only.funds were used to purchase the shriner tract.in addition,plaintiffs challenge the secretary determination that the huron cemetery is a reservation for purposes of igra.
plaintiffs challenges are brought pursuant to the administrative procedures act apa.under the apa,we can not set aside an agency decision unless it fails to meet statutory,procedural or constitutional requirements,or unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a d see public lands council babbitt,cir,aff,d.although the district court passed upon all but one of the plaintiffs challenges to the secretary decisions,we owe no deference to the district court decision.rather,the scope of our review is de novo.public lands council,at.
because the agency decisions at issue here involve interpretations of federal statutes,our review is guided by the principles announced in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the first question always,is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we are generally required to defer to the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.more specifically,if we find an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,we must accept the agency interpretation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.alternatively,if we do not find an express delegation by congress,but nevertheless perceive an implicit delegation to the agency on the particular question,we must accept a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of the agency.id.at.
was acquisition of the shriner tract mandated by.
plaintiffs contend the secretary violated the apa by concluding he had a nondiscretionary duty under.to acquire the shriner tract in trust for the wyandotte tribe.according to plaintiffs,the secretary remained obligated to satisfy the requirements of the trust statute,and regulations,et,and to exercise his discretion as required by law in processing any trust application filed by wyandotte tribe pursuant to.pls.br.at.
generally speaking,the secretary has broad discretion under the indian reorganization act of ira the trust statute referred to by plaintiffs,to decide whether to acquire land in trust on behalf of indian tribes.that statute authorizes the secretary,in his discretion,to acquire any interest in lands,within or without existing reservations,for the purpose of providing land for indians.id.when the secretary acts pursuant to the ira,title to any such lands is taken in the name of the united states in trust for the indian tribe or individual indian for which the land is acquired.id.to assist in deciding which lands to take into trust under the ira,the secretary has promulgated regulations the trust regulations referred to by plaintiffs.see et.in pertinent part,those regulations set forth a land acquisition policy,which provides 
a subject to the provisions contained in the acts of congress which authorize land acquisitions,land may be acquired for a tribe in trust status when the property is located within the exterior boundaries of the tribe reservation or adjacent thereto,or within a tribal consolidation area or when the tribe already owns an interest in the land or when the secretary determines that the acquisition of the land is necessary to facilitate tribal,economic development,or indian housing.
notwithstanding the ira and its implementing regulations,the secretary concluded that his discretion regarding whether to acquire the shriner tract on behalf of the wyandotte tribe was curtailed by.the secretary based his conclusion on section of,entitled distribution to wyandotte tribe of oklahoma,which provides in pertinent part 
b twenty percent of the funds allocated to the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma pursuant to section b shall be used and distributed in accordance with the following general plan 
a sum of of such funds shall be used for the purchase of real property which shall be held in trust by the secretary for the benefit of such tribe.
c except as provided in paragraph and notwithstanding any other provision of law,the approval of the secretary for any payment or distribution by the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma of any funds described in subsection b shall not be required and the secretary shall have no further trust responsibility for the investment,supervision,administration,or expenditure of such funds.
the secretary may take such action as the secretary may determine to be necessary and appropriate to enforce the requirements of this title.
admin.record at stat.
in our view,the secretary interpretation is easily affirmed under the first test set forth in chevron,whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.although subsection b of section could be construed as ambiguous when examined in isolation,subsection c resolves any potential ambiguities by indicating that,notwithstanding any other provision of law,the approval of the secretary for any payment by the wyandotte tribe of any funds described in subsection b shall not be required.see united sav.ass of texas timbers of inwood forest,d indicating that statutory terms are often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.subsection c clearly indicates that the secretary shall have no discretion in deciding whether to take into trust a parcel of land purchased by the wyandotte tribe with.funds.we therefore agree with the secretary and the district court that,notwithstanding the provisions of the ira.imposed a nondiscretionary duty on the secretary.
was nepa or nhpa analysis necessary prior to acquisition of shriner tract 
plaintiffs contend the secretary violated the apa by determining it was unnecessary for the agency to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa,et,or the national historic preservation act nhpa,et,prior to acquiring the shriner tract in trust for the wyandotte tribe.in response,the secretary contends analysis under the nepa and the nhpa is unnecessary due to the mandatory nature of the acquisition.in other words,the secretary contends,because there was no discretion involved in acquiring the shriner tract,nepa and nhpa analysis would have been pointless.
both the nepa and the nhpa require federal agency heads to take certain steps prior to engaging in certain actions.the nepa delineates a procedure for federal agencies to follow when any major federal action they propose to undertake could pose potential environmental harms.somewhat similarly,the nhpa requires federal agency heads to take into account the impact of any federal or federally assisted undertaking on sites listed or eligible for listing in the national register of historic places.see.the nhpa also requires that the advisory council on historic preservation be given a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings.id.
because.affords the secretary no discretion with respect to the shriner tract acquisition,we conclude the secretary reasonably determined that no nepa or nhpa analysis was required prior to the acquisition.several circuits have held that nepa compliance is unnecessary where the agency action at issue involves little or no discretion on the part of the agency,sierra club babbitt,cir collecting cases demonstrating that nondiscretionary agency action is excused from the operation of nepa sugarloaf citizens ass ferc,cir other circuits have held that when an agency has no discretion to consider environmental values implementing a statutory requirement,its actions are ministerial and not subject to nepa.goos icc,cir because the icc has not been granted any discretion under section d to base its issuance of an nitu or citu on environmental consequences,we agree that it would make little sense to force the icc to consider factors which can not affect its decision.milo cmty.hosp.weinberger,cir finding that no eis was necessary where consideration of the factors that the appellant has characterized as environmental considerations could not have changed the secretary decision.although no courts have addressed whether nhpa compliance is necessary in such situations,we are persuaded that a similar rule should apply.because of the operational similarity between the two statutes,courts generally treat major federal actions under the nepa as closely analogous to federal undertakings under the nhpa,ringsred city of duluth,cir.in sum,because the secretary exercised no discretion in acquiring the shriner tract,he reasonably concluded that nepa or nhpa analysis would have been pointless,since neither could have had any impact on the acquisition.
were.funds used to purchase the shriner tract 
plaintiffs contend the secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously,and against the clear evidence in the agency record,by accepting without scrutiny the wyandotte tribe representation that the shriner tract was purchased with only.funds.in response,the secretary contends t here is no reason to believe that the money used to purchase the shriner tract was anything other than money available under.gov t br.at.
although the secretary attempts to support his contention by citing various documents contained in the administrative record,the documents in fact suggest that nearly half of the funds used to acquire the shriner tract were.funds.first,the secretary points to an april,resolution of the wyandotte tribe authorizing the application.although it is true the resolution indicates that.funds will be used for the proposed acquisition,it in fact states that the tribe will purchase the kansas city tract with a portion of the pl set aside funds.admin.record at emphasis added.the reference at best would indicate part of the monies set aside for tribal use in.would be used in this purchase.second,the secretary cites to an april,letter from the wyandotte tribe to bia in which the tribe outlines its plan for purchasing the shriner tract.although the letter indicates the shriner land will be purchased for using funds wired from the.trust account maintained by the mercantile bank of joplin,missouri,the letter goes on to state that t he funds required for closing on the shriner building which the tribe intended to purchase for will be wired from another tribal account.id.at emphasis added.in other words,the letter seems to suggest that only the land,but not the building,was purchased with.funds.another document cited by the secretary,an internal message from one bia employee to another,seems to suggest that at least some agency employees were aware that the.funds remaining and available to fund this purchase would not cover the entire purchase price of the shriner tract.
based upon these documents,which are not contradicted by any other documents in the record,we conclude the secretary determination that only.funds were being used for the purchase was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.we therefore reverse with directions to the district court to remand the matter to the secretary for further consideration of this issue.
is the huron cemetery a reservation for purposes of igra 
the final,and indeed critical,issue raised by plaintiffs is whether the secretary acted arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the huron cemetery constitutes a reservation for purposes of igra.the district court did not address the question of whether the huron cemetery constitutes a reservation for purposes of igra.because the facts relevant to that issue are uncontroverted and the issue thus hinges on a question of statutory interpretation,we have discretion to decide it in the first instance and conclude that doing so is in the interests of judicial economy,united food commercial workers union southwest ohio reg l transit,cir although we will generally decline to consider in the first instance issues not considered by the district court,we will make an exception where injustice might otherwise result,or where the issue presents only a question of law.travelers ins.pataki,cir concluding that appellate court had discretion to decide in the first instance a question of law not reached by the district court.
plaintiffs contend the secretary determination that the huron cemetery is a reservation for purposes of igra is wrong for several reasons.first,plaintiffs argue that when the land upon which the cemetery now rests was acquired by the wyandottes from the delawares,there was never any declaration that it was intended to be the wyandottes reservation.second,plaintiffs argue that nothing in the treaty indicates that the united states or the tribe intended for the cemetery to operate as a reservation.third,plaintiffs contend that in enacting igra,congress specifically distinguished between reservation and lands held in trust by the united states for a tribe.according to plaintiffs,congress clearly intended for the term reservation to include only land that is actually used for the residence of tribal members and,through use of the phrase the tribe reservation,indicated that each tribe would have only one reservation for purposes of igra.plaintiffs argue that the cemetery does not fall within this definition because it is a public burial ground,situated more than miles away from the oklahoma reservation upon which the tribal members actually reside.fourth,plaintiffs argue that the wyandotte tribe has not manifested tribal governmental jurisdiction over the cemetery.finally,plaintiffs argue that the secretary determination is contrary to public policy as expressed in igra.for example,plaintiffs contend,congress intended by way of igra to provide employment on reservation for tribal members,members who may be traditionally plagued by few employment opportunities unless they leave the reservation.pls.br.at.here,plaintiffs argue,a casino located in downtown kansas city,kansas provides no employment for members of the wyandotte tribe,who reside more than miles away and would have to leave the oklahoma reservation to work in the facility.id.at.
in response,the secretary contends that he construed the term reservation,as used in igra,in a manner consistent with its usual meaning.according to the secretary,the phrase originally referred to any land reserved from an indian cession to the federal government,gov t br.at citing united states winans,but has since evolved to include land set aside under federal protection,whether by executive order or otherwise,for the use of tribal indians,regardless of origin.id.under this definition,the secretary contends,it is enough that the property at issue has been set aside for some purpose by the federal government,and there is no requirement that tribal members actually reside on the property.the secretary contends the huron cemetery falls squarely within this definition 
in,the united states approved of,and in,the united states paid for,the wyandottes purchase of kansas property in satisfaction of the united states promise to the tribe that it would reserve kansas lands for the tribe.in,the tribe ceded that land to the united states,but the treaty specifically excepted the huron cemetery from the cession.by expressly and unambiguously reserving the cemetery,the treaty gave it the same status as the whole parcel of land had before the cession and allotment.at the very least,as land reserved from an indian cession to the federal government,the property would fall within the traditional definition of a reservation.
id.at citations omitted.finally,the secretary argues that the status of property as a reservation under igra is not altered by the failure of a tribe to assert its jurisdiction over land or the assertion of such jurisdiction by others.id.at.instead,the secretary argues,only explicit congressional action can alter a property reservation status.id.at.
to resolve this issue,we again return to the chevron framework.because igra does not specifically define the term reservation,the parties agree,as do we,that congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.normally,under chevron,the next step would be to determine whether the secretary interpretation is based upon a permissible construction of the statute.significantly,however,neither the secretary nor the department of the interior in general is charged with administering igra.when congress enacted igra,it established the national indian gaming commission commission and charged the commission with the exclusive regulatory authority for indian gaming conducted pursuant to igra.that authority includes promulgat ing such regulations and guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the provisions of igra.b.presumably,the commission authority also includes interpreting any ambiguous phrases or terms contained in igra.
reviewing the record in this case,there is no indication that the commission had any involvement in deciding whether the huron cemetery constituted a reservation for purposes of igra.to the contrary,the record indicates that a preliminary determination of the issue was first made by the associate solicitor for the division of indian affairs.that determination was reviewed and adopted by the director of the indian gaming management staff.f
