background 
management and consulting agreements 
we adopt the factual findings of the district court,which we summarize here.in,the sioux tribe the tribe became interested in building and operating a casino on indian trust land within the tribe lake traverse reservation in north dakota.the tribe entered into a management agreement with casino magic on july.the agreement,created in accordance with the indian gaming regulatory act,et.igra,provided that casino magic would become the manager of the dakota nation casino gaming enterprise,to be known as dakota magic casino.for a management agreement involving indian land to become a binding legal document,it must be approved by the national indian gaming commission nigc.see d,the tribe and casino magic agreed that such approval was a condition precedent to the contract becoming a binding legal document.the agreement was submitted to the nigc but was never approved for reasons not clarified by the record.
on september,after finalizing the terms of the management contract,and perhaps anticipating that the management agreement would be approved,the tribe and casino magic entered into a secured loan agreement.under the terms of this agreement,casino magic agreed to loan up to million to the tribe so that it could begin to build the casino.it was contemplated by both parties that once the management contract was approved,the proceeds of the loan would be repaid.in september,casino magic advanced to the tribe,which the tribe later repaid once it received a million loan from the bnc national bank of bismark,north dakota,bnc.
because the management agreement was never approved,the parties entered into a consulting agreement on march,under which casino magic was to become a consultant to assist the tribe in developing and operating the gaming enterprise.the consulting agreement specifically stated that casino magic had no management authority over the casino.it agreed to conduct market feasibility studies,develop and identify market plans,and to provide an accounting system,written system of internal controls,security plan,and a job classification system with training.united states ex.rel.maynard bernard casino magic,civ,slip op.at april,order granting motion for summary judgment.casino magic also agreed to develop a master plan for the casino.
the parties submitted the consulting agreement to the nigc for approval to avoid any future dispute regarding the legitimacy of the agreement.the nigc determined that the consulting agreement was not a management contract and therefore did not require the approval of the nigc.in its february,letter to the tribe,the nigc wrote 
while casino magic will be advising and consulting on many aspects of the gaming enterprise,pursuant to the consulting agreement,the tribe will retain ultimate control and direction of the casino operation.because the consulting agreement does not provide for the management of all or part of the tribe gaming operation by any person or entity other than the tribe or its employees,it is not a management contract.therefore this agreement does not require the approval of the chairman.
appellant separate app.at.
the bia also approved the consulting agreement.it sent a section accommodation approval and disclaimer to the parties in february.the disclaimer stated in part 
the department has reviewed this agreement,determined that it does not constitute an agreement relative to the tribe trust land or other trust assets and,therefore,this agreement is not subject to the provisions of.as a result,this statute does not limit or impair the tribe capacity to make or enter into this agreement without obtaining the approval of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs.
b.the construction and term loan agreement and the participation agreement 
on june,bnc and the tribe entered into a construction and term loan agreement.under the terms of the agreement,bnc agreed to make advances to the tribe in the aggregate amount of million,conditioned upon casino magic commitment to contribute to the loan up to million,or percent of the loan.article v,section p of the agreement obliged the tribe to accept and comply with all of the recommendations made by the consultant under the consulting agreement,except to the extent that any such recommendations are not consistent with current indian gaming practices or industry standards.id.at.casino magic was not a party to the construction and term loan agreement.the district court determined that casino magic status as consultant continued after the construction and term loan agreement became effective.
on june,bnc and casino magic entered into a participation agreement to formalize casino magic consent to contribute a percentage of the tribe financing for the casino.the participation agreement stated in relevant part this loan participation agreement constitutes a sale of a percentage ownership interest in the referenced indebtedness,and,collateral security and in the loan documents and shall not be construed as an extension of credit by casino magic to bnc.appellant separate app.at.
the parties submitted the construction and term loan agreement to the bia for approval,but it was not submitted to the nigc.on july,the bia issued a section accommodation approval and disclaimer letter stating,the department has reviewed the documents,determined that they do not constitute an agreement relative to the tribe trust land or other trust assets and,therefore,the documents are not subject to the provisions of.appellee app.at.
the tribe received its first advance from the approved loan after receipt of this letter.as part of this first disbursement,casino magic received a cashier check from bnc in the amount of to satisfy the tribe loan obligation under the secured loan agreement.
on january,casino magic requested a consulting fee payment from the tribe under the terms of the consulting agreement.on january,before paying the consulting fee,the tribe terminated the consulting agreement.following termination,the tribe submitted the consulting agreement and the construction and term loan agreement to the nigc for joint review.after inspecting both documents,the nigc stated in relevant part 
certain provisions of the submitted documents are of particular concern to the construction of the management contract.more specifically,section p of the construction and term loan agreement requires that the tribe accept and comply with all of the recommendations made by the consultant under the consulting agreement pg.the agreement further provides that t he tribe will maintain the consulting agreement in full force and effect,and limits the tribe ability to terminate the agreement while there is any outstanding balance due to the bnc national bank.section g pgs.as mentioned in your request letter dated february,these provisions call into question the actual relationship between the sioux tribe and cma.
after careful review,we have determined that the consulting agreement and related documents,when considered as a whole,are management contracts.as such,the submitted documents require the approval of the chairman of the nigc.
appellant separate app.at.
