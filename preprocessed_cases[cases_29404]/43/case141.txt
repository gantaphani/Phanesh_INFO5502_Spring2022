yvette lafloe falcon was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the united states in violation of and two counts of embezzlement or misapplication of funds from an indian tribal organization in violation of.the district court sentenced falcon to eighteen months imprisonment.falcon appeals,alleging insufficient evidence and plain error in the jury instructions.we affirm.
background 
falcon is an enrolled member of the turtle mountain band of chippewa indians the tribe in north dakota.in,she was elected chief clerk of the tribe court.she was in two subsequent elections and held the post of chief clerk during all times relevant to the present offenses.the conspiracy and embezzlement charges in this case arose from the use of travel funds obtained and disbursed under falcon signature or under the signature of her convicted coconspirator sharon malaterre.the travel at issue was allegedly undertaken for the purpose of training related to tribal business.during the times relevant to the present offenses,malaterre served first as an associate judge and later as chief judge of the tribe court.
under the tribe policy regarding business travel,travelers were required to submit a signed travel authorization request and voucher request to a supervisor or department head who would approve,sign,and forward the requests to a member of the executive committee for a final signature and disbursement of funds.the tribe considered falcon and malaterre to be supervisors or department heads.members of the executive committee included officers such as the tribe chairman.travelers could request and receive up to eighty percent of their anticipated travel expenses in advance and submit receipts upon the completion of travel to obtain the lesser of the remaining twenty percent or the actual cost of travel.
in,the tribe chairman instructed falcon and other department heads and project administrators that his signature on requisitions served only as acknowledgment that all other necessary signatures were present.he stated it was the responsibility of department heads or project administrators to make sure that requested expenditures were permissible under the terms of relevant grants or funding sources,and he would interpret their signatures as representations that expenditures were appropriate.the tribe chairman testified that the large number of grants and other funding sources and the large number of departments or line items in the tribe overall budget made it impractical for the executive committee to track each source and verify the propriety of every request received from a department head.accordingly,the tribe chairman testified that it was necessary,in general,for the executive committee and the finance office to rely upon representations by the department heads and grant administrators concerning the propriety of expenditures under the various grants.
the travel funds at issue in this case relate to travel for two separate seminars or conferences.the first travel occurred in,and the destination was a conference in jacksonville,florida.the persons who received travel funds for the trip from north dakota to florida included falcon,malaterre,delmark langen a bureau of indian affairs law enforcement officer,and marilyn davis an employee of the tribe.these persons had planned to fly to florida,and falcon had made flight reservations for the group.days before leaving,however,falcon determined that flying was not possible.she then approached langen about using a bia van for the trip.langen obtained a bia van.the travelers also used a smaller van owned by a different judge on the tribe court.
falcon,malaterre,and langen requested and received eighty percent of their anticipated expenses in advance.malaterre received and falcon and langen each received over.the amounts advanced to malaterre and langen included anticipated mileage for the trip at per mile.falcon proposed and approved payment of per mile for langen to drive the bia van to florida.this reimbursement rate was the rate usually paid to persons for driving their own vehicles during reimbursable travel,not a rate applied to the use of vehicles.
langen,malaterre,falcon,and falcon son traveled together to florida in the bia van.davis,her husband,and her husband daughter traveled in the private van.the employees family members went to disney world while in florida.although the government strongly inferred at trial that the purpose for taking two vans was to permit the family members to travel to disney world for free,such a finding was not necessary to support the jury verdict.
during the trip,falcon told langen that malaterre had run out of money,and langen gave a portion of his mileage money to malaterre.following the trip,falcon submitted trip reports and receipts for the travelers.these submissions included receipts for hotel stays in eau claire,wisconsin,and ashley,illinois.it was shown at trial that these hotel receipts were and malaterre denied staying in either of the hotels,and,in fact,the hotels named on the receipts did not exist.further,the fabricated receipts were poorly made for example,eau claire was misspelled on the false receipt.falcon claimed that malaterre acted alone and submitted the false receipts.malaterre and langen testified,however,that falcon submitted the receipts.also,falcon had signed the relevant trip reports.
the second instance of travel at issue in this case was a trip to las vegas for a training conference.funding for the las vegas trip,approved by falcon,was taken from a specific federal grant.the federal grant included a limited allocation of funds for travel.this allocation included money for an attorney to travel to washington,and for the project administrator to travel once to rapid city,south dakota,and once to bismark,north dakota.it contained no money for travel to las vegas.according to grant documents and testimony from multiple witnesses,falcon was the administrator for the grant and was responsible for creating the budget that was included in the grant.notwithstanding falcon knowledge of and responsibility for the grant,she approved travel for multiple members of the tribe to a conference in las vegas.the total amount of travel funds requested and paid out under vouchers approved by falcon for the las vegas trip exceeded the total travel budget of the grant by thousands of dollars.
in las vegas,multiple tribe members spent their travel advances at the gaming tables prior to the conference.the money lost due to gambling included the travel advances intended to pay the conference fee or tuition.falcon talked to the conference director and obtained permission to pay the required fee at a later date.ultimately,only one of the travelers paid the conference fee.after the conference,in her submission for the unpaid twenty percent of her requested travel funds,falcon submitted a photocopy of a check for the conference fee and a photocopy of an envelope that she purportedly used to mail the check to the conference organizers.at trial,it was revealed that the check was never received by the conference organizers and that the check had never been cashed.taken in a light most favorable to the verdict,we must assume that the jury permissibly concluded that falcon never sent the check to pay for the conference tuition and fabricated the evidence she submitted with her claim for reimbursement.
the government charged falcon and malaterre with conspiracy and embezzlement.malaterre pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the united states in violation of and testified against falcon.the jury received malaterre plea agreement as evidence in falcon case.
falcon defended herself at trial by arguing that the tribe executive committee,comptroller,and finance office had oversight duties regarding the travel expenditures such that she was free to sign her own and other persons requests and vouchers without regard to the propriety of the travel.numerous other witnesses,including the tribe chairman and the comptroller,rebutted these claims.further,falcon at no time presented a reasoned explanation for the submission of false hotel receipts.she did arg
