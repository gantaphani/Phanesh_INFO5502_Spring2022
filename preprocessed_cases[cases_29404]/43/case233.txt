lakota thomas first was indicted as a misdemeanant in possession of a firearm under g,which makes it unlawful for a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to possess a firearm.the district court dismissed the indictment because first was not provided with appointed counsel pursuant to the sixth amendment at his underlying misdemeanor domestic violence proceeding in tribal court.the government appealed.interpreting a defining misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,we hold that the statute right to counsel provision,id.a b i i,refers to the right to counsel that existed in the predicate misdemeanor proceeding not to a uniform federal right to counsel.first was convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in tribal court,where he had the right to retain counsel at his own expense but lacked a sixth amendment right to appointed counsel.because first was not denied his right to counsel as it existed in the tribal court misdemeanor proceeding,we hold that his resulting conviction could properly serve as a predicate to a g prosecution.we further hold that this result does not violate the sixth amendment,the due process clause of the fifth amendment,or the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.

ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss an indictment,and the district court interpretation of the underlying statute.united states grace,cir citing united states barrera moreno,cir and united states gorman,cir.we may affirm the district court dismissal of an indictment on any ground supported by the record even if it differs from the rationale of the district court.united states telink,cir per curiam.
iii.analysis 
under precedent,the sixth amendment right to counsel serves as a constitutional minimum in all state and federal criminal proceedings that result in a sentence of actual imprisonment or a suspended sentence of imprisonment.alabama shelton,d holding that a suspended sentence that may end up in the actual deprivation of a person liberty may not be imposed unless the defendant was accorded the guiding hand of counsel in the prosecution for the crime charged citation omitted scott illinois,d holding that the sixth amendment right to counsel was only required when a defendant was sentenced to actual imprisonment,which was later expanded by shelton argersinger hamlin,d holding that defense counsel must be appointed in any criminal prosecution,whether classified as petty,misdemeanor,or felony,that actually leads to imprisonment even for a brief period.
however,t his circuit has held the sixth amendment right to counsel does not apply in tribal court criminal proceedings.united states percy,cir citing united states ant,cir and settler lameer,cir.as we have explained,t he protections of the united states constitution are generally inapplicable to indian tribes,indian courts and indians on the reservation because indian tribes are nations.id.citations omitted.in,however,congress enacted the indian civil rights act icra,which mandated that a defendant in tribal court be provided a right to retained counsel in all criminal proceedings.see,tit.ii,stat.in,congress further provided defendants in tribal court with the right to appointed counsel i n a criminal proceeding in which an indian tribe,in exercising powers of,imposes a total term of imprisonment of more than year,c,but left unchanged the right to retained counsel when a lesser penalty is imposed,id.a 
here,the fort peck tribal court imposed a suspended sentence of thirty days in jail.although this sentence,had it been imposed in state or federal court,would have triggered sixth amendment protection under shelton,the sentence does not trigger such protection in tribal court rather,first was entitled to the right to retained counsel under both federal statute,and the tribal law governing fort peck tribal court,ccoj tit.vi stating in part that in a criminal case t he accused shall have the right to assistance of counsel at own expense.
first does not argue that he was denied his right to retained counsel pursuant to federal statute and tribal law,and we do not address that issue here.further,the government does not dispute that first was not provided and did not waive a sixth amendment right to appointed counsel.here,the dispute turns on whether a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence that was validly obtained in tribal court,under circumstances that would have violated the sixth amendment in state or federal court,may qualify as the predicate misdemeanor offense for a prosecution under g.
we begin by addressing first statutory argument and then turn to his constitutional arguments.
section a defines the terms used in,which criminalizes inter alia the possession of firearms by certain persons.the relevant portion of a provides 
a the term misdemeanor crime of domestic violence means an offense that 
i is a misdemeanor under federal,state,or tribal law and 
ii has,as an element,domestic violence 
b i a person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter,unless 
i the person was represented by counsel in the case,or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case and 
ii in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried,either 
aa the case was tried by a jury,or 
bb the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury,by guilty plea or otherwise.
a emphasis added.
we must determine whether the right to counsel in a b i i refers to a uniform federal meaning containing a sixth amendment floor first contention or to the right as it existed in the predicate misdemeanor proceeding the government contention.we conclude that the government argument should prevail.
statutory text 
we begin with the text of the statute.miranda anchondo,cir cert.denied,d.the government argues that in the phrase right to counsel in the case,the words in the case modify the words right to counsel.we agree.first offers no plausible alternative interpretation that does not effectively eliminate the words in the case from the statute.and it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.duncan walker,d citations and quotation marks omitted.moreover,the words in the case clearly refer to the predicate misdemeanor proceeding,and they could not plausibly refer to any other proceeding.indeed,in looking to the language and design of the statute as a whole,k mart cartier,d,the entirety of a defines a qualifying predicate misdemeanor.
