branden pete was convicted,after a jury trial,of second degree murder on an indian reservation,two counts of felony murder,and conspiracy to commit murder.pete was sentenced to four concurrent terms of life imprisonment.he contends that the speedy trial act the sta or the act,et,was violated and the indictment against him should therefore have been dismissed.we do not agree,and so affirm 
pete was arrested on tribal charges on august,on march,the federal government filed a juvenile information against pete he was transferred from tribal to federal custody on march.
on march,the government filed a motion to proceed against pete as an adult.before the government motion was heard,pete sought,on april,to dismiss the juvenile information for violation of the speedy trial provision of the juvenile delinquency act jda,arguing that he was not brought to trial within thirty days after he was detained.on october,the government motion to proceed against pete as an adult was granted and pete motion to dismiss under the jda denied.
pete thereupon filed a notice of interlocutory appeal on november.this court affirmed the district court decision to treat pete as an adult on october.we also determined that we did not have jurisdiction in the interlocutory appeal to hear pete speedy trial challenge under the jda.see united states brandon,cir.on november,pete filed a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for rehearing en banc,which we denied on december.the mandate issued in brandon on december.
pete motion to recall the mandate pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court,filed on december,was denied on january.pete next filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the supreme court on march,it was denied on june.
meanwhile,on march,the government returned an indictment charging pete as an adult.pete filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on april,arguing that the government violated the sta because the mandate for pete interlocutory appeal issued on dec,but the indictment was not filed until march,violating the sta requirement that an indictment be filed within thirty days from the date of pete arrest absent excludable time,discussed infra.see b.
on june,soon after the supreme court denied certiorari with respect to pete interlocutory appeal,the district court denied pete motion,holding that t he entire delay caused by the interlocutory appeal was excludable from the sta thirty day filing requirement,including up until the supreme court denied the cert petition on june.after trial,the jury found pete guilty of the lesser included offense of second degree murder on count and guilty of the remaining counts in the indictment.the district court sentenced pete to four concurrent sentences of life imprisonment.this timely appeal followed.
pete contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the government violated the sta,et under b,a ny information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.section h excludes certain periods of time from the time calculation under b,stating

pete sta clock did not begin running when the federal juvenile information was filed against him or when he was taken into federal custody.at those times,pete was detained as an alleged juvenile delinquent and was subject to the speedy trial provision of the jda.see.pete was not held in federal custody as an adult until october,when the district court granted the government motion to proceed against pete as an adult although pete sta clock began running on october,it stopped on november,when pete filed notice of his interlocutory appeal.see h e.pete sta clock remained stopped until at least december,when this court mandate issued,affirming the district court decision to transfer pete from juvenile to adult status 
the dispositive questions raised here are whether the preindictment time during which pete certiorari petition to the supreme court was pending is excludable march,through march,and if so,whether the time after the mandate issued but before the certiorari petition was filed is also excludable december,through march.
excludability of the certiorari petition period 
this court has never decided whether the time during which a certiorari petition from a court of appeals decision in an interlocutory appeal is pending is excludable from the sta timing requirements.we now hold that such time is excludable under h e of the sta.
as an initial matter,a certiorari petition undoubtedly comes within h catchall language,which excludes time for other proceedings concerning the defendant.united states davenport,cir we hold that the petition for writ of habeas corpus in this case seeking dismissal of the indictment for violation of the speedy trial act is an other proceeding analogous to an interlocutory appeal.we hold that the delay resulting therefrom is excluded from the petitioner speedy trial clock under h e.united states tyler,cir stating,with regard to a petition for a writ of mandamus,that we perceive no principled basis upon which to distinguish this kind of interlocutory review with any interlocutory appeal expressly excluded under section h e.the petition for writ of mandamus sought appellate review of a district court order concerning a pretrial ruling rendered prior to final judgment.accordingly,it was the functional equivalent of an interlocutory appeal,and holding that the time during which the petition was pending was excludable as an analogous other proceeding under h emphasis in original.
more specifically,pete certiorari petition is included within subsection h e.although a certiorari petition does not trigger an appeal,it is certainly part of the appellate process.until a party files a certiorari petition or the time to do so expires,a party is entitled to seek review by the supreme court of an adverse appellate decision.therefore,even though certiorari petitions are not explicitly included in h e,a certiorari petition following an interlocutory appeal is encompassed in h e broad language as a delay resulting from an interlocutory appeal.see united states gambino,so holding quoting h e united states lyon,cir excluding the time during which a certiorari petition was pending under what is now h d of the sta,noting that i t would have been impracticable to retry the instant case while appellate review of these issues was pending.
here,interlocutory review of the district court order was not final after this court decision in brandon,as pete sought review of the appellate decision via his certiorari petition.therefore,the time during which pete certiorari petition following his interlocutory appeal was pending is excludable under h e from the calculation of the sta period for filing an indictment.
as previously noted,the sta excludes a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,including delay resulting from any interlocutory appeal.h e.if,as is often the case,the appellate mandate had been stayed while pete sought certiorari from the supreme court applying the statute would be fairly straightforward the interlocutory appeal would still be pending until the mandate issued.united states crooks,cir crooks ii citing united states ross,cir.the twist in this case comes about because there was no timely motion to stay the mandate this court did issue its mandate and then denied pete motion to recall the mandate.with the mandate in effect,the district court resumed jurisdiction over the case.see united states,cir once a mandate issues,jurisdiction over a criminal case automatically revests in the district court.emphasis in original.as a result,the government did not have to,and did not,wait until the supreme court denied pete certiorari petition before filing the indictment in the district court.instead,the indictment was filed while pete certiorari petition was pending.we are left with a situation in which the putatively excludable period quite obviously did not preclude the government from proceeding to file the indictment,raising the question whether the delay in doing so result ed from the pendency of the certiorari petition.
whether the time period used in pursuing an interlocutory appeal is automatically excludable under h e,even if the appeal did not actually cause any delay,is an open issue in this court,but just barely so.applying parallel delay resulting from language,we have held that pretrial motions,excludable under h f of the sta,need not actually cause any delay for the time during which the motions are pending to be excludable.see united states vo,cir holding that a pretrial motion triggers an automatic exclusion under h f,even though no actual delay results quotation marks and internal citations omitted crooks ii,at holding that even though the trial date had already been set and the motion or proceeding actually caused no delay in the start of the trial,the period of pendency of the motion or proceeding was nonetheless excludable united states van brandy,cir we reject an analysis which would require that to be excludable under f a particular pretrial motion must have caused an actual delay in the commencement of the trial.we accept,instead,the government view that a pretrial motion triggers an automatic exclusion.alterations in original quoting united states cobb,cir we can perceive no basis for treating the exclusion for interlocutory appeals under subsection h e differently from the exclusion for pretrial motions contained in subsection h f,as both subsections contain identical delay resulting from language.united states gallardo,cir stating that the fact that congress chose to employ the same phrase in h and suggests that it intended them to be interpreted uniformly.
united states clymer,cir is not to the contrary.clymer dealt with a motion to dismiss that the district court continued,without deciding,until after trial.id.at.the district court then set the trial schedule without any reference to the pending motion.id.as clymer itself observed and as we observed in a later case largely limiting clymer to its facts,see vo,at,the district court in clymer in effect dismissed the pretrial motion and put off deciding the issue raised in that motion until after trial.clymer,at.under these circumstances,we held the time during which the pretrial motion was pending was not excludable under h f.id.the precise holding of clymer does not apply here,either directly or by extension,because the certiorari petition had not been put off by the court in which it was pending,the supreme court,until after the relevant sta trigger date,here the filing of the indictment.see vo,at i n the years since clymer was decided,its holding has been limited to situations in which a motion is postponed until after trial.internal citations omitted quoting united states lewis,cir 
we now hold that,like the exception under h f for pretrial motions,the exclusion of time under h e for an interlocutory appeal need not actually cause any delay to create excludable time the exclusion is automatic.
we recognize that neither vo,crooks ii,nor van brandy dealt with the time limit for the filing of the indictment specified in b,which is at issue in this case.vo and van brandy dealt with time limits under c,which provides that the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date and making public of the information or indictment.crooks dealt with time limitations for a retrial after an interlocutory appeal,applying e by analogy.see united states crooks,cir crooks i,modified by crooks ii,at.
here,unlike in vo,crooks ii,or van brandy,the relevant time period is the one between pete arrest and his indictment,which is governed by b.but the sta makes no distinction regarding the applicability of the exclusions under h to the period governed by b and the pretrial period governed by c and e and nothing in vo,crooks ii,or van brandy suggests such a distinction.
we therefore hold that the automatic exclusion of time for interlocutory appeals under h f is applicable under b.united states robinson,cir holding that the exclusion of time under h d from the time limit under b of the sta is automatic and no causal connection is required united states montoya,cir stating that congress did not intend to saddle the government with proving a causal relationship between another proceeding and its delay in indicting or bringing a defendant to trial each time it seeks an exclusion under section h,and holding that the time during which an other proceeding under h is pending is automatically excludable from the period under b.
the upshot is that even though the filing of pete certiorari petition did not actually cause any evidenced by the fact that the indictment was returned while the certiorari petition was time during which pete certiorari petition was pending is still excludable under our precedents,as the period is one covered by h.
excludability of the period 
pete argues that even if the period during which his certiorari petition was pending is excludable,the charges against him should be dismissed because more than thirty days of includable time passed between the issuance of the mandate in his interlocutory appeal and the filing of his certiorari petition.we conclude that in the unusual circumstances of this case,pete sta clock resumed running with the issuance of the mandate,but stopped soon thereafter because the period of time beginning with pete motion to recall the mandate and ending with the filing of the petition is excludable.
we have held that generally,after an appeal,the period of excludable delay under the sta ends on the day this court mandate issues,because that is the date the appellate decision is final and jurisdiction returns to the district court.see crooks ii,at quoting ross,at see also united states lloyd,cir holding that the sta clock under e began running again with the issuance of the mandate citing crooks ii,at united states rush,cir relying on cases applying e to hold that excludable time for interlocutory appeals under h e ends when the mandate issues,noting that the date on which the mandate is issued determines when the district court reacquires jurisdiction for further proceedings.citing ross,at.crooks ii did not specifically address the possibility that a certiorari petition would be filed after the mandate issues for an interlocutory appeal,presumably because no such circumstance was there presented,but it did hold that the exclusion for interlocutory appeals ends with the issuance of the mandate,not with the expiration of the time to file a petition for writ of certiorari.somewhat analogously,in the context of an appeal from the district court,the ten days within which a party may file a notice of appeal following a district court order are not excludable under the sta unless there is an intervening excludable event the sta begins to run following the district court order see,supra.in the run of cases,crooks ii dictates the parallel rule is,that the period within which to file a petition for a writ of certiorari from an interlocutory appeal is not usually excludable time.applying this rule,the sta clock in this case resumed running with the issuance of this court mandate.
this case,however,is an oddity.ordinarily,in situations in which a defendant intends to file a certiorari petition,the defendant will typically seek a timely stay of the mandate pending the filing of a certiorari petition,thereby indicating an intenti
