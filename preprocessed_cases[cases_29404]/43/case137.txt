alex and percy white plume,members of the oglala sioux tribe tribe on the pine ridge indian reservation,and tierra madre,llc and madison hemp and flax company,the companies,collectively,appellants appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states.we affirm.
background 
in,the tribe council passed tribal ordinance number which amended the oglala sioux tribal penal code,title,section marijuana and section controlled drugs and substances.the amendment to title,section provided for a sentence of labor not to exceed six months,or a fine not to exceed,or both,for any indian who farmed,gathered,or dealt in marijuana.section e,which defines marijuana for purposes of the penal code,was amended to exclude all parts of the cannabis plant that contain less than one percent of the chemical tetrahydrocannabinol thc by weight.the amended ordinance specifically excluded industrial hemp by definition.a definition of industrial hemp was added to section,describing it as 
a ll parts and varieties of the plant cannabis sativa,both indigenous and imported,that are,or have historically been,cultivated and harvested for fiber and seed purposes and contain a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of one percent or less by weight.
appellee app.at.before passage of the amendments,the united states attorney for south dakota had notified the tribe of the drug enforcement agency dea position that the manufacture of hemp required a dea certificate of registration dea registration permitting the manufacture of marijuana.he also warned that anyone cultivating marijuana or hemp without one was subject to criminal prosecution.
pursuant to the ordinance,and without a dea registration,alex white plume raised a cannabis crop on federal trust land in.white plume contracted to sell the crop to tierra madre,a hemp processing company.the government learned of the crop,obtained samples of it under a search warrant,and,pursuant to court order,destroyed it.the next year,percy white plume tried his hand at growing cannabis on federal trust land without a dea registration,and told the government he was doing so.he was sent a dea registration application,but it was never completed,and a registration was never issued.as earlier,the government destroyed the crop.that crop was under contract to be sold to another hemp processing company,madison hemp.undaunted,in,alex white plume planted yet another cannabis crop on federal trust land,and,equally undaunted,the government again took samples and discovered traces of thc.instead of prosecuting the white plumes,the government asked the district court to declare them in violation of the controlled substances act csa and to permanently enjoin them from manufacturing or distributing cannabis.
the district court found that the white plumes had violated the csa by cultivating,without a dea registration,hemp,which the court held was included in the definition of marijuana under the csa.it also found that the treaty of fort laramie of treaty did not preserve any right of the tribe to grow cannabis.finally,the court determined that the classification of hemp as marijuana was not irrational and unconstitutional.the court ordered the white plumes permanently enjoined from cultivating cannabis sativa without a valid dea registration.
ii.discussion 
appellants argue the district court erred by holding that industrial hemp is subject to the csa,by finding that the treaty does not grant the tribe the right to cultivate hemp,and by failing to find that regulating hemp under the csa constitutes a due process and equal protection violation 
industrial hemp is subject to the csa 
the csa makes it illegal to manufacture,distribute,dispense,or possess any controlled substance except as authorized by the csa.a,a.a controlled substance is anything listed in a schedule under the csa.id.at.a person who proposes to engage in the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance must obtain a registration dea registration issued by the attorney general pursuant to regulations established by that office.id.at et.the csa establishes five schedules of controlled substances differentiated by the scheduled drugs potential for abuse,usefulness in medical treatment,and potential consequences if abused.to be placed on schedule i,a drug or substance must have a high potential for abuse,must have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states,and there must exist a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.b.marihuana marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinols thc are both listed on schedule id.at c schedule i c.
appellants first argue that the hemp the white plumes attempted to farm is not marijuana.section defines marijuana as all parts of the plant cannabis sativa,whether growing or not the seeds thereof the resin extracted from any part of such plant and every compound,manufacture,salt,derivative,mixture,or preparation of such plant,its seeds or resin.excepted from the definition are 
the mature stalks of such plant,fiber produced from such stalks,oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant,any other compound,manufacture,salt,derivative,mixture,or preparation of such mature stalks except the resin extracted therefrom,fiber,oil,or cake,or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.
appellants argue that the court ignored evidence that industrial hemp and marijuana are really different species of cannabis,and that the drug marijuana that congress sought to regulate in the csa is cannabis indicus.but congress clearly defined marijuana as cannabis sativa in the csa.we are persuaded that congress adopted cannabis sativa believing it to be the term that scientists used to embrace all cannabis the other named sorts were not seen as separate cannabis species.united states gavic,cir quoting united states honneus,cir.see new hampshire hemp council,marshall,cir b oth the drug commonly known as marijuana and various industrial products,rope derive from different portions of the plant popularly called the hemp plant and designated cannabis sativa in the linnaean system of botanical classification.
in support of their argument that congress did not intend to regulate industrial hemp,appellants also assert that while the definition of marijuana in the modern csa was carried forward from the marihuana tax act of tax act,which the csa replaced,the tax act practical effect of excluding portions of the plant from regulation by not taxing them,was not carried forward.as a result,appellants argue,congress unintentionally subjected industrial hemp to regulation under the csa.they cite hemp council for a bit of history to support this assertion.
the definition of marijuana under the csa is derived from the tax act,stat,hemp council,at,and uses identical language as that used in the tax act.
the term marihuana means all parts of the plant cannabis sativa,whether growing or not the seeds thereof the resin extracted from any part of such plant and every compound,manufacture,salt,derivative,mixture,or preparation of such plant,its seeds,or resin but shall not include the mature stalks of such plant,fiber produced from such stalks,oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant,any other compound,manufacture,salt,derivative,mixture,or preparation of such mature stalks except the resin extracted therefrom,fiber,oil,or cake,or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.
stat.b.the practical effect of the tax act,however,was to treat and marijuana differently by taxing them at different rates,or not at all.
all producers of cannabis sativa and certain legitimate users,doctors were subject to a small tax,per year,marihuana tax act a,stat.at see also,at,but no tax was applied to transfers of the mature stalk of the plant,which is useful only for industrial use,at,and which was specifically excluded from the definition of marijuana,marihuana tax act b,stat.at.by contrast,to discourage illicit uses,an extremely high tax applied to each transfer of other parts of the plant to anyone who had not registered with the government and paid his own occupational tax.marihuan
