the coeur tribe tribe appeals the preliminary injunction prohibiting the tribe from offering texas hold hold poker.the tribe argues that tribal sovereign immunity was not abrogated and that venue was improper under the terms of the tribal state gaming compact compact.we affirm because the indian gaming regulatory act igra severed tribal immunity and the compact did not bar the litigation.lastly,we affirm the grant of injunctive relief because the district court findings were not clearly erroneous.
factual and procedural background 
as this appeal hinges on the regulation of indian gaming,we begin with a brief introduction to the igra.congress passed the igra in in order to provide a statutory basis for the operation and regulation of gaming by indian tribes.seminole tribe of florida.the act divides gaming on indian lands into three classes i,ii,and iii and provides a different regulatory scheme for each class.id.card games including poker can be either class ii or class iii gaming,depending on the laws of the state in which the gaming takes place see.
card games are class ii if they are explicitly authorized by the laws of the state,or are not explicitly prohibited by the laws of the state and are played at any location in the state.id.a ii.class iii gaming is a residual category that consists of all forms of gaming that are not class i gaming or class ii gaming,and is the most heavily regulated of the three classes.seminole tribe,at.such gaming is lawful only where it is conducted in conformance with a tribal state compact.id.at quoting d.
several years after congress enacted the igra,the state and tribe executed a compact authorizing the tribe to offer class iii gaming.the parties failed to reach accord on the scope of gaming allowed by idaho law.the state argued that idaho law only permitted the state lottery and parimutuel betting,while the tribe countered that it allowed all games that contain the elements of chance and or skill,prize and consideration.the compact authorized the parties to seek a declaratory judgment to resolve the dispute.
the tribe filed suit in federal court in pursuit of such a declaration.the district court held on summary judgment that idaho law only allowed a lottery and parimutuel betting and that idaho law and public policy clearly prohibit all other forms of class iii gaming,including the casino gambling activities which the tribes have sought to include in compact negotiations with the state.coeur tribe idaho,coeur i.the ninth circuit affirmed.coeur tribe idaho,cir.
in march,idaho officials learned that the tribe intended to offer hold at the coeur casino.shortly after providing notice of,the state filed a complaint and moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.the tribe moved to dismiss pursuant to rules b,arguing that tribal sovereign immunity applies and that venue was improper.
the district court denied the motion for injunctive relief as moot,granted the tribe request to compel arbitration,stayed the litigation,and directed the parties to file a joint status report,concluding that the compact prohibited the state from litigating at that juncture.the court refrain ed from rendering an opinion as to whether the parties could litigate the dispute if neither party invoked arbitration.
the joint status report informed the court that neither party had invoked arbitration and asked the court to decide the pending motion to dismiss.the court denied the motion to dismiss and granted a preliminary injunction,determining that the tribe had elected to pursue litigation.the court concluded that the statute abrogated tribal immunity,and determined that an injunction was warranted because the state otherwise lacked effective remedies and the continued offering of unlawful gaming would cause irreparable harm.the tribe filed timely notice of appeal.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the general statute,claim alleging a violation of igra.michigan bay mills indian.the court had jurisdiction pursuant to because idaho alleged a violation of the igra.see oklahoma hobia,cir 
the existence of sovereign immunity is a question of law reviewed de novo.see allen gold country casino,cir.the classification of texas hold hinges on statutory interpretation,which is also reviewed de novo,see schleining thomas,cir,as is the district court venue ruling.brayton purcell llp recordon recordon,cir.
a preliminary injunction ruling is subject to limited appellate review,and we will reverse only if the district court abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.wildlife fed marine fisheries,cir quoting united states peninsula commc ns,cir.
tribal sovereign immunity 
an indian tribe is subject to suit only when congress has abrogated the tribe sovereign immunity by statute or when the tribe has waived its immunity.kiowa tribe of techs.to abrogate immunity by statute,congress must unequivocally express its intent to do so.see c l,citizen band potawatomi tribe of.
the relevant federal statute provides that district courts shall have jurisdiction over any cause of action initiated by a state or indian tribe to enjoin a class iii gaming activity located on indian lands and conducted in violation of any tribal state compact d a ii.in order to abrogate immunity,all of the statute textual prerequisites must be met.michigan bay mills indian,cir,aff and remanded.
in bay mills,the statute did not abrogate immunity because the conduct michigan sought to enjoin was not located on indian land and was not class iii gaming.at.likewise,the tribe contends here that the statute does not abrogate immunity because hold is class ii gaming and the compact does not address it.thus,the immunity inquiry necessarily requires the determination of whether hold qualifies as class iii gaming.
classification of texas hold 
as discussed supra,card games are class ii gaming if they are either explicitly authorized by the laws of the state or are not explicitly prohibited by the laws of the state and are played at any location in the state.a ii.the district court properly determined that hold is not a class ii game because the idaho constitution and gaming statute explicitly prohibit poker 
the idaho constitution provides that g ambling is contrary to public policy and is strictly prohibited id.const.art.iii.the constitution contains three exceptions for the lottery,parimutuel betting,and bingo and raffle charity games but reaffirms that the exceptions may not employ any form of casino gambling including,but not limited to poker.id.the enabling statute specifically prohibits poker by defining gambling as risking any money,credit,deposit or other thing of value for gain contingent in whole or in part upon lot,chance,or the happening or outcome of an event,including,but not limited to,blackjack,craps,roulette,poker.idaho code see also gambling is a misdemeanor.hold can only be class ii gaming if an exception in idaho law applies 
the tribe interpretations of idaho law are not persuasive.though skill undoubtedly plays a role in hold the game does not qualify for the statutory exemption for bona fide contests of skill,speed,strength or endurance.see idaho code.a contrary reading would impermissibly place the statute in conflict with the constitution prohibition on poker.see bingham cnty.idaho comm for reapportionment,idaho i f the state constitution and a statute conflict,the state constitutional provision prevails.
the tribe interpretation would also force the specific prohibition on poker to yield to a general exception for contests of skill.see morton mancari,weighting the general in favor of the specific is impermissible,unless the drafters clearly intended the effect.the tribe does not show that the legislature intended this effect.
nor does the promotional contests exception authorize hold.in a handful of clearly distinguishable cases,courts have determined that gaming statutes permitting casino nights for charitable purposes establish that gaming is explicitly authorized by the laws of the state and that a tribe may thus offer those games.see,arapaho tribe wyoming,cir mash
