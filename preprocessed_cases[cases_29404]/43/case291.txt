petitioners are six organizations that support environmental conservation,indigenous communities,and wildlife populations of northern alaska.they challenge the minerals management service mms approval of an exploration plan submitted by shell offshore shell.shell seeks to drill multiple offshore exploratory oil wells over a period in the alaskan beaufort sea.
petitioners challenge the agency action under the national environmental policy act nepa,and the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla.petitioners allege that mms failed to take the requisite hard look at the impact of drilling on the people and wildlife of the beaufort sea region in violation of the standards set forth by nepa,ocsla,and their implementing regulations.petitioners also argue that mms erred by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement eis for the proposed exploration activities,because of the potential for significant harmful effects on the environment.
we have jurisdiction over all parties claims as each petition for review was timely filed.we vacate the agency approval of shell exploration plan,and remand so that mms can conduct the hard look analysis required by nepa.
factual and procedural background 
administrative process 
in april,mms issued a plan establishing a lease sale schedule for the outer continental shelf ocs of the gulf of mexico and alaska.the plan envisions offering three separate lease sales in the beaufort sea.in february,mms prepared a detailed eis to evaluate the overall impacts of the activities projected to occur pursuant to these lease sales eis.the study analyzes the potential effects of oil exploration and production on the region wildlife,environment,and subsistence activities.the multisale eis assumes that drilling would begin in,and would require a maximum of two drilling rigs,icebreakers,supply boats,and floating platforms in waters deeper than twenty meters.the eis also evaluates mitigation measures that were developed through the cooperation of federal agencies,the state of alaska,and native alaskans.these measures include an extensive bowhead whale monitoring program and a conflict avoidance process designed to protect subsistence activities.the eis further notes any proposed exploration or development plans that may result for any of the three ocs sales evaluated in this eis,would require additional nepa environmental analysis using site specific information.
in,mms held the first sale,lease sale,without conducting further nepa analysis.the agency held two subsequent lease sales in july lease sale,and august lease sale,preparing a supplemental environmental assessment ea for each one.both of these eas tiered to the eis.in the tiering process,the agency looks to see if the proposed activities are covered by the analysis in previous studies,whether additional mitigation measures are needed,and what level of nepa evaluation is required.the leases at issue in this case were purchased in july,under lease sale.
ocsla requires that a lessee obtain approval of an exploration plan ep before beginning exploratory drilling.the ep must include a environmental impact analysis assessing the potential effects of the proposed exploration activities.mms reviews the ep,and the application is deemed submitted when it fulfills requirements and is sufficiently accurate,and the applicant has provided all needed additional information.a.mms then conducts its environmental review pursuant to nepa,c,and within thirty days issues a decision approving,disapproving,or requiring modifications to the ep.
shell proposed drilling activities are the first to be considered for the beaufort sea in conjunction with these lease sales.in november,shell submitted the first version of its ep for the beaufort sea region.shell ep details its plan to drill up to twelve exploratory wells on twelve lease tracts in the beaufort sea over the next three years.the lease blocks are grouped into five prospects and stretch from the colville river delta eastward to the canadian border.the cornell prospect is fifteen to twenty miles offshore of the colville river delta,north of the inupiat eskimo village of nuiqsut.the sivulliq prospect is ten miles offshore in camden bay,between the villages of nuiqsut and kaktovik.the olympia prospect is located north of kaktovik.the fosters and fireclaw prospects are located farther east,between kaktovik and the canadian border.
in the first year of the plan,shell aims to drill four wells within the sivulliq prospect in camden bay.in the following two years shell proposes to drill an undetermined number of wells on additional prospects depending on the initial drilling results.throughout this project,shell plans to use two drilling vessels,two icebreaking ships,various other supply boats,and up to six aircraft.all exploratory activities would occur between june and as the beaufort sea is frozen over for half of the year.
in december,mms issued its completeness comments on shell ep,indicating what information was still needed before the ep would be considered properly submitted.the agency asked shell to clarify the specific drilling locations for which it was seeking approval.mms also sought more information on the potential impact of underwater noise,conflict avoidance mechanisms,and other mitigation measures that could ameliorate the deleterious effects of the exploratory drilling.the final version of shell ep was submitted on january.the application included shell environmental report and an oil spill contingency plan.no further detail was given identifying specific well locations for the and seasons.mms determined the application was complete and began the approval process on january.
after receiving a completed ep,the agency has thirty days to approve,disapprove,or require modification of a plan.c.throughout this time period,a number of agency experts expressed concern about the potentially significant impacts the drilling would have on bowhead whales,polar bears,and the inupiat subsistence harvest.
despite these concerns,mms issued an page ea and a finding of no significant impact fonsi on february.the ea tiers to the prior environmental studies,pursuant to.the ea states the level and types of activities proposed in the shell ep are within the range of the activities described and evaluated in the beaufort sea eis and updated in ea sic for sales and.the agency concluded that the proposed activities would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment or cause undue or serious harm or damage to the human,marine,or coastal environment,in accordance with.as a result of this finding,the agency did not prepare an eis specific to this project 
on april,a group of petitioners consisting of the alaska wilderness league,the national resources defense council,and the pacific environment collectively awl,filed a petition for review with this court.simultaneously,petitioners representing the north slope borough and the alaska eskimo whaling commission collectively nsb filed an optional administrative appeal from the agency decision with the interior board of land appeals ibla.on may,the ibla declined to exercise its jurisdiction and stayed the administrative proceedings pending the outcome of awl petition for review.
shell filed a motion to intervene on may.on may,nsb filed an independent petition for review.on may,resisting environmental destruction on indigenous lands redoil,an organization representing a network of native alaskans,filed its petition for review and a motion to consolidate.this court consolidated the matter on july.on august,this court granted petitioners motion to stay,ordering the agency decision inoperative until this matter could be considered on the merits.
ii.beaufort sea resources and wildlife 
the alaskan beaufort sea is part of the arctic ocean,bordering alaska north shore.it stretches from point barrow and the chukchi sea in the west,to the canadian border in the east.the beaufort sea is home to a wide range of fish,mammal,and bird species.the western arctic stock of bowhead whales lives within the beaufort region.bowhead whales are designated as an endangered species under h.these creatures may live over years and do not reach sexual maturity until fifteen to twenty years.once they attain maturity,they reproduce roughly every three years.the western arctic group migrates twice annually.in the spring,they move eastward from the bering strait,through the alaskan beaufort sea,and into summer feeding grounds in the canadian beaufort sea.most calves are born in the chukchi sea prior to entering the beaufort.during september and october,the whales reverse course and head back to the bering strait.the whales spend considerable time feeding in the alaskan beaufort during both phases of their migratory pattern.
bowhead whales are sensitive to noise in the marine environment.the noise generated by icebreakers and drillships has the potential to cause serious consequences for bowhead whales.the impacts of a specific project would vary depending on the placement,quantity,and quality of vessels operating at each site.high levels of underwater noise can cause temporary or permanent hearing damage.even low levels of noise can affect the biological functions and behavioral patterns of marine mammals.in particular,increased noise can cause avoidance behaviors that displace migratory routes.females traveling with young calves may be especially susceptible to harm,as disturbances could separate a dependent from its caregiver.
the inupiat eskimos reside on the north coast of alaska and have long relied upon the resources of the beaufort sea and its environs for subsistence.eight different villages are scattered along the coast.as noted by the eis 
t his close relationship between the spirit of a people,their social organization,and the cultural value of subsistence hunting may be unparalleled when compared with other areas in america where energy development is taking place.the inupiat continuing strong dependence on subsistence foods,particularly marine mammals and caribou,creates a unique set of potential effects from onshore and offshore oil exploration and development on the social and cultural system.
subsistence activities are an important component of the inupiat health,as this diet and lifestyle protects against degenerative health risks.further,as the eis states s ubsistence activities are assigned the highest cultural values by the inupiat and provide a sense of identity in addition to being an important economic pursuit.
bowhead whales are an important subsistence resource for the inupiat.the harvest of bowhead whales is regulated by the international whaling commission,which sets guidelines on the number of whales that can be taken for subsistence purposes.the whale hunt is a dangerous and arduous process for inupiat whalers,but it produces large amounts of meat consumed by inupiat communities.shell proposed activities take place in and adjacent to the subsistence bowhead whale hunting grounds for the villagers of both nuiqsut and kaktovik.as a result,there is the potential that shell activities may disrupt the inupiat whaling activities.

discussion 
jurisdiction over nsb and redoil petitions for review 
this court has jurisdiction over all claims before us.respondents unsuccessfully argue that nsb and redoil petitions should be dismissed as untimely.ocsla jurisdictional provision provides that a petition for review must be filed with the court within sixty days of any contested action.c.respondents assert that the action at issue here is mms approval of shell ep on february.under this logic,the time limit expired on april,and jurisdiction would therefore be barred over the petitions filed by nsb on may,and redoil on may.
however,since nsb and redoil utilized the administrative appeal process,the deadline did not begin to run on february.nsb and redoil filed an optional appeal of the agency decision with the ibla on april,pursuant to.this optional appeal was filed within the timeline established by.on may,the ibla declined to exercise its jurisdiction and stayed further proceedings pending the outcome of awl petition,already filed in this court.the statute of limitations was tolled during the administrative appeal process,and the period to file a petition for review began to run after the ibla issued its decision on may see icc of locomotive eng rs,d holding that a timely petition for administrative review stops the running of the statute of limitations.by filing on may and may,the organizations petitioned for review well within the statutory time period 
respondents argument that tolling does not apply in this context is unavailing.for purposes of judicial review,the filing of an optional administrative appeal renders mms february,decision.see acura of bellevue reich,cir we hold that exercise of an optional appeal to a department alj renders the initial administrator decision nonfinal for purposes of judicial review under the apa.the statute of limitations was tolled while the administrative appeal was pending.see,of locomotive eng rs,at.
respondents assert that the supreme court decision in stone ins,d,limits the availability of tolling in this context.to the contrary,stone in fact reiterates the strength of the conventional tolling rule during administrative appeals.at.that case dealt with a very specific jurisdictional provision in the immigration and nationality act ina.the statute stated 
w henever a petitioner seeks review of an order under this section,any review sought with respect to a motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall be consolidated with the review of the order.
a current version at b.the court examined the statutory language and the legislative history to conclude that the statute is best understood as reflecting an intent on the part of congress that deportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance,irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider.stone,at.the court deviated from the general tolling principle because of specific indications from congress that it intended such a result.id.at.congress chose to depart from the ordinary judicial treatment of agency orders under reconsideration see also id.at.this provision is best understood as reflecting congress expectation that in the particular context of ins deportation orders the normal tolling rule will not apply.
the jurisdictional statute in ocsla is not analogous to the ina statute at issue in stone.the statute in stone directly addressed the relationship between judicial review and agency reconsideration.see a.ocsla jurisdictional provision uses standard language that does not suggest any intent to diverge from general tolling principles.see.the statute generically states that petitions for review must be filed within sixty days after the date of such action.id.c.there is no indication here that congress intended to depart from established tolling principles.additionally,permitting tolling does not frustrate the prompt implementation of mms action.the regulations provide that the agency decisions remain in effect during an administrative appeal,unless a stay is granted.a.mms decisions can therefore have immediate effect,unless a reviewing body has legitimate reason to grant a stay.
the dissent erroneously argues that c prohibits any internal administrative appeal of the secretary decision to approve an exploration plan.however,that section prohibits only other forms of judicial review and is silent as to administrative review.sections c through c by their own terms apply only to judicial review and sections c through c establish rules for that judicial review.the only possible basis for the dissent conclusion is section c,which provides that a ny action of the secretary specified in paragraph or shall only be subject to review pursuant to the provisions of this subsection,and shall be excluded from citizen suits which are permitted pursuant to subsection a of this section.id.notably,the latter half of c,like the remainder of c,is concerned exclusively with judicial review.in this statutory context,it is clear that,just like every other provision of c,the review covered by the first half of c is judicial review section c simply preempts other statutory avenues for judicial review,such as the administrative procedure act.because c is silent as to the availability or timing of administrative review,general principles of administrative tolling,as exemplified in brotherhood of locomotive engineers,apply,and the deadline did not begin to run until the ibla issued its decision on may.
nsb and redoil did not relinquish their opportunity for judicial review by opting to file an administrative appeal first.the statute of limitations was tolled during the appeal process,and petitions for review were filed well within sixty days after the ibla issued its order.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over all parties.
ii.compliance with nepa hard look review 
statutory background 
ocsla provides for a process for oil and gas development,with nepa review at each stage.see sec y of the interior california,d delineating the four distinct statutory stages to developing an offshore well,each requiring separate regulatory review.the process involves preparation of a schedule lease sales exploration of the area and development and production.id.the continuing review process allows an agency to adjust its analysis to make sure energy production activities are conducted in an environmentally sound manner.the case before us involves exploration,the third stage of the process.at this phase,a lessee submits an ep for review and approval.c.the agency has thirty days to review the ep.id.c.the agency must disapprove the plan if it would result in serious harm or damage to the marine,coastal,or human environment.see a a i.
as noted by the supreme court,nepa declares a broad national commitment to protecting and promoting environmental quality.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.nepa ensures that an agency will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts it also guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.id.at.
nepa requires that,to the fullest extent possible,all federal agencies shall prepare an eis when considering proposed activities significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.robertson,at.see also blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir threshold question in nepa challenge is whether a proposed project will significantly affect the environment,thereby triggering the requirement for an eis quoting c.an agency may first prepare a less exhaustive ea to determine whether an eis is necessary.parks conservation ass babbitt,cir.an ea is a concise public document that b riefly provide s sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a fonsi.a.because the very important decision whether to prepare an eis is based solely on the ea,the ea is fundamental to the process.metcalf daley,cir.an ea is sufficient if it provides enough evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a fonsi.anderson evans,cir.federal regulations encourage agencies to tier their environmental analyses in order to streamline and focus the review process.whenever a broad eis has been prepared the subsequent statement or environmental assessment need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement and incorporate discussions from the broader statement by reference and shall concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action.
a n eis must be prepared if substantial questions are raised as to whether a project may cause significant degradation of some human environmental factor.idaho sporting congress thomas,cir quoting greenpeace action franklin,cir.if an agency finds an eis is not required and issues a fonsi,it must provide a convincing statement of reasons to explain its decision.blue mountains,at see also e.an agency can not rely on mere conclusory assertions that an activity will have only an insignificant impact on the environment.ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir.rather,the agency must demonstrate that it took the requisite hard look at the potential environmental impacts of a project,thereby justifying its action.blue mountains,at ocean advocates,at kern bureau of land,cir.
to provide guidance on how nepa should be applied,the council on environmental quality promulgated regulations explaining what factors an agency must consider in determining if a project potential effects are significant.see.this requires considerations of both context and intensity.id.context refers to the location and interests that would be affected by the proposed action.id.a.intensity refers to the severity of the impact.id.b.in considering intensity,an agency should consider up to ten factors that shed light on the significance of a project.id.those factors include the effect on public health and safety the unique characteristics of the geographic area the degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial the degree to which the possible effects are highly uncertain or involve unknown risks and the possible impacts on an endangered or threatened species.id.b.
sufficiency of mms environmental analysis 
mms has not provided a convincing statement of reasons explaining why shell exploratory drilling plans at these specific sites would have an insignificant impact on bowhead whales and inupiat subsistence activities.as a result,we are unpersuaded that mms took the requisite hard look at the environmental impact of this project.there remain substantial questions as to whether shell plan may cause significant harm to the people and wildlife of the beaufort sea region.
respondents primary response is that,through the tiering process,the agency sufficiently analyzed all possible environmental impacts of this project.the ea is tiered to the eis and the eas for lease sales and pursuant to.according to respondents,any analysis that is allegedly missing from the ea is adequately covered in those previous documents.respondents point out that ocsla only allows thirty days to approve an ep,see c,and argue that this short statutory deadline encourages a streamlined review process.the agency may not,however,hide behind the cloak of its generalized eis.nepa applies to all stages of the ocsla cycle.vill.of false pass clark,cir.when the agency is tasked with assessing the environmental impacts of a particular exploration plan,it has a duty to take a hard look at the consequences of drilling in specific sites.as the agency itself noted in the eis,a ny proposed exploration or development plans that may result for the area evaluated in this eis,would require additional nepa environmental analysis using site specific information.mms environmental analysis is inadequate because it fails to consider the impacts this specific project will have on bowhead whales and inupiat subsistence activities.
impacts on bowhead whales 
mms ea fails to take a hard look at whether shell exploratory drilling program would have a significant effect on bowhead whales,an endangered species.see b agency should consider degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species.the ea lacks sufficient analysis on the consequences of underwater noise and its impact on bowheads migratory routes.although the presence of some negative effects does not mandate a finding of significant impact,the agency must consider the degree of adverse effect on a species.env t protection info.center epic forest,cir see also native ecosystems council,at any mention of an adverse impact does not necessarily compel an eis,but an agency should not use a soft touch or of negative effects.
the major shortcoming of the agency environmental analysis is that it does not assess the impacts that would be felt by the bowhead whale population from a project in the migratory route that involves two drillships and two icebreakers.the eis envisions a maximum of two drilling rigs would be used during this time,and the ea assumed that two drilling rigs with icebreaker support might operate during any year.however,aside from nominally mentioning the possible extent of this project,the studies relied upon by the agency do not actually assess the potential significance of underwater noise from a drilling operation of this scope.
the eis discusses,in a general sense,the impact of noise on bowhead whales,citing a number of studies that have been conducted on the topic.however,that document contains no studies that analyze the effects of noise from a project with two drillships and two icebreakers.the studies assessing the effect of noise in other situations suggest that bowheads respond to drilling noise by altering their migration speed and swimming direction to avoid closely approaching the noise sources.in discussing icebreaker noise,the eis states,e ffects of an actual icebreaker on migrating bowheads,especially mothers and calves,could be biologically significant.moreover,studies cited in the multisale eis use varying methodologies and come to inconclusive results.many of these reports use noise simulations,but there is limited data on how bowheads would respond in an uncontrolled setting.the reports state there are no observations of bowhead reactions to icebreakers breaking ice and playback results may somewhat understate the differences between truly undisturbed whales versus those exposed to playbacks.the generalized information contained in the eis does not adequately demonstrate that the agency has taken a hard look at the effects of shell project on bowhead whales.after making the observation that noise could cause significant biological effects,there is not additional information that supports why any specific project would not cause real harm to whale populations.in particular,it is not evident from the eis that a project using the type of equipment proposed by shell would not have a significant impact on bowhead whales.
the ea does not cure this infirmity.the ea gives only a brief description of the level of noise the individual drillships in shell proposal could make,but does not examine the combined effect of all vessels operating simultaneously.the agency analysis relies in large part on a biological opinion biop prepared by the national marine fisheries service nmfs in.mms asserts that the biop covers the proposed shell operations because it assumed a situation where two drilling rigs with icebreaker support would operate in an area covering up to twelve wells.but there is no indication that the biop in fact relies on studies involving two drillships and two icebreakers.the biop acknowledges that the potential total adverse effects of added noise,disturbance,and related avoidance of feeding and resting habitat are unknown.in addition,t here has been no documented evidence that noise from previous ocs operations has served as a barrier to migration,but c oncentrations of loud noise and disturbance activities during the open water period have the potential to cause large numbers of bowheads to avoid using areas for resting and feeding for long periods of time while the noise producing activities continue.this analysis indicates that there are serious concerns and uncertainties about the manner in which the endangered bowhead population would respond to shell three year exploratory drilling plan.despite these concerns,the biop goes on to allege that bowhead whales exposed to activities most likely would experience temporary,nonlethal effects.it comes to the conclusion that such exploratory drilling would not jeopardize the population.this determination is not supported by the biop contrary assertions that noise could cause serious adverse effects.
mms realizes the distinguishing characteristics between shell specific proposal and the scope of prior studies,but does not then engage in any additional analysis.the agency admits in the ea that,in the past,operations with one drill ship and associated icebreakers have displaced the migration slightly,and no whales were sighted between the operations and shore,but it is unknown what the increased level of effect of two proposed drillships and associated icebreakers and other attendant vessels would be.in mms own review of a monitoring study,the agency notes that the report detected behavioral changes in bowheads around drillship operations near camden bay.mms goes on to state 
with regards to the mms significance criteria,there is no evidence that the offshore displacement persisted for more than a generation about years.so,the level of effect of a drillship in camden bay is probably not significant by mms nepa standards.however,the same type of displacement to the east of kaktovik where whales frequently feed would affect growth and could have a more serious biological effect.also,even though there is a significant biological effect from in camden bay operations,there could be a significant sociocultural effect if the bowheads do not migrate back into the shoreward portion of the migration corridor as they approach cross island.
notably,the ea also states that the effect on bowheads is likely to be greater than for the activities because of shell proposal to use two drillships,two large icebreakers,and several associated vessels.although the agency mentions the possibility for increased impacts on bowhead whales and the human populations who depend on them,it fails to take a hard look at whether a proposal of this magnitude will have significant impacts on this endangered species.
the agency attempt to rely upon a monitoring program as a mitigation measure is similarly.this section of the ea ends with a discussion of stipulation which requires that shell conduct a whale monitoring program during its drilling operations.instead of insisting on alternative mitigation measures or conducting a full eis at this time,mms states it has the authority to modify approved operations to ensure that significant biological populations or habitats deserving protection are not subject to a threat of serious,irreparable,or immediate harm.
federal regulations define mitigation as a way to avoid,minimize,rectify,or compensate for the impact of a potentially harmful action.a e.an agency can rely upon mitigation measures in determining whether an environmental impact is significant.see parks conservation ass n,at.in order to be effective,a mitigation measure must be supported by analytical data demonstrating why it will constitute an adequate buffer against the negative impacts that may result from the authorized activity.id.a mitigation measure must render potential impacts so minor as to not warrant an eis.id.the proposed monitoring program fails this test,as it could detect impacts only after they have occurred.mms statement that it would reserve the authority to modify approved operations does not provide enough protection under this standard.a court must be able to review,in advance,how specific measures will bring projects into compliance with environmental standards.see id.at the parks service proposes to increase the risk of harm to the environment and then perform its studies this approach has the process exactly backwards.monitoring may serve to confirm the appropriateness of a mitigation measure,but that does not make it an adequate mitigation measure in itself.see epic,at.
after considering the gaps in the eis and the ea,we conclude that the agency failed to take a hard look under nepa because it did not provide a analysis of impacts to the endangered bowhead whale population.the tiered ocsla process allows general analysis at the stage,but the agency must then consider impacts before approving an individual exploration plan.see pit river tribe forest,cir holding that agency could not rely on vague prior programmatic statements but needed to consider impacts when a critical decision has been made to act on a lease sale vill.of false pass watt,a purpose of ocsla is to permit an expedient resolution of preliminary matters in the development of oil lands while preserving administrative and judicial review for future times when potential threats to the environment are readily visualized and evaluated.
as the agency itself notes in the eis,the tiered approach builds on the premise that as both the agencies and companies involved move from general planning,to leasing,to exploration the specificity of the information improves.the accompanying environmental analysis that flows from each stage also is more specific with respect to location,timing,and magnitude.the ea contains the names of shell drilling vessels the kulluk and the frontier discoverer and icebreakers the kapitan dranitzyn and the vladimire ignatyuk,and mentions the other vessels shell intends to use.however,merely noting the details of shell ep does not demonstrate that the effects of this plan were actually analyzed.the results of the studies in the eis and ea were inconclusive.the agency may not rely on past studies on the general impact of noise on bowhead whales to justify its failure to conduct a particularized assessment here.this is especially true when past studies acknowledged that noise levels may,in certain circumstances,cause significant disturbances to whales.additionally,mms analysis should take a closer look at the locations of shell individual wells in relationship to the migratory patterns of the bowhead whales.
in sum,mms abrogated its nepa duties because neither the ea nor the documents it tiers to considers the specific parameters and potential dangers of shell project.there is substantial uncertainty about how various levels of noise would affect whales and their migratory patterns.see b,in its review,agency should consider degree to which possible effects to the environment are highly uncertain,as well as how action may adversely affect an endangered species.furthermore,the proposed mitigation measure does not save the plan because it is not clear that a monitoring program will ameliorate potentially serious negative impacts.see parks conservation ass n,at.
impacts on inupiat subsistence activities 
bowhead whale harvest 
mms also failed to take a hard look at the effects shell project would have on the inupiat subsistence uses of bowhead whales.the agency review should consider how the proposal affects public health or safety,and the degree to which its impact on the human environment is unknown or highly controversial.b.mms defines a significant effect on a sociocultural system as a chronic disruption of sociocultural systems that occurs for a period of years,with a tendency toward the displacement of existing social patterns.
as discussed above,mms did not adequately evaluate the consequences of drilling in these specific locations on bowhead whale populations.that same analysis applies to the effect the drilling plan will have on the bowhead whale harvest and the important role this tradition plays in inupiat culture.mms failure to consider the parameters of shell plan results in an inadequate analysis of the impacts of this proposal on communities that rely on bowhead whales for subsistence.the ea itself notes that even if underwater noise does not cause a significant biological effect for the whales themselves,there could be a significant sociocultural effect if the bowheads do not migrate back into the migration corridor.mms acknowledges this possibility,but then comes to the inexplicable conclusion that this project can proceed without other modifications.the agency further states that ideally,drilling and high resolution seismic activity would not deflect whales until whalers had harvested whales but does not give any rationale explaining why it expects this ideal scenario will occur.the ea itself admits that it is unknown what the increased level of effect of two proposed drillships and associated icebreakers and other attendant vessels would be.
without examining the possible level of disruption to the inupiat harvest of bowhead whales,mms offers only conclusory assertions that impacts will not be significant.see ocean advocates,at holding that army corps of engineers failed to take hard look where its assessment included only conclusory assertions and did not discuss contrary evidence.accordingly,petitioners correctly posit that the agency must conduct greater analysis of how shell activities in these particular locations,using two drillships and two icebreakers,will affect the inupiat reliance on the bowhead harvest.
mms asserts that any threat to the inupiat subsistence whaling would be minimized through a conflict avoidance agreement.again,the deficiencies in the agency analysis are not cured through its proposed mitigation measure.in order to rely on mitigation to obviate further analysis,the measure must be identified and its effectiveness analyzed.parks conservation ass n,at holding eis must be prepared where monitoring and mitigation measures were uncertain.additionally,m itigation must be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the agency must provide analytic data on the efficacy of a proposed measure,and the court must decide whether it will render such impacts so minor as to not warrant an eis.parks conservation ass n,at.
the conflict avoidance agreement process is too vague and uncertain as a mitigation measure to justify the agency decision not to engage in further analysis.conflict avoidance agreements come about through a voluntary process and are renegotiated every year.the agency is not party to the process,and any agreement made is not legally binding.the ea itself notes that without an agreement,there are serious questions about whether the project would have significant impacts on inupiat communities.the agency states without such conflict avoidance measures in place,significant impacts to the subsistence resources and hunts for bowhead whales,seals,and polar bears could occur.it goes on to say only a carefully constructed and monitored conflict avoidance agreement could produce some remedy to disturbances to bowhead whales and the subsistence hunt.the language used by mms reveals the real risks this project poses to the bowhead population and inupiat communities.an annual voluntary process does not sufficiently mitigate the concerns raised by petitioners and acknowledged by the agency.
simply because conflict avoidance agreements have been used effectively in the past does not mean that an agency can rely on them to cure inadequacies in the environmental assessment mms abdicates its responsibility for analyzing the effects on subsistence whaling by leaving it up to the parties to come up with their own agreement,outside of the nepa review process.mms does provide that,if the parties fail to reach an agreement,mms may the situation and make a final determination on the adequacy of the measures taken to prevent unreasonable conflicts with subsistence harvests.however,this provision is not sufficient to meet the agency obligations.there is still no analytical data that shows how the process would reduce the impact to whaling below the level of significance.see parks conservation ass n,at citing idaho sporting congress,at.by relying on the uncertain outcome of the conflict avoidance agreement process,the agency deprives this court of its ability to review whether the measure is sufficiently protective.in sum,the agency is not relieved of its responsibility to conduct more specific analysis on how this project will affect the inupiat harvest of bowhead whales.
ii.other subsistence activities 
shell activities will also affect other inupiat subsistence resources,such as beluga whales,caribou,and fish.petitioners urge the agency to take a closer look at the impacts of exploration because of the proximity of the proposed activities to the inupiat hunting and fishing grounds.the ea comments focus almost entirely on the subsistence use of bowhead whales.it notes only in one sentence that helicopter and aircraft supply flights have the potential to disturb caribou movements and alter the subsistence hunt.the eis takes a cursory glance at these other animal populations,stating that drilling activities could affect the availability of beluga whales to subsistence hunters.the study further acknowledges that flight activity may disturb caribou populations 
the biggest gap in the agency eis and ea is the lack of both information and analysis examining the impacts this project will have on fish populations.in analyzing fish populations,the ea acknowledges given scientific uncertainty surrounding how several important fish species would react to varying levels of drilling program noise,we believe it possible there will be more than a minimal level of effect on some species.mms acknowledges that it can not concur with shell assurances that its activities may have minimal to no impact on fish.the agency goes on to state 
the mms also can not concur that the effects on all fish species would be short term or that these potential effects are insignificant,nor would they be limited to the localized displacement of fish,because they could persist for up to five months each year for three consecutive years and they could occur during critical times in the life cycle of important fish species.
the mms remains concerned that the potential adverse effects described for several fish species will occur to an unknown degree,however none are expected to exceed the level that would require three generations to recover the threshold for a significant effect.
after this lengthy discussion on concerns and gaps in the data,the ea abrupt conclusion that any potential effects will be insignificant is unsubstantiated.this is the type of conclusory assertion that is disfavored by this court because the agency has not provided any scientific data that justifies this position.see ocean advocates,at.
the ea notes that it does not have the data to examine the full effect of underwater noise on fish movement.when information necessary to determine the effects is readily available or easily gathered,the law requires that an agency gather such information.see parks conservation ass n,at stating agency lack of knowledge does not excuse the preparation of an eis rather it requires the agency to do the necessary work to obtain it.here,mms has not shown that this information is unattainable.if data on the impacts of fish is not readily available,then the agency must give a more complete explanation of how,in light of those gaps,it still believes this project would not cause a significant impact on fish and the communities that consume them.
the ea ultimately concludes that inupiat communities may suffer cultural consequences from drilling activities,but does not state whether these effects will be significant.instead,the ea relies on mitigation measures in the hopes that they would ameliorate any harm done required mitigation,monitoring,and conflict avoidance measures would serve collectively to mitigate disturbance effects on native lifestyles and subsistence practices and likely would mitigate any consequent impacts on sociocultural systems.as discussed above,these mitigation measures do not go far enough to rectify the potential that shell project will cause substantial harm to inupiat communities on alaska northern shore.
in sum,mms failed to take a hard look at the impacts this plan will have on inupiat subsistence activities.the agency notes the gaps in its data and the potential for serious consequences,but then comes to the unsubstantiated conclusion that any impacts will be insignificant.the agency broad assertions are not supported by the record.see epic,at agency must consider all relevant factors and provide a convincing statement of reasons to justify its decision.accordingly,mms should create either a revised environmental analysis or,as necessary,an environmental impact statement,taking a closer look at how shell drilling in these specific sites will affect inupiat subsistence activities.
impacts of potential crude oil spills 
despite any other insufficiencies,mms environmental analysis does adequately examine the impacts of a potential crude oil spill.the ea states,f or purposes of this ea analysis,no crude oil spills are assumed from exploration activities.this assumption is based on the low rate of exploratory drilling blowouts per well drilled and the history of exploration spills on the arctic ocs petitioners contend that this assumption is erroneous,and the agency must consider the likelihood of a spill in relationship to the harm such an event would cause.this argument is unavailing.the agency assessment makes the proper inquiry into the risk of an oil spill,and no further analysis is required in relationship to this exploration plan.
in the process of nepa review,an agency should consider the degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.b.nepa does not require consideration of risks that are merely speculative or infinitesimal.no gwen alliance aldridge,cir ground zero ctr.for action dep t of the navy,cir.an agency should assess the likelihood of a particular risk along with the consequences of such an accident.see city of new york dep t of,cir it is only the risk of accident that might render the proposed action environmentally significant.that circumstance obliges the agency to undertake risk assessment an estimate of both the consequences that might occur and the probability of their occurrence.
despite its initial assumption that an oil spill will not occur,the ea includes discussion of the effects of a potential spill on the inupiat subsistence harvest and a variety of animal species.the ea also incorporates the eis extensive discussion of a potential spill.the eis recognizes that a very large oil spill is an issue of concern to everyone.a very large oil spill is a event with the potential for very high effects.the eis analyzes data from spills around the world,since very large spills in waters have been extremely rare.the document further considers the potential effects of small and large oil spills in the beaufort sea region.appended to the eis is a lengthy document entitled the information,models and assumptions we use to analyze the effects of oil spills in this eis.this report includes information on the history and behavior of spilled oil.in evaluating the risks of an oil spill,the agency has,over time,conducted extensive studies on the likelihood of oil spills in the beaufort sea.these include the and bercha reports on the alternative oil spill occurrence estimators and their variability for the beaufort and chukchi seas.the analysis of oil spill risks was updated in the eas for both lease sale and lease sale.there is no indication that the agency erred in relying on these documents in its review of this specific project.
petitioners argue that extensive discussion of spills in mms prior analyses and the requirement that an oil response plan be prepared is evidence that an oil spill is a reasonably foreseeable event.under their logic,the ea should therefore have included analysis on the possibility of such a spill.petitioners support this contention by citing to cases where an agency was required to consider even remote risks that could cause great harm.see,san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory comm n,cir holding that agency was unreasonable in categorically dismissing the possibility of a terrorist attack as too remote and highly speculative to warrant nepa consideration.petitioners also point out that,even if an oil spill is unlikely,the consequences could be great.petitioners contend that the ea blanket assumption failed to adequately consider the relationship between the risk and the consequences of an oil spill.
petitioners position on this issue is flawed.the ea properly tiers to the lengthy discussion of the risk and impacts of oil spills in the eis.this case may be distinguished from san luis obispo mothers for peace because here,the agency does not claim it has no obligation to consider this risk,but only that it has sufficiently done so in previous studies.there is no evidence that anything about this particular project requires separate analysis on oil spills.no special risk creates the need for additional evaluation of factors that were not already considered in mms prior studies.
although the language in the ea may not have been ideal,mms assumption that there would not be an oil spill was supplemented with comprehensive studies on the likelihood and impact of such an event.accordingly,the agency did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in its assessment of the potential effects of an oil spill from this project.
necessity of a revised ea or an eis 
mms has violated nepa by failing to take a hard look at the impacts of shell proposal on bowhead whales and inupiat subsistence activities.mms has not provided a convincing statement of reasons to justify its decision not to complete an eis.see blue mountains,at.
moreover,several of the regulatory significance criteria are triggered here.see sierra club forest,cir holding that an agency decision not to prepare an eis was unreasonable because record demonstrated that four of the regulatory factors were implicated.shell project is located in an increasingly fragile ecosystem and near the arctic national wildlife refuge,an ecologically critical area under b.the contentious nature of the agency internal communication during the review process demonstrates the controversy surrounding the project.see id.b see also native ecosystems council,at noting that a project is highly controversial if there is a substantial dispute about the effect of an action.as discussed above,the impact of activities at these particular sites poses an unknown risk to bowhead whales and inupiat subsistence activities.see id.the project could also have a serious effect on an endangered species bowhead whales.see id.b.finally,there is the potential for cumulatively significant impacts as the project continues through exploration and into the production phase,and the region continues to develop.see id.b.
in light of the potential for serious impacts on bowhead whales and inupiat subsistence activities,the agency erred by not undertaking a more careful analysis before issuing a fonsi.due to the inadequacies in this particular ea,there is uncertainty over whether the proposed project may have a significant impact.accordingly we remand to the agency to either prepare a revised ea or,as necessary,an eis.
the statutory scheme does not preclude a finding that an eis may be appropriate in these circumstances.mms argues that the strict timelines in ocsla indicate that an eis is not a feasible option at the exploration stage.the agency only has thirty days to approve or disapprove of an exploration plan.c.respondents argue that thirty days is not enough time to generate a full eis.however,in passing ocsla,congress specifically provided that it did not alter an agency obligations under nepa.see a see also c the agency will evaluate the environmental impacts of the activities described in your proposed ep and prepare environmental documentation under nepa.this court has recognized that nepa may require an environmental impact statement at each stage leasing,exploration,and production and development.vill.of false pass clark,at.
the agency may be correct that it is difficult for an agency to conduct a full eis in only thirty days,but its argument that ocsla precludes such a result is unconvincing.there is flexibility built into the regulatory scheme so that the agency can perform its full duties under nepa.the clock begins to run only when an exploration plan is deemed complete.a.if the agency is able to identify gaps before that point,then it can request that information be added before the proposal is finalized.see b.additionally,at the end of the review period,the agency may opt to require modifications to an ep if there are concerns that it does not comport with environmental standards.b.these options give the agency additional time to consider a plan and compile an environmental impact statement,if necessary.to say simply that the agency only has thirty days to complete a full eis is misleading.here,since the agency decision to issue a fonsi without considering the environmental impacts to bowhead whales and subsistence resources was in error,mms should prepare either a more thorough environmental analysis or an eis,as necessary,examining the consequences of drilling at these specific locations.see metcalf daley,cir.
iii.mms compliance with ocsla 
the agency approval of this project also violated ocsla.ocsla implementing regulations require that,when evaluating exploration plans,an agency should consider information about proposed well location and spacing.exploration plans must be project specific and describe the resources,conditions,and activities that could be affected.in particular,an ep must include a map showing the surface location and water depth of each proposed well and the locations of all associated drilling unit anchors.b.shell submitted the locations of the drilling sites,but did not specify where it wished to drill in and.shell noted that future drilling locations will depend on what is found in the first sivulliq exploration.without specific information about future well locations,the agency can not meet its obligation to review and approve proposed well location and spacing in accord with.as a result,the agency erred by approving an ep for without knowing where shell would be drilling for the last two years.
the agency is not saved by regulations that allow mms to consider the impacts of drilling at subsequent locations when the company requests permits for those specific sites.see.these regulations stipulate that to obtain approval for a well,the applicant must have i nclude d the well in its approved exploration plan.b.the wells for and were not included in shell ep.the permit regulations are not an adequate mechanism enabling the agency to check shell actions at a later date.mms also points to c,which enables the agency to relax certain informational requirements when 
sufficient applicable information or analysis is readily available to mms 
other coastal or marine resources are not present or affected 
other factors such as technological advances affect information needs or 
information is not necessary or required for a state to determine consistency with their czma plan.
it is not clear how any of these sections would apply here.to the contrary,having specific information about well locations is critical to the agency ability to analyze the project environmental effects.mms acted in contravention of the regulations by approving shell plan without determining the locations of the wells that would be drilled in that period.in order to comply with the regulations,the agency needs to consider the location of the proposed wells before it can approve the project for all three years.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the agency approval of shell exploration plan and remand for the agency to prepare a revised ea or,as necessary,an eis.shell motion to lift the stay is denied as moot.
vacated and remanded.
i respectfully dissent on two grounds.first,north slope borough and the alaska eskimo whaling commission nsb and resisting environmental destruction on indigenous lands redoil filed their petitions for review after the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations,and neither congress nor this court provide nsb or redoil with an exception to the requirement of timely filing.
second,because the minerals management service mms approval of shell exploration plan was neither arbitrary nor capricious,we have no power to overturn the agency action,and the majority efforts to do so contravene our recent en banc decision in the lands council mcnair,cir.
jurisdiction 
we do not have jurisdiction over nsb and redoil petitions for review because the petitions were filed in this court more than days after the agency action here on review mms approval of shell offshore,shell exploration plan.in their petitions for review,nsb and redoil contend mms failed to consider how shell exploration plan would harm some inupiat subsistence activities to wit,the inupiat practice of bowhead whale hunting.we lack jurisdiction over these petitions because it took nsb and redoil days to file the petitions they were required by statute to file within days.
at all times relevant here,the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,et,provided 
any action of the secretary specified in paragraph or shall only be subject to review pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 
c emphases added.this subsection by which a ny action of the secretary may only be reviewed is c.
c makes clear the statute applies to a ny action of the secretary to approve any exploration plan and that such actions shall be subject to judicial review only in a united states court of appeals for a circuit in which an affected state is located.id.emphases added.thus,review under c must be judicial in nature,because any action by the secretary to approve an exploration plan shall only be subject to review pursuant to the mechanisms described in the provisions of c and those mechanisms are only judicial 
subsection c provides that judicial review shall be available only to a person who files a petition for review of the secretary action within sixty days after the date of such action accordingly,an mms order approving an exploration plan,as here,is reviewable only in a court of appeals and only when the petition for review is filed within days.mms approved shell exploration plan on february.the last day to petition for review of the mms decision was april,days later.nsb and redoil filed their petitions for review in this court on may,and may,respectively.
the majority ignores the plain text of the statute,and instead relies on the fact that on april,before filing their petitions for review in this court,nsb and redoil chose to file a purported administrative appeal with the interior board of land appeals ibla of mms approval filing that is not authorized by the relevant statute.they purported to do so pursuant to on may,ibla suspended proceedings on the administrative appeal pending the outcome of the instant petition for review.
the majority holds the statutory filing period was tolled during nsb and redoil unauthorized administrative appeal.accordingly,the majority holds nsb and redoil may and may petitions in this court were timely.the majority holds ibla suspension of the administrative appeal pending the outcome of the instant action is a reviewable final agency order and,thus,the period for nsb and redoil to file their petitions for review of mms order approving the exploration plan began when ibla suspended the unauthorized administrative appeal.
the majority use of the word tolling here is inventive.the tolling the majority applies is different from any known concept of tolling by appeal or equitable tolling,which is perhaps why,as discussed below,the majority cites only inapposite cases.here,the question is not whether the time to file for review of mms approval of shell exploration plan was extended by the administrative appeal.rather,the question is whether the filing of an administrative appeal with ibla suddenly rendered mms approval of the exploration plan,which constitutes a final appealable order,therefore,whether ibla later suspension of the administrative appeal was itself a final agency action that restarted the filing clock.see united states ibarra,d t he issue is better described as whether the day period began to run on the date of the first order or on the date of the order denying the motion for reconsideration,rather than as a matter of tolling.principles of equitable tolling usually dictate that when a time bar has been suspended and then begins to run again upon a later event,the time remaining on the clock is calculated by subtracting from the full limitations period whatever time ran before the clock was stopped.
contrary to the majority assertion,ibla suspension of proceedings can not constitute a final agency action because a suspension of proceedings pending the outcome of collateral proceedings is,by definition,not final see bennett spear,d as a general matter,two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.nothing is more interlocutory than a suspension of in review of an agency action or a divorce decree.thus,the only final agency action here was mms approval of the exploration plan 
further,the majority tolling theory is inapplicable as a matter of law because,although the department of the interior provides a general scheme for administrative appeals of mms decisions pursuant to the regulation on which nsb and redoil erroneously relied when filing their unauthorized administrative appeal,congress expressly restricted the availability of review for mms approval of an exploration plan to the court of appeals.see any action of the secretary to approve any exploration plan under this subchapter shall be subject to judicial review only in a united states court of appeals emphasis added.thus,there is no statutory administrative review process during which a court may stay the running of ocsla limitations period.nsb and redoil simply filed administrative appeals under general agency regulations,and those appeals clashed with a specific statutory prohibition of an appeal other than to a united states court of appeals.it should be that simple the specific congressional statute trumps the general agency regulation.see chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.
even if tolling somehow were to apply,under any recognized tolling theory the statute of limitations would have begun to toll on april,when nsb and redoil filed their administrative appeals.on april,only three days remained in the statutory filing period.thus,when ibla suspended nsb and redoil unauthorized administrative appeal on may,nsb and redoil would have had three days in which to file timely petitions for review in this court by may.their petitions were not filed until may,redoil and may,nsb.thus,the petitions were filed late,even if one accepts the majority creative tolling theory.
to support its tolling theory,the majority opinion relies on cases interpreting the hobbs act,to hold the tolling rule applicable under that statutory scheme also applies here.cases based on the hobbs act,the primary case cited by the majority,icc brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d are inapposite because the hobbs act simply does not apply to decisions of the secretary of the interior,whose authority is delegated to mms,and the rationale behind hobbs act tolling does not apply to a situation like this one 
the hobbs act does not apply to actions by mms or the secretary of the interior.
any tolling rule derived from an interpretation of the hobbs act is off base because the hobbs act does not apply to mms.the hobbs act states t he court of appeals other than the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of final orders from certain specific not those within department of the interior,including mms.on its face,the hobbs act applies only to final orders of the federal communications commission the secretary of agriculture the secretary of transportation the federal maritime commission the atomic energy commission and the surface transportation board,and also orders under section of the fair housing act.in some instances,an agency organic statutes may refer to the hobbs act as the appropriate statute for obtaining judicial review.see,a providing for judicial review of final orders of removal of aliens under the hobbs act.ocsla,however,is not such a statute.instead,ocsla contains its own provisions for exclusive judicial review by the courts of appeals.thus,a tolling rule under the hobbs act does not apply to agency action taken by the secretary of the interior or mms under ocsla.
here,nsb and redoil simply may not have read ocsla,et,and filed an administrative appeal under a law that provides for review only by this court.now they want a free pass.we should not give it to them as the saying goes,rules is rules.sci.and tech.network,fcc.
the justifications for hobbs act tolling do not apply here.
even were the hobbs act applicable to mms final order,the underlying rationale for staying the running of the limitations period under the hobbs act does not apply to mms approval of exploration plans under ocsla.in the hobbs act cases,the agencies the court reviewed possessed statutory authority to conduct administrative reviews of their orders after the filing of a petition for rehearing or reconsideration with the agency.see,c granting administrative powers to review orders of the department of transportation b federal maritime commission b atomic energy commission.hence,in those cases,including those cited by the majority,it was consistent with congress stated intent to stay the limitations period for judicial review of actions by those agencies because congress gave those agencies statutory power and authority to review their own actions before another court did.
in contrast,ocsla and the organic statutes for the department of the interior do not provide for interior or other agency administrative review of mms decisions.the statutory scheme provides the secretary of the interior only with the general authority to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out ocsla,but not to review an mms order approving an exploration plan.indeed,as discussed above,the ocsla provision governing the approval of exploration plans expressly limits review to a petition to the courts of appeal.
thus,we lack a statutory basis on which to allow tolling for an administrative appeal in the ocsla context.further,tolling here violates the clear intent of congress that the secretary shall approve exploration plans within days.the majority holding that action on exploration plans may be administratively appealed to the ibla and,almost over a period of time longer than days,defeats congress express desire for rapid approval or denial of exploration plans the justifications for hobbs act tolling simply do not apply to review of an exploration plan approval under ocsla.
finally,the supreme court has made clear that statutorily imposed times to file a notice of appeal and,by extension,a petition for review are jurisdictional and are not subject to equitable exceptions.see bowles russell,d the majority does not claim there are grounds for equitable exceptions to the rule.here,as discussed,we lack any statutory basis for tolling.therefore,because ocsla provides exclusive jurisdiction for review of mms approval of exploration plans to the courts of appeals,because the hobbs act does not apply to petitions for review under ocsla,and because the justifications for hobbs act tolling are not present in the context of this case,we do not have jurisdiction over nsb and redoil untimely petitions.
our lack of jurisdiction over nsb and redoil untimely petitions narrows the scope of our review because it eliminates from our consideration those issues that were not raised in the timely filed petition of the alaska wilderness league,the national resources defense council,and the pacific environment collectively awl.specifically,we lack jurisdiction over claims that mms failed to take a hard look at the potential impact of shell exploration plan on inupiat subsistence hunting,as awl did not raise this contention.
we still must determine whether,as awl did contend,mms failed to take a hard look at the impact of shell exploration plan on bowhead whales.
under ocsla,the secretary of the interior and,by delegation,mms,are charged with ensuring the vital national resource reserve of the outer continental shelf be made available for expeditious and orderly development,subject to environmental safeguards.under the national environmental policy act nepa,et,the agency must utilize a staged process that conducts environmental review at each stage of a proposed action ocsla review.see.
this case comes to us at stage three of nepa analysis at this stage,ocsla to lessee shell commencing exploration of potential oil or natural gas such lessee must submit an exploration plan to the secretary for approval.c.if the secretary finds the plan is consistent with ocsla,ocsla regulations,and the provisions of the lease,the exploration plan shall be approved within days of submission.id.
as the majority correctly observes,mms prepared an initial,environmental impact statement that discussed potential environmental effects from development of each of shell sites eis.mms then prepared a supplemental,environmental assessment ea that supplemented the eis for two of shell lease plots about which mms decided additional information was needed.in agency parlance,this supplementing process is called tiering.tiering means the agency bases its later analyses on its initial comprehensive analysis,instead of preparing another page eis.petitioners and the majority do not want mms to use its extensive prior work to inform its decisions on individual leases,but to prepare a new,eis for each lease shell proposes to explore.this is worse than the wheel this is the wheel for each wheel of the car.
the process will be expensive,and largely duplicative,which is precisely why nepa implementing regulations encourage tiering of nepa eliminate repetitive discussion of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review.whenever a broad environmental impact statement has been prepared the subsequent statement or environmental assessment need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement.the agency use of tiering allows it to fulfill its nepa obligations while complying with the strict turnaround time ocsla requires.see c.here,following its tiered analysis,mms issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi,which is the agency determination that the existing analyses are sufficient and a new,eis or revised ea is unnecessary.see a.
the majority concludes mms failed to include a sufficiently detailed analysis of the biological effects of shell exploration plan on bowhead whales,and that its order approving the plan was therefore arbitrary and capricious.the majority holds the agency should have prepared a new,selfcontained eis or revised ea in response to shell exploration plan,rather than the ea it prepared,which tiered to the eis.
mms conducted a thorough review to determine whether its ea was sufficient fully to analyze shell exploration plan.pursuant to regulations,mms considered the significance of shell proposal in terms of context and intensity.see.this means the agency considered,in relevant part whether,after a hard look,shell exploration plan was likely to impact bowhead whales in a significant manner whether the likely consequences of the drilling plan were highly controversial whether the agency identification of cumulatively significant impacts on bowhead whales required a separate eis or different ea and whether shell needed to identify the precise locations of each well it planned to drill.the majority holds each of these considerations requires the agency to produce a supplemental eis or revised ea,and reverses the agency order.for the reasons discussed below,with respect,the majority is in error.we should deny the petition.
mms gave the potential effects of shell exploration plan on bowhead whales a hard look.
the majority concludes mms analysis of the effect on bowhead whales of the proposed exploration plan was insufficient for the agency to approve the exploration plan without requiring a new,separate eis or revised ea for each lease site because the agency did not give the plan a hard look.we will find an agency gave an environmental issue a hard look under nepa if the agency puts forth a convincing statement of reasons that explain why the project will impact the environment no more than insignificantly.ocean advocates united states army corps of eng rs,cir.this statement may not be a mere conclusory assertion.id.
the majority concludes the eis and tiered ea it prepared were insufficient to constitute a hard look the majority,not the expert ea and eis were too generalized to consider adequately the impact of shell planned activities on bowhead whales.according to the majority,it was not enough for the agency to analyze studies regarding the impact of the type of noise shell equipment would produce on bowhead whales as they swim by in the majority expertise,the agency failed to analyze such vital additional consequences of drilling as the noise of two drillships with two icebreakers versus the noise of two drillships with one icebreaker,and the noise of cracking ice.
sitting en banc,we recently held in a similar case that,contrary to the majority position,it is not our proper role to make judgments about the weight of specific studies on which an environmental agency relies.the lands council mcnair,cir.rather,we are to be most deferential when the agency is making predictions,within its area of special expertise,at the frontiers of science.id.
in lands council,we affirmed a forest service plan to regrow an forest area against a challenge that contended the forest service failed to confirm its statistical modeling with long term,observation.we recognized that,as,we need only ensure the forest service analyzes the issue based on studies that the agency,in its expertise,deems reliable.id.at.in other words,we do not assess the quality and detail of the studies on which the agency relies.id.at.rather,we conduct a particularly deferential review of an agency predictive judgments about the areas that are within the agency field of discretion and expertise as long as they are reasonable.id.our role is merely to ensure the agency has not relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or an explanation that is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.
none of these factors are present here.the documents mms utilized in its analysis were comprehensive.the eis contains a detailed analysis of icebreakers potential effects on bowheads,and finds the effect of icebreaker noise on bowheads is likely to be and not disruptive of migration patterns.the eis also contains a comprehensive analysis of all possible impacts from drilling and other oil and gas related activities on bowhead whales,reviewing studies on the biological significance of noise as it related to bowheads.the eis notes there has been no documented evidence that noise would serve as a barrier to migration.
the ea,which was tiered to the eis,analyzed the biological significance of exploratory drilling on whales,with the advantage of knowledge of shell specific plans.it provided detailed information regarding the specific types of drilling and vessels shell plans to use and how it intends to use them.all the studies to which they referred considered responses of bowhead whales to the noise from drillships along with noise from ice management vessels.the ea discussed icebreaker noise,the effect on bowheads of noise from drilling and ice management,and the national marine fisheries service conclusion that exploratory drilling and associated activities would not jeopardize bowhead whales,which it based in turn on an analysis of icebreaker and noise in addition to drilling noise.in fact,the ea conducted a noise analysis specific to the particular drilling vessels the kulluk and frontier discoverer and the particular the kapitan dranitzyn and vladimir ignatyuk shell plans to use.
the ea also requires shell to measure and mitigate sound levels in specific operating environments.specifically,the effects on bowhead whales will be carefully monitored through methods including aerial surveys if there is any indication bowheads are being displaced from important habitats,the agency retains the authority to require shell to modify its operations to prevent the threat of serious,irreparable harm to the whales.
if one substitutes the forest service sufficient statistical modeling simulation in lands council for mms purportedly insufficient simulation of noise effects here,and the unnecessary observation by the forest service in lands council for the purportedly necessary noise measurement here,one can not help but conclude the panel majority here is overruling lands council sub silentio.
the majority holds simulations of noise effects on bowhead whales are not enough the agency must actually go and measure the effect of noise in an uncontrolled setting.the eis and ea studies that do exist,according to the majority,are insufficient because they involve two drillships with one icebreaker ship,and the situation here involves two icebreaker ships nevermind the fact the agency analyzed the statistics for each of the two icebreaker ships shell plans to use.and the agency proposal to monitor the environmental effects of shell plan is not good enough according to the majority environmental expertise,the agency should have mandated alternative migration measures or prepared a full eis or revised ea.this is precisely the analysis lands council rejected.see at t o require an environmental agency to affirmatively present every uncertainty in an eis would be an onerous requirement,given that experts in every scientific field routinely disagree such a requirement might inadvertently prevent the agency from acting due to the burden it would impose.
mms gave a hard look,by any stretch of the term,to whether shell plans would disrupt the bowhead whale migratory habits.the expert agency to which congress delegated its authority concluded shell plan would not disrupt the bowhead whales to an extent necessary to require an additional costly eis or revised ea.the majority would replace the hard look standard with one that requires the agency to address every possible consideration or eventuality.this not what the statute demands n one of nepa statutory provisions or regulations requires an environmental agency to affirmatively present every uncertainty in its eis,id.at such a rule would render impossible congress express requirement in ocsla that the analysis be completed in days.thus,with respect,the majority analysis is incorrect on this ground.
the potential effects identified in the eis and ea are not highly controversial.
if a proposed exploration plan is highly controversial,a new,eis or revised ea may be required.the majority contends mms erred by failing to prepare a eis or revised ea due to t he contentious nature of the agency internal communication during the review process.this is based on a handful of complaints from a few agency scientists who opposed the agency final determination.
a plan is highly controversial,and thus in need of a new eis or revised ea,only if there is a substantial dispute about the size,nature,or effect of the proposed not the mere existence of opposition.native ecosystems council united states forest,cir emphasis added.internal disagreement alone is not enough to render an plan highly controversial,because w hen specialists express conflicting views,we defer to the informed discretion of the agency.envtl.prot.info.ctr.united states forest,cir.as this court has explained,s imply because a challenger can cherry pick information and data out of the administrative record to support its position does not mean that a project is highly controversial native ecosystems council,at.not only would such a standard deter candid disclosure of negative information,it does not follow that the presence of some negative effects necessarily rises to the level of demonstrating a significant effect on the environment.id.
thus,that qualified experts may disagree about the importance of certain data does not necessarily create a substantial enough controversy to undermine the eis or ea the agency prepared.otherwise,any information included in an ea and its supporting nepa documents that admits impacts on wildlife species and their habitat would trigger the preparation of an eis.id.thus,this court has decline d to interpret nepa as requiring the preparation of an eis any time that a federal agency discloses adverse impacts on wildlife species or their habitat or acknowledges information favorable to a party that would prefer a different outcome.id.
accordingly,the majority is incorrect that the agency action was so highly controversial that preparation of an eis was required.indeed,the fact that the agency considered such dissenting views underscores what a hard look the proposal was given.see id.at a hard look should,of course,involve the discussion of adverse impacts.a hard look does not dictate a soft touch or of negative effects.however,such information does not automatically make the project highly controversial for the purposes of determining whether a new eis or revised ea is necessary.id.
on the contrary,neither the majority nor the parties identify systemic failures in the agency analysis,or any potential effects it might avoid by the collection of more data.the agency did not err.
there is no need for an eis to analyze cumulatively significant impacts.
the majority asserts a supplemental eis or revised ea was necessary because there is the potential for cumulatively significant impacts.cumulatively significant impacts are environmental effects from multiple activities,each too small to create a disturbance,but that together create a measurable environmental effect.
here,the eis,along with the ea,show the agency gave substantial consideration to the cumulative impacts from the proposed activities.section v of the multisale eis contains an discussion of cumulative impacts.using a analysis,the eis identified the potential effects of the beaufort sea multiple sale on the natural resources and human environment that may occur in the beaufort sea,on the north slope,and along the route analyze d other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future activity on the north sea consider ed effects from other actions sport harvest,commercial fishing,subsistence hunting,and loss of overwintering range,attempt ed to quantify effects by estimating the extent of the effects and how long effects would last and weigh ed more heavily other activities that are more certain and geographically in the zone nearest to shore and analyz ed more intensively those effects that are of greatest concern.emphasis added.the ea updated the analysis and included information on the potential effects from claimed global warming.the cumulative effects analysis considered the projected effects of oil development and production under all of the leases covered by the multisale eis,past development and production,reasonably foreseeable development and production,and even speculative development and production prospects.
relying on its previous cumulative impact analyses,the ea reasonably determined the incremental contribution of the proposed activities to cumulative impacts is expected to be quite small,and thus not significant.the ea further observed that t he activities proposed in shell exploration plan represent a small portion of the projected activities originally analyzed for a beaufort sea lease sale.as one agency scientist stated in an,because there is no new information to be discovered in an additional eis,w e do not need to reanalyze all cumulative impacts.
accordingly,the ea and the documents to which it tiered articulated a careful and extensive cumulative effects analysis.the mms reasonably concluded potential additional cumulative effects were not significant enough to require a costly and new eis or revised ea,which would have made compliance with congress ocsla approval mandate impossible.
shell did not need to specify the location of each drilling well prior to approval of its exploration plan.
shell exploration plan included the locations of the four wells it planned to drill during the first of three years of drilling.the plan explained shell intended to drill wells on additional prospects during the final two years of the plan.the precise location and extent of drilling in the final two years,however,depended in part on the resources found during the first year of drilling the majority incorrectly concludes ocsla and its implementing regulations require shell exploration plan to include the specific locations of every well that will be drilled.
ocsla requires that an exploration plan include,in the degree of detail which the secretary may by regulation require,among other things,the general location of each well to be drilled.c c emphasis added.the agency regulations require an exploration plan that includes a map showing the surface location and water depth of each proposed well and the locations of all associated drilling unit anchors.here,shell knew of and proposed four wells to be drilled,and provided a map with the required information for those four wells.this is sufficient under the regulation.the majority demand shell provide exact locations of wells before approval of its exploration plan,when those exact locations depend on what happens with the earlier wells which must be explored pursuant to the exploration plan,is a.
under the exploration plan approved by mms,should shell seek to drill at sites other than the four specified in its original exploration plan,it will need to obtain a permit to drill before doing so.b.likewise,all supplemental exploration plans the regional supervisor determines are likely to result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated in the original exploration plan will be subject to the same procedures for approval as the original exploration plan.c.thus,shell will be required to supplement its exploration plan with information regarding those additional drilling sites 
the agency interpretation of its own regulations to permit an entity to determine the exact location of future wells based on what it discovers in the first year of exploitation is consistent with the statute and its regulations and is entitled to substantial deference.thomas jefferson shalala,d see also chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d we have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer.any drilling beyond the specific sites approved in shell exploration plan would have to undergo separate mms review pursuant to h,which requires the applicant for a permit to drill to submit a report of conditions as the proposed site.thus,the agency decision not to require this information now,but instead to require it later when the information is available,was not arbitrary and capricious.
conclusion 
in the statutorily required period mms had to approve or deny shell request for an exploration permit,the agency parsed nearly pages of scientific analysis.this voluminous hard look by any that,while the drilling project might have some small impact on the environment,that impact was not significant enough for mms to require a costly,duplicative eis or revised ea.this analysis was neither arbitrary nor capricious,and is entitled to deference.
i afraid the majority has substituted its expertise in environmental science for that of the expert agency to which congress entrusted primary analytic responsibility,and in the process has overruled an en banc decision and nullified congress express ocsla approval requirement.we sh
