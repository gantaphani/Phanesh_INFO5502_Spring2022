the alaska native claims settlement act of ancsa,et,extinguished all aboriginal title in alaska and,in partial compensation,provided for native villages to select specified acreages of land from the public domain.id.at.the selection process ran into difficulties in the most populous area of alaska,cook inlet.in,the department of the interior interior and cook inlet region,ciri,an alaska native regional corporation,entered into an agreement,known as the deficiency agreement,to govern the conveyance of lands from the federal government to ciri for reconveyance to alaska native village corporations within the region.the agreement described lands eligible for conveyance in two separate appendices to the agreement appendix a and appendix c.the primary issue in this case is whether,under the terms of the agreement and the statute implementing it,all of the lands listed in appendix a must be transferred before any of the lands in appendix c will be made available,even though the villages have selected some appendix c lands in preference to appendix a lands to fulfill their statutory entitlement.we conclude,as did interior and the district court,that the deficiency agreement requires the appendix a lands to be exhausted before any appendix c lands may be transferred to ciri for reconveyance to the villages.because the appendix a lands are sufficient to satisfy the villages acreage entitlements,the villages will be required to accept some tracts of appendix a lands in place of appendix c lands that they selected as being more desirable.
the deficiency agreement arose out of a compromise intended to resolve severe difficulties that had arisen with regard to village land selections in the cook inlet region.in order to provide a context for understanding the dispute over the meaning of the agreement,it is necessary to recite some of the developments leading up to its adoption.
a.the alaska native claims settlement act 
ancsa extinguished all aboriginal title and claims of aboriginal title to lands in alaska in exchange for the distribution of and over forty million acres of land to alaska natives.see b,a.the act provided for the establishment under state law of regional and village corporations in which alaska natives would be the shareholders.see.the village plaintiffs in this case,creek native association,knikatnu,ninilchik native association,seldovia native association,and tyonek native corporation,collectively the villages are all village corporations within the region of a regional corporation known as cook inlet region,ciri.
ancsa did not convey lands directly to village or regional corporations,but provided a method for accomplishing transfer.among other things,ancsa required interior to withdraw all available public lands in the township in which any native village was located,as well as all public lands in two concentric rings of townships around the village.see a.it was from this withdrawn land that it was contemplated that the villages could select the acreages to which ancsa entitled them.
b.the villages section a selections 
cook inlet region,where the plaintiff villages are located,lies along alaska coast and is one of the most heavily populated areas of the state.considerable segments of the land near the villages are either owned by third parties or are under water.as a consequence,the withdrawals mandated by ancsa immediately surrounding the villages were not sufficient to satisfy the villages entitlement.accordingly,interior made compensatory deficiency withdrawals from the nearest unreserved,vacant and unappropriated lands.see a.
section a of ancsa authorized each village to select its designated number of acres from withdrawn lands these are known as section a selections.ancsa required that each village section a selections must be contiguous and in reasonably compact tracts,and shall be wherever feasible,in units of not less than acres.a.
in addition to lands received by the villages pursuant to section a,section b of the statute required interior to allocate additional lands to each regional corporation on the basis of native population until the total acreage from sections a and b equaled million acres.see b.the regional corporations receiving section b lands were required to distribute those lands among its constituent village corporations on an equitable basis.see id.villages selection of lands to be received from a regional corporation pursuant to this mandate were known as section b selections.
as the district court noted,the process of land withdrawal and selection did not go smoothly in the cook inlet region.the act required the villages to make their a selections by december,but as the deadline approached,the eligibility of two villages in ciri region,salamatoff and alexander creek,was unresolved.due to this uncertainty,interior did not designate land withdrawals for each village specifically,but withdrew a single block of land for all five plaintiff villages along with salamatoff and alexander creek.this maneuver forced the villages to compete for the same land.to resolve this potential conflict,the villages decided to make and prioritize their selections of various tracts of land in a series of rounds,in a manner roughly similar to that of major league sports teams drafting players.each of the plaintiff villages thus ended the process with a list,in order of preference,of lands they elected to receive,often in scattered locations within the withdrawn lands 
because the villages divided up their entitlements by selecting lands in rounds,there was a concern that their section a selections would not satisfy the act requirements that these selections be compact and contiguous,and in minimum sizes of acres.prior to filing their selections,however,bureau of land management blm officials assured the villages that even if their individual selections did not meet these requirements of the act,they would be accepted as long as their selections as a whole formed a compact and contiguous block.relying on those assurances,the villages filed their section a selections with interior on december.the villages also filed blanket section b selections on all lands withdrawn for their benefit pending a determination of the specific land to be allocated to ciri under that section.
c.the terms and conditions agreement 
the selection process posed problems for the villages,the federal government,and the state of alaska.the villages complained that interior deficiency withdrawals involved much lower quality land than the original lands surrounding their villages that were deemed ineligible for withdrawal.the villages accordingly filed a lawsuit,cook inlet kleppe,challenging the validity of the deficiency withdrawals.the federal government was concerned because it desired some of the lands selected by the villages in their a selection draft for the creation of a national park around lake clark as a result,interior,the state of alaska,and ciri entered into a series of negotiations that resulted in an agreement entitled terms and conditions for land consolidation and management in the cook inlet area terms and conditions.
the terms and conditions were essentially a large land trade between alaska,the federal government and ciri.ciri acquired certain oil producing lands in the kenai peninsula,the state acquired certain lands,and interior received some of the lands it wanted in order to create lake clark national park.to accomplish the latter purpose,the villages who were not actually parties to the terms and conditions would have to give up their section a claims to lands surrounding lake clark in exchange for other selections.in addition,the federal government wanted to leave open the possibility of expanding the lake clark park into the chinitna peninsula,an area that includes many of the villages desired section a selections that are the subject of this appeal,they are appendix c lands in the deficiency agreement.interior therefore wanted to make sure that the only peninsular lands conveyed to the villages were lands chosen through their section a selections,not those designated pursuant to section b.paragraph of the terms and conditions therefore required ciri section b allocations to come from specified lands,which did not include chinitna peninsula.as for the villages a land selections located in chinitna,paragraph of the agreement allowed for the future possibility of a land swap between the villages and interior whereby interior would give the villages other lands in exchange for their a selections in chinitna.paragraph stated that such a trade could not occur without the consent of the affected villages.
the terms and conditions required congressional authorization,and congress ratified the agreement through,stat,note.the legislation,however,contained three preconditions that had to be met before the agreement could go into effect the state of alaska had to convey certain lands to the united states for possible reconveyance to ciri,the villages had to withdraw their appeal in cook inlet kleppe,and the villages had to relinquish their selections of certain lands around lake clark so that interior could obtain its lands for the park.the selections identified for relinquishment by the villages were near lake clark,and must be distinguished from the chinitna peninsula selections that were identified for a possible future trade in paragraph.the three conditions were fulfilled in and the terms and conditions then went into effect.
the terms and conditions bear on the present dispute because the villages contend that the deficiency agreement was intended to be consistent with the terms and conditions,and that the terms and conditions clearly recognized the villages section a selections in the chinitna peninsula and provided that the federal government might later acquire those tracts only by consent of the villages.the villages also argue that,if they had known that they were not to receive their a selections now being denied to them,they would not have fulfilled the statutory of the lawsuit and relinquishment of the lake clark permitted the terms and conditions to go into effect.
rejection of the villages a selections 
in may,blm completed its evaluation of the a selections submitted by the villages in and,in a series of decisions,rejected many of the villages selections.the main reason for most of the rejections was that the villages selections did not meet the compact and contiguous requirement or the minimum size requirement of ancsa.other selections were rejected because the land was either not authorized for selection or was reserved for selection by other villages.these decisions caused alarm and anger among the villages,who had been told previously by blm that their failure to meet the compact and contiguous requirements would not hinder approval of their selections.the rejections had potentially grave consequences for the villages because ancsa contained no provisions for allowing the resubmission of new selections after the statutory deadline.thus,the villages were faced with the prospect of losing a significant portion of their statutory land entitlements.they pursued an administrative appeal of the blm decision.
the rejection decisions also upset several officials at interior who had negotiated the terms and conditions.they feared that the villages,in light of the rejections of their selections,would no longer agree to meet the preconditions of the terms and conditions,and that as a result,interior would not be able to obtain the lands necessary for the creation of lake clark national park.
e.the deficiency agreement 
a flurry of communication followed blm rejections of the village selections,and blm ultimately secured a remand of its appealed rejections so that a negotiated solution could be reached.the ultimate result of the negotiations was the deficiency agreement between ciri and interior.although the villages were highly interested in the negotiations,they were not parties to the agreement.the agreement contemplated transfer of withdrawn lands from the federal government to ciri,for retransfer to the villages.the agreement,in most relevant part,provides 
a.the secretary shall,subject to valid existing rights,convey,as soon as reasonably possible,the surface and subsurface estate in all public lands described in appendix a to ciri.
ciri shall reconvey the surface estate of such lands to the village corporations within the region pursuant to an agreement between ciri and the affected village corporations,which agreement is attached as appendix b to this agreement and which agreement may be modified by the parties thereto.
to the extent the lands conveyed pursuant to paragraph a when added to lands otherwise heretofore received or to be received by such village corporations are insufficient to satisfy their statutory entitlement,the secretary shall,for the purpose stated in paragraph b,convey subject to valid existing rights to cook inlet region,such additional lands from appendix c as are necessary to fulfill such entitlement,except to the extent conveyances of such land are inconsistent with the requirements of the terms and conditions statute and this paragraph conveyances by the secretary under this paragraph c shall be made from the lands therein listed in appendix c and in the order therein listed until the requirements of this subsection are met.
l.if the provisions of the terms and conditions statute take effect,the following lands,which are also described in appendix c to this agreement,shall only be conveyed to ciri where there are section a selections on file with the bureau of land management,december,within such lands or where the provisions of the terms and conditions statute permit conveyance.
ii lands generally known as the chinitna peninsula 
deficiency agreement emphasis added.
the agreement between ciri and the villages referred to in paragraph b was entitled a conveyance agreement.it provided that,once ciri received land from the federal government,it would distribute that land to the villages in the order in which they had made their section a selections.in other words,the villages previous selection by rounds would govern the manner in which they would receive their land from ciri.interior was not a party to this conveyance agreement.
in order to permit the deficiency agreement to be carried out,congress enacted,stat,note.among other things,it stated 
a the secretary is authorized to convey lands under application for selection by village corporations within cook inlet region to the cook inlet region,incorporated,for reconveyance by the region to such village corporations.such lands shall be conveyed as partial satisfaction of the statutory entitlement of such village corporations of lands withdrawn pursuant to ancsa for the purposes of counting acres received in computing statutory entitlement,the secretary shall count the number of acres or acre selections surrendered by village corporations in any exchange for any other lands or selections.
f.the present dispute 
in accordance with their a conveyance agreement with ciri,the villages believed that under the deficiency agreement,they would receive their lands in the same order and priority as they had made in their round of a selections.although many of the villages a selections involved lands listed in appendix a of the deficiency agreement,others of their a selections involved lands listed in appendix c of the agreement.
in,after ciri had conveyed the villages higher priority a selections contained in appendix a,it requested that interior convey the land next on the list of the villages a selection priorities,so that it could reconvey it to the villages.these lands,comprising approximately acres of the chinitna peninsula,are listed in appendix c of the deficiency agreement and are the subject of the current dispute.
initially,at least some responsible interior officials believed that interior could convey the land according to paragraphs b and l of the deficiency agreement,because those lands were next on the list of the villages a selection priorities.interior conducted further review over the course of several years,and finally,in,it formally notified ciri that it was not entitled to receive the lands in question because they were contained in appendix c and there was land remaining in the appendix a group.ciri protested,and interior position was upheld by an opinion of the solicitor in that was adopted by the assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.because there is no dispute today that the lands described in appendix a are sufficient in quantity to provide all the acreage to which the villages are entitled under section a and section b,interior interpretation of the deficiency agreement means that the villages will receive none of their selections of appendix c those in the chinitna peninsula.
the dispute was brought to the attention of congress,which authorized ciri and the villages to bring an action in the district court for the district of alaska to contest interior ruling that ciri and the villages would receive no lands listed in appendix c of the deficiency agreement.omnibus parks and public lands management act of,stat,as amended by,stat.the act provided that,if litigation is commenced,at the court trial,any party may introduce any relevant evidence bearing on the interpretation of the agreement.id.
ciri and the villages both sued,and the district court consolidated the cases.the district court denied the parties for summary judgment,stating that clauses of the agreement appeared to conflict regarding whether land from appendix c could be conveyed before exhaustion of the appendix a lands.the court accordingly ordered trial to proceed for the purpose of examining extrinsic evidence in order to ascertain the intended meaning of the agreement.following an bench trial in which many of the participants in the drafting of the deficiency agreement testified,the district court ruled that the language of the agreement was unambiguous and that,according to its plain meaning,interior could convey lands from appendix c only if the lands from appendix a proved insufficient to meet the villages statutory entitlements.because the lands from appendix a were sufficient to meet those entitlements,the district court rejected the villages claims and ruled in favor of the government.the villages and ciri now appeal.
standard of review 
federal law governs the interpretation of contracts entered pursuant to federal law where the federal government is a party.see united states,cir.the determination whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law that we review de novo,see,but we review only for clear error the district court underlying findings of fact.see dp aviation smiths indus.aerospace def,cir.
interior argues that,because it is the agency responsible for administering ancsa,we should defer to its interpretation of contracts made under ancsa if the interpretation is reasonable.it is true that we have held that interior interpretations of ancsa are entitled to deference that carries more weight than the canon of construction that ambiguous statutes are to be interpreted in favor of native americans.see,williams babbitt,cir seldovia native ass n,lujan,cir applying chevron deference to interior interpretation of ancsa.here,however,interior is not interpreting ancsa but a separate agreement entered into by ciri and interior.although ancsa may have provided the context for the agreement,the deficiency agreement neither calls for interior to interpret ancsa in any way nor to use its expertise in its understanding of that statute.in addition,as an interested party to the deficiency agreement that stands to gain or lose depending on the outcome of this litigation,the agency should not be accorded any deference.see transohio sav.bank director,office of thrift supervision.thus,we need not defer to interior interpretation of the deficiency agreement.
b.the deficiency agreement 
the plain language 
the primary issue in this case is whether the deficiency agreement requires that land conveyances from the federal government to ciri must come from appendix a before any can come from appendix c or,alternatively,whether it requires that conveyances to ciri must be made in the order of the villages a selection priorities regardless of whether those lands are contained in appendix a or appendix c.the villages do not appear to argue that their interpretation of the deficiency agreement is the only reasonable interpretation,but instead argue that the contract is ambiguous.they then argue that we should follow the canon of construction that ambiguous terms in statutes and treaties concerning native americans,including native alaskans,should be construed in their favor.see united states gila valley irrigation,cir explaining the canon but see united states atlantic richfield,cir rule of favorable construction may operate with less force in modern day when natives are represented by illustrious counsel.
we conclude that the unambiguous language of the deficiency agreement precludes the conveyance of appendix c lands if the lands conveyed in appendix a are sufficient in quantity to satisfy the acreage entitlements of the villages.we are unable to construe in any other manner the provision that lands in appendix c can be conveyed to the extent the lands conveyed pursuant to paragraph a when added to lands otherwise heretofore received by such village corporations are insufficient to satisfy their statutory entitlement we also agree with the district court that the evidence presented by the parties does not indicate a mutual intent contrary to the plain meaning of the deficiency agreement 
statutory entitlement 
the villages argue that paragraph c language indicating that appendix c lands would be conveyed only if appendix a lands were insufficient to satisfy their statutory entitlement is ambiguous because the term statutory entitlement could refer either to the villages entitlement under ancsa to a specified quantity of acreage or to the villages entitlement to receive their a selections in the order that they made them.here,again,we find no ambiguity the agreement clearly uses statutory entitlement as in above.section d of the agreement provides 
for the purposes of counting acres received in computing statutory entitlement under paragraphs b and c the secretary shall count the number of acres surrendered by village corporations in any exchange for any other lands or selection rights,not the number of acres received in such exchange.
deficiency agreement,d.this passage makes sense only if statutory entitlement refers to the total number of acres allowed a particular village.virtually the same language was repeated in the implementing act passed by congress four days after the deficiency agreement was concluded,a.moreover,ancsa itself refers to acreage or number of acres to which a village is entitled.see,a and c,a.interior regulations do the same.see,b,a.
there is another difficulty with the villages interpretation of statutory entitlement to mean the villages section a selections rather than a maximum acreage.because of uncertainties regarding the availability of some of the withdrawn land,the villages were permitted to overselect.if their selections as made are their entitlement,then their entitlement exceeds the total allowable acreage under ancsa.in addition,the villages are allowed to change their order of priorities,which means that the selections involve considerable uncertainty prior to actual conveyance.see seldovia native ass n,united states.for both literal and practical reasons,therefore,we reject the villages contention concerning the meaning of statutory entitlement.
paragraph b 
the villages most forceful argument concerns the apparent inconsistency between paragraphs b and c of the deficiency agreement.paragraph b requires ciri to convey land to the villages pursuant to the attached a conveyance agreement between ciri and the villages.that agreement specifies that land will be conveyed in the order that the section a selections were made by the villages.yet that goal can not be accomplished paragraph c requires the villages to forego their appendix c selections because there is land remaining in appendix a which they can select.
although this contention has its appeal,the inconsistency between paragraphs b and c is more apparent than real.first,at the time that the deficiency agreement was entered,it was entirel
