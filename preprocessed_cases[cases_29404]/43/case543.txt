this case involves a class action suit by beneficiaries of individual indian money iim trust accounts against interior secretary gale norton and other federal officials who serve,in their official capacities,as on behalf of the federal government.iim trust beneficiaries filed suit alleging breach of fiduciary duties.specifically,plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment delineating appellants trust obligations to iim trust beneficiaries and injunctive relief to ensure that such trust obligations are carried out.after a lengthy trial,the district court concluded that the federal government and its officers have been derelict in their duties,and issued a remand to the interior and treasury departments so that appellants could discharge their fiduciary obligations.the district court further retained jurisdiction and ordered appellants to file quarterly reports detailing steps taken in fulfillment of their duties.although the decision did not resolve every issue raised by plaintiffs,the district court certified the order for interlocutory appeal.
appellants challenge the district court delineation of their trust obligations and assert that the district court exceeded its authority in ordering equitable relief for plaintiffs.we find that the district court had before it ample evidence to support its finding of ongoing material breaches of appellants fiduciary obligations.notwithstanding the fact that appellants have taken significant steps towards the discharge of the federal government fiduciary obligations,appellants clearly have yet to fulfill their trust duties.the relief ordered was well within the district court equitable powers.while we order the district court to modify the characterization of some of its findings,we generally affirm its judgment and order.
background 
the federal government has substantial trust responsibilities toward native americans.this is undeniable.such duties are grounded in the very nature of the relationship.a fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the government assumes elaborate control over forests and property belonging to indians.united states mitchell mitchell ii,d.it is equally clear that the federal government has failed time and again to discharge its fiduciary duties.here,there is no dispute that appellants,as of the federal government,have failed to discharge fully their fiduciary obligations.the issue we confront is whether the district court properly delineated the contours of the obligations owed by the interior secretary,treasury secretary and other officials,and whether such officials have been so derelict in their obligations to justify the relief ordered by the district court.
a.the trust relationship 
the federal trust relationship dates back over a century.the trusts at issue here were created over one hundred years ago through an act of congress,and have been mismanaged nearly as long.to appreciate truly the nature and extent of the government responsibilities,and appellants failure to discharge them,it is necessary to review the history of the trust relationship.
since the founding of this nation,the united states relationship with the indian tribes has been contentious and tragic.america expansionist impulse in its formative years led to the removal and relocation of many tribes,often by treaty but also by force.see,cherokee nation georgia,pet.official policy sought to encourage westward migration of indian tribes by offering to exchange unsettled lands in the west for indian land in the east.see,the indian removal act of,ch.cxlviii,stat.unofficial policy encouraged the forcible dislocation of indian tribes.
in the second half of the nineteenth century,the policy of relocation was replaced with one of assimilation.at that time the federal government began to divide indian lands into individual parcels,taking lands that had been set aside for indian tribes and allotting them to individual tribe members.see felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law ed.the objectives of allotment were simple and clear cut to extinguish tribal sovereignty,erase reservation boundaries,and force assimilation of indians into the society at large.yakima yakima indian nation,d see also muscogee creek nation hodel,allotment was justified as a means of accomplishing the then current policy of assimilation.once tribal lands were allotted in fee to individual indians,white settlers could purchase the lands for settlement.allottees,by divorcing themselves from the tribal estate,also became subject to federal and state jurisdiction on the same terms as other citizens.
this assimilationist policy began with individually negotiated treaties and was eventually enacted into federal law with passage of the general allotment act of,also known as the dawes act,ch,stat.as amended at et.under the general allotment act,beneficial title of the allotted lands vested in the united states as trustee for individual indians.the trust was to last for years or more,at which point a fee patent would issue to the individual indian allottee.during the trust period,individual accounts were to be set up for each indian with a stake in the allotted lands,and the lands would be managed for the benefit of the individual allottees.indians could not sell,lease,or otherwise burden their allotted lands without government approval.where tribes resisted allotment,it could be imposed.see act of june,ch,stat.curtis act.while the dawes act may not have achieved assimilation,it did result in the widespread transfer of land from indians to white settlers.as the district court found,from to,an estimated million acres,accounting for approximately of all indian lands,left indian ownership.cobell babbitt,d,cobell v.
allotment of tribal lands ceased with enactment of the indian reorganization act of ira,stat.codified as amended at et.lands already allotted remained so,but the ira provided that unallotted surplus indian lands would be returned to tribal ownership.rather than undo the assimilationist allotment polices,the act extended the trust period for allotted lands indefinitely.id.the federal government retained control of lands already allotted but not yet,and thereby retained its fiduciary obligations to administer the trust lands and funds arising therefrom for the benefit of individual indian beneficiaries.these lands form the basis for the individual indian money iim accounts that are at the heart of this case.
after passage of the ira,federal indian policy changed yet again.in the,congress adopted a termination policy,whereby it sought to release indian tribes from federal supervision and terminate the relationship.as assistant interior secretary gover testified at trial,the policy was specifically aimed at severing the trust relationship.cobell v,d at.in some cases,the withdrew recognition of indian tribes altogether.id.at.
the termination policy was no more successful than earlier assimilation efforts,and was soon replaced with the current policy of and.id.at.in congress enacted the indian and education assistance act,stat,which,among other things,authorizes tribes to assume some of the management functions currently imposed on the bureau of indian affairs bia and office of trust fund management.in particular,a tribe may contract with bia to manage trust accounts,including iim accounts,for the tribe or its members.such contracts must be approved unless bia determines that the tribe lacks the accounting or management capabilities to fulfill the contract.see cobell v,d at.where such capacity is lacking,bia is to assist tribes in developing the necessary capabilities to manage iim accounts themselves.see id.in sum,because of bia own fiduciary obligations to iim trust beneficiaries,it must ensure that a tribe can fulfill the fiduciary obligations attendant to trust management before transferring control.
federal iim trust responsibilities 
because the united states holds iim lands in trust for individual indian beneficiaries,it assumes the fiduciary obligations of a trustee.w here the federal government takes on or has control or supervision over tribal monies or properties,the fiduciary relationship normally exists with respect to such monies or properties unless congress has provided otherwise even though nothing is said expressly in the authorizing or underlying statute or other fundamental document about a trust fund,or a trust or fiduciary connection.united states mitchell mitchell ii,d quoting navajo tribe of indians united states.as a result of allotment,individual indians became beneficiaries of the trust lands,but lost the right to sell,lease,or burden the property without the federal government approval.the federal government also probates estates related to indian trust lands and receives and distributes income from the lease of allotted lands.income generated from the trust lands is to be paid to the individual beneficiaries.
under current law,the secretary of the interior and the secretary of the treasury are the designated for the iim trust.each secretary,or his designates,has specific fiduciary responsibilities that must be fulfilled lest the united states breach its fiduciary obligations.several governmental agencies have specific trust obligations.these include,among others,bia,office of trust funds management otfm,and office of the special trustee ost.their responsibilities are extensively detailed in the decision below.see cobell v,d at.
bia is responsible for trust land management,including the approval of leases and land transfers,and income collection.see id.at.as noted above,bia is also required to contract with qualifying tribes for the management of iim accounts.otfm,with the assistance of the treasury department,deposits iim land revenues,maintains the individual iim accounts,and ensures that money is distributed to iim account holders or special deposit accounts where money can not be distributed to the individual account holder.ost,created in by the indian trust fund management reform act,oversees iim trust reform efforts.
while the interior department is responsible for executing most of the federal government trust duties,the treasury department has substantial trust responsibilities as well.in particular,treasury holds and invests iim funds at the interior department direction and provides accounting and financial management services.see cobell v,d at.the treasury department maintains only a single iim account for all iim funds,rather than individuated accounts for each individual iim beneficiary,leaving the maintenance of individualized accounting records to otfm.otfm relies upon the treasury department accounting records to reconcile its own iim records.of note,when otfm issues a check to an iim trust beneficiary,the amount is deducted from the relevant fund,even though the money remains in the treasury general account.thus,the iim beneficiary loses any interest that would be accrued between issuance and cashing of the check.the district court found that while this time lapse may be short in the private sector,it can be much longer in the iim trust context because otfm often has incorrect addresses for the recipients.id.at.
the federal government does not know the precise number of iim trust accounts that it is to administer and protect.at present,the interior department system contains over accounts covering an estimated million acres,but the department is unsure whether this is the proper number of accounts.see id.at plaintiffs claim that the actual number of accounts is far higher,exceeding trust accounts.see id.
not only does the interior department not know the proper number of accounts,it does not know the proper balances for each iim account,nor does interior have sufficient records to determine the value of iim accounts.as the district court found,a lthough the united states freely gives out balances to plaintiffs,it admits that currently these balances can not be supported by adequate transactional documentation.id.current account reconciliation procedures are insufficient to ensure that existing account records,reported account balances,or payments to iim beneficiaries are accurate.as the interior secretary testified at trial,the department is presently unable to render an accounting for a majority of the iim trust beneficiaries.trial transcript at.as a result,the government regularly issues payments to trust beneficiaries in erroneous unreconciled of which are known to have incorrect balances.cobell v,d at.thus,the district court concluded,and the government does not deny,that i t is entirely possible that tens of thousands of iim trust beneficiaries should be receiving different amounts of own they do today.perhaps not.but no one can say id.
c.the indian trust fund management reform act act 
concern over federal mismanagement of the iim trust funds is not new.the general accounting office,interior department inspector general,and office of management and budget,among others,have all condemned the mismanagement of the iim trust accounts over the past twenty years.see,general accounting office,financial management bia management of the indian trust funds,general accounting office,financial management status of bia efforts to reconcile indian trust fund accounts and implement management improvements,misplaced trust the bureau of indian affairs mismanagement of the indian trust fund,at citing critiques of iim trust management by interior department ig,omb,and others.time and again interior department officials pledged to address these concerns.yet,as interior officials readily acknowledge,there has been little progress at reforming the management of iim trust accounts.see cobell v,d at citing interior department factual stipulations trial transcript at testimony of interior secretary bruce babbitt acknowledging that t he fiduciary obligation of the united states government is not being fulfilled.
beginning in,congress held oversight hearings on interior management of the indian trust accounts.these hearings led to a report,misplaced trust the bureau of indian affairs mismanagement of the indian trust fund.hereinafter misplaced trust,which harshly criticized the interior department mishandling of the trust accounts.consistent with prior analyses,the report found,significant,habitual problems in bia ability to fully and accurately account for trust fund moneys,to properly discharge its fiduciary responsibilities,and to prudently manage the trust funds.id.at.interior persistent failure to meet its obligations led the congressional investigators to conclude that top officials have utterly failed to grasp the human impact of its financial management of the indian trust fund.id.at.to address these concerns,interior commissioned an independent study which determined that reconciling the iim trust accounts could cost over million.see cobell v,d at.yet e ven that expenditure would have yielded only a reconciliation of approximately percent reliability.id.once again the interior department pledged reforms once again there was little improvement.
in,congress enacted the indian trust fund management reform act act.this law recognized the federal government preexisting trust responsibilities it further identified some of the interior secretary duties to ensure proper discharge of the trust responsibilities of the united states.d.these include but are not limited to the following 
providing adequate systems for accounting for and reporting trust fund balances 
providing adequate controls over receipts and disbursements 
providing periodic,timely reconciliations to assure the accuracy of accounts 
preparing and supplying periodic statements of account performance and balances to account holders and 
establishing consistent,written policies and procedures for trust fund management and accounting.
there is no dispute that the federal government owes iim duties.the district court so found and the interior department conceded as much at trial.see,cobell v,d at.while arguing that plaintiffs claims should be evaluated on the basis of what is contained in the act alone,the interior department did not dispute that these duties must be interpreted in light of the common law of trusts and the united states indian policy.id.at.most significantly,the interior department stipulated that many of the duties owed under the act were not being fulfilled.see id.listing interior department stipulations.in other words,the federal government readily acknowledges that it is in breach of at least some of the fiduciary duties owed to iim beneficiaries.
the office of the special trustee the high level implementation plan 
the act created the office of the special trustee for american indians ost to provide for more effective management of,and accountability for the proper discharge of,the secretary trust responsibilities and ensure proper reform measures are implemented.b.the special trustee st is a level officer appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate who reports directly to the interior secretary.id.b.the st is required to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for trust management reform and an appropriate reform timetable to ensure proper and efficient discharge of the secretary trust responsibilities.id.a.the st is also to oversee a fair and accurate accounting of the trust accounts and submit annual reports to congress.id.b a and f.despite these responsibilities,the st only has general oversight responsibilities authority for iim trust management remains with the secretary of the interior.id.b.
the first st under the act was paul homan.in april,homan submitted a strategic plan to the secretary and congress pursuant to the act.among other things,the plan called for the reorganization of indian trust fund management and the centralization of,changes that may have required legislative authorization.the interior secretary opted to implement portions of the strategic plan,including the upgrade of computer systems,the of trust records,and the elimination of processing backlogs.the secretary plan,known as the high level implementation plan hlip,was issued in july.as drafted,the hlip consisted of twelve subprojects which focus on ensuring the accuracy of information regarding the iim trust accounts and developing uniform policies and procedures to guide trust management in the future.these subprojects included data cleanup,clearing probate backlogs,improving records management,and establishing internal controls to prevent future mismanagement.
the hlip is designed to overcome numerous gaps and deficiencies in the interior department and trust management.those identified by the district court as central to this case are the following 
data records upon which the government must rely to fulfill its trust duties are woefully deficient.in particular,the interior department does not have complete or accurate information on the identities or whereabouts of all trust beneficiaries,nor does the department have complete land title records.for instance,as of,there were over iim trust accounts without current addresses for the beneficiary and over accounts without a social security or tax identification number.to address these concerns,the hlip calls for the inventorying of existing documents from iim trust offices around the country and the reconciliation of conflicting records.however,the trial court found no written plan to obtain missing information necessary for compiling complete land title records.cobell v,d at.
probate bureau of indian affairs has a probate backlog of approximately cases,some or all of which could affect the payments owed to individual trust beneficiaries.there is currently no formal plan to address this backlog.there is,however,a reinvention team that is to address probate concerns and fractionated interests in land.id.
appraisal trial court found evidence of an estimated title defects.these defects can impact the processing of leases which can,in turn,impact the government ability to render an accounting for the trust beneficiaries.under the hlip,the interior department plans to reduce the backlog,at least in part,by when appraisals are required as a matter of interior policy.id.at.
computer interior department does not have computer systems in place capable of tracking trust resources and relevant data.the current system,known as the legacy system,is not capable of performing this function.the hlip calls for the acquisition and implementation of two new computer systems to replace the legacy system the trust fund accounting system tfas and the trust asset and accounting management system taams.id.
records interior department acknowledges that adequate is essential if the department is to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to the iim trust beneficiaries.yet,as interior stipulated at trial,the current system is woefully inadequate.to address this concern,the hlip establishes a records management group to develop a plan for transferring financial records from bia to ost and maintaining trust records into the future.id.at.
despite ost substantial responsibilities,congress did not provide for funding of ost in the act,nor has the interior department sought funding for ost in its departmental budget requests sufficient to meet the st estimated costs.in january,the interior secretary announced his unilateral reorganization of ost,prompting homan resignation 
there are also trust management problems at the treasury department.in response to plaintiff charges,the treasury department stipulated to the following problems and remedies 
illegal document treasury department regularly allows the destruction of documents over six years and seven months old in conformity with the national archives and records administration document destruction schedule.at present,no effort is made to ensure that iim trust records or other documents that could be needed to conduct an adequate accounting are preserved.as a result,iim trust records necessary for an accounting of the trust accounts have been irretrievably lost.the treasury department has agreed to develop a record retention schedule for trust documents for the purposes of this litigation and into the future.id.at.
time lapse in fund can be a time lapse between the deposit of funds with the treasury department and the investment of those funds by the interior department on behalf of iim trust beneficiaries.the treasury department has agreed to facilitate investment when funds are initially deposited.id.at.
lost interest on iim to plaintiffs,some iim beneficiaries lose interest during the delay between the time a check is issued and when that check can be presented for payment.treasury has agreed to conduct a study of the alleged time lapse and resulting lost interest.id.at.
the treasury department further stipulated to the development of new systems and procedures that could potentially fulfill the department fiduciary obligations.id.at.
district court proceedings 
on june,appellees filed this suit to compel performance of trust obligations.they alleged that the federal government,including the secretaries of the interior and treasury,breached the fiduciary duties owed to plaintiffs by mismanaging the iim trust accounts.on february,the district court certified the named plaintiffs under federal rule of civil procedure b a and b as class representatives for all present and former iim account beneficiaries.cobell babbitt cobell i,d.on may,the district court bifurcated the case for trial.phase i would address fixing the system or reforming the management and accounting of the iim trusts so as to meet the federal government fiduciary responsibilities.phase ii will address historical accounting of the accounts.
on november,the district court rejected the government motion to dismiss and for summary judgment.the court found that the government waived sovereign immunity pursuant to section of the administrative procedure act.id.at.the court also dismissed some of plaintiffs claims for money damages and held that the government fiduciary duties to iim trust beneficiaries were not ministerial in nature and therefore could not be compelled by mandamus.id.at.
later in,the court held interior secretary bruce babbitt,treasury secretary robert rubin,and assistant interior secretary kevin gover in contempt of court for failing to comply with the court production orders and imposed monetary sanctions.see cobell babbitt cobell ii,d holding defendants in contempt of court for failing to make good faith effort to comply with discovery order cobell babbitt cobell iv,awarding sanctions.as trustee delegates these officials had a clear obligation to maintain trust records and furnish such records to beneficiaries upon request,yet they were unable to provide such records and related documents to the court in response to an order of production.see cobell ii,d at.the district court found that these officials had failed to make a good faith effort to produce such information.indeed,the district court found that the defendants proposed a stipulated order to the court and then immediately improperly instructed their field personnel on what documents were required to be produced.id.at.the egregious nature of this conduct was only compounded by the treasury department contemporaneous destruction of documents potentially responsive to the court production order,and the failure of government officials to apprise the court or the plaintiffs of the defendants unwillingness and inability to comply with the production orders.id.at.
on june,the district court denied the government motion for summary judgment on some of the plaintiffs claims.in addition,the court found that the federal government waived its sovereign immunity against a suit for injunctive and declaratory relief for the breach of trust duties.see cobell babbitt cobell iii,d.
the court held a trial on the indians claims,and issued its opinion on december.after satisfying itself that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims,the district court found that the federal government had breached some of the fiduciary duties owed to plaintiffs.among the district court specific conclusions were 
under the act defendants must provide iim trust beneficiaries with an accurate accounting of all money in the iim trust held in trust for the benefit of plaintiffs,without regard to when the funds were deposited,cobell v,d at 
under the act defendants must retrieve and retain all information concerning the iim trust that is necessary to render an accurate accounting for the trust beneficiaries,
the interior secretary and assistant secretary must establish written policies and procedures for a collecting from outside sources missing information necessary to render an accurate accounting of the iim trust b the retention of trust documents necessary for an accurate accounting c computer and business systems architecture necessary for an accurate accounting and d the staffing of trust management functions necessary for an accurate accounting,
the treasury secretary owes iim trust beneficiaries the statutory trust duty to retain iim trust documents necessary for an accurate accounting,id.
the court further found that the defendants were in violation of the fiduciary duties,ordered them to come into compliance with their duties and remanded the required actions to the defendants for further proceedings not inconsistent with the court opinion.id.the court rejected plaintiffs plea for the appointment of a special master to oversee the government compliance with its fiduciary duties.id.at.
the court did not rule for the plaintiffs on all counts,however.the court dismissed their pure claims as well as those claims alleging obstruction of the special trustee.id.at.the court retained continuing jurisdiction over the case for the next five years,during which time the defendants are required to submit quarterly status reports summarizing the government progress in meeting its fiduciary duties to the iim trust beneficiaries.id.at.
the court certified its order for interlocutory appeal under b t o the extent that the court order is not otherwise appealable.cobell v,d at.the defendants appealed,alleging that the district court improperly construed the nature and extent of the government fiduciary duties to iim trust beneficiaries.specifically,appellants take issue with the district court finding of specific trust obligations,including a judicially enforceable duty to account,and the district court conclusion that trust reforms have been unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.further,appellants allege that the district court lacked sufficient basis to award equitable relief and that the relief awarded was unwarranted.
ii.jurisdiction 
subject matter jurisdiction 
although appellants have not renewed their jurisdictional challenge to plaintiffs claims,we must assure ourselves that we have jurisdiction.plaintiffs claims allege breach of trust obligations grounded in federal law and plaintiffs seek enforcement of their federal rights.plaintiffs claims thus arise under the laws of the united states,granting federal court jurisdiction under.see,robbins reagan,association of national advertisers,ftc.
sovereign immunity 
the federal government claimed sovereign immunity below,but did not renew this claim on appeal.as the court below noted,section of the administrative procedure act waives federal officials sovereign immunity for actions seeking relief other than money damages involving a federal official action or failure to act.insofar as the plaintiffs seek specific injunctive and declaratory,in particular,seek the accounting to which they are government has waived its sovereign immunity under this provision.see bowen massachusetts,d.that plaintiffs rely upon common law trust principles in pursuit of their claim is immaterial,as here they seek specific relief other than money damages,and federal courts have jurisdiction to hear such claims under the apa.
final agency action 
whether there is a final agency action is also a jurisdictional question.with a few exceptions,if there is no final agency action,there is no basis for review of the government decision or policy.one exception occurs where plaintiffs claim that a governmental action was unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.
when the district court rejected the government motion to dismiss in november,it held that the hlip itself constitutes final agency action.cobell i,d at.this conclusion was based on a concession made by government counsel at oral argument on the motion.id.at trial,however,appellants argued that there was no final agency action for the court to review.cobell v,d at.appellants new position was that the hlip was not a final agency action because it was and continues to be a work in progress.id.at.the court rejected this argument holding that the preexisting accounting system used to administer the iim trust constituted a final agency action capable of review.see also cobell i,d at.it is the existing system,and not any proposed reform or replacement that aggrieves plaintiffs today.cobell v,d at.
although the government does not press the issue,this conclusion by the district court is questionable.while a single step or measure is reviewable,an program or policy is not,in itself,a final agency action under the apa.see lujan national wildlife federation,d.a plaintiff can not seek wholesale improvement of a program by court decree,rather than in the offices of the department or the halls of congress,where programmatic improvements are normally made.id.at.
this is not to say that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claims,however.where a federal court has jurisdiction to hear challenges to an agency action it also has jurisdiction over claims of unreasonable delay.see telecommunications research and action center fcc.as this court has noted in the past,where an agency is under an unequivocal statutory duty to act,failure so to act constitutes,in effect,an affirmative act that triggers final agency action review.sierra club thomas,see also public citizen health research group commissioner.were it otherwise,agencies could effectively prevent judicial review of their policy determinations by simply refusing to take final action.
in the case at bar,it is clear that the federal government has been under an obligation to discharge the fiduciary duties owed to iim trust beneficiaries for decades.it is also clear that refusing to hear plaintiffs claims could unduly prejudice their rights as trust beneficiaries.the district court findings of fact,largely unchallenged by the government,make clear that insofar as the federal government owes trust beneficiaries a duty to maintain records and provide an accounting,delaying review is tantamount to denying review altogether.the district court further concluded that appellants extensive delay in discharging their fiduciary duties was unreasonable.in such circumstances,federal courts may exercise jurisdiction to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably denied.
even assuming,as appellants argue,that the act effectively reset the clock for a finding of unreasonable delay,appellants reasonable time to discharge its fiduciary obligations has expired.cobell v,at.the district court judgment came down over six years after passage of the act.during that time,deadlines were missed,documents destroyed,and,in the words of the district court,appellants had yet to progress much beyond planting the seed for discharging their fiduciary obligations.see id.at.courts owe substantial deference to agency prerogatives in fulfilling their legal obligations,especially where congress intervenes to address longstanding problems,as it did with the act.but this does not require courts to turn a blind eye when government officials fail to discharge their duties.
as a general rule,section of the apa leaves in the courts the discretion to decide whether agency delay is unreasonable.forest guardians babbitt,cir.the legal standard used to determine whether agency delay is unreasonable is a question of law to be reviewed de novo by this court.however,the factual findings that underlie that determination are only to be overturned if the district court findings are clearly erroneous.
for good reason,courts are reluctant to upset existing agency priorities,unless the delay is egregious.see telecommunications research and action center,at.an agency own timetable for performing its duties in the absence of a statutory deadline is due considerable deference.sierra club gorsuch.moreover,a finding that delay is unreasonable does not,alone,justify judicial intervention.in re barr,
in reviewing an unreasonable delay claim,this court considers four factors 
first,the court should ascertain the length of time that has elapsed since the agency came under a duty to act second,the reasonableness of the delay must be judged in the context of the statute which authorizes the agency action.third,the court must examine the consequences of the agency delay finally,the court should give due consideration in the balance to any plea of administrative error,administrative convenience,practical difficulty in carrying out a legislative mandate,or need to prioritize in the face of limited resources.
in re international chemical workers union,citations omitted.
considering the first two factors,it is beyond question that the government has delayed fulfilling its trust obligations for many years.the district court specifically found that iim trust beneficiaries have been denied their particular their right to an decades.see cobell v,d at noting that iim beneficiaries have waited a century for an accurate accounting which is the most basic fiduciary duty.that congress enacted its own remedial statute to address this unconscionable delay does not mitigate the egregious amount of time plaintiffs have waited for,as discussed below,the act is not the source of plaintiffs rights.rather,it is designed to help rectify the government longstanding failure.given the record before it,the district court reasonably concluded that absent court intervention,discharge of the government fiduciary obligations may yet be far off.
appellants note that the statute provides no deadlines for the reforms at issue.failure to provide a statutory timetable may indicate that congress sought to leave the timing of reform to agency discretion.but the lack of a timetable does not give government officials carte blanche to ignore their legal obligations.this is particularly true where,as here,the act of outlining specific steps toward reform was enacted against a background of agency delay dating back many years.
the district court noted that the consequences of further agency delay are potentially quite severe.documents necessary for a proper accounting and reconciliation have been lost or destroyed,and the district court found little reason to believe that this would change in the near future.the longer defendants delay in creating the plans necessary to render an accounting,the greater the chance that plaintiffs will never receive an actual accounting of their own trust money.cobell v,d at.given that many plaintiffs rely upon their iim trust accounts for their financial,the injury from delay could cause irreparable harm to plaintiffs interests as iim trust beneficiaries.thus it seems that the interests at stake are not merely economic interests in an administrative scheme,but personal interests in life and health.public citizen health research group auchter,citation omitted.
concern for administrative convenience certainly counsels against interfering with the government reform priorities.see grand canyon air tour coalition faa,although the apa gives courts the authority to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,we are acutely aware of the limits of our institutional competence in the highly technical area at issue in this case.citations omitted.yet neither a lack of sufficient funds nor administrative complexity,in and of themselves,justify extensive delay,nor can the government claim that it has become subject to unreasonable expectations.federal officials were aware of their fiduciary obligations long before the passage of the alone the initiation of this yet little progress has been made in discharging those duties.what little progress the government has made appears more due to the litigation than diligence in discharging its fiduciary obligations.see misplaced trust,at noting that the only thing that seems to stimulate a flurry of activity at the bureau of indian affairs is an impending appearance before a congressional committee.see also cobell v,d at noting that the positive steps taken by defendants toward bringing themselves into compliance with the law have not come easily.for these reasons,we find no basis for disturbing the district court conclusion that appellants unreasonably delayed the discharge of their fiduciary obligations,nor for upsetting the district court exercise of jurisdiction under on this basis.
iii.discussion 
appellants contend that the district court erred in finding that the secretary of the interior committed four statutory breaches of iim trust duties that warrant prospective relief.cobell v,d at.they challenge both the district court conclusions that specific measures were required under the act for the government to fulfill its fiduciary obligations and its provision of prospective equitable relief awarded.specifically,the government argues that the act does not require the creation of written policies and procedures covering the four areas identified by the district court.
to the extent that appellants contest the district court conclusions defining the federal government fiduciary obligations to iim trust beneficiaries,they raise questions of law that we review de novo.yet insofar as appellants challenge factual findings,we will uphold the district court unless its findings are clearly erroneous.such findings include the district court determination whether the steps taken by appellants in recent years toward fulfilling their legal obligations have been sufficient,or whether there has been unreasonable delay in discharging the government fiduciary duties.
applying these standards,the government is incorrect to the extent that it assumes that the act forms the basis for its fiduciary obligations.the act did not create these obligations any more than it created the iim trust accounts.as noted above,the act was a remedial statute designed to ensure more diligent fulfillment of the government obligations.it recognized and reaffirmed what should be beyond the government has longstanding and substantial trust obligations to indians,particularly to iim trust beneficiaries,not the least of which is a duty to account.while the district court erred in characterizing some specific actions as material breaches that were themselves merely indicia of appellants breach,there is ample evidence in the record to support the district court broader conclusion that appellants failure to take reasonable steps toward the discharge of their trust obligations constituted a breach of their fiduciary duties.once this conclusion was reached,the district acted well within its power to provide modest equitable relief,requiring appellants to do little more than develop plans to ensure proper discharge of their duties within a reasonable time.the district court did not exceed its powers with this order,nor with its decision to maintain jurisdiction over the case.
a.the trust relationship 
there is no doubt that the federal government has a longstanding fiduciary obligation to iim trust beneficiaries.t he law is well established that the government in its dealings with indian tribal property acts in a fiduciary capacity.lincoln vigil,d quoting united states cherokee nation of oklahoma,d.in the leading case on indian trust responsibilities,united states mitchell mitchell ii,the supreme court was clear 
a fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the government assumes such elaborate control over forests and property belonging to indians.all of the necessary elements of a trust are present a trustee the united states,a beneficiary the indian allottees,and a trust corpus indian timber,lands,and funds.

this rule operates as a presumption.see loudner united states,cir t here is a presumption that absent explicit language to the contrary,all funds held by the united states for indian tribes are held in trust.quoting rogers united states,cir.therefore,courts correctly recognize a trust relationship even where it is not explicitly laid out by statute.specifically,where the federal government takes on or has control or supervision over tribal monies or properties,the fiduciary relationship normally exists with respect to such monies or properties unless congress has provided otherwise even though nothing is said expressly in the authorizing or underlying statute or other fundamental document about a trust fund,or a trust or fiduciary connection.mitchell ii,at.quoting navajo tribe of indians united states.
it is no doubt true that the government fiduciary responsibilities necessarily depend on the substantive laws creating those obligations.tribes reno,see also mitchell ii,at.the relevant statutes and regulations define the contours of the united states fiduciary responsibilities.national wildlife federation andrus,a trust responsibility can only arise from a statute,treaty,or executive order.citation omitted.this does not mean that the failure to specify the precise nature of the fiduciary obligation or to enumerate the trustee duties absolves the government of its responsibilities.it is well understood that t he extent of a trustee duties and powers is determined by the trust instrument and the rules of law which are applicable.restatement second of trusts,at.it is the nature of any instrument that establishes a trust relationship that many of the duties and powers are implied therein.they arise from the nature of the relationship established.
while the government obligations are rooted in and outlined by the relevant statutes and treaties,they are largely defined in traditional equitable terms.where congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity or the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.nlrb amax coal,d.courts must infer that congress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties unless congress has unequivocally expressed an intent to the contrary.id.at.much as the supreme court has regularly turned to the restatement and other authorities to construe trust responsibilities,it is appropriate for the district court to consult similar sources.
despite the imposition of fiduciary duties,federal officials retain a substantial amount of discretion to order their priorities.in lincoln vigil,for example,the supreme court held that the government fiduciary relationship with indians could not limit an agency discretion to reorder its priorities as among beneficiaries,d.in lincoln,the court rejected a challenge to the indian health service decision to discontinue a health program for handicapped indian children in one region of the country in order to devote greater resources to a national program.nonetheless,the secretary can not escape his role as trustee by donning the mantle of administrator to claim that courts must defer to his expertise and delegated authority.jicarilla apache tribe supron energy,cir seymour,concurring in part and dissenting in part,adopted as majority opinion as modified en banc,cir.
the secretary has an overriding duty to deal fairly with indians.morton ruiz,d.this duty necessarily constrains the secretary discretion.when faced with several policy choices,an administrator is generally allowed to select any reasonable option.yet this is not the case when acting as a fiduciary for indian beneficiaries as stricter standards apply to federal agencies when administering indian programs.jicarilla,at.summarizing federal case law on fiduciary obligations owed to indian tribes,the tenth circuit concluded that where the secretary is obligated to act as a fiduciary his actions must not merely meet the minimal requirements of administrative law,but must also pass scrutiny under the more stringent standards demanded of a fiduciary.id.at.the federal government has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust in its relationships with indians,and its conduct should therefore be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards.seminole nation united states.muscogee creek nation hodel,giving careful consideration to interior interpretation of the oklahoma indian welfare act,but not deferring to it.
the crux of appellants argument is that there was no material breach of their fiduciary obligations as defined by the act.specifically,appellants contend that the district court found obligations beyond those enumerated in the act,when congress had intended that ost would determine the proper content and timing of policies and procedures to discharge appellants fiduciary obligations.therefore,insofar as this process has yet to be completed,appellants contend that there is no basis for the district court to find that appellants unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed discharge of their obligations.
the fundamental problem with appellants claims is the premise that their duties are solely defined by the act.the indian trust fund management reform act reaffirmed and clarified preexisting duties it did not create them.it further sought to remedy the government failure to discharge its trust obligations it did not define and limit the extent of appellants obligations.while appellants are right to quibble with some of the district court specific findings,the premise upon which much of their appeal rests is unsustainable.
the trust nature of the federal government iim responsibilities was recognized long before passage of the act.see felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law,ed.as early as,the supreme court recognized that the relationship between indians and the federal government was like that of a ward to his guardian.cherokee nation georgia,pet.marshall.half a century later,in upholding a statute placing certain crimes between indians under federal jurisdiction,the court again noted that indian tribes are the wards of the nation and reaffirmed that the federal government owes indians a duty of protection.united states kagama.the fiduciary nature of the government duty was made explicit in seminole nation united states.in seminole nation the court applied the most exacting fiduciary standards of the common law in assessing the government discharge of its duties.id.at.and in mitchell ii,the court reiterated the existence of a general trust relationship which imposes distinctive obligation s in addition to those established by statute.at.citation omitted.
enactment of the indian trust fund management reform act in did not alter the nature or scope of the fiduciary duties owed by the government to iim trust beneficiaries.rather,by its very terms the act identified a portion of the government specific obligations and created additional means to ensure that the obligations would be carried out.indeed,the act explicitly reaffirmed the interior secretary obligation to fulfill the trust responsibilities of the united states.d.from this express language,we must infer that congress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties unless congress has unequivocally expressed an intent to the contrary.nlrb amax coal,d.
section of the act states that the interior secretary proper discharge of the trust responsibilities shall include but are not limited to eight enumerated actions,d emphasis added.in other words,the government has other trust responsibilities not enumerated in the act.see puerto rico maritime shipping auth.icc,it is hornbook law that the use of the word including indicates that the specified list that follows is illustrative,not exclusive.citation omitted.moreover,applicable canons of statutory construction counsel against interpreting a statute creating a new remedy to eliminate prior remedies and in favor of construing a statute affecting indians in a manner favorable to indians.see sutherland,statutory construction,at ed.norman singer ed see also rosebud sioux tribe kneip,d united states santa fe pacific.
section of the act does not create trust responsibilities of the united states.rather it lists some of the means through which the secretary shall discharge these preexisting duties.for instance,the first listed duty is p roviding adequate systems for accounting for and reporting trust fund balances.d.this would not be necessary to discharge the government trust responsibilities were not the government already obliged to account for and report trust fund balances.rather than exhaust the list of duties owed by the federal government to iim trust beneficiaries,the act clarified and augmented aspects of the government preexisting obligations to facilitate their fulfillment.
this view of the federal government fiduciary duties is supported by mitchell ii which held that a fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the government assumes such elaborate control over property belonging to indians in particular where,as here,a ll of the necessary elements of a trust are present.at.the general contours of the government obligations may be defined by statute,but the interstices must be filled in through reference to general trust law.while mitchell ii involved a claim for damages,nothing in that decision or other indian cases would imply that appellants are not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief.such remedies are the traditional ones for violations of trust duties.
appellants imply that the district court did not show sufficient deference to their roles as administrative officials charged with developing and implementing policies and procedures to ensure the discharge of the federal government obligations.appellants thus imply,but do not argue,that their interpretation of the act,and the obligations that it imposes,is due deference under chevron nrdc,d.assuming that the act is ambiguous,this does not enable the government to escape liability by interpreting away its fiduciary obligations.while ordinarily we defer to an agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes entrusted to it for administration,chevron deference is not applicable in this case.the governing canon of construction requires that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d.therefore,even where the ambiguous statute is one entrusted to an agency,we give the agency interpretation careful consideration but we do not defer to it.muscogee creek nation hodel.this departure from the chevron norm arises from the fact that the rule of liberally construing statutes to the benefit of the indians arises not from ordinary exegesis,but from principles of equitable obligations and normative rules of behavior,applicable to the trust relationship between the united states and the native american people.albuquerque indian rights lujan,see also county of oneida oneida indian nation of new york state,d court resolves ambiguity in favor of indian claims pueblo of sandia babbitt.thus,even if the statutory language did not make clear that the government duties predate and extend beyond those enumerated in the act,the interior department would retain its fiduciary obligations to iim trust beneficiaries.
duty to account 
holding that appellants fiduciary duties predate the act does not dispose of all their claims.having determined the source of appellants obligations,we must now consider what those duties entail,at least with respect to the claims at hand.specifically,we must consider the nature and extent of the fiduciary duty to account appellants owe to iim trust beneficiaries.
appellants challenge focuses on the district court conclusion that the iim trust beneficiaries are entitled to a complete historical accounting of their trust accounts.the government maintains that no such right is conferred by the act.rather,the act delegates responsibility for determining the nature and scope of an accounting to the interior department.the accounting required by section of the act is merely a prospective right and,according to appellants,does not speak to the extent to which the secretary must inquire into the correctness of past transactions.reply brief for appellants at.while appellants concede that some type of review of past transactions may indeed be necessary to accurately state opening balances,this does not mean that the plaintiffs have a judicially enforceable right to a complete historical accounting.id.even were the plaintiffs entitled to such an accounting,appellants contend that the interior department,and not the court,would have the authority to determine the nature and scope of the accounting.
contrary to appellants claims,section of the act makes clear that the interior secretary owes iim trust beneficiaries an accounting for all funds held in trust by the united states for the benefit of an indian tribe or an individual indian which are deposited or invested pursuant to the act of june.a emphasis added.all funds means all funds,irrespective of when they were deposited or at least so long as they were deposited after the act of june.therefore,the act reaffirms the government preexisting fiduciary duty to perform a complete historical accounting of trust fund assets.
appellants place substantial weight on the fact that title iii of the act instructs the st to oversee any accounting or account reconciliation conducted by interior.under section b a the st shall monitor the reconciliation of trust accounts and ensure that there is a fair and accurate accounting of all trust accounts.id.b a.further,section of the act requires the interior secretary to report on any account reconciliation that takes place and what steps will be taken to resolve disputes over account balances.id.section of the act,on the other hand,specifies numerous actions that must be taken by the government,but does not dictate the nature or scope of any accounting.see id.d.
yet title iii of the act does not vindicate the government position as these provisions merely detail the oversight functions of the st,not the fiduciary responsibilities of the federal government.the language in title iii,if anything,supports plaintiffs claims,as it requires the st to ensure that bia provides the account holders,with a fair and accurate accounting of all trust accounts.id.b a emphasis added.appellants never explain how one can give a fair and accurate accounting of all accounts without first reconciling the accounts,taking into account past deposits,withdrawals,and accruals.indeed,the government own expert acknowledged that one could not determine an accurate account balance without confirming historical account balances.
even were the language of the act ambiguous,this would not redeem appellants position,as we follow the same rules of construction with regard to indian trust expectations discussed above.courts must be guided by that eminently sound and vital canon that statutes passed for the benefit of indian tribes are to be liberally construed,doubtful expressions being resolved in favor of the indians.bryan itasca county,d citations omitted see also alaska pacific fisheries united states.s tatutes passed for the benefit of dependent indian tribes are to be liberally construed,doubtful expressions being resolved in favor of the indians.muscogee creek nation,at courts should consider,but not defer,to agency interpretations of statutes concerning the federal government obligations to indians jicarilla,at w henever doubt or ambiguity exists in federal statutes or regulations,such doubt is resolved in favor of the tribes.again,as we noted above,the canon of liberality of construction in favor of the indians acts with its special strength even where a federal agency would in other cases enjoy the implied authority to implement ambiguous statutory language supporting a competing interpretation.albuquerque indian rights,at see also montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d noting that the standard principles of statutory construction do not have their usual force in cases involving indian law.
not only does the act plainly reaffirm the government preexisting duty to provide an accounting to iim trust beneficiaries,but it is plain that such an obligation inheres in the trust relationship itself.the obligation of a trustee to provide an accounting is a fundamental principle governing the subject of trust administration.white mountain apache tribe of arizona united states,citing bogert,trusts,at ed.
the act requires that the interior department perform an adequate accounting.this indicates that the accounting must be sufficient to serve the purposes for which a trust accounting is typically conducted.by this standard,the district court conclusion that the management of a trust and rendering of an adequate accounting requires the locating and retention of records,operational computer systems,and adequate staffing was,in plaintiffs words.anything less would produce an inadequate accounting.
this conclusion is reinforced by basic common law trust principles.it is trust law that a n accounting necessarily requires a full disclosure and description of each item of property constituting the corpus of the trust at its inception.engelsmann holekamp,see also black law dictionary ed defining accounting as the report of all items of property,income,and expenses prepared by the trustee for the beneficiary.under traditional equitable trust principles,t he trustee report must contain sufficient information for the beneficiary readily to ascertain whether the trust has been faithfully carried out.white mountain apache tribe.at.
appellants maintain that even if an accounting is required,the district court overstepped its bounds by defining the nature of the accounting required.this argument both misrepresents the district court opinion and misconstrues the relevant trust law principles.the district court made clear that it was not ruling upon what specific form of accounting,if any,is required by the act or the government preexisting fiduciary obligation.cobell v,d at.rather,it noted that an accounting is,in fact,required,and that such an accounting must be of all money in the iim trust held in trust for the benefit of plaintiffs,without regard to when the funds were deposited.id.at.the district court explicitly left open the choice of how the accounting would be conducted,and whether certain accounting methods,such as statistical sampling or something else,would be appropriate.such decisions are properly left in the hands of administrative agencies.
claiming the role of administrator,however,does not absolve the government of its enforceable obligations to the iim trust beneficiaries.as noted above,appellants may not escape from their fiduciary obligations by appealing to their roles as administrators of a federal program.in those capacities,they are trustee delegates of the federal government who owe substantial fiduciary duties to iim trust beneficiaries.if the secretary is obligated to act as a fiduciary then his actions must not merely meet the minimal requirements of administrative law,but must also pass scrutiny under the more stringent standards demanded of a fiduciary.jicarilla,at.
appellants also argue that whatever right to an accounting plaintiffs may have,the district court erred insofar as it determined that such a right was judicially enforceable.the only action for an accounting that could be judicially compelled,according to the government,would be an accounting accompanying an action for money damages in the court of claims under the tucker act.according to appellants,mitchell ii provides that plaintiffs can seek monetary damages in a tucker act claim,but not declaratory or injunctive relief because these prospective equitable remedies are totally inadequate.at.no common law claim for an accounting is cognizable,and even if it were,such a claim has been waived by the plaintiffs failure to file a on that claim.
here again,appellants misconstrue the relevant case law.we have already determined that there is federal jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claims insofar as the federal government has unreasonably delayed or unlawfully withheld performance of its trust duties.federal courts have repeatedly recognized the right of native americans to seek relief for breaches of fiduciary obligations,including suits for monetary damages under the tucker act where prospective remedies would be inadequate.indeed,this is the clear import of mitchell ii.see at.it is fundamental that an action for accounting is an equitable claim and that courts of equity have original jurisdiction to compel an accounting.klamath and modoc tribes united states.
this position should not come as a surprise to appellants,as it has been the official position of the federal government.in prior to the filing of the initial complaint in this case the interior department solicitor issued an opinion that government trustees have an affirmative duty to make a full and proper accounting.nothing in the act,nor any other federal statute,acts to limit or alter this right.
based upon the foregoing facts and recognition of the federal government broad fiduciary obligations to iim trust beneficiaries,particularly a duty to render a complete and accurate historical accounting,the district court found several specific breaches on the part of appellants.specifically,the district court found that a appellants failed to provide plaintiffs with an accurate accounting of all money in the iim trust held in trust for the benefit of plaintiffs,without regard to when the funds were deposited b appellants in both the interior and treasury department failed to retrieve and retain all information concerning the iim trust that is necessary to render an accurate accounting for the trust beneficiaries c the interior secretary and assistant secretary failed to establish written policies and procedures for collecting and retaining necessary documents and information,implementing computer and business systems architecture necessary and ensuring sufficient staffing of trust management functions to fulfill such obligations.cobell v,d at.as discussed separately below,the court also found that the treasury secretary failed to retain iim trust documents necessary for an accurate accounting.id.
appellants do not contest the district court factual findings appellants have failed to do what the district court concluded they failed to do.nor do appellants forcefully maintain that those steps which they have taken toward discharging their fiduciary obligations come anywhere close to those steps necessary to fulfill the obligation to provide an accounting.even were these findings challenged,there is more than enough substantial evidence to support the district court findings in this regard.
appellants do object to the district court conclusions,however.specifically,appellants argue that the district court found specific breaches of obligations that do not exist.save for the first breach of failing to render an have a point.while there is a specific duty to provide a complete accounting,there is no specific duty to,for example,implement particular policies or retrieve information either in the act or elsewhere.this does not vindicate appellants position,however,for while appellants may not have breached a specific duty to perform the particular tasks identified by the district court,such as implementing a iim trust management computer system,appellants failure to take such steps provides ample support for the district court ultimate conclusion that appellants have unreasonably delayed the discharge of their fiduciary obligations to iim beneficiaries,and that there is little reason to believe that,absent court intervention,these duties will be discharged any time soon.
the government broad duty to provide a complete historical accounting to iim beneficiaries necessarily imposes substantial subsidiary duties on those government officials with responsibility for ensuring that an accounting can and will take place.in particular,it imposes obligations on those who administer the iim trust lands and funds to,among other things,maintain and complete existing records,recover missing records where possible,and develop plans and procedures sufficient to ensure that all aspects of the accounting process are carried out.as the district court concluded,this may well include an obligation to develop or obtain computer software capable of tracking and reconciling fund data,hire staff sufficient to execute management duties,and implement specific plans to ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to provide the most complete and accurate historical accounting of iim trust funds that is possible.the failure to implement a computer system is not itself the breach.rather it is indicative of appellants failure to discharge their fiduciary obligations in a reasonably prompt manner.it is the latter which constitutes the breach.
there are similar problems with some of the district court other specific findings of breach.for instance,one provision in section of the act requires e stablishing consistent,written policies and procedures for trust fund management and accounting.d.another requires the interior secretary to provide adequate staffing for trust fund management and accounting.id.d.the district court concluded that the department of interior had breached a duty to have written policies and procedures for the staffing of trust management functions.cobell v,d at.this may technically overstate the case.there may not literally be a duty to have such written policies and procedures.were there a means of ensuring discharge of appellants fiduciary obligations absent such steps,there would be no breach.nonetheless,though the failure to take such steps may not constitute a breach,it surely provides substantial evidence that such a breach has occurred.
in sum,there are numerous provisions of the act which appellants,by their own stipulation,are unable to meet.most significantly,the government can not provide an adequate accounting or reconciliation and does not provide the required reports to iim trust beneficiaries,nor did the district court find any basis for believing that such obligations would soon be met.thus the district court conclusions that certain types of policies and plans would be necessary for the government to discharge its fiduciary obligations are sustainable.it is clear that the federal government will be unable to provide an adequate accounting without computer systems,staffing,and document retention policies that are adequate for the task.at the same time,defendants should be afforded sufficient discretion in determining the precise route they take,so long as this threshold is met.the actual legal breach is the failure to provide an accounting,not its failure to take the discrete individual steps that would facilitate an accounting.thus,while the district court must amend its opinion on remand to account for this distinction,there is no need to alter the district court order,as the bottom line is the same by failing to take reasonable steps toward the discharge of the federal government fiduciary obligations to iim trust beneficiaries,appellants breached their duties.
e.the treasury department 
appellants specifically object to the district court decision to award relief against the treasury department.treasury stipulated it would take actions to preserve documents,which the district court acknowledged might satisfactorily discharge the department duties.cobell v,d at.moreover,appellants argue,there is no proof that the documents destroyed by the treasury department included anything necessary to render an accounting of the iim trust accounts.at a more fundamental level,the government challenges the court finding of any breach by the treasury department for failing to retain documents.while the act does impose obligations upon the treasury department,there are no enumerated document retention obligations in the act.congress gave no indication that the government trust responsibilities required it to alter the record destruction schedules set for the treasury department by the national archives and records administration nara.
appellants have stipulated that the federal government is the iim beneficiaries trustee and that the treasury secretary is a.a trustee is required to preserve those documents necessary to fulfill the trustee obligations to trust beneficiaries.this includes maintaining those documents that are necessary for an accounting.therefore,insofar as the treasury department has records and documents that are necessary to perform an adequate accounting,the district court was correct in holding that the department must maintain these records.the treasury department failure to maintain such documents is a breach of its fiduciary duty.the destruction of potentially relevant trust documents that may have been necessary for a complete accounting is clear evidence that the department committed such a breach.see id.at citing pls.ex,treasury declarations re document destruction,june,as noted above,in the context of indian trust obligations the government,in both its executive and legislative branches,is held to a high standard of conduct,one consonant with its moral obligations of the highest obligation and trust.jicarilla,at quoting seminole nation united states,at.
although the nara guidelines direct the treasury department to destroy check records more than six years and seven months old,this can not excuse the treasury department from its fiduciary obligations under the act.another agency development,in consultation with the treasury department,of document retention regulations which allow for the destruction of documents can not relieve the treasury department of its responsibilities.not only are nara record retention schedules modified regularly to account to each agency particular needs at a given point in time,but nara typically approves the record retention schedule proposed by the agency.thus,there is no basis for treasury to contend that it was unable to maintain the records under federal rules.
upon concluding that appellants committed several substantial breaches of their fiduciary obligations to iim beneficiaries,the district court issued an order to compel those actions which had been unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.specifically,the district court remanded the required actions to appellants so that they may begin to discharge the duties found by the court.furthermore,the court retained jurisdiction over the matter in order to ensure that defendants are diligently taking steps to rectify the continuing breaches of trust.cobell v,d at.finally,the court ordered that appellants prepare a revised hlip and file quarterly status reports setting forth and explaining the steps that defendants have taken to rectify the breaches of trust declared by the court.id.at.
there is no question that appellants have made significant steps toward the discharge of the federal government fiduciary
