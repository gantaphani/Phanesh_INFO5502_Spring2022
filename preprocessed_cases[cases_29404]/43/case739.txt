bodrell joer dan smith smith appeals an order sustaining,without leave to amend,the hopland band of pomo indians tribe demurrer,and granting the tribe motion to dismiss smith complaint.the court held that the tribe had not waived its sovereign immunity,by entering into a contract containing an arbitration clause,and agreeing to the application of california law,because a tribal ordinance provided that its sovereign immunity could only be waived by an ordinance or resolution of the tribal council explicitly waiving immunity.
we shall reverse,and remand to the trial court.
smith is an architect.on july,and september,he entered into two contracts with the tribe to provide planning and architectural services related to development of indian land,including a new casino and hotel.after a dispute arose over performance and payment,smith filed a complaint in mendocino county superior court seeking to recover unpaid fees of over.a copy of each of the contracts was attached to the complaint.the contracts included the american institute of architects standard form of agreement between owner and architect,aia document.article provides,in relevant part 
claims,disputes or other matters in question between the parties to this agreement arising out of or relating to this agreement or breach thereof shall be subject to and decided by arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
the foregoing agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
the award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final,and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
article further provides 
unless otherwise provided,this agreement shall be governed by the law of the principal place of business of the architect.smith address was listed as palo alto,california.
after smith voluntarily dismissed his causes of action against individual tribe members,the tribe filed a motion to quash service of summons,demurrer,and motion to dismiss,on several grounds,including the assertion of sovereign immunity.in support of the motion,it submitted,among other things,a certified copy of a tribal ordinance,passed on february,which provided,in pertinent part 
sovereign immunity of the tribe.except as otherwise provided by a duly enacted ordinance of the hopland tribal council or a resolution of the hopland tribal council adopted pursuant to such authorizing ordinance,explicitly waiving the tribe sovereign immunity from unconsented suit,the hopland band of pomo indians 
does not consent to be sued and is not subject to suit in any administrative or court proceeding and 
is not liable for any act or omission of any tribal officer,elected official,tribal employee,or any other person,organization,or entity owned or operated by the tribe.
the court denied the motion to quash and motion to dismiss,and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to some causes of action and without leave to amend as to others.on the issue of sovereign immunity,it followed a line of authority represented by sokaogon gaming enterp.cir which held that similar contract language agreeing to arbitration,and enforcement in any court of competent jurisdiction,is an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.the trial court further noted that the tribe had not disputed the authority of the tribal chairperson to sign the contract,and it therefore did not consider what effect the sovereign immunity ordinance might have had.
smith filed a second amended complaint alleging three causes of action for breach of contract.the tribe filed another demurrer,or motion to dismiss.this time,the tribe did argue,among other things that in accordance with the tribal sovereign immunity ordinance,sandra sigala,the tribal chairperson who signed the contracts did not have the authority to waive the tribe sovereign immunity in the absence of an ordinance,or resolution pursuant to such ordinance,explicitly waiving sovereign immunity.the tribe submitted the declaration of sandra sigala,authenticating the sovereign immunity ordinance.brian yepez,the tribe treasurer,declared that,although the tribal council passed a resolution approving the contract,it did not understand the arbitration clause to constitute a waiver of the tribe sovereign immunity,and that the resolution approving the contract,did not contain authorization to waive the tribe sovereign immunity or approve a contract waiving the tribe sovereign immunity.
in opposition,smith filed his own declaration,stating that on september,he was present at a meeting of the tribal council,during which it authorized,by unanimous vote,sandra sigala to negotiate and execute contracts with smith.at that same meeting,smith gave each tribal council member a copy of each of the contracts that he had presented,and left three signed originals,all of which contained the same aia,standard form l arbitration clauses that were included in the final contacts.he was also present at a tribal council meeting on september,during which all members present participated in negotiating and modifying the wording of the two agreements.
on october,the court filed its order on the demurrer and motion to dismiss.it,preliminarily,observed that the assertion of sovereign immunity,and the claim of waiver,presented a question affecting its subject matter jurisdiction,and that it therefore was appropriate to consider the declarations submitted,to the extent that they related to the issue of sovereign immunity,and resolve any conflicts necessary to determine whether it had jurisdiction the court ruled that the sovereign immunity ordinance requires that the tribal council pass an ordinance,or resolution,explicitly waiving its sovereign immunity.it further held that the fact that the tribal council members were aware of the contract,and its terms,when it authorized sigala to sign it,did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity because the council did not pass an ordinance or resolution explicitly waiving its sovereign immunity.it therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and granted the motion to dismiss,with directions for the tribe counsel to prepare,and submit an appropriate order smith filed a notice of appeal on november.
while this appeal was pending,the united states supreme court,in c l enterprises potawatomi indian tribe.hereafter c l enterprises,resolved the split of authority that had emerged in the state and federal courts on the question whether,by agreeing to an arbitration clause,and to enforcement of an arbitral award,in any court having jurisdiction thereof,a tribe has waived its sovereign immunity from suit.the court concluded that agreement to such contract language constitutes an explicit waiver,of tribal sovereign immunity.c l enterprises,at.at.as we shall explain,the contract in this case is indistinguishable from the contract in c l enterprises,supra,and the only reasonable interpretation of its terms is that it clearly,and explicitly waives tribal sovereign immunity.
the court,in c l enterprises,supra,focused on two key contractual provisions which,in all material respects,are identical to the arbitration clause,and choice of law provision included in the contract between appellant and respondent.the arbitration clause in c l enterprises,supra,provided all claims or disputes shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the construction i ndustry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final,and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.c l enterprises,supra,at.at.the court noted that,t he american arbitration association rules to which the clause refers provide parties to these rules shall be deemed to have consented that judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof.ibid.
the choice of law provision selected oklahoma law.oklahoma,like california has adopted a provision of the uniform arbitration act which provides that t he making of an agreement providing for arbitration in this state confers jurisdiction on the court to enforce the agreement under this act and to enter judgment on an award hereunder,and which further defines,court as any court of competent jurisdiction of this state.c l enterprises,supra,at.at see also civ.proc.
the court rejected the conclusion of the oklahoma court of appeals,that the contract language constituted only a waiver by implication,because the contract did not use the words sovereign immunity,or expressly state that the defense of sovereign immunity is waived.an implied waiver would be ineffective in the face of an established standard of federal law that requires a waiver of tribal immunity must be clear.c l enterprises,supra,at.at,citing oklahoma tax comm potawatomi tribe,d.the court,instead,held the contract language was unambiguous,and by agreeing to submit all disputes to arbitration,to enforcement in any court of competent jurisdiction,and accepting oklahoma law as the law governing the contract,the tribe had clearly and explicitly waived its sovereign immunity.c l enterprises,supra,at.at.
respondent demurrer and motion to dismiss,however,raises an additional issue that the supreme court in c l enterprises,supra,expressly declined to reach respondent contends that,even if the contract does explicitly waive sovereign immunity,in accordance with the tribe sovereign immunity ordinance,in the absence of an ordinance or resolution of the tribal council explicitly waiving sovereign immunity,sandra sigala did not have actual authority to waive it 
respondent,however,does not dispute that sigala had the authority to negotiate the contracts with smith,and to execute the final versions which included the arbitration clause and choice of law provisions,and that the tribal council,by resolution,approved the contracts.the declaration of brian yepez admits that the tribal council authorized sandra sigala to negotiate and execute the contracts brian yepez declaration also admits that the tribal council,by resolution,approved the contracts as finally negotiated.nor did respondent submit any declarations that contradict appellant declaration that,at the meeting in which the tribal council authorized sigala to negotiate and execute contracts with him,he gave all members of the tribal council copies of the contract including the arbitration,and choice of law clause,and that at the september,meeting the tribal council met with him and all members present participated in negotiating and modifying the terms of what became the final contracts.instead,respondent declarations acknowledge that,although the tribal council subjectively believed that agreeing to the arbitration clause did not waive sovereign immunity,when the tribal council authorized sigala to sign the contracts,and passed its resolution approving them,it was fully aware of their terms,including the arbitration and choice of law clauses.
therefore,we are not presented with a circumstance in which a tribal agent has signed a contract without authority to act on the tribe behalf.for that reason,the first decision upon which respondent relies,hydrothermal energy fort bidwell indian community council d,is inapposite.in that case,lucinda lame bull,the chairman of the council,had signed two contracts with an educational agency organization that contained an arbitration clause.the tribe terminated the contracts when it discovered the agency proselytized for the church of scientology.the agency compelled arbitration,and the arbitrator concluded the tribe had waived its immunity by signing the contract with the arbitration clause.the trial court confirmed the arbitration award,but the court of appeal reversed,on the ground that lucinda lame bull did not have actual authority to sign the contract on behalf of the tribe.the court based this conclusion upon a declaration filed by lame bull explaining that all contracts had to be approved by a quorum of the tribal council,that she informed the agency of this procedure,and she agreed to sign the contracts,without such approval,at the agency request,only for limited bookkeeping purposes.id.at.therefore,without approval of a quorum of the tribal council,she did not have actual authority to sign the contract on behalf of the tribe.
by contrast,here,the tribal council authorized sigala to negotiate and execute the contracts with appellant,was aware of the terms,including the arbitration clause,and,by resolution,approved the contract.thus,not only did sigala clearly have authority to agree to all the contract terms,but also the tribal council ratified her action when it approved the contract.despite respondent declaration that the tribal council did not subjectively understand that by agreeing to its terms it had explicitly waived its sovereign immunity,the court decision in c l enterprises,supra,d has definitively resolved that issue in appellant favor.consequently,in the absence of the tribe sovereign immunity ordinance,respondent clearly and explicitly waived its sovereign immunity.
according to respondent,the effect of the sovereign immunity ordinance is to require the enactment of an ordinance or resolution explicitly waiving tribal sovereign immunity,even if the tribe has,in accordance with other applicable laws,authorized one of its officials to execute a contract containing provisions explicitly waiving the tribe sovereign immunity,and the tribe governing body has,by resolution,approved the contract.thus,the ordinance does not,in substance,define or limit authority to negotiate,execute,and approve a contract.instead,it establishes a general principle of tribal law defining what acts may be deemed to constitute a waiver of its immunity.therefore,respondents argument stands or falls with the proposition that we must apply its tribal sovereign immunity ordinance to find the otherwise binding contract with smith ineffective to waive sovereign immunity,because the explicit waiver was made by contract,instead of pursuant to a tribal ordinance or resolution.we decline to do so for several reasons 
first,the terms of the sovereign immunity ordinance may have been satisfied because,according to the declaration of brian yepez,the tribal council did pass a resolution approving the contract.yepez also declares that the resolution did not contain authorization from the tribal council to waive the tribe sovereign immunity or approve a contract waiving the tribe sovereign immunity.italics added.the later assertion must be based only upon the fact that the resolution did not use the specific words sovereign immunity or waiver,because the contract itself,approved by resolution of the tribal council,did contain language that constitutes an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.c l enterprises,supra,d.for the same reasons that the court in c l rejected the argument that to be deemed explicit the waiver must use the words sovereign immunity,we do not interpret the reference in the tribal ordinance to an explicit waiver to mean that a resolution must use the magic words waiver or sovereign immunity.it is unclear,however,whether the phrase adopted pursuant to such authorizing ordinance means that such a resolution must also be preceded by a separate ordinance authorizing the tribal council,by resolution,to waive sovereign immunity,or whether such authorizing ordinance refers to the tribal sovereign immunity ordinance itself.at a minimum,however,it is clear that the purpose of the tribal sovereign immunity ordinance is to ensure that no waiver of sovereign immunity is made by a single tribal officer,and that instead such waivers be made only by formal action of its governing body,the tribal council.that purpose is served here because,the tribal council,with full knowledge of its terms,approved the contract by resolution.
second,we question the premise that the issue whether the tribe has waived its sovereign immunity by entering into this contract should be determined by reference to a tribal law.although there are,no doubt,s
