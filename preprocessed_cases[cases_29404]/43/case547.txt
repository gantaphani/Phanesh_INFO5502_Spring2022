background 
one of the disputes here concerns the claimed of the appellant to an accounting of a trust fund allegedly resulting from an treaty called the category one claims.the background of the dispute is as follows.
the historic wyandot nation resided in ohio and michigan.in,the historic wyandot nation ceded to the united states all of its lands and in ohio and michigan in exchange for a promise of acres west of the mississippi.that land grant never occurred,forcing the historic wyandot nation to purchase acres of land located in kansas from the delaware tribe in.in,the historic wyandot nation and the united states entered into a treaty,rescinding any claims the historic wyandot nation may have had with respect to the previously promised acres,in exchange for and extinguishing the historic wyandot nation debt to the delaware tribe for its land purchase.see treaty with the wyandot,stat.treaty of.
in,the united states entered into another treaty with the historic wyandot nation,in which the tribe agreed to be dissolved and to cede its lands to the united states,in exchange for the ceded lands to be divided in fee simple to the individual tribe members,a payment of to be distributed equally among tribe members,and the payment from the treaty of also be distributed equally among tribe members.see treaty with the wyandots,stat.treaty of.
during the civil war,many native american tribes suffered hardships and were forced to sell their lands.in response,in,the united states entered into a new treaty with several tribes.see treaty with the seneca,stat,treaty of.the treaty of set aside acres of federally purchased lands in oklahoma to become a reservation for a wyandot tribe,and it allowed individual wyandot indians to choose to either become members of this newly reconstituted tribe or become united states citizens.
schedule a,appended to the treaty of,provided for the payment of to be divided and paid to wyandot indians and their heirs to satisfy what was determined to be due from the claims of the wyandots against the united states,for all of its former treaties and sales of treaty lands.the parties dispute whether these funds were properly paid.the united states asserts that it had correctly paid the amounts due in to the rightful claimants.the appellant asserts that there are unpaid amounts due to the heirs of wyandot nation that the united states currently holds in trust,for which the appellant is owed a full accounting and fiduciary trust duties.
the parties in this case also dispute the relationship of the wyandot nation of kansas to the wyandot tribe recognized by the treaty of.the government asserts that this newly reconstituted tribe became known as the wyandotte nation.the federal government recognizes the wyandotte nation of oklahoma as its present day successor.that tribe has its in wyandotte,oklahoma.
the appellant,on the other hand,asserts that despite the treaty of,the historic wyandot nation did not dissolve.rather,the appellant contends that after the treaty of was executed,some tribe members moved to the oklahoma reservation established under the treaty,while others chose to remain in kansas.according to the appellant,these two separate bands of which the wyandotte nation of oklahoma and the wyandot nation of kansas are the successors were both a part of the newly constituted wyandot tribe in.the appellant therefore asserts that it is a federally recognized tribe by virtue of the treaty of.however,in a settlement agreement with the wyandotte nation of oklahoma over disputed land use,the appellant also admitted that the kansas wyandot is a recognized indian tribe.
in,the oklahoma band reorganized as a separate tribe under the oklahoma indian welfare act oiwa,which provided that a ny recognized tribe or band of indians residing in oklahoma shall have the right to organize for its common welfare.stat.in,the kansas band changed its name to the wyandot nation of kansas.the wyandot nation of kansas is currently incorporated under kansas law.
in,congress enacted the american indian trust fund management reform act reform act,pub,stat,which provided that t he secretary of the interior shall account for the daily and annual balance of all funds held in trust by the united states for the benefit of an indian tribe.a.the reform act defined indian tribe as any indian tribe,band,nation,or other organized group or community,which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the united states to indians because of their status as indians.
almost simultaneously,congress also enacted the federally recognized indian tribe list act of list act,pub,stat,which provided that 
the secretary of the interior is charged with the responsibility of keeping a list of all federally recognized tribes the list published by the secretary shall be accurate,regularly updated,and regularly published and the list of federally recognized tribes which the secretary should reflect all of the federally recognized indian tribes in the united states which are eligible for the special programs and services provided by the united states to indians because of their status as indians.
id.the list act approved existing regulations spelling out a mechanism whereby any entity not on the annual department of the interior interior list can pursue federal recognition.see pt.c.
wyandot nation is not on the list maintained by the secretary of the interior.the appellant petitioned interior in for federal recognition pursuant to the list act regulations.interior preliminarily determined that the wyandot nation of kansas,which consists of the of the citizen wyandotts of kansas terminated in,does not qualify for federal acknowledgement through the administrative process and can only become a federally recognized indian tribe by an act of congress.the appellant did not pursue further administrative or judicial review of this agency action.
one other statutory provision is pertinent.during the period from through,the department of interior appropriation act riders provided that claims for losses or mismanagement of indian trust funds do not accrue until the affected indian tribe or individual indian has been furnished with an accounting of such funds.see,consolidated appropriations act,pub,stat,appropriation riders.
a second dispute in this case called the category two claims concerns the ownership of the huron cemetery in kansas city,and funds derived from easements over this cemetery property.
under the treaty of,certain ceded lands were exempt from assignment to individual members,including the huron cemetery,which was a historic wyandot burial ground.easements for city streets have traversed the huron cemetery since.the parties dispute the current ownership interests of the huron cemetery.the appellant asserts that the united states holds the huron cemetery land,as well as monies derived from easements,in trust for the benefit of the wyandot nation of kansas.the united states maintains that it holds title to the huron cemetery in trust for the wyandotte nation of oklahoma,and that the appellant possesses no beneficial interest in the land.
on june,the appellant filed suit in the court of federal claims,seeking an accounting of,and monetary damages from alleged mismanagement of,the schedule a funds of the treaty of category one claims,and funds that may have been derived from easements across the huron cemetery category two claims.the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,untimeliness,and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
with respect to the category one claims,the court of federal claims found that because the wyandot nation is not a federally recognized indian tribe,it is not entitled to an accounting under the reform act.because it is not entitled to an accounting under the reform act,the wyandot nation can not rely on the appropriations riders to avoid the statute of limitations bar that would apply to its fund mismanagement claims.that is,without the benefit of the appropriation riders,the statute of limitations barred fund mismanagement claims that the appellant had known about since the.see.the claims court therefore dismissed without prejudice the category one claims for lack of jurisdiction.
with respect to the category two claims,the court of federal claims found that based on prior litigation,the united states holds title to the huron cemetery in trust for the wyandotte nation of oklahoma.because the wyandot nation of kansas has no beneficial interest in the huron cemetery,the claims court dismissed without prejudice the category two claims for lack of standing.

discussion 
wyandot nation asserts with respect to the category one claims that it is entitled to an accounting of,and monetary damages for the mismanagement of,the treaty of schedule a funds that the united states holds in trust.the united states contends that the statute of limitations has run on any such claim.
to the extent that wyandot nation asserts accounting and breach of trust claims based on the government failure to make payment in the,such claims would be because the complaint alleges that the amounts that the government then calculated pursuant to schedule a were paid to the wyandotte tribe of indians in,providing notice that the government had breached its obligations by failing to make full payment.thus,the claim made here would not be the sort of claim for which a final accounting would be necessary to put a plaintiff on notice of a claim,because claimants knew or should have known that the money was publicly distributed in,and the appellant would have no right to wait for an accounting.wolfchild united states,fed.cir.the appellant category one claims therefore depend on its right to an accounting under the reform act which would arguably invoke the statute of limitations extensions provided by the appropriation riders.
understanding this dispute thus requires descriptions of the reform act,the list act,the corresponding regulations,and their relevant provisions.the reform act requires interior to account for the daily and annual balance of all funds held in trust by the united states for the benefit of an indian tribe.a.the appropriation riders extend the statute of limitations to pursue accounting breach of trust claims under the reform act until after the affected indian tribe has been furnished with an accounting of such funds.stat.at.
only an indian tribe is entitled to an accounting under the reform act.wyandot nation right to an accounting,therefore,requires establishing that it is a federally recognized indian tribe,which the reform act defines as any indian tribe,band,nation,or other organized group or community,which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the united states to indians because of their status as indians.both parties agree that unless the appellant is a federally recognized indian tribe,it has no right to an accounting under the reform act.
the government contends that a tribe can not be a recognized indian tribe within the meaning of the reform act unless it is recognized as such by the secretary of the interior under the list act.the list act requires the secretary of the interior to annually publish in the federal register a list of all indian tribes which the secretary recognizes to be eligible for the special programs and services provided by the united states to indians because of their status as indians.emphasis added.if an entity is not on the list,regulations provide a process for petitioning for federal acknowledgement.see pt.c.
wyandot nation contends that being listed pursuant to the list act is not a necessary condition to federal recognition.appellant points out that the list act provides that indian tribes presently may be recognized by act of congress by the administrative procedures set forth in part of the code of federal regulations procedures for establishing that an american indian group exists as an indian tribe or by a decision of a united states court.stat.at.wyandot nation asserts that it is already federally recognized pursuant to the treaty of and that this treaty right should be recognized by the courts.
we are persuaded that the list act regulatory scheme exclusively governs federal recognition of indian tribes.
at the outset,we reject the government contention that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies here.the government argues that wyandot nation failed to exhaust its administrative remedies at interior for tribal recognition and that the list act is a statutory scheme that displaces tucker act jurisdiction.horne dep t of.we do not agree.the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies provides that no one is entitled to judicial relief until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.woodford ngo,emphasis added.had wyandot nation sought only federal recognition as an indian tribe,dismissal for failure to exhaust the specific administrative remedies might have been appropriate,but the appellant category one claims are broader.wyandot nation is also seeking an accounting and monetary damages.because there is no exclusive administrative remedy for an accounting and damages,we conclude that administrative exhaustion does not apply to the category one claims and that there is no displacement of tucker act jurisdiction.see,cobell salazar,cir.the plaintiffs are entitled to an accounting under the reform act statute.the district court sitting in equity must do everything it can to ensure that interior provides them an equitable accounting.citation omitted.
while the exhaustion doctrine does not apply here,we think that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction treated by the government only in a footnote requires that the appellant pursue the administrative remedies provided by the list act 
an explicit purpose of the list act is to establish procedures and criteria for addition to the department list of federally recognized indian tribes.and the regulations specifically address entities like the wyandot nation,which is asserting that it was previously acknowledged as a federally recognized indian tribe,or is a portion that evolved out of a previously federally recognized indian tribe.a.the regulations also provide guidance as to what needs to be shown to gain recognition.see id.
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,like the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies,is with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties.united states western pacific railroad.the doctrine of primary jurisdiction 
applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,but enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case,the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.
in western pacific,the western pacific railroad billed the government for a freight shipment,but the parties disputed the accuracy of the billing because they disagreed as to the applicable tariff rate.id.at.western pacific railroad sued to recover the monies owed in the court of claims.id.at.the supreme court held that the interpretation of tariffs was a threshold issue to the overall claim,and that this issue was within the primary jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission.id.at.since this threshold issue was within the special competence of an administrative body,in such a case,the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.id.at.the doctrine of primary jurisdiction thus transfers from court to agency the power to determine some of the incidents of the broader claim.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
subsequent supreme court cases have consistently affirmed the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.in port of boston marine terminal ass rederiaktiebolaget transatlantic,the court held that w hen there is a basis for judicial action,independent of agency proceedings,courts may route the threshold decision as to certain issues to the agency charged with primary responsibility for the activity involved.in ricci chicago mercantile exchange,the court held that the overall action should be stayed until the administrative officials have had an opportunity to act when some facets of the overall dispute are within the statutory jurisdiction of the commission and adjudication of that dispute by the commission promises to be of material aid in resolving the overall claim.the ricci court elaborated that w e make no claim that the commission has authority to decide the overall dispute,id.at,but w e think it very likely that a prior agency adjudication of this dispute will be a material aid,id.at,in either making the problem disappear entirely or making for a more intelligent and sensitive eventual judicial judgment,id.at.and in reiter cooper,the court held that 
primary jurisdiction is a doctrine specifically applicable to claims properly cognizable in court that contain some issue within the special competence of an administrative agency.it requires the court to enable a referral to the agency and the court has discretion,if the parties would not be unfairly disadvantaged,to dismiss the case without prejudice.
id.at see also richard pierce,administrative law treatise ed.if a court concludes that it has jurisdiction over a dispute but that an issue raised in the dispute is within the primary jurisdiction of an agency,the court will defer any decision in the dispute before it until the agency has addressed the issue.
no fixed formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.in every case the question is whether the reasons for the existence of the doctrine will be aided by its application in the particular litigation,at.the two rationales for the doctrine are that desirable uniformity would be obtain ed if initially a specialized agency passed on certain types of administrative questions,and that the expert and specialized knowledge of the agencies involved would help ensure that the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised.id.we conclude that the threshold question here of whether wyandot nation is a federally recognized indian tribe is within the primary jurisdiction of interior.it is clear that desirable uniformity would be obtained by such an approach and that interior has expert and specialized knowledge of the issue involved.
other courts have reached similar conclusions,holding that whether a particular entity is an indian tribe is to be first resolved by interior.in james hhs,cir,the gay head tribe,like the wyandot nation,asserted that it was already federally recognized,and sought a declaration ordering the department of the interior to add the gay head tribe to the list of federally recognized tribes.the district of columbia circuit held that i n cases such as this,where congress has delegated certain initial decisions to the executive branch,questions as to whether the gay head tribe was federally recognized should be made in the first instance by the department of the interior.id.
the james court cited several reasons for requiring interior,rather than courts,to make tribal recognition determinations.first,congress has specifically authorized the regulatory scheme set up by the secretary of the interior to determine which indian groups exist as tribes.that purpose would be frustrated if the judicial branch made initial determinations of whether groups have been recognized previously.id.second,such an approach allows the department of the interior the opportunity to apply its developed expertise in the area of tribal recognition,since it employs experts in the fields of history,anthropology and genealogy,to aid in tribal recognition,providing expertise that would most assuredly aid in judicial review should the parties be unsuccessful in resolving the matter.id.at.finally,interior had not expressed a strong position or an unwillingness to reconsider the issue of a tribe acknowledgement.id.at.
again,recently,in mackinac tribe jewell,cir,following james,the district of columbia circuit held that 
when a court is asked to decide whether a group claiming to be a currently recognized tribe is entitled to be treated as such,the court should for prudential reasons refrain from deciding that question until the department of the interior has received and evaluated a petition under part.
id.at citations omitted.
in western shoshone business council babbitt,cir,the tenth circuit and applied the james approach.there,western shoshone argued that a tribe may be not included on the interior list and yet still be recognized as an indian tribe.the tenth circuit disagreed,explaining that 
the limited circumstances under which ad hoc judicial determinations of recognition were appropriate have been eclipsed by federal regulation.in,the department of interior promulgated regulations establishing procedures for establishing that an american indian group exists as an indian tribe.pt.we therefore conclude that the tribe absence from this list is dispositive.
id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
again,in united tribe of shawnee indians united states,cir,the tenth circuit reaffirmed this approach.the united tribe of shawnee indians utsi sought a judicial ruling that it is a recognized tribe by virtue of the treaty and the decision in the kansas indians,which held that the shawnee tribe existed as a recognized tribal entity in.the tenth circuit held that a tribe seeking recognition is required first to seek recognition at interior,and not attempt to bypass the regulatory framework for establishing that an indian group exists as an indian tribe.we were strongly persuaded in this matter by the decision in james.id.at citation omitted.
the second circuit has also reached the same result.in golden hill paugussett tribe of indians weicker,cir,the golden hill tribe asserted that it was the rightful owner of acres of land in because that land had been wrongfully conveyed in violation of the nonintercourse act.to show a violation of the nonintercourse act,a plaintiff must show that it is an indian tribe.the second circuit held that the fact that interior lacks the authority to determine plaintiff land claim,id.at,did not excuse the appellant from first seeking interior recognition as an indian tribe,id.at.primary jurisdiction applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,but enforcement of the claim requires,or is materially aided by,the resolution of threshold issues,usually of a factual nature,which are placed within the special competence of the administrative body.id.at.the department of the interior creation of a structured administrative process to acknowledge nonrecognized indian tribes using uniform criteria,and its experience and expertise in applying these standards,has now made deference to the primary jurisdiction of the agency appropriate during the threshold determination of the broader land claim.id.at.
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction has particular force in this area because of the long history making clear that tribal recognition is a political question committed to the political branches.i t is the rule of this court to follow the action
