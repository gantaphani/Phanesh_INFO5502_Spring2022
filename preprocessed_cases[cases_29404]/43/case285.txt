factual and legal background 
treaty fishing rights 
during the governor stevens of washington territory negotiated a number of treaties with northwest indian tribes.the treaty of point elliott was typical of those treaties in guaranteeing the signatory tribes t he right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations in common with all citizens of the territory.stat.at.in washington i,the seminal case construing this clause,the district court held that,with small exceptions,the treaty clause reserved to the indians the right to take fifty percent of the annual harvestable runs of salmon and steelhead trout.at.it further held that fourteen tribes or bands,not including the present samish tribe,were entitled to treaty fishing rights as political successors to tribes that had signed treaties guaranteeing tribal fishing rights.id.at.two of the tribes so entitled,the stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes,were not federally recognized.id.at.
initial denial of samish tribe treaty status 
shortly thereafter,the samish tribe intervened in the washington litigation and sought to establish its entitlement to treaty fishing rights.at that time,the samish tribe was not federally recognized the district court denied relief.washington ii.at.the district court found that the samish indians,then numbering between and persons,were a party to the treaty of point elliott.id.at.they were not named in the treaty,but were signed for by the lummi tribe representative.id.at.the court further found 
pursuant to the treaty most of the samish people initially moved to the lummi reservation.later others moved to the swinomish reservation.the lummi and swinomish reservation tribes include descendants of the samish indians.
id.the court held,however,that t he intervenor samish tribe is not an entity that is descended from any of the tribal entities that were signatory to the treaty of point elliott.id.the court noted the samish lack of federal recognition and further stated 
the intervenor membership roll contains persons many of whom are of only degree indian blood.two have only samish blood.the tribe does not prohibit dual membership and at least one member is an officer of the lummi tribe.
the members of the intervenor samish tribe and their ancestors do not and have not lived as a continuous separate,distinct and cohesive indian cultural or political community.the present members have no common bond of residence or association other than such association as is attributable to the fact of their voluntary affiliation with the intervenor entity.
id.internal citations omitted.the court accordingly concluded that the samish tribe was not at this time a treaty tribe in the political sense within the meaning of washington i and did not presently hold for itself or its members fishing rights secured by any of the stevens treaties identified in washington i.id.at.the district court also concluded that o nly tribes recognized as indian political bodies by the united states may possess and exercise the tribal fishing rights secured and protected by the treaties of the united states.id.this last conclusion was surprising because it was wholly inconsistent with the district court ruling in washington i that two unrecognized tribes were entitled to treaty fishing rights.at.
on appeal,we affirmed the denial of treaty rights.united states washington,cir.we pointed out the district court error in stating that federal recognition is a prerequisite to the enjoyment of treaty rights t his conclusion is clearly contrary to our prior holding affirming washington i and is foreclosed by precedent.id.at.we nevertheless held that the district court factual findings supported the denial of relief 
t he district court specifically found that the appellants had not functioned since treaty times as continuous separate,distinct and cohesive indian cultural or political communit ies.
after close scrutiny,we conclude that the evidence supports this finding of fact.although the appellants now have constitutions and formal governments,the governments have not controlled the lives of the members.nor have the appellants clearly established the continuous informal cultural influence they concede is required.
id.at internal citation omitted second alteration in original 
federal recognition of the samish tribe treaty tribes denied intervention to oppose recognition 
the samish tribe first sought federal recognition in,but no action was taken on the application.in,the department of the interior adopted rules establishing a process for tribes to achieve federal recognition,known in the regulations as federal acknowledgment.procedures for establishing that an american indian group exists as an indian tribe,the samish tribe then filed a revised application.
on february,the department of the interior published a final determination that the samish indian tribe does not exist as an indian tribe.a major reason for the denial was that the tribe had failed to meet two mandatory requirements for recognition that a substantial portion of the petitioning group inhabits a specific area or lives in a community viewed as american indian and distinct from other populations in the area,and that its members are descendants of an indian tribe which historically inhabited a specific area and that the petitioner has maintained tribal political influence or other authority over its members as an autonomous entity throughout history until the present.at the department decision was made on the papers the regulation did not provide for a hearing and gave the applicant no right to see the submissions of others.
the samish tribe then brought an action in district court challenging the administrative denial of recognition.the tulalip tribes,which had treaty fishing rights,attempted to intervene on the ground that recognition of the samish tribe would threaten the tulalips treaty fishing rights.see greene i,at.the district court ruled that the samish tribe could not,in its challenge to denial of recognition,relitigate washington ii denial of treaty fishing rights.see id.the district court then denied intervention,and the tulalip tribes appealed.see id.at.
we upheld the denial of intervention,rejecting the tulalips argument that the factual inquiries underlying recognition were so similar to the inquiries underlying treaty rights that recognition was bound to affect treaty rights.we stated 
we recognize that the two inquiries are similar.yet each determination serves a different legal purpose and has an independent legal effect.federal recognition is not a threshold condition a tribe must establish to fish under the treaty of point elliott 
similarly,the samish need not assert treaty fishing rights to gain federal recognition even if they obtain federal tribal status,the samish would still have to confront the decisions in washington i and ii before they could claim fishing rights.federal recognition does not treaty rights claims.
meanwhile,the district court had ruled that the samish had been denied due process in the administrative proceeding,and remanded for a formal adjudication under the administrative procedure act.see greene lujan,no,wl.the secretary of the interior appealed that decision.the tulalip tribes,as amici curiae,again argued that recognition of the samish was barred by washington ii.we rejected that contention and affirmed the district court in greene ii.we stated 
our decision in greene united states,cir,can leave no serious doubt that our court regards the issues of tribal treaty status and federal acknowledgment as fundamentally different.we there held that the tulalip tribe was not entitled to intervene in this very litigation.we did so because the tulalip interest in preventing the samish from gaining treaty fishing rights was not affected by this litigation,involving federal tribal recognition or,as it is termed in the applicable regulation,acknowledgment.
greene ii,at.we further observed that we had denied intervention by the tulalip tribes in greene i because we disagreed with their position that samish success in the recognition case would undermine the finality of the washington ii decision.id.at.after further consideration of the merits,we then upheld the district court ruling that due process entitled the samish tribe to a hearing on its application for recognition.id.at.
in administrative proceedings that followed,an administrative law judge held that the samish tribe was entitled to federal recognition.the judge included several findings tracing the samish tribe history which supported the mandatory recognition criteria that the group has been identified as an american indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since,id.a the group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times until the present,id.b the tribe has maintained political influence or authority over its members,id.c and t he petitioner membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical indian tribe or from historical indian tribes which combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity,e.see greene iii.at.the assistant secretary of the interior,however,after an ex parte conference with a government lawyer and expert witness,approved the recognition of the samish tribe but deleted several of the crucial findings of the administrative law judge underlying the determination that the samish had met the regulatory requirements.see id.at samish recognition.at.
the samish tribe thereupon returned to district court,objecting to the deletion of the administrative law judge findings.the district court held the ex parte contacts to be unlawful,and reinstated the disputed findings of the administrative law judge.greene iii.at 
the samish tribe moves to reopen the treaty rights denial washington iii.
in,armed with its federal recognition,the samish tribe filed a motion in district court to reopen washington ii.see washington iii,at.the motion was filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,which provides that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment for certain specified reasons or,in a catchall provision,for any other reason that justifies relief.b.several tribes that currently hold treaty fishing rights the treaty tribes opposed the motion.washington iii,at.the district court denied relief.
the samish appealed,and we reversed.we recognized that the catchall provision of rule b has been used sparingly as an equitable remedy to prevent manifest injustice and is to be utilized only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a party from taking timely action to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.id.at quoting united states alpine land reservoir,cir.we held that,in light of the circumstances of the earlier denial of treaty rights for the samish tribe,its subsequent federal recognition was an extraordinary circumstance justifying rule b relief.id.at.the key point was not the recognition itself,but the factual findings underlying the recognition,notably the findings that the samish tribe has been continuously identified throughout history as indian or aboriginal,has existed as a distinct community since first sustained european contact,has maintained political influence within itself as an autonomous entity and that percent of its members are descendants of the historical samish tribe.id.at quoting.
we noted that,if the samish tribe had been recognized at the time it first sought an adjudication of treaty rights,it almost certainly would have succeeded.id.at.we further stated 
in light of the government excessive delays and misconduct in withholding of recognition from the samish,a circumstance beyond their control the government position in washington ii that federal recognition was necessary and that future federal recognition might justify revisiting the treaty rights issue and the district court erroneous conclusion that nonrecognition was decisive and wholesale adoption of the united states findings of fact in washington ii,we conclude that the samish were effectively prevented from proving their tribal status in a proper fashion.
id.alteration in original.we also noted 
although we have previously held that federal recognition is not necessary for the exercise of treaty fishing rights by a signatory tribe,we have never held that federal recognition is not a sufficient condition for the exercise of those rights.indeed,our precedent leads us to the inevitable conclusion that federal recognition is a sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights.
id.at.the reason,we said,was that treaty rights require that a signatory group has maintained an organized tribal structure from treaty times to the present,and recognition requires that a group be a distinct community that has existed from historical times to the present and maintained political influence or authority over its members during that time.id.at.because the samish were parties to the treaty,recognition of the samish tribe established that they were successors to the treaty status.id.at.
finally,we ruled that the district court concerns for the finality of judgments did not justify denial of the samish motion to reopen washington ii unlike a judgment between private parties,the allocation of natural resources between treaty tribes and others can not help but be an ongoing venture.id.at.we accordingly reversed the district court order and remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.id.
the district court decision on remand,now under review 
on remand after our decision in washington iii,the district court again denied the samish tribe motion to reopen washington ii.it recited at length the findings of washington ii that the present samish tribe had not maintained an organized tribal structure and was not a successor to the samish tribe that had secured treaty r
