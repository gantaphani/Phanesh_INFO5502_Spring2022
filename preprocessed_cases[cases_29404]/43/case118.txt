a jury convicted john michael jumping eagle on two counts of aggravated sexual abuse,within indian country,in violation of c,a,c,and.the victim was jumping eagle nephew,jumping eagle now appeals his conviction,raising numerous issues.for the reasons stated below,we reject jumping eagle contentions and affirm the district court 
background 
in,jumping eagle lived in manderson,south dakota,with his parents.during the summer,jumping eagle nephew,started regularly visiting his grandparents,jumping eagle parents.on these visits,would help one of his aunts with her children as well as play games with jumping eagle.at night,slept on a couch in his grandparents living room while jumping eagle slept on a different couch in the same room.
at trial,gave the following account.one night,while he was sleeping on the couch,he awoke to find his pants pulled down,and he felt someone or something inside of him.the feeling was painful.jumping eagle was on top of him,holding his mouth shut,preventing him from screaming.while jumping eagle held his hands,jumping eagle inserted something into his anus.he fought to get jumping eagle off of him,but to no avail.finally,however,he was able to let out a scream.when he screamed,jumping eagle got off him and returned to his couch.
after the assaults experienced mental,emotional,and physical problems.for instance,he began feeling sad and unhappy and also experienced encopresis,or involuntary defecation.eventually told his mother what jumping eagle had done,after which mother took him to a doctor and a social service worker called the police.approximately two weeks after told his mother,he visited black hills pediatrics,where lori strong evaluated him for signs of sexual assault.before strong examined,lora hawkins,a forensic investigator,interviewed.in this interview,stated that jumping eagle sexually assaulted him on several occasions while he was visiting his grandparents.
soon after disclosed the sexual abuse to his mother,fbi special agent richard lauck interviewed jumping eagle in manderson.jumping eagle initially denied allegations,but later confessed to digitally penetrating anus in the mistaken belief that was his girlfriend.at the conclusion of the interview,jumping eagle memorialized his confession in writing.several weeks after jumping eagle confessed to agent lauck,fbi special agent kelly kenser interviewed jumping eagle.during this interview,jumping eagle again admitted to digitally penetrating anus.jumping eagle also confessed to placing his penis on buttocks and inserting it into anus.at agent kenser behest,jumping eagle agreed to repeat his confession while agent kenser tape recorded it.on tape,jumping eagle only admitted to placing his penis on buttocks.
following the fbi investigation,a grand jury indicted jumping eagle on two counts of aggravated sexual abuse.jumping eagle pled not guilty,and after a trial,the petit jury convicted jumping eagle on both counts.jumping eagle now appeals his conviction,arguing the district court erred by abandoning its gatekeeping function and admitting expert testimony that speculated as to causation by admitting two different hearsay statements when it permitted the government to employ several improper impeachment techniques by permitting the government to make certain remarks during its closing argument,denying him a fair trial and when it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal.because we find that the district court did not commit reversible error,we affirm.
ii.discussion 
expert witness 
jumping eagle first challenges the district court decision to admit strong expert testimony.he argues that the district court failed to require the government to establish an adequate foundation for strong testimony about the cause of encopresis.we disagree.
we review a district court ruling admitting expert testimony under federal rule of evidence for an abuse of discretion.in re air crash at little rock,on june,cir.rule permits a district court to admit the testimony of a witness whose knowledge,skill,training,experience,or education will assist a trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue,if the testimony is both relevant and reliable.daubert merrell dow,d.there is,however,no requirement that the district court always hold a daubert hearing before qualifying an expert witness under rule.united states evans,cir.
in child sexual abuse cases,a qualified expert can inform the jury of characteristics in sexually abused children and describe the characteristics the alleged victim exhibits.united states kirkie,cir internal quotations omitted.an expert can also summarize the medical evidence and express an opinion that the evidence is consistent or inconsistent with the victim allegations of sexual abuse.id.at.an expert,however,can not express an opinion that sexual abuse has in fact occurred or vouch for the victim.id.
in the instant case,the government designated strong as its expert,and during a conference,jumping eagle asked the district court to exclude her testimony regarding certain medical conditions suffered by,such as whether the sexual abuse caused encopresis,or in the alternative,to hold a daubert hearing to ascertain whether strong testimony regarding causation was supported by reasonable medical certainty.the district court denied both requests and allowed strong to testify.
strong testified that had no abnormalities in his penis area or in his anal area,but that this lack of abnormalities was not inconsistent with statement that the last assault occurred nearly three months earlier.strong also testified that encopresis is a nonspecific historical finding of abuse,meaning there are other reasons encopresis may occur.strong further testified that when a child exhibits a litany of nonspecific findings of abuse,such as problems at school,fighting,encopresis,and characteristics become concerned that the underlying problem may be less dietary and more emotionally based or tied to abuse.strong never stated that sexual abuse occurred in this case or that encopresis was caused by sexual assault rather,she only provided testimony regarding characteristics of sexually abused children in general and how they compared with the characteristics exhibited by.this is allowed under our precedent.see,kirkie,at united states whitted,cir.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting strong testimony.
evidentiary issues 
jumping eagle also challenges several of the district court other evidentiary rulings.a district court has broad discretion in the admission of evidence and we will overturn its decisions only if it abuses its discretion.united states beason,cir.when,however,a defendant fails to object to the admission of evidence at trial,we review for plain error.united states pirani,cir en banc.under review,the defendant has the burden to prove that there was error,that was plain,and that affected substantial rights.id.citing united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,we may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
jumping eagle next evidentiary challenge relates to the district court failure to exclude two hearsay statements,neither of which were objected to when offered.a hearsay statement is a statement other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.unless a hearsay statement falls within an exception,it is generally inadmissible at trial.thus,the unfettered admission of a hearsay statement is usually error.nevertheless,it is fundamental that where a defendant opens the door or invites error,there can be no reversible error.beason,at.accordingly,we have allowed the use of otherwise inadmissible evidence,including hearsay statements,to clarify,rebut,or complete an issue opened up by defense counsel on.id.
the first hearsay statement involves an conversation between and his mother,mandy,during which told his mother about the sexual abuse.jumping eagle first brought up this conversation during mandy,when he queried told you that this had happened over times to him,did he during redirect of mandy,the government asked her what had told her about the abuse.jumping eagle inquiry of mandy,opened the door,permitting further evidence of the conversation between mandy and.as a result,the district court did not commit reversible error by admitting the testimony.
the second hearsay statement involves double hearsay specifically,statement to a forensic investigator about the type of sexual abuse that occurred in this case.the forensic investigator repeated statement to special agent lauck,who testified at trial.the government again contends jumping eagle first opened the door.while this presents a close evidentiary issue,we are inclined to agree with the government.during special agent lauck,jumping eagle questioned agent lauck about how he got jumping eagle to confess in the face of jumping eagle initial denials.lauck responded that he was able to do so because he articulated to jumping eagle the evidence he had gathered that caused him to believe jumping eagle assaulted.this evidence,he stated,included interview with the forensic interviewer,during which described the sexual abuse.later during agent lauck,jumping eagle inquired u p until then you had been talking to him jumping eagle about more specifically than just sexual contact,that,i t was alleged that you jumping eagle had anal sex with your jumping eagle penis his anus as a result of the questions jumping eagle posed to agent lauck during his,jumping eagle opened the door to the government question w hat type of sexual abuse had described in that forensic interview the district court may well have prohibited an answer to this inquiry without committing error.but,on the other hand,under the circumstances,the court did not plainly err by admitting statement.
confrontation clause 
regarding the second hearsay statement to the forensic eagle also makes a confrontation clause challenge.because jumping eagle did not raise a confrontation clause objection to this testimony at trial,we review for plain error.united states rodriguez,cir.
the confrontation clause bars the admission at trial of the testimonial statements of a witness who is absent from trial,unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity to him.crawford washington,d.a defendant right to confront and witnesses against him,under the confrontation clause,applies to those who bear testimony against him,which is typically a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.id.at.alteration in original internal quotations omitted.thus,only testimonial statements implicate a defendant confrontation rights.statements made to a forensic interviewer are testimonial statements.united states bordeaux,cir.statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial.id.
here,even if the district court erred by admitting statements to the forensic investigator by way of agent lauck trial testimony,we need not reverse,as jumping eagle failed to make a showing of prejudice.indeed,the original declarant,appeared at trial,and was subject to about his statements to the forensic interviewer.what is more,jumping eagle also on a number of other issues.in short,jumping eagle confrontation clause claim fails.
impeachment 
jumping eagle next argues that the government improperly impeached him and another defense witness.we also review a district court ruling on the admissibility of impeachment evidence for an abuse of discretion.united states headbird,cir.under federal rules of evidence and,district courts have discretion to limit or block questioning that is unfairly prejudicial,beyond the scope of direct examination,or unrelated to credibility.
regarding the government impeachment of jumping eagle,jumping eagle contends the government tried to prejudice the jury against him by improperly questioning him about drinking alcohol before being injured in a car accident and his failure to cooperate with authorities in the prosecution of the other car driver.jumping eagle challenges this line of questioning under federal rules of evidence and.
here,the district court did not err in permitting the government questioning of jumping eagle regarding the accident.under rule,whenever a defendant testifies at trial,his credibility becomes relevant.see united states new,cir.during jumping eagle direct examination,he testified that he had never met an fbi agent.on,the government questioned whether this testimony was true.specifically,the government asked if he met special agent bill grode when he was in the hospital for injuries relating to the car accident.jumping eagle replied that he had,but that he did not know agent grode was with the fbi.the government then queried whether jumping eagle was drunk the night he spoke with agent grode.the district court properly allowed this line of questioning.it related to jumping eagle credibility,specifically his perception of events on the night of the car accident.moreover,because jumping eagle mentioned the accident and that he had never met an fbi agent before this case,the government questioning was appropriate to correct the jury impression that jumping eagle had never before dealt with an fbi agent.see united states womochil,cir holding the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the government to clarify the false impression created by the defendant on.
as to jumping eagle rule argument,he did not properly preserve it.a general objection to relevance is not sufficient to preserve an objection under rule.united states mejia,cir.jumping eagle trial counsel made a general relevance objection,he did not specifically object under rule.thus,we review for plain error.jumping eagle has not shown how his substantial rights were affected by the district court ruling admitting this testimony therefore,his claim fails.
jumping eagle also challenges the district court ruling permitting the government line of questioning regarding the propriety of inserting a finger into a female anus.he challenges this testimony only under rule.the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing this inquiry.on direct examination,jumping eagle testified that he told agent lauck he inserted his finger in anus because he thought it was his girlfriend.on its of jumping eagle,the government questioned jumping eagle on the propriety of inserting a finger into a female anus.as the government questioning could help the jury assess the credibility of jumping eagle statement to agent lauck about why he assaulted,the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the interrogation.
next,jumping eagle contends the government failed to follow federal rule of evidence in its impeachment of defense witness,phillip labatt.specifically,jumping eagle argues that the government improperly questioned labatt by asking whether he had been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude,failed to give proper notice of its intention to use a prior conviction,and failed to give the district court an opportunity to apply a rule analysis.
rule allows a party to offer evidence of a witness prior conviction for purposes of attacking the witness character for truthfulness,if the prior conviction was for a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the applicable law.and if the conviction or the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction occurred more than ten years before trial,the court must determine whether the probative value of the conviction,supported by specific facts and circumstances,substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect,and the party offering the evidence must give his opponent advance written notice.id.
here,without the foundation required by rule,the government inquired of labatt whether he had been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude.this was error.but because jumping eagle did not object at trial,we review for plain error.in this regard,jumping eagle fails to show or even argue that his substantial rights were affected.what is more,evidenc
