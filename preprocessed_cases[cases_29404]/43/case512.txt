citizen potawatomi nation citizen potawatomi,a federally recognized indian tribe located in the western district of oklahoma,brought this action which the tribe termed as one for a mandatory injunction in the nature of mandamus against federal officials of the united states department of the interior challenging their methods for calculating funding the citizen potawatomi nation receives under its tribal compact.subject matter jurisdiction was asserted under in that the action was brought by an indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the secretary of the interior and the matter in controversy arises under the constitution,laws or treaties of the united states.the complaint also presented an action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the united states to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.
defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the citizen potawatomi are unable to join three necessary and indispensable parties,tribal participants in the funding agreement.the district court agreed and granted the motion.this timely appeal ensued.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
background 
under the indian and education assistance act,et,the united states is authorized to enter into compacts with tribes.pursuant to that act,tribes do not contract to take over specific programs rather,tribes assume comprehensive responsibility for the planning and administration of programs and services previously provided by the united states.essentially,the act provides for tribal.
once the united states enters into a compact with a tribe,the parties ordinarily negotiate an annual funding agreement.in,however,five tribes within the shawnee agency of the bureau of indian affairs negotiated a formula among themselves for dividing future federal appropriations.those tribes included the citizen potawatomi,the shawnee tribe,the kickapoo tribe of oklahoma,the sac fox nation,and the iowa tribe of oklahoma.under their formula,the tribes agreed to divide percent of the funding equally percent in proportion to total tribal enrollment percent in proportion to resident tribal enrollment within each tribe jurisdictional area and percent of the funds in proportion to the amount of trust property in each tribe jurisdiction.the united states used this formula to determine the amount of funding awarded to the tribes in their annual funding agreements.
on september,the citizen potawatomi brought this action against defendants challenging the methods they use for determining the citizen potawatomi funding.specifically,the citizen potawatomi challenge the determination that the shawnee tribe and the citizen potawatomi share the same service area and,therefore,the funds provided to that area the determination that the formula is static and does not change as the data change the refusal of defendants to fund certain items of the citizen potawatomi that defendants claim are residual and defendants interpretation of a moratorium clause,which defendants allege prevents them from fully funding the citizen potawatomi.
after the citizen potawatomi filed this lawsuit,defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the citizen potawatomi had not,and could not,join as parties to the action the other tribal participants in the funding agreement the defendants argued that because those tribes were indispensable,the court should dismiss the action pursuant to.a.the district court agreed and rejected the citizen potawatomi contention that the evidence had not been sufficiently developed for the court to rule on the motion.
the court first noted that under rule,it must determine whether the absent tribes are necessary if they are necessary,whether joinder is feasible and if not,whether the absent tribes are indispensable.applying this test,the district court ruled that the absent tribes were necessary because complete relief was not possible without them since as a result of the action and a possible increase in plaintiff funding allocation,the remaining tribes would suffer detriment from which they may seek collateral relief from the plaintiff or the defendants and because the absent tribes had an interest in the funding allocations.order granting motions to dismiss at,ii app.at.further,the district court ruled that joinder was not feasible because the absent parties possessed sovereign immunity.finally,the absent tribes were indispensable because they would suffer substantial prejudice if the action proceeded without them there was no way to lessen the prejudice a judgment without the tribes would be inadequate and the citizen potawatomi nation was said to have an adequate alternative remedy in congress.see order at,ii app.at.accordingly,the district court granted the motions to dismiss.

the question of whether an absent party is necessary indispensable is resolved by applying rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.sac and fox nation of missouri norton,cir quoting davis,at.rule provides a process for determining whether an action should be dismissed for failure to join a purportedly indispensable party.united states bowen,cir.first,the court must determine whether the absent person is necessary.a person is necessary if 
in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.

if the absent person is necessary,the court must then determine whether joinder is feasible.see.a b.in the instant case,the citizen potawatomi do not dispute the district court ruling that joinder of the absent tribes was not feasible because the tribes possess sovereign immunity.see fletcher united states,cir indian tribes are domestic dependent nations that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their members and territories as an aspect of this sovereign immunity,suits against tribes are barred in the absence of an unequivocally expressed waiver by the tribe or abrogation by congress.citing oklahoma tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of oklahoma,d.
finally,if joinder is not feasible,the court must decide whether the absent person is indispensable,whether in equity and good conscience the action can continue in his absence.the factors the court considers include 
f irst,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
