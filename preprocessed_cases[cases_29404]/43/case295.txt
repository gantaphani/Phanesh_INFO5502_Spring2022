in this opinion we resolve whether the overtime provisions of the fair labor standards act flsa apply to a retail business located on an indian reservation and owned by indian tribal members.we also resolve whether appellee the secretary of labor for the united states department of labor the secretary has the authority to enter the indian reservation to inspect the books of that business.finally,we resolve whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to appoint a receiver for the retail business in the event the overtime payments were not made.
we conclude that the overtime requirements of the flsa apply to the retail business at issue in this case.because the flsa applies to the retail business,we conclude that the secretary had the authority to enter the indian reservation to audit the books of the business,as she would regularly do with respect to any private business.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court on these two issues.
we conclude that the district court decision with respect to the automatic appointment of a receiver over the retail business in the event the overtime payments were not made was premature.we therefore vacate that portion of the judgment.
background 
the parties stipulated to the underlying facts of this case.
baby zack smoke shop 
appellant paul matheson is a member of the puyallup tribe.the puyallup tribe is a pacific northwest indian tribe that has a reservation in the state of washington.paul matheson owns and operates a retail store known as baby zack smoke shop baby zack,located on trust land within the puyallup indian reservation.appellant baby zack sells tobacco products and sundries to indians and.some of the goods sold by baby zack have been shipped in from locations outside the state of washington.baby zack accepts credit card and debit card payments and uses electronic or telephonic means of communication to banks and credit card companies located outside of the state of washington.baby zack regularly employs both indian and workers.
in and,baby zack had an annual gross volume of sales of not less than.paul and nick matheson are employers within the meaning of the flsa.if the flsa applies,the amount of wages due to employees and former employees is.
b.the medicine creek treaty 
the puyallup tribe entered into a treaty in the known as the treaty of medicine creek.the treaty of medicine creek provides that the tribes and bands agree to free all slaves now held by them,and not to purchase or acquire others hereafter.the treaty of medicine creek also provides that certain lands are for exclusive use of the indians,nor shall any white man be permitted to reside upon the same without permission of the tribe and the superintendent or agent.
procedural history 
the secretary subpoenaed the books of baby zack and determined that the mathesons had failed to pay overtime wages to its employees,as required by the flsa.the secretary filed suit and a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment,finding that the flsa applied to the mathesons.
the district court later entered judgment the judgment concluding that the flsa applied to the mathesons,and their failure to pay overtime wages violated the flsa.the judgment provided that the mathesons were enjoined from violating the flsa,they must pay in overtime wages,and if they failed to do so,the court would appoint a receiver from a list of potential receivers provided by the secretary or one of its own choosing,and the mathesons would be required to pay the costs of the receiver.in addition,the judgment stated that the receiver would have full authority to collect assets and report findings,redeem or liquidate assets,turn over proceeds,and prevent waste or fraud.
the mathesons appealed both the decision regarding the applicability of the flsa and the automatic appointment of a receiver upon the failure to pay,which was set forth for the first time in the secretary proposed judgment.

discussiona.the application of the flsa to the mathesons 
the mathesons argue that the flsa does not apply in this instance because they qualify for either or both the intramural affairs exception set forth in donovan coeur tribal farm,cir,or the treaty rights exception.we disagree.
the central aim of the flsa is to achieve certain minimum labor standards,such as overtime requirements,with respect to industries engaged in commerce.the flsa is a statute of general applicability,snyder navajo nation,cir citation omitted,that is to be construed liberally.klem county of santa clara,cir.congress did not expressly make the flsa applicable to indian tribes.reich great lakes indian fish wildlife comm n,cir.the issue in this case is whether,as a statute of general applicability,the flsa applies to the mathesons business,which is owned and run by tribal members and located on the tribe reservation.
indian tribes have a special status as sovereigns with limited powers.indian tribes are dependent on,and subordinate to the federal government,yet retain powers of.see washington confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation,d macarthur san juan county,cir,cert.denied,d.however,those powers may be limited,modified,or eliminated by congress.santa clara pueblo martinez,d.
the tribes retained sovereignty reaches only that power needed to control internal relations,preserve their own unique customs and social order,and prescribe and enforce rules of conduct for their own members.toward this end,the supreme court has recognized that a tribe may regulate any internal conduct which threatens the political integrity,the economic security,or the health or welfare of the tribe.

indians and their tribes are equally subject to statutes of general applicability,just as any other united states citizen.coeur,at fed.power comm tuscarora indian nation,d.however,a statute of general applicability that is silent on the issue of applicability to indian tribes,like the flsa,does not apply to indian tribes if 
the law touches exclusive rights of in purely intramural matters the application of the law to the tribe would abrogate rights guaranteed by indian treaties or there is proof by legislative history or some other means that congress intended the law not to apply to indians on their reservations.in any of these three situations,congress must expressly apply a statute to indians before we will hold that it reaches them.
coeur,at citations,quotation marks,brackets,and ellipses omitted.the mathesons assert that the first exception known as the intramural affairs exception,or the second exception known as the treaty rights exception,applies in this case.
and intramural affairs exception 
t he tribal exception is designed to except purely intramural matters such as conditions of tribal membership,inheritance rules,and domestic relations from the general rule that otherwise applicable federal statutes apply to indian tribes.coeur,at citation omitted.although these are not the only matters which could be covered by this exception,exemptions have been allowed only in those rare circumstances where the immediate ramifications of the conduct are felt primarily within the reservation by members of the tribe and where is clearly implicated.snyder,at.
the only case in this circuit regarding the applicability of the flsa to indian tribes is the snyder case.in snyder,this court addressed whether tribal law enforcement officers who enforced the law on an indian reservation were entitled to overtime payments pursuant to the flsa.id.at.this court held that law enforcement was an appropriate activity to exempt as intramural because it was a traditional governmental function,and the flsa contained an express exemption for state and local officers in k,o.id.at.this court also found that although the officers traveled outside of the reservation to provide information or to testify in a court,they did 
so because of a crime that occurred on the reservation or directly affected the interests of the tribal community.thus,such services performed nevertheless relate primarily to tribal and remain part of exempt intramural activities.such travel does not relate to any purpose.nor does it provide primary benefits to persons with no interest or stake in tribal government.indeed,none of the officers official travel is aimed at benefiting any private organization or nonmember.employed by an arm of the tribal government,officers serve the tribe governmental need for law enforcement to promote the welfare of the tribe and its members.
id.at citation omitted see also great lakes,at holding that law enforcement officers were exempt from overtime requirements of flsa because they performed governmental functions.
while there is no case directly on point in this circuit,there are cases both from this circuit and others deciding the applicability of other federal employment statutes to indian tribes.in coeur,this court recognized that the occupational safety and health act osha is a statute of general applicability,and that it applied to a farm wholly owned and operated by the coeur indian tribe,located entirely within the indian reservation.coeur,at.this court recognized that the tribe had the inherent sovereign right to regulate the health and safety of workers in tribal enterprises.but neither wa s there any doubt that congress has the power to modify or extinguish that right.unlike the states,indian tribes possess only a limited sovereignty that is subject to complete defeasance.id.at citations omitted.this court,therefore,found that none of the exceptions applied because the farm was a commercial enterprise that produced grain and lentils exclusively for sale on the open market in interstate commerce,and because the farm employed workers.id.at.thus,the farm activities were neither profoundly intramural,nor essential to.id.
the tribe in coeur had argued that under their rights to and to exclude,they could exclude osha inspectors as part of their fundamental aspect of tribal sovereignty that can not be infringed without a clear expression of congressional intent.id.at.this court stated that it had never employed this fundamental aspect of sovereignty formulation of the tribal exception to the general rule that federal statutes ordinarily apply to indians,and declined to do so for the coeur tribe.id.internal quotation omitted.
in eeoc karuk tribe housing authority,cir,this court found that the age discrimination in employment act adea did not apply to an employment relationship between the karuk tribe housing authority,a tribal governmental employer,and a tribe member,because it touched on purely internal matters related to the tribe.the dispute did not concern or as employers,employees,customers,or anything else.id.at.this court noted that t he housing authority functions as an arm of the tribal government and in a governmental role.it is not simply a business entity that happens to be run by a tribe or its members,but,rather,occupies a role quintessentially related to.id.at.
unlike the housing authority in the karuk tribe case,nlrb chapa de indian health program,cir,involved a financially independent,nonprofit organization of the rumsey tribe that contracted to provide health services to members of the tribe as well as others,and operated outside of the reservation.the organization argued that the national labor relations act nlra did not apply to its activities because providing health care services to tribal members was purely intramural.id.at.this court found that the activities were not exempt from provisions of the nlra because the organization itself was not a tribe and even if the rumsey tribe terminated its funding of the organization,the organization would have other resources available to operate.id.at.in addition,the health care facilities were not located on indian land,and nearly half of the patients and the nonprofessional employees involved in the controversy were.id.this court stated that the patients and employees cut against the organization claim that its activities touch rights of on a purely intramural matter.id.finally,none of the organization board members were members of the tribe and the organization did not argue that its labor relations were intramural activities related to.in light of these circumstances,this court held that applying the nlra does not clearly appear to touch on purely intramural matters that affect the right to.id.
other cases have similarly affirmed the application of osha,the employee retirement income security act erisa,and the americans with disabilities act ada to tribal businesses.see dep t of labor occupational safety health review comm n,cir finding tribal lumber mill employer subject to osha because it employ ed a significant number of americans and sold virtually all of its finished product to americans through channels of interstate commerce mashantucket sand gravel,at finding that osha applied to construction business lumber indus.pension fund warm springs forest prods,cir holding that erisa,as a statute of general applicability,applied to a tribally owned and operated sawmill because t he exception applies only where the tribe power is usurped,and p ermitting the fund to sue the mill under erisa will not usurp the tribe power smart state farm ins,cir applying erisa to health care facility owned and operated by tribe and located on tribal land.paraplegic ass n,miccosukee tribe of indians of,cir holding that ada public accommodation requirements could apply to restaurant and gaming business run by an indian tribe because the business did not relate to the governmental functions of the tribe,nor d id it operate exclusively within the domain of the tribe and its members.
the mathesons rely on united states lara,d,asserting that it stands for the proposition that as sovereign entities with power over their members,tribes possess inherent power to control events that occur on their land.the mathesons also assert that lara stands for the proposition that congress could not enact laws modifying tribal inherent power.
the mathesons reliance is misplaced.the lara case dealt with the inherent tribal authority to prosecute tribe members.see id.at.the supreme court in lara held that congress possessed the power to lift restrictions on tribes criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians.id.at.the lara case did not hold that tribes possess inherent power to control events that occur on their land or that congress could not enact laws modifying that power.indeed,as noted above,the supreme court has held that congress has plenary authority to limit,modify or eliminate the powers of local which the tribes otherwise possess.santa clara pueblo,at.citation omitted.the mathesons fail to provide an appropriate analogy between the lara case and the instant case,and we find none.
the mathesons also assert that the lara case aligns with the earlier case from the tenth circuit,nlrb pueblo of san juan,cir.the tenth circuit in pueblo of san juan determined whether in light of the constitution supremacy clause and congress plenary power over indian affairs,the nlra prevents through the pueblo from enacting a law or entering into a lease with provisions making prohibitions similar to those in laws.id.at.
the mathesons reliance on this case is also misplaced because the general applicability of the nlra was not at issue.id.at.additionally,the pueblo had exercised its sovereign authority by enacting a labor regulation.id.at.the pueblo was not acting in a proprietary capacity,such as an employer or landlord.id.at.the tenth circuit found that as an indian tribe,the pueblo retain ed the sovereign power to enact its ordinance,and to enter into the lease agreement with provisions,because congress has not made a clear retrenchment of such tribal power as is required to do so validly.id.
here,although the supreme court has found that indian tribes have a strong interest as a sovereign in regulating economic activity involving its own members within its own territory and may enact laws governing such activity,see pueblo of san juan,at citing merrion jicarilla apache tribe,d,the mathesons do not argue that the puyallup tribe enacted a different wage and hour law that applied in place of the flsa,nor do they assert that the flsa does not preempt any such law.see great lakes,at stating that if the chippewa had a treaty right to employ law enforcement officers on any terms,the fair labor standards act would be presumed not to abrogate the right by forcing the great lakes indian fish and wildlife commission to pay time and a half for overtime.thus,there is no evidence in the record that the puyallup tribe has acted on its right of in the field of wage and hours laws and specifically with respect to overtime.
because the puyallup tribe has not enacted wage and hour laws,the holdings of the cases discussed above lead this court to conclude that the overtime provisions of the flsa apply to the mathesons and the intramural affairs exception does not.baby zack is a purely commercial enterprise engaged in interstate commerce selling goods to and employing.see mashantucket sand gravel,at e mployment of weighs heavily against its claim that its activities affect rights of in purely intramural matters.in general,tribal relations with fall outside the normal ambit of tribal when a tribal operation affects open markets,it is unlikely that the operation is purely intramural.unlike many of the businesses in the cases discussed above,baby zack is not a tribal business,although it is owned by tribe members.therefore,the district court finding that the intramural exception does not apply because there is nothing profoundly intramural or involving about the employment of indians and by a retail business engaged in interstate commerce is affirmed.
treaty rights exception 
the mathesons next argue that the treaty of medicine creek addresses employment rights and payment of overtime,although crudely,because the treaty states that t he said tribes and bands agree to free all slaves now held by them,and not to purchase or acquire others hereafter.
indian treaties are deemed the legal equivalent of federal statutes and they can therefore be modified or even abrogated by congress nevertheless,the presumption is that a statute does not modify or abrogate indian treaty rights.great lakes,at citing united states dion,d,and washington.state commercial passenger fishing vessel ass n,d.
the text of a treaty must be construed as the indians would naturally have understood it at the time of the treaty,with doubtful or ambiguous expressions resolved in the indians favor.united states smiskin,cir.ambiguities in tribal treaties are construed liberally to favor native americans and to respect traditional notions of native american sovereignty.occupational safety health review comm n,at.
in smiskin,this court distinguished its findings in a previous case,united states baker,cir,which analyzed a different section of the medicine creek treaty than is at issue in the present case.baker involved members of the puyallup tribe who trafficked in unstamped cigarettes without obtaining prior approval from the state of washington,in violation of washington administrative code section.the cigarettes were therefore unauthorized under state law and contraband under the ccta contraband cigarette trafficking act.smiskin,at.
the smiskin opinion noted that the medicine creek treaty provided only that t he said tribes and bands finally agree not to trade at vanzcouver island,or elsewhere out of the dominions of the united states.at citation omitted.the relevant part of the treaty did not expressly grant any right to the puyallup tribe and was ambiguous regarding any trading right.id.in stark contrast,the yakama treaty,which is a different treaty with a different tribe,expressly granted the right to travel.id.therefore,this court found that the ccta would certainly be an impermissible restriction on the yakamas right to travel if the government could rely on it to enforce against tribal members a state fee on the transport of unstamped cigarettes.id.emphasis in original.
great lakes involved treaties that covered thirteen chippewa indian tribes that inhabit the great lakes region.great lakes,at.the great lakes indian fish and wildlife commission the commission supervised the activities and enforced the rights retained by the treaties,including hunting and fishing.id.the commission did not pay time and half for overtime to its officers.id.at.the department of labor sought enforcement of a subpoena seeking evidence that the commission was in violation of the flsa.id.in order to determine whether the subpoena could be enforced,and whether the department had jurisdiction to regulate wages of the commission,the seventh circuit reviewed the treaties at issue.the seventh circuit determined that the treaties contained only rights to hunt,fish and gather.id.at.the treaties did not mention a system for enforcing those rights,or contain any reference to terms of employment of those hired to enforce it.id.therefore,the court focused on the flsa itself and its exemption for state and local law enforcement officers.id.
here,there is nothing in the medicine creek treaty directly on point discussing employment or wages and hours.moreover,the language regarding freeing all slaves is not so ambiguous that it could be construed to cover the payment of required wages.therefore,the application of the overtime provisions of the flsa to a retail business such as baby zack does not impact the tribe agreement that it would free all slaves.
relying on montana united states,d,the mathesons additionally argue that their treaty right to occupy and exclude gives them a right to regulate employment relationships with those members who consent to employment by tribal members.
a hallmark of indian sovereignty is the power to exclude from indian lands merrion,at.in montana,the supreme court stated that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.at.this is because the exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes.id.at.
to be sure,indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over on their reservations,even on fee lands.a tribe may regulate,through taxation,licensing,or other means,the activities of who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,through commercial dealing,contracts,leases,or other arrangements.a tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity,the economic security,or the health or welfare of the tribe.
id.at.citations omitted.
as was the case in montana,here also,n o such circumstances are involved in this case.id.at.first,there is no evidence that the puyallup tribe asserted regulatory authority over employment and wages for.see macarthur,at montana only applies insofar as the tribe in question is seeking to assert regulatory authority over the activities of a nonmember.the mathesons only argument in this regard is that they were issued a business license by the tribe.such information,however,is not in the record.even if it were,the issuance of a license to do business does not mean that the puyallup tribe has sought to regulate wages and hours of employees.
second,there is no evidence that the employed at baby zack entered into any agreements or dealings with the puyallup tribe that would subject the to tribal civil jurisdiction.finally,the mathesons have not alleged that requiring payment of time and a half for overtime imperils the welfare of the tribe.we
