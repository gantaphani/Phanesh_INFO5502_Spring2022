tribal issues consumer financial protection bureau 
the panel affirmed the district court decision compelling tribal lending entities to comply with civil investigative demands issued by the consumer financial protection bureau.
the tribal entities are lending companies created by the chippewa cree,tunica biloxi and otoe missouria tribes the tribes.the bureau initiated an investigation into the tribal lending entities to determine whether lenders violated federal consumer financial laws.the tribes directed the tribal lending entities not to respond to the investigative demands.
the panel held that the consumer financial protection act was a law of general applicability,and it applied to tribal businesses,like the tribal lending entities involved in this appeal.the panel further held that congress did not expressly exclude tribes from the bureau enforcement authority.the panel also held that none of the three exceptions in donovan coeur tribal farms,cir,to the enforcement of generally applicable laws against indian tribes applied to this case.the panel concluded that the district court properly held that the bureau did not plainly lack jurisdiction to issue investigative demands to the tribal corporate entities under the act.
appellants great plains lending,llc,mobiloans,llc,and plain green,llc collectively,tribal lending entities appeal from the district court decision compelling the tribal lending entities to comply with civil investigative demands investigative demands issued by appellee consumer financial protection bureau bureau.the tribal lending entities maintain that they are not subject to the bureau jurisdiction because the entities were created and operated by several recognized tribes,and are thereby cloaked in tribal sovereign immunity.the tribal lending entities assert that,because the consumer financial protection act of the act defines the term state as including native american tribes,the tribal lending entities,as arms of sovereign tribes,are not required to comply with the investigative demands.we disagree with the argument made by the tribal lending entities that the inclusion of tribes in the act definition of state impliedly excludes the tribal lending entities from regulation under the act,and therefore affirm the decision of the district court enforcing the investigative demands.
background 
this appeal stems from the creation of several tribal lending entities as lending companies by the chippewa cree,tunica biloxi,and otoe missouria tribes collectively,tribes.the tribes established regulatory frameworks for consumer lending by these tribal lending entities.
in addition to regulation by the tribes,the tribal lending entities came to the attention of the bureau,which initiated an investigation into the tribal lending entities by serving investigative demands.the bureau explained that 
the purpose of this investigation is to determine whether online lenders or other unnamed persons have engaged or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices relating to the advertising,marketing,provision,or collection of loan products,in violation of section of the wall street reform and consumer protection act,the truth in lending act,the electronic funds transfer act,the act,or any other federal consumer financial law.the purpose of this investigation is also to determine whether bureau action to obtain legal or equitable relief would be in the public interest.
the tribes directed the tribal lending entities not to respond to the investigative demands,and informed the bureau that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate lending entities created and operated by the tribes.rather,the tribes offered to cooperate with the bureau as of consumer lending services.
when the offer of cooperative regulation was rejected by the bureau,the tribes petitioned the bureau to set aside the investigative demands.the bureau denied the tribes petition,and sought enforcement of the investigative demands in federal court.the district court then issued an order to show cause as to why the tribal lending entities should not comply with the investigative demands.
relying primarily on our ruling in donovan coeur tribal farms,cir,the district court concluded that the act,as an act of general applicability,was enforceable against the tribal lending entities.the district court rejected the tribal lending entities reliance on the holding in vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,that the statutory definition of the term person typically excludes the sovereign.the district court noted the unlikelihood that stevens overruled subsequent ninth circuit authority restating the holding in coeur.instead,the district court found it persuasive that t he stevens and coeur presumptions have existed side by side for decades without so much as a suggestion of an inescapable conflict between them.the district court reasoned that the cases were indeed reconcilable because the supreme court had not definitively held that the holding in stevens applied to actions brought by the federal government against the sovereign.
the district court was also not swayed by the tribes argument that,because the act treats the states and tribes as,congress did not intend to vest authority in the bureau to regulate tribal entities in the absence of cooperation with tribal regulators.the district court emphasized that 
textually,the act is not silent with respect to indian tribes.the exclusion of statutes that are not silent with respect to indian tribes is intended to avoid undermining the expressed intent of congress.congress does not express such intent by merely mentioning indian tribes as sovereign regulators,while remaining silent on whether the unrelated provision at issue is also intended to regulate indian tribes.
put simply,there is no provision of the act that expressly or impliedly suggests that the defined terms persons and states are mutually exclusive.accordingly,the provision creating the bureau authority to investigate persons is silent with respect to the tribes.
finally,the district court referenced the lack of any convincing legislative history bearing on the issue.
following the district court denying the tribal lending entities petition to set aside the bureau investigative demands,the tribal lending entities filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo whether the bureau plainly lacked jurisdiction to issue the investigative demands.see labor relations bd.chapa de indian health program,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the bureau jurisdiction to investigate the tribal lending entities activities 
consistent with their argument before the district court,the tribal lending entities contend on appeal that the act does not confer authority upon the bureau to investigate tribal entities.the tribal lending entities repeat their assertion that the act limits the bureau authority to persons,which excludes sovereign entities.the tribal lending entities add that congress did not intend for the definition of person to encompass tribal entities because the act explicitly includes tribes in the definition of state in.
before we address the merits of the tribal lending entities arguments,a delineation of the act statutory framework is in order.pursuant to the expressed statutory purpose of the act 
the bureau shall seek to implement and,where applicable,enforce federal consumer financial law consistently for the purpose of ensuring that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair,transparent,and competitive.
a.the primary functions of the bureau include collecting,investigating,and responding to consumer complaints,and,to accomplish its objectives,t he bureau is authorized to exercise its authorities under federal consumer financial law to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair,deceptive,or abusive acts and practices and from discrimination.b,c.in terms of its enforcement authority,
whenever the bureau has reason to believe that any person may be in possession,custody,or control of any documentary material or tangible things,or may have any information,relevant to a violation,the bureau may,before the institution of any proceedings under the federal consumer financial law,issue in writing,and cause to be served upon such person,a civil investigative demand requiring such person to a produce such documentary material for inspection and copying or reproduction in the form or medium requested by the bureau b submit such tangible things c file written reports or answers to questions d give oral testimony concerning documentary material,tangible things,or other information or e furnish any combination of such material,answers,or testimony.
c emphasis added.the act defines person as an individual,partnership,company,corporation,association incorporated or unincorporated,trust,estate,cooperative,organization,or other entity.
the act also addresses the role states may play in supporting the goals of the act.the act defines state to include any state,territory,or possession of the united states including any federally recognized indian tribe,as defined by the secretary of the interior,and compels the board to coordinate with state regulators,as appropriate,to promote consistent regulatory treatment of consumer financial and investment products and services.under the act,states are also authorized to bring a civil action to enforce provisions of the act.the only entities excluded from the enforcement authority of the state are national banks and federal savings associations.a a.no entities are expressly excluded from the enforcement authority of the bureau.see defining covered person without exception.
because the act by its terms applies broadly and without exception,it is properly characterized as a law of general applicability.see federal power commission tuscarora indian nation.we have consistently held that similar laws of general applicability govern tribal entities unless congress has explicitly provided otherwise.most notably,in coeur,we considered whether the occupational safety and health act osha applied to tribal entities.see at.we observed that osha definition of employer as an organized group of persons engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees encompassed a tribal farm operating as a commercial enterprise.id.at alteration omitted.we recognized that congress expressly excluded only the united states or any state or any political subdivision of a state from the broad definition of employer in the act.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we explained that 
no one doubts that the tribe has the inherent sovereign right to regulate the health and safety of workers in tribal enterprises.but neither is there any doubt that congress has the power to modify or extinguish that right.unlike the states,indian tribes possess only a limited sovereignty that is subject to complete defeasance.
id.at citations omitted.we emphasized that m any of our decisions have upheld the application of general federal laws to indian tribes not one has held that an otherwise applicable statute should be interpreted to exclude indians.id.citations omitted.as a result,we eschewed the proposition that indian tribes are subject only to those laws of the united states expressly made applicable to them.id.at.at the same time,we recognized the following three exceptions to enforcement of generally applicable laws against tribes 
a federal statute of general applicability that is silent on the issue of applicability to indian tribes will not apply to them if the law touches exclusive rights of in purely intramural matters the application of the law to the tribe would abrogate rights guaranteed by indian treaties or there is proof by legislative history or some other means that congress intended the law not to apply to indians on their reservations.
id.citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.in any of these three situations,congress must expressly apply a statute to indians before we will hold that it reaches them.id.emphasis in the original.
we have consistently applied coeur and its progeny to hold that generally applicable laws may be enforced against tribal enterprises.see solis matheson,cir.observing that o ther cases have similarly affirmed the application of osha,the employee retirement income security act erisa,and the americans with disabilities act ada to tribal businesses citations omitted.in keeping with our precedent,we similarly conclude that the consumer financial protection act,a law of general applicability,applies to tribal businesses like the tribal lending entities involved in this appeal.see chapa de,at.
relying on vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,the tribal lending entities contend that our precedent departs from the united states supreme court holding that the statutory term person generally excludes sovereign entities,such as states and native american tribes.in stevens,the supreme court considered whether a private individual may bring suit in federal court on behalf of the united states against a state or state agency under the false claims act.id.at citation omitted.the supreme court reasoned that,in considering application of the false claims act to any person,the court was required to take into account its longstanding interpretive presumption that person does not include the sovereign.id.at citations omitted.the supreme court added that t he presumption is particularly applicable where it is claimed that congress has subjected the states to liability to which they had not been subject before.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.however,t he presumption is,of course,not a hard and fast rule of exclusion,but may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court observed that,in another section of the false claims act which enables the attorney general to issue civil investigative demands,the statute includes a provision expressly defining person for purposes of this section to include states id.at citations and footnote reference omitted.additionally,the false claims act imposes punitive damages which would be inconsistent with state qui tam liability in light of the presumption against imposition of punitive damages on governmental entities.id.at citation and footnote reference omitted see also will michigan department of state police,holding that a state is not a person under because i t is an established principle of jurisprudence that the sovereign can not be sued in its own courts without its consent.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
at first blush,the tribal lending entities reliance on stevens,a decision predating our precedent focusing on the general applicability of the law in question,has surface appeal.however,the equivalence provision in the consumer financial protection act only provides definitional guidance for later references in the statute only to the term state.this equivalence provision simply clarifies that the term state includes any federally recognized indian tribe,as defined by the secretary of the interior.it does not expressly provide that tribes are excluded from the definition of person or from the bureau enforcement authority under the act.in sum,the tribal lending entities interpretation of the equivalence provision reads far too much into a simple definition.we are not persuaded at this stage of the litigation that we should intervene to nullify the bureau issuance of investigative demands specifically provided for in the act on the basis that jurisdiction is plainly lacking.chapa de,at 
furthermore,none of the three coeur exceptions to the enforcement of generally applicable laws against indian tribes apply in this case.see at.it is undisputed that the tribal lending entities are engaged in the business activity of lending over the internet,reaching customers who are not members of the tribes,or indeed,have any relation to the tribes other than as debtors to the tribal lending entities.thus,the first coeur exception whether the law touches exclusive rights of in purely intramural matters does not apply.coeur,at internal quotat
