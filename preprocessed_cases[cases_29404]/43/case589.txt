the practice of deferred deposit lending often called payday or cash advance lending generally involves small sums that become due on the borrower next payday.in return for the loan,the borrower provides the lender with a personal check for the amount of the loan plus fees or with direct access to his or her checking account.the lender then waits a specified amount of time to deposit the borrower check or debit his or her account hence the deferred deposit.because of the nature of these loans and the relatively high fees involved,effective annual percentage rates of percent or higher are not unusual.
in,the legislature enacted the california deferred deposit transaction law fin.code,et,which limits the size of each loan and the fees that lenders may charge.in response to this law and similar legislation in other states,some deferred deposit lenders sought affiliation with federally recognized indian tribes,which are generally immune from suit on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity.see generally martin schwartz,the alliance between payday lenders and tribes are both tribal sovereignty and consumer protection at risk lee.hereafter martin schwartz.
in this case,a pair of federally recognized tribes created affiliated business entities.those entities or their subsidiaries then provided deferred deposit loans through the internet to borrowers in california under terms that allegedly violated the deferred deposit transaction law.the question is whether these tribally affiliated entities are immune from suit as arms of the tribe.applying a test that takes into account both formal and functional aspects of the relationship between the tribes and their affiliated entities,we conclude that the entities are not entitled to tribal immunity on the record before us.
this case concerns business entities associated with two indian tribes,the miami tribe of oklahoma and the santee sioux nation.
the miami tribe of oklahoma is a federally recognized tribe.fed.reg.in,it created miami nation enterprises,hereafter mne,as a subordinate economic enterprise of the miami tribe of oklahoma.in,mne created mne services,a wholly owned subsidiary of mne that is incorporated under tribal law.shortly thereafter,mne transferred tribal financial services tfs,its financial lending subdivision,to mne services.mne services holds tribal licenses to engage in the cash advance service business under the names ameriloan,united cash loans,and fast cash.
the santee sioux nation,located in northeastern nebraska,is also a federally recognized tribe.fed.reg.in,the tribe passed a resolution creating sfs,hereafter sfs,an economic and political subdivision of the santee sioux nation.according to its articles of incorporation,sfs is organized to facilitate the achievement of goals relating to the tribal economy,and sovereign status of the santee sioux nation by provid ing administer ing loans and cash advance services payday loans and associated services.the tribe has issued licenses to sfs to conduct a cash advance and lending business under the names preferred cash and one click cash.these lenders provide cash advance services,or loans,to eligible borrowers and the loan transactions are approved and consummated on indian lands and within the jurisdiction of the santee sioux nation.
although the tribes and their business entities are based in oklahoma and nebraska,they offer deferred deposit loans through the internet to borrowers nationwide.in august,the commissioner of the california department of corporations now commissioner of business oversight issued a desist and refrain order to various online deferred deposit lenders,including defendants here,directing them to cease engaging in unlicensed deferred deposit transaction business.the lenders did not heed the desist and refrain order.
in june,the commissioner filed a complaint against the lenders in los angeles superior court,alleging violations of the deferred deposit transaction law and seeking injunctive relief,restitution,and civil penalties.according to the complaint,defendants made deferred deposit loans without a license,issued loans in excess of the statutory maximum,charged borrowers unlawful fees,and violated the commissioner desist and refrain orders.mne and sfs specially appeared and moved to quash service based on lack of jurisdiction.they asserted that ameriloan,united cash loans,fast cash,preferred cash,and one click cash are merely trade names utilized by tribal entities immune from suit without their consent.the parties then conducted discovery regarding the relationship among the tribes,their subsidiary business entities,mne and sfs,and the online deferred deposit lenders to determine whether the lenders were sufficiently related to the tribes to benefit from the application of sovereign immunity.
the commissioner adduced evidence that a company called clk management,llc,registered the trademarks to ameriloan,united cash loans,fast cash,one click cash,and similar names between and.in september,one month after the commissioner issued her desist and refrain orders,clk management conveyed the one click cash trademark to sfs.clk management also conveyed the ameriloan,united cash loans,and fast cash marks to tfs,which later assigned them to mne services.the commissioner requests that we take judicial notice of screenshots from the homepages of ameriloan,united cash loans,fast cash,preferred cash loans,and one click cash,as well as information from the united states patent and trademark office regarding each of those trade names.we grant this unopposed request,because the information is publicly available and is not reasonably subject to dispute.evid.code,subd.h.
the parties also produced documents relating to the entities operations.those documents show that since its creation in,sfs has hired a series of management companies to operate its deferred deposit lending businesses.initially,sfs contracted with universal management services ums,a nontribal corporation.since,sfs has contracted with amg services,amg,a corporation by the miami tribe of oklahoma,for the purpose of providing employees to provide loan servicing.mne likewise contracted with ums before the creation of amg today,amg provides employees to service the loans issued by mne services.amg subsequently acquired clk management,the company that initially registered many of the lenders trade names.according to declarations from tribal officials,some loan approval and customer service operations are run from mne and sfs offices.
under their prior service agreements with ums,which were in effect until,mne and sfs received percent of gross revenues from the online lending operations.the record does not reveal what percentage of revenues mne services and sfs currently receive under their agreements with amg.affidavits from santee sioux tribal officials state that a ll profits earned by sfs go to the santee sioux to help fund government operations and social welfare programs.the miami tribe likewise asserts that t he profits from mne services flow back to the miami tribe and enable it to fund critical governmental services.
the commissioner also introduced evidence regarding two brothers,scott and blaine tucker,who were linked to the companies sfs and mne hired to manage the tribal entities lending activities.neither scott nor blaine is a member of the santee sioux or miami tribe.scott,who had been the president of clk management,later became a signatory on amg bank accounts along with his brother blaine.an investigator from the federal trade commission ftc analyzed amg business checking account and found numerous payments that appear to be for personal interests,including expenses associated with scott personal residence in aspen,colorado,and sponsorships of his auto racing team.in addition,scott and blaine were authorized to sign checks in the name of sfs,and during a sample period reviewed by an investigator from the california department of justice,either scott or blaine signed every check issued by mne services.a law firm with ties to the tucker brothers paid the website domain registration fees for all of the online deferred deposit lenders at issue here.a federal court has recently ruled that scott,amg,and several companies violated several federal lending laws and imposed a billion judgment in addition to injunctive relief.see federal trade com.amg services,wl.
after discovery,mne and sfs renewed their motion to quash.on may,the trial court held an evidentiary hearing,granted the motion to quash,and dismissed the case on the basis of tribal immunity.the commissioner appealed.
the court of appeal identified the key question as whether the lending businesses are sufficiently related to their respective tribes to be protected by tribal sovereign immunity.in answering that question,the court found significant that mne was created directly under the miami tribe tribal law as a subordinate unit of the tribe itself to provide for its economic development.moreover,tribal leaders appoint mne board of directors profits from mne commercial activities fund the tribe governmental services and in the court view,extension of immunity to mne would further the federal policy in favor of tribal autonomy.likewise,the santee sioux and sfs are also closely linked by virtue of sfs method of creation,ownership,structure and control,and extension of immunity to it substantially promotes tribal autonomy.thus,the court of appeal concluded,t here can be little question that mne and sfs,considered initially by themselves and without regard to the payday lending activities at issue in this enforcement action,function as arms of their respective tribes and are entitled to immunity.
turning to the online deferred deposit lenders named as defendants in the commissioner complaint,the court of appeal acknowledged that the analysis is slightly more complicated.the court observed that operations of these businesses have been effectively delegated pursuant to management agreements.in addition,the tribal business entities do not participate in the net income from the businesses,receiving instead only a modest percentage of the gross revenues,characterized by the commissioner as similar to a royalty.
ultimately,however,the court of appeal found that the online lenders were entitled to tribal immunity a tribal entity engaged in a commercial enterprise that is otherwise entitled to be protected by tribal immunity does not lose that immunity simply by contracting with nontribal members to operate the business.as for the tribes meager share of the lenders revenues,the court concluded that whether or not the miami tribe and the santee sioux negotiated good or poor management agreements for themselves can not serve as the basis to determine the tribal entities are not functioning as arms of their respective tribes.
we granted review.
the tribal entities claim to immunity depends on the understanding that the miami tribe of oklahoma and santee sioux nation are themselves immune from suit.the high court first addressed the sovereign status of tribes in three opinions known today as the marshall trilogy after their author,chief justice john marshall.see worcester georgia cherokee nation georgia cherokee nation johnson.broadly speaking,these cases established that states lack jurisdiction in indian country,that tribes are domestic dependent nations to whom the united states owes a fiduciary obligation,and that indian affairs are the exclusive province of the federal government.wood,it was an accident the tribal sovereign immunity story,fns.omitted.
subsequent cases implied that tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit,but did so in dicta.turner united states,turner parks ross.then,in united states fidelity guaranty fidelity,the high court elevated the concept of tribal immunity from dictum to holding.agua caliente band of cahuilla indians superior court cal th,agua caliente.citing turner,cherokee nation,and decisions from the lower federal courts,the high court held that indian nations are exempt from suit without congressional authorization.fidelity,at see id.at fns.
since fidelity,the high court has held that tribal immunity applies in a variety of contexts.michigan bay mills indian community,bay mills immunity bars state suit against tribe for opening casino outside tribal territory kiowa tribe of oklahoma manufacturing technologies,kiowa tribe tribes are immune from suit for breaches of contract involving commercial conduct oklahoma tax commission citizen band potawatomi indian tribe,potawatomi tribal immunity bars state suit to enforce collection of sales tax on cigarettes three affiliated tribes wold engineering,three affiliated tribes federal law preempts requirement that tribe waive its sovereign immunity in all civil cases in order to sue in state court santa clara pueblo martinez,santa clara pueblo indian civil rights act of did not abrogate tribal immunity,nor did it create an implied private right of action against tribal officials puyallup tribe department of game,puyallup state courts lack jurisdiction over tribe in suit to enforce state fishing regulations.
the rule that indian tribes are immune from suit is now firmly established as a matter of federal law and is not subject to diminution by the states.kiowa tribe,supra,at.tribal immunity applies in both federal and state court and extends to suits arising from a tribe commercial activities,even when they take place off indian lands.bay mills,supra,at.at.immunity can be abrogated by congress,but congressional intent to abrogate tribal immunity must be unequivocally expressed.santa clara pueblo,supra,at.immunity may also be waived,but a tribe waiver must be clear.enterprises,citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of oklahoma.as discussed in more detail below,tribal immunity applies not just broadly but deeply,frequently protecting not just tribal governments,but tribal entities and corporations that are considered subentities of the tribe.florey,indian country borders territoriality,immunity,and the construction of tribal sovereignty.
moreover,the high court has reiterated that tribal immunity is a necessary corollary to indian sovereignty and.three affiliated tribes,supra,at,italics added.as that statement implies,the doctrine rests on two distinct rationales.first,tribes are immune from suit by virtue of their sovereign status.in bay mills,for instance,the high court observed that a mong the core aspects of sovereignty that tribes possess is the immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.bay mills,supra,at.at see id.at id.at citing federalist for the proposition that it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to suit without consent.similarly,fidelity referred to the immunity of tribes as the immunity which was theirs as sovereigns.fidelity,supra,at.
second,the high court has recognized policy rationales for tribal immunity that serve an ultimate interest in promoting tribal.permitting suits against tribes and,in some contexts,their officials would impose serious financial burdens on already financially disadvantaged tribes.santa clara pueblo,supra,at.conversely,immunity encourages tribal economic development and by protecting tribal enterprises.potawatomi,supra,at.more broadly,exposing tribes to suit without their consent could work a potentially severe impairment of the authority of the tribal government,its courts,and its laws,threatening the tribe ability to govern itself according to its own laws.three affiliated tribes,supra,at see kiowa tribe,supra,at suggesting that immunity should be congruent with what is needed to safeguard tribal.these rationales recognize that tribal immunity furthers the federal policy of tribal,an ideal that encompasses governmental,economic,and cultural autonomy.see cohen,handbook of federal indian law ed,describing shift in federal indian policy from termination to.
finally,although the high court has rejected calls to abolish or curtail tribal immunity,the doctrine remains controversial as applied to certain tribal activities.in kiowa tribe,the high court acknowledged there are reasons to doubt the wisdom of extending tribal immunity to commercial activity because doing so may go beyond what is needed to safeguard tribal.kiowa tribe,supra,at.but the high court ultimately decline d to revisit its case law and ch ose to defer to congress.id.at.the three dissenting justices would have held that tribal immunity does not extend to commercial activity.see id.at dis.opn.of stevens.in bay mills,four dissenting justices observed that i n the years since kiowa,tribal commerce has proliferated and the inequities engendered by unwarranted tribal immunity have multiplied.bay mills,supra,at.at dis.opn.of thomas,see ibid.dis.opn.of scalia,stating that although he concurred in kiowa tribe,i am now convinced that kiowa was wrongly decided.and the high court in bay mills hinted that it might be willing to consider in a future case whether immunity should apply in the ordinary way if a tort victim,or other plaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe,has no alternative way to obtain relief for commercial conduct.id.at,fn.at,fn.
the main legal question in this case is how to determine whether a tribally affiliated entity shares in a tribe immunity from suit.we conclude that an entity asserting immunity bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is an arm of the tribe entitled to tribal immunity.in making that determination,courts should apply a test that considers the entity method of creation,whether the tribe intended the entity to share in its immunity,the entity purpose,the tribe control over the entity,and the financial relationship between the tribe and the entity.as explained below,this test takes into account both formal and functional considerations in other words,not only the legal or organizational relationship between the tribe and the entity,but also the practical operation of the entity in relation to the tribe.once the entity demonstrates that it is an arm of the tribe,it is immune from suit unless the opposing party can show that tribal immunity has been abrogated or waived.
the high court has recognized that tribal sovereign immunity extends to entities beyond the tribe itself.inyo county indians of the bishop community of the bishop colony,fn.the united states maintains,and the county does not dispute,that the corporation is an arm of the tribe for sovereign immunity purposes.but it has not articulated a framework for determining when a particular entity should be considered an arm of the tribe.ibid.in the absence of guidance from the high court,state and federal courts have articulated a variety of tests.
some jurisdictions have focused on a tribe financial relationship to the disputed entity.such an approach aims to protect the tribal treasury as a means of ensuring that the tribe retains its sovereign prerogative to govern itself through expenditure of funds and to allocate public resources through its own political processes.new york high court,for instance,considers financial relationship considerations as the most important of several factors.concrete paving,lewiston golf course.the financial relationship factor includes whether the corporate entity generates its own revenue,whether a suit against the corporation will impact the tribe fiscal resources,and whether the subentity has the power to bind or obligate the funds of the tribe citation.the vulnerability of the tribe coffers in defending a suit against the subentity indicates that the real party in interest is the tribe.ransom regis mohawk education and community fund.under new york test,i f a judgment against a corporation created by an indian tribe will not reach the tribe assets,because the corporation lacks the power to bind or obligate the funds of the tribe citation,then the corporation is not an arm of the tribe,at see dixon picopa construction,tribally affiliated business was not entitled to immunity in part because its insurance coverage and limited liability clause shielded tribe from direct liability.
alaska test likewise considers the financial relationship between the tribe and the entity to be of paramount importance.runyon ex rel.association of village council presidents alaska,runyon.indeed,it appears to make tribal liability for the entity acts a threshold requirement for immunity.under runyon,if a judgment against the entity will not reach the tribe assets or if the entity lacks the power to bind or obligate the funds of the tribe,it is unlikely that the tribe is the real party in interest,and the entity therefore can not share in the tribe immunity.ibid.only if the tribe is legally responsible for the entity obligations do additional factors such as control and purpose come into play.id.at.
other states have adopted tests that omit or deemphasize the financial relationship and instead focus on the legal or organizational relationship between the tribe and the entity.compared to the new york and alaska approaches,these tests tend to favor immunity.colorado and washington apply tests that do not require a showing that the tribe would be liable for a judgment against the entity.cash advance and preferred cash loans state,cash advance immunity turns on whether the tribes created the entities pursuant to tribal law whether the tribes own and operate the entities and whether the entities immunity protects the tribes sovereignty wright colville tribal enterprise,wright suggesting,without extensive discussion,that the only relevant factors are whether the tribal entity is owned and controlled by a tribe,and created under its own tribal laws.
minnesota approach focuses on three principal factors in determining whether tribal sovereign immunity extends to a tribal business entity whether the business entity is organized for a purpose that is governmental in nature,rather than commercial whether the tribe and the business entity are closely linked in governing structure and other characteristics and whether federal policies intended to promote indian tribal autonomy are furthered by the extension of immunity to the business entity.gavle little six,gavle.
among the federal decisions that have addressed this issue,the tenth circuit opinion in breakthrough management group,chukchansi gold casino and resort cir.breakthrough appears most influential.breakthrough adopted a test that includes the method of the entities creation their purpose their structure,ownership,and management,including the amount of control the tribe has over the entities whether the tribe intended for them to have tribal sovereign immunity the financial relationship between the tribe and the entities and whether the purposes of tribal sovereign immunity are served by granting them immunity.id.at.although breakthrough recognize d that the financial relationship between a tribe and its economic entities is a relevant measure of the closeness of their relationship,it rejected the notion that financial relationship or any other single factor is a dispositive inquiry.id.at.
the ninth circuit recently adopted the breakthrough approach white university of california cir,white,and breakthrough is consistent with previous federal decisions that addressed the issue without articulating an express multifactor test see,cook avi casino enterprises cir,tribal entity entitled to immunity where the tribe created it pursuant to a tribal ordinance and intergovernmental agreement,the tribal corporation is wholly owned and managed by the tribe,the economic benefits produced by the casino inure to the tribe benefit,and a majority of the entity board must be members of the tribe.
like the high court,we have recognized that tribal immunity extends to entities that are arms of the tribes,but we have not elaborated on the appropriate test for determining when an entity merits this designation.agua caliente,supra,cal th at,quoting cohen,handbook of federal indian law,supra,a.in grappling with this issue,the courts of appeal have followed the lead of other jurisdictions.
in trudgeon fantasy springs casino th trudgeon,a man injured in a fight at a tribal bingo hall sued the tribal corporation that operated the venue.the court of appeal largely adopted gavle s analysis,calling it an accurate summation of the relevant case law.trudgeon,at.applying gavle three factors,the court of appeal concluded that the tribal corporation was immune because its underlying purpose of promoting tribal development is governmental in nature notwithstanding its status,the tribe directly oversees the operations of the corporation,and both congress and the high court have recognized that indian gaming furthers tribal.trudgeon,at.
redding rancheria superior court th redding rancheria also involved a tort victim who was injured on the premises of a tribal gaming facility.the court cited trudgeon approach with approval and concluded that tribal immunity barred the plaintiff suit because he presented no evidence in the trial court to challenge the tribe evidence the casino was an arm of the tribe.redding rancheria,at,italics omitted.
in american property management superior court th american property management,a california limited liability company called grant,which was indirectly affiliated with the sycuan band of the kumeyaay nation,purchased a hotel.id.at.the tribe created the sycuan tribal development corporation under tribal law and then established several layers of california limited liability companies to stand between it and grant,the entity that took ownership of the hotel.id.at.the issue was whether grant was entitled to tribal immunity in a contract dispute.the court of appeal agree d that the list of factors set forth by the tenth circuit in breakthrough is helpful and,although the factors overlap somewhat when applied,they accurately reflect the general focus of the applicable federal and state case law.american property management,at.the court analyzed each of these factors and,in support of its finding of no immunity,explained that the dispositive fact throughout our analysis is that grant,llc is a california limited liability company rather than an entity organized under tribal law.ibid.justice aaron agreed that grant was not immune as an arm of the tribe but disagreed with the court dispositive emphasis on the company formation under state law.id.at conc.opn.of aaron.she would have weighed the various breakthrough factors differently in arriving at the same conclusion.id.at.
the court of appeal in this case initially remanded the matter to the trial court to analyze mne and sfs claim of immunity under the factors identified in trudgeon and redding rancheria.see ameriloan superior court th.in the opinion below,the court of appeal applied elements of the various tests appearing in the case law,including the entity ownership,governance,and financial relationship to the tribe,but concluded that the tribe method and purpose for creating a subordinate economic entity are the most significant factors in determining whether it is protected by a tribe sovereign immunity and should be given predominant,if not necessarily dispositive,consideration.
noting a lack of consensus across jurisdictions regarding the test,the commissioner urges us to seek guidance from the doctrine.she argues that because tribal and state sovereign immunity are fundamentally similar,we should look to the analogous and doctrine governing immunity.although we decline the commissioner invitation to look to the doctrine for guidance on the factors of the test,we agree with her view that a tribally affiliated entity,just like a entity,bears the burden of proving it is entitled to immunity.
as the commissioner acknowledges,tribal sovereignty differs from state sovereignty in important respects.unlike the states,which have consented to suit by other states alden maine,tribes have never agreed to so limit their sovereign immunity.the high court has repeatedly held that indian tribes enjoy immunity against suits by states,citation,as it would be absurd to suggest that the tribes surrendered immunity in a constitutional convention to which they were not even parties.blatchford native village of noatak,see idaho coeur tribe of idaho,t he plan of the convention did not surrender indian tribes immunity for the benefit of the states.
at the same time,tribes are domestic dependent nations subject to plenary control by congress,which means congress enjoys free rein to abrogate tribal immunity so long as its intent is clearly expressed.bay mills,supra,at.at.indeed,the high court has emphasized deference to congress broad authority as a reason why courts should be wary of restricting tribal immunity.see id.at.at kiowa tribe,supra,at.by contrast,congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity only when its intent is clearly stated and it acts pursuant to a constitutional provision granting congress the power to abrogate.seminole tribe of florida florida.even when congress seeks to authorize suit against the states pursuant to its power to enforce the fourteenth amendment,there must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.city of boerne flores.
beyond these conceptual differences,it is not clear which version of the test we would adopt even if we were inclined to look to that doctrine for guidance.the jurisprudence over how to apply the doctrine is,at best,confused.mancuso new york state thruway authority cir.it has produced four supreme court sample case analyses,none of which purport to offer a systematic test or a formalized list of factors two competing eleventh amendment rationales intended to guide the factor analysis twelve very different circuit court tests,each with their own twists,measuring a litany of factors that vary by circuit and scores of lower court precedents with outcomes varying not only circuit by circuit but state by state within a given circuit.comment,keeping the arms in touch taking political accountability seriously in the eleventh amendment doctrine emory.
furthermore,although courts have taken different approaches to fashioning an test,we believe the doctrine is sufficiently well developed to guide our analysis.numerous courts,including our own courts of appeal,have addressed this issue in the context of typical business activities in which tribally affiliated entities engage.see,redding rancheria,supra,th tribal casino cash advance,supra,at same deferred deposit lending operations at issue in this case.these opinions,combined with the high court tribal immunity precedent,provide a sufficient basis for formulating our own version of the test.
nonetheless,we agree with the commissioner that the burden of proof on the issue of immunity properly falls on the entity claiming immunity.typically,on a motion asserting sovereign immunity as a basis for dismissing an action the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that jurisdiction exists.campo band of mission indians superior court th,campo band.when a tribe asserts sovereign immunity,the plaintiff must show that the tribe immunity has been abrogated or waived if not,the court lacks jurisdiction.ibid.the commissioner argues this rule should not apply to a tribally affiliated entity until it proves it is an arm of the tribe.only then,she contends,should the burden shift to the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction.
in support of this argument,the commissioner relies on itsi productions,agricultural assns.cir.itsi,which held that eleventh amendment immunity,whatever its jurisdictional attributes,should be treated as an affirmative defense and thus must be proved by the party that asserts it and would benefit from its acceptance.id.at.accordingly,when a entity seeks immunity on the basis of state sovereign immunity,it must first show it is an arm of the state.id.at see woods rondout valley central school district bd.of education cir,woods following itsi and decisions from other federal circuit courts in holding that the governmental entity invoking the eleventh amendment bears the burden of demonstrating that it qualifies as an arm of the state entitled to share in its immunity.according to the commissioner,the same rule should apply to an entity claiming to be an arm of a tribe.
few cases have closely considered which party bears the burden of proof.american property management placed the burden on the plaintiff to show that the entity was not an arm of the tribe,as did the opinion below.yet these opinions simply assumed,without analysis,that tribally affiliated entities should be treated the same as tribes themselves.see american property management,supra,th at.cases,however,require the court to decide an antecedent question whether the entities can claim sovereign immunity in the first instance.city of new york golden feather smoke shop,cv cba wl,golden feather.
among the cases that have analyzed this issue in greater depth,the results are mixed.in cash advance,the colorado supreme court acknowledged that the jurisdictional nature of tribal immunity is not entirely clear but concluded that tribal sovereign immunity bears a substantial enough likeness to subject matter jurisdiction to be treated as such for procedural purposes.cash advance,supra,at.hence,under colorado rule,the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the tribal entities are not entitled to immunity by a preponderance of the evidence.ibid.by contrast,the court in gristede foods,unkechuage nation d held that the entity seeking immunity must establish,by a preponderance of evidence,that it is an arm of the tribe,and thus entitled to immunity.id.at see golden feather,supra,wl,at pp.citing itsi and woods in support of same conclusion cash advance,supra,at dis.opn.of coats.
having considered itsi,woods,and similar cases from other federal courts,we find their rationales for placing the initial burden of proof on entities persuasive with regard to tribally affiliated entities.as with state sovereign immunity,the jurisdictional nature of tribal immunity has never been definitively settled.the high court cases indicate that tribal immunity is jurisdictional in a general sense,but they have not elaborated further.see puyallup,supra,at absent abrogation or waiver,a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over a recognized indian tribe bay mills,supra,at,fn.at,fn.although tribe was immune from suit,court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act.california court of appeal cases often describe tribal immunity as a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction,but this court most recent tribal immunity case discussed it in terms of personal jurisdiction.compare,campo band,supra,th at,with agua caliente,supra,cal th at see great western casinos,morongo band of mission indians th,noting inconsistency in the law regarding whether claims of sovereign immunity affect a court personal as opposed to subject matter jurisdiction.the federal circuit courts are split on this question.compare miner electric,muscogee creek nation cir,tribal sovereign immunity is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction with in re prairie island dakota sioux cir,tribal sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional consideration separate from subject matter jurisdiction.
regardless of how we characterize tribal immunity,it is undisputed that tribal immunity,like state sovereign immunity,can be affirmatively waived.in addition,trial courts do not have a sua sponte duty to raise the issue of tribal immunity.these features indicate that tribal immunity,like eleventh amendment immunity,is not a true jurisdictional bar that automatically divests a court of the ability to hear or decide the case.itsi,supra,at see wisconsin of corrections schacht.thus,whatever its jurisdictional attributes,tribal immunity does not implicate a court subject matter jurisdiction in any ordinary sense.itsi,at.
in the context,as for arms of the state,placing the burden on the entity asserting immunity comports with the traditional principle that a party in possession of facts tending to support its claim should be required to come forward with that information.woods,supra,at see new york,new haven hartford railroad,fn.the inquiry will occasion serious dispute only where a relatively complex institutional arrangement makes it unclear whether a given entity ought to be treated as an arm of the tribe.in such cases,the true facts as to the particulars of this arrangement will presumably lie peculiarly within the knowledge of the party claiming immunity.itsi,supra,at.
placing the burden of proof on the entity also aligns with our basic notions of why arms of the tribe are immune from suit.an entity that is formally distinct from the tribe will be immune from suit only insofar as it benefits from the tribe own immunity.once the entity has established that it is an arm of the tribe,we treat the lawsuit as if it were an action against the tribe itself.as noted,tribal immunity is a strong tonic such immunity shields a tribe from liability unless congress has so authorized or the tribe has waived its immunity by consenting to suit,and the burden of proving abrogation or waiver falls on the plaintiff.lawrence barona valley ranch resort and casino th.but until the entity has proven it should be treated as an extension of the tribe,it is no more entitled to a presumption of immunity than any other party.accordingly,we conclude that a tribally affiliated entity claiming immunity bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it is an arm of the tribe.
we now turn to the substance of the test.having reviewed prior california decisions as well as the various approaches in other jurisdictions,we adopt a modified version of the tenth circuit breakthrough test.that test factors method of creation,tribal intent,purpose,control,and financial relationship properly account for the understanding that tribal immunity is both an inherent part of the concept of sovereignty and necessary to promote the federal policies of tribal self determination,economic development,and cultural autonomy.breakthrough,supra.at.
since immunity is inherent in the nature of tribal sovereignty bay mills,supra,at.at,it is appropriate that the test considers the legal relationship and organizational proximity between the tribe and the entity.the entity method of formation and declared purpose,whether the tribe intended the entity to share in its immunity,and the financial linkage and formal control that the tribe possesses in relation to the entity are factors that illuminate whether the dignity that immunity doctrine accords to the tribe by virtue of its sovereign status should extend to the entity by virtue of its status as a tribal affiliate.the more closely linked the entity is to the tribe in these formal dimensions,the more likely it is to share in the tribe inherent immunity.
at the same time,tribal immunity is intended to promote the federal policy of tribal,which includes economic,cultural autonomy,and the tribe ability to govern itself according to its own laws.three affiliated tribes,supra,at see potawatomi,supra,at.the same five factors method of creation,tribal intent,purpose,control,and financial relationship incorporate the understanding that tribal immunity should extend to arms of the tribe when such immunity would,as a practical matter,further that federal policy.most notably,the purpose factor considers the extent to which the entity actually promotes tribal the control factor examines the degree to which the tribe actually,not just nominally,directs the entity activities and the financial relationship factor considers the degree to which the entity liability could impact the tribe revenue.these functional considerations illuminate the degree to which imposition of liability on the entity would practically impair tribal.
in addition to the five factors just discussed,breakthrough articulated a sixth whether the purposes of tribal sovereign immunity are served by granting the entity immunity.breakthrough,supra,at.that factor,which overlaps significantly with the other factors american property management,supra,th at,serves to focus the analysis of the individual factors on the purposes of tribal sovereign immunity it need not be considered separately here.accordingly,in assessing whether an entity is an arm of the tribe,courts should analyze the following factors 
method of creation.in considering the method of creation of the economic entit y breakthrough,supra.at,courts have focused on the law under which the entity was formed.formation under tribal law weighs in favor of immunity id.at,whereas formation under state law has been held to weigh against immunity american property management,supra,th at or to constitute a waiver of immunity wright,supra,at runyon,supra,at.the circumstances under which the entity formation occurred,including whether the tribe initiated or simply absorbed an operational commercial enterprise,are also relevant.
tribal intent.in some cases,the tribal ordinance or articles of incorporation creating the entity will express whether the tribe intended the entity to share in its immunity.see breakthrough,supra,at.because the entity bears the burden of proof and is typically positioned to specify the terms of its creation or incorporation in collaboration with the tribe,this factor will generally weigh against immunity if the record is silent as to the tribe intent.in certain cases,it may be possible to infer the tribe intent,even where it is not express,from the tribe actions or other sources.
purpose.this factor encompasses both the stated purpose for which the entity was created and the degree to which the entity actually serves that purpose.in adopting this factor,we disagree with the colorado supreme court view that high court precedent render s the entity purpose and its activities irrelevant to the determination whether it qualifies for immunity.cash advance,supra,at.although the high court has rejected the argument that a tribe immunity turns on whether the activities in question are governmental or commercial,it has not addressed whether purpose is relevant in analyzing immunity for tribally affiliated entities.judicial inquiry into the entity purpose may elucidate whether its relationship to the tribe is sufficiently close,and its activities sufficiently germane to tribal,that it shares in the tribe immunity.
the inquiry into this factor begins with the entity stated purpose.in order to weigh in favor of immunity,the stated purpose need not be purely governmental so long as it relates to broader goals of tribal.if the entity was created to develop the tribe economy,fund its governmental services,or promote cultural autonomy,its purpose pertains to tribal notwithstanding the entity commercial activities.see breakthrough,supra,at tribal gaming authority and casino were created for the financial benefit of the tribe and to enable it to engage in various governmental functions gavle,supra,at discussing the unique role that indian gaming serves in the economic life of impoverished indian communities across this country american property management,supra,th at conc.opn.of aaron,discussing symbolic importance for tribe of entity purchase of historic hotel.by contrast,this factor will weigh against immunity if the entity was created solely for business purposes and without any declared objective of promoting the tribe general tribal or economic development.trudgeon,supra,th at.
if the entity stated purpose is sufficiently related to tribal,the inquiry then examines the extent to which the entity actually serves that purpose.the fit between stated purpose and practical execution need not be exact,but the closer the fit,the more it will weigh in favor of immunity.an entity whose declared purpose is to further the tribe economic development may bolster its case for immunity by proving,for example,the number of jobs it creates for tribal members or the amount of revenue it generates for the tribe.by contrast,evidence that the entity engages in activities unrelated to its stated goals or that the entity actually operates to enrich primarily persons outside of the tribe or only a handful of tribal leaders weighs against finding that the entity is an arm of the tribe.courts should consider such evidence in order to meaningfully evaluate an entity stated purpose.
control.this factor concerns the entity structure,ownership,and management,including the amount of control the tribe has over the entities.breakthrough,supra,at.relevant considerations include the entity formal governance structure,the extent to which it is owned by the tribe,and the entity management.an entity decision to outsource management to a nontribal third party is not enough,standing alone,to tilt this factor against immunity.as the minnesota supreme court has observed,control of a corporation need not mean control of business minutiae the tribe can be enmeshed in the direction and control of the business without being involved in the actual management.gavle,supra,at see trudgeon,supra,th at.if the tribe retains some ownership and formal control over the entity but has contracted out its management,this factor may weigh either for or against immunity depending on the particular facts of the case.evidence that the tribe actively directs or oversees the operation of the entity weighs in favor of immunity evidence that the tribe is a passive owner,neglects its governance roles,or otherwise exercises little or no control or oversight weighs against immunity.see american property management,supra,th at indicating that indirect ownership and control of the tribal corporation weighs against a finding of immunity.
financial relationship.the starting point for analyzing the financial relationship between the entity and the tribe is whether a judgment against the entity would reach the tribe assets.see american property management,supra,th at.but direct tribal liability for the entity actions is neither a threshold requirement for immunity nor a predominant factor in the overall analysis,and we disagree with those courts that have held as much.see,supra,at runyon,supra,at.as the commissioner acknowledges,raising revenues through taxation is harder for tribes than for states.f ew tribes have any significant tax base.tribal business enterprises may be the only means by which a tribe can raise revenues and thus such enterprises may be essential to the fulfillment of the tribe governmental obligations.struve,tribal immunity and tribal courts,see bay mills,supra,at.at conc.opn.of sotomayor,due to a lack of other revenue sources,tribal business operations are critical to the goals of tribal.some tribes rely on such business revenues to an extent that a judgment against the entity could effectively strike a blow against the tribal treasury,regardless of whether the tribe is directly liable.
thus,courts consider the extent to which the tribe depends on the entity for revenue to fund its governmental functions,its support of tribal members,and its search for other economic development opportunities.breakthrough,supra,at.if a significant percentage of the entity revenue flows to the tribe,or if a judgment against the entity would significantly affect the tribal treasury,this factor will weigh in favor of immunity even if the entity liability is formally limited.see wright,supra,at conc.opn.of madsen,although tribe was not directly liable for entities obligations,a ny liability imposed on the corporations could still affect the tribe finances.determining whether this factor weighs in favor of immunity requires a consideration of degree rather than a binary decision.but because any imposition of liability on a tribally affiliated entity could theoretically impact tribal finances,the entity must do more than simply assert that it generates some revenue for the tribe in order to tilt this factor in favor of immunity.
in setting forth the five factors of the test,we emphasize that no single factor is universally dispositive.see,breakthrough,supra,at financial relationship is not a dispositive inquiry american property management,supra,th at conc.opn.of aaron,method of creation is not dispositive.each case will call for inquiry into all the factors followed by an overall assessment of whether the entity has carried its burden by a preponderance of the evidence.
although the court of appeal in this case examined the factors discussed above,it believe d the tribe method and purpose for creating a subordinate economic entity are the most significant factors in determining whether it is protected by a tribe sovereign immunity and should be given predominant,if not necessarily dispositive,consideration.the court observed that although the tribes had delegated operations of the online lending businesses to a nontribal third party,under the management agreements mne and sfs have final decisionmaking authority to approve or disapprove any loans advance instructions or approval parameters are established by them to allow the managers to function on a basis.indeed,the agreements expressly provide that the tribal entities have the sole proprietary interest in and responsibility for the conduct of the business and that the third party management of the operations is subject to the oversight and control of mne and sfs,respectively.
in light of these considerations,the court held,it did not matter whether or not the miami tribe and the santee sioux negotiated good or poor management agreements for themselves or whether they could have insisted on a higher percentage than they actually received.the court concluded absent an extraordinary set of circumstances not present here,a tribal entity functions as an arm of the tribe if it has been formed by tribal resolution and according to tribal law,for the stated purpose of tribal economic development and with the clearly expressed intent by the sovereign tribe to convey its immunity to that entity,and has a governing structure both appointed by and ultimately overseen by the tribe.such a tribal entity is immune from suit absent express waiver or congressional authorization.neither management of operations nor retention of only a minimal percentage of the profits from the enterprise however that may be defined justifies judicial negation of that inherent element of tribal sovereignty.
the court of appeal thus assigned dispositive weight to formal considerations the formation of the entities under tribal law,the tribes intent to confer immunity,and the governance structure as set forth in the language of the management agreements.in so doing,the court of appeal tilted its analysis toward one of the two poles of the debate as it relates to lenders.tribes will likely maintain that whether an entity functions as an arm of the tribe is a foundational inquiry,and not to be inferred from the functional arrangements,whatever they are.if tribal sovereignty is inherent and not subject to diminution by the states,so the argument goes,a state court lacks the power to hold that a tribal entity formed according to tribal law,by tribal resolution,for the stated purposes of tribal development,with clear intent on the part of the sovereign tribe to convey its sovereign immunity to the entity,is not an arm of the tribe,simply because the deal the tribe negotiated does not retain enough of the profits to satisfy the court.on the other hand,it is common sense that if an entity provides a miniscule percentage of its revenue to the tribe,and the tribe is barely involved,the entity can not be said to stand in the place of the tribe.moreover,if a tribe retains only a minimal percentage of the profits from the enterprise,it would appear that the enterprise may not be truly controlled by the tribe.martin schwartz,supra,lee.at.
while recognizing the relevance of the formal relationship between a tribe and the disputed entity,we conclude that the court of appeal gave inordinate weight to those formal considerations in the overall balance when it said they could be outweighed only by an extraordinary set of circumstances.as explained further below,organizational arrangements on paper do not necessarily illuminate how businesses operate in practice.here,the language of the management agreements between the tribes and the online lenders is not,by itself,sufficient to warrant the court of appeal conclusion that mne and sfs are not merely passive bystanders to the challenged lending activities.given the manipulability of formal arrangements,it is important to carefully examine how such arrangements function as a practical matter,lest we expand the application of tribal immunity beyond its established rationales and indeed beyond common sense.martin schwartz,supra,lee.at.
business entities that claim immunity have no inherent immunity of their own.instead,they enjoy immunity only to the extent the immunity of the tribe,which does have inherent immunity,is extended to them.in view of that fact,it is possible to imagine situations in which a tribal entity may engage in activities which are so far removed from tribal interests that it no longer can legitimately be seen as an extension of the tribe itself.trudgeon,supra,th at.in such cases,extending immunity to the entity would not promote the federal policies of tribal self determination,economic development,and cultural autonomy.breakthrough,supra.at.immunity must not become a doctrine of form over substance.the ultimate purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether the entity acts as an arm of the tribe so that its activities are properly deemed to be those of the tribe.allen gold country casino cir,italics added allen see id.at extending tribal immunity to casino because there can be little doubt that the casino functions as an arm of the tribe italics added.
whether tribal immunity bars suit is a question of law that we review de novo.see findleton coyote valley band of pomo indians th.applying the inquiry set forth above,we hold that on the record before us,the lenders named as defendants in the commissioner complaint are not entitled to immunity as arms of the miami tribe of oklahoma and santee sioux nation,respectively.
at the outset,we note that our analysis focuses on these lenders as part of sfs and mne services rather than as separate entities.preferred cash and one click cash are simply trade names under which sfs conducts its lending business.when the commissioner filed the complaint,ameriloan,united cash loans,and fast cash were trade names under which mne through its tfs subdivision conducted lending operations.but by the time the trial court granted the motion to quash,mne had transferred ownership of that lending business,including the trade names,to mne services.we thus agree with the commissioner that for purposes of determining the immunity of ameriloan,united cash loans,and fast cash,our focus must be on mne services,although evidence regarding mne prior operations under those trade names may shed light on the inquiry.
although the commissioner,joined by various amici curiae,decries the impact of deferred deposit lending on vulnerable borrowers,the court of appeal was correct that tribal immunity does not depend on our evaluation of the respectability or ethics of the business in which a tribe or tribal entity elects to engage.in every instance where some form of immunity bars suit,an alleged wrong will go without a remedy.see puyallup,supra,at no remedy for alleged overfishing by tribe potawatomi,supra,at no remedy for tribe refusal to collect state sales tax santa clara pueblo,supra,at no remedy for gender discrimination in tribal membership requirements.our immunity analysis does not rest on the merits or ethics of deferred lending as a means of tribal economic development.instead,our inquiry focuses on whether sfs and mne services have shown on this record that they have a sufficiently close relationship with their respective tribes to warrant the protection of sovereign immunity.
the record reveals a nominally close relationship between sfs and the santee sioux,and between mne services and the miami tribe.but it contains scant evidence that either tribe actually controls,oversees,or significantly benefits from the underlying business operations of the online lenders.on the record before us,which both parties contend is undisputed,we are unable to conclude that defendants have carried their burden of showing that a denial of immunity would appreciably impair either tribe economic development,cultural autonomy,or.
the evidence here consists primarily of affidavits by tribal officials submitted by the business entities and various affidavits and supporting documentation assembled as part of an ftc investigation of amg submitted by the commissioner.sfs treasurer robert campbell,in particular,submitted affidavits in and in support of the motions to quash we refer to these as the campbell and campbell affidavits.don brady,mne chief executive officer,also submitted affidavits.but in the course of the federal investigation of amg,mne services and amg admitted that t
