factual and procedural background 
this appeal arises out of a series of four consolidated suits challenging the secretary of commerce decisions to allocate a portion of the harvest of pacific coast whiting to the makah tribe under the treaty of neah bay.the controversy began in,after the makah tribe notified the fisheries service that it intended to exercise its treaty rights and harvest up to one half of the harvestable surplus of pacific whiting that pass through its usual and accustomed fishing grounds see generally washington daley,cir 
allocation of pacific whiting is subject to regulation pursuant to the act,et,which vests the fisheries service with the authority to issue fishery management regulations see,see also kramer mosbacher,cir.such regulations must be consistent with the act and other applicable law defining indian treaty fishing rights.see parravano babbitt,cir.other applicable law under the act includes indian treaty fishing rights.state charterboat ass baldrige,cir.
in,the fisheries service promulgated a framework regulation,codified at,that recognized the treaty rights of four coastal hoh,makah,and quileute indian tribes,and the quinault indian harvest groundfish in the tribes usual and accustomed fishing areas.june.the framework regulation defined the usual and accustomed fishing areas of the four tribes as extending approximately forty miles into the ocean off washington coast.daley,at.it also instituted a procedure for accommodating these treaty rights.id.
pursuant to the framework regulation,the department of commerce has made allocations of pacific whiting to the makah tribe every year since.in,midwater,along with the states of oregon and washington,filed suit against appellees,challenging the framework regulation and the allocation provided to the tribes.in addition,because it believed the fisheries service proposed allocation deprived it of its treaty entitlement in violation of its treaty rights,the makah tribe initiated a subproceeding seeking to have the proposal declared invalid washington ii,d at.
in its subproceeding,the makah tribe disagreed with the fisheries service over the method to be used for calculating the tribe allocation of pacific whiting.the makah tribe argued that the biomass method lacked scientific support and disagreed with the fisheries service on the definition of harvestable surplus.see,washington ii,d at.
under the biomass methodology initially used by the fisheries service,the amount of harvestable fish is calculated by taking snapshots of the geographic distribution of pacific whiting at given points in time.id.at.the problem with the biomass method is that it fails to account for the annual migration patterns of pacific whiting,which can be influenced by ocean conditions,age,and food sources.this means that the abundance of pacific whiting in a particular area may dramatically differ from as the fish migrate for food or because of ocean conditions.consequently,the biomass snapshot method will only count those fish present in the makah tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds during the particular survey period,likely resulting in an underestimate of the actual numbers of pacific whiting passing through those fishing grounds.
instead of a biomass methodology,the makah tribe had long argued that a sliding scale methodology provided a better way to calculate its treaty share of the annual pacific whiting harvest.under the sliding scale method,the amount of pacific whiting allocated to the tribes varied,based on the amount of optimum yield the data supporting this approach indicates that the bulk of migratory pacific whiting pass through the makah tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds,thereby entitling the makah tribe to fifty percent of the bulk of the migratory pacific whiting harvest.midwater ii,at.when estimates of the optimum yield are less than metric tons mt,the makah tribe would be allocated percent of the optimum yield.after the estimate reached mt,the tribe portion would remain at 
before making the pacific whiting allocation,the fisheries service sought public comment on two allocation proposals.one proposal would have kept the tribe allocation the same as it had been for and.the other proposal would have relied upon the sliding scale methodology proposed by makah,which varied the tribe allocation as a percentage of the optimal yield.however,the fisheries service later determined that the tribe proposal of mt was a reasonable accommodation of the treaty right for in view of the remaining uncertainty surrounding the appropriate quantification.may.
in response to the fisheries service pacific whiting allocation,midwater and oregon filed a second suit in the district court in oregon,again challenging the agency allocation of pacific whiting to makah.this case was consolidated with midwater suit in the district court for the western district of washington.
in its second suit,midwater argued,among other things,that the pacific whiting allocation was illegal because it was not based on the best scientific information available.the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment on all of midwater claims,upholding the framework regulation and the allocation.midwater trawlers coop.dep t of commerce,d.
on appeal from that decision,we upheld the framework regulation that recognized and implemented the treaty rights of the four coastal tribes to harvest groundfish in their usual and accustomed fishing grounds.midwater ii,at holding that the makah tribe is entitled,pursuant to the treaty of neah bay,to one half the harvestable surplus of pacific whiting that passes through its usual and accustomed fishing grounds,or that much of the harvestable surplus as is necessary for tribal subsistence,whichever is less.however,we further concluded that the allocation of pacific whiting to the makah tribe did not comply with the act because the fisheries service failed to explain the allocation on the basis of the best available scientific information.id.at t he undisputed history leading up to the allocation decision,demonstrates that the rule was a product of pure political compromise,not reasoned scientific endeavor.although the fisheries service allocation may well be eminently fair,the act requires that it be founded on science and law,not pure diplomacy.accordingly,we remanded to the district court for the fisheries service to either promulgate a new allocation consistent with the law and based on the best available science,or to provide further justification for the current allocation that conforms to the requirements of the act and the treaty of neah bay.id.at.
eventually,the fisheries service agreed with the makah tribe that a sliding scale methodology was consistent with applicable law and treaty obligations.nevertheless,the state of oregon separately sought summary judgment to determine that the biomass allocation was the proper methodology.washington ii,d at.the district court issued its ruling on the merits of the sliding scale methodology used in the allocation,while the midwater ii appeal was pending with this court.id.at.in its order,the district court observed that the biomass method was likely to underestimate the amount of harvestable fish passing through the tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds.id.at.in addition,the district court noted that this method was not internationally recognized as the best measure for allocating marine fishery resources.id.rather,the sliding scale method was consistent with the act requirements and it embodie d the fisheries service reasoned opinion on how to best manage the nation fisheries resources while honoring the country treaty commitments.id.at.thus,the district court rejected the biomass method and held that the sliding scale method shall govern the united states aspect of the pacific whiting fishery until the secretary finds just cause for alteration or abandonment of the plan,the parties agree to a permissible alternative,or until further order issues from this court.id.
following our remand in midwater ii,the fisheries service issued its pacific whiting allocation.in that allocation,the fisheries service explained,
t he fisheries service has reviewed the best available scientific information,including the information contained in documents in the administrative record in the midwater trawlers case,and has also reviewed scientific information submitted by the fisheries service and the makah tribe in united states washington.the fisheries service has no additional information that alters the existing information on the distribution and migration pattern of the stock.therefore,the fisheries service is relying on the existing information as the best scientific information available.
at see also id.the fisheries service is relying on the existing information as the best scientific information available.
additionally,in january,the fisheries service sought public comment on its proposed rule to allocate makah tribe treaty share using the sliding scale method.in march,the fisheries service issued its final rules establishing the allocations of pacific whiting.see.in so doing,the fisheries service stated that the allocations were based on the best scientific information currently available.at.again,the fisheries service explained that it had 
no additional information that would change the conclusions in th e declarations of william robinson and richard methot,submitted in midwater trawlers cooperative department of commerce on the distribution and migratory pattern of the pacific whiting stock.therefore,the fisheries service is relying on the information in those declarations as the best scientific information currently available.accordingly,the fisheries service finds that the treaty indian allocation of pacific whiting mt to be taken by the makah tribe,which is based on the sliding scale methodology that has been in use since,is based on the best scientific information available,and is within the indian treaty right as described in midwater trawlers cooperative department of commerce,cir.
id.the fisheries service went on to reject the biomass methodology,explaining that,
the biomass method is not required for conservation and underestimates the quantity of fish that pass through the tribal usual and accustomed fishing grounds,and hence it can not serve as the basis for calculating the treaty share.also,application of the biomass method to calculate the treaty indian allocation of pacific whiting would illegally discriminate against tribal fishing interests,since the biomass method is not used in management of the fishery.also see makah brown,order on five motions relating to treaty halibut fishing at.
after the fisheries service issued its allocation,midwater sought an order from the district court directing the fisheries service to conduct new rulemaking and to enjoin the use of the sliding scale methodology until such rulemaking was complete.in response,the fisheries service argued that remand was unnecessary.rather,the fisheries service moved to supplement the administrative record with additional explanation for the scientific foundation underlying the use of the sliding scale methodology in the allocation.as part of its motion,the fisheries service included the declarations of william robinson,assistant regional manager for sustainable fisheries,and richard methot,the fisheries service senior advisor on groundfish issues.both declarations concluded that the available scientific information supported the sliding scale methodology adopted by the fisheries service.
the district court,in an order directly relevant to this appeal,granted the fisheries service motion to supplement the administrative record and granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.in so ruling,the district court denied midwater request to remand to the fisheries service for further rulemaking proceedings to clarify the basis of the sliding scale method of allocating pacific whiting.instead,the district court concluded that the sliding scale method met the requirements of the act.
according to the district court,the biomass method was not based on the best scientific information available.rather,the best available scientific information supported the sliding scale method.that information established that most pacific whiting pass through the makah tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds.in making the and allocations,the fisheries service relied on the sliding scale methodology after finding no additional information to change its scientific conclusions regarding pacific whiting migration patterns.because no additional information had come to light,the sliding scale methodology remained the best scientific information available.therefore,the district court concluded,a sliding scale methodology,which allocates the makah tribe rights on the basis of the entire yield,is based on the best scientific information available despite potential gaps and imperfections in the information,and remand to the fisheries service was not necessary.
in this appeal,midwater argues that the sliding scale method of allocation is not based on the best available scientific evidence as required by the act.midwater further contends that the district court should have vacated the challenged regulation and remanded to the fisheries service.
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal pursuant to.the district court order granting or denying summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see buono norton,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.the district court decision to supplement the record is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see fishing of alaska,united states,cir.
under section f of the act,f,which adopts the standard of review set forth in the apa at,regulations promulgated by the commerce secretary may be set aside only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow,and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.daley,at.rather,in reviewing such regulations,our only task is to determine whether the secretary has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.id.quoting.crab producers,mosbacher,cir.
discussion 
the best scientific information available 
the act requires that allocations between treaty and nontreaty fishers be based on the best scientific information available.a conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.see also parravano babbitt,aff,cir.nevertheless,t he fact that scientific information concerning a fishery is incomplete does not prevent regulation.b.indeed,by specifying that decisions be based on the best scientific information available,the act recognizes that such information may not be exact or totally complete.see.crab producers,at.
in allocating fish between treaty and nontreaty fishers,the location of where the fish are caught does not matter.washington.state commercial passenger fishing vessel ass n,d shares in the fish runs should not be affected by the place where the fish are taken.rather,any fish taken in washington waters or in united states waters off the coast of washington,taken from runs of fish that pass through the indians usual and accustomed fishing grounds,and taken by either members of the indian tribes that are parties to this litigation,on the one hand,or by citizens of washington,on the other hand,shall count against that party respective share of the fish.id.at.as we have already found,the makah tribe is entitled to one half of the pacific whiting passing through its usual and accustomed fishing grounds.midwater ii,at.
here,the primary dispute is the method to be used to determine the amount of pacific whiting that passes through the makah tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds.specifically,midwater challenges the fisheries service decision to base the makah tribe annual allocation on the sliding scale methodology proposed by the tribe.midwater argues that the method is the result of political compromise instead of scientific data.we conclude,however,that,although the fisheries service initial adoption of the sliding scale method may have been the result of a compromise,the fisheries service has amply demonstrated that it is the method supported by the best available scientific information.
as discussed above,the fisheries service initially believed that the biomass method was the best way to determine the tribe allocation of pacific whiting.nevertheless,the fisheries service also recognized that the biomass method had been rejected as contrary to the conservation necessity principle.further,the fisheries service data regarding the pacific whiting migratory pattern contradicted the biomass method snapshot calculation of the numbers of fish potentially exploitable by makah.
in contrast to the picture painted by the biomass method snapshot approach,the fisheries service data suggests that the pacific whiting migration pattern takes the bulk of the pacific whiting stock through the makah tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds.according to declarations by the fisheries service scientists,available data suggests that when pacific whiting migrate north,their migrations take place within makah tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds such that the bulk of pacific whiting stock pass through the tribe usual and accustomed fishing grounds.recognition of this migration pattern is significant because it means that all migrating coastal pacific whiting are potentially exploitable by makah.simply put,the biomass method snapshot approach fails to account for this migratory pattern and,thereby underestimates the numbers of fish passing through the tribe fishing grounds 
the sliding scale method,however,does account for the pacific whiting migratory patterns and,thus,overcomes the failings of the biomass approach.under the sliding scale method,the makah tribe would be allocated a percentage ranging from and percent of the optimum yield 
optimum yield is defined as the maximum sustainable yield from the fishery.b.by relying on the optimum yield,the sliding scale method presumes that the bulk of pacific whiting passes through and is exploitable by makah.this presumption is supported by the fisheries service data concerning migration patterns.thus far,the fisheries service has found no new information contradicting its data concerning pacific whiting migratory patterns or distribution.see.at.
because the best available scientific information supports a sliding scale method of allocation,we find that the fisheries service reliance on that method for allocating the tribal share of the pacific whiting harvest is neither arbitrary,capricious,nor an abuse of its discretion.f a daley,at.we agree with the district court that a sliding scale methodology,which allocates the makah tribe rights on the basis of the entire yield,is based on the best scientific information available despite potential gaps and imperfections in the information.
remand to the fisheries service was not necessary 
in midwater ii,we remanded to the fisheries service for the agency to promulgate a new allocation consistent with the law and based on the best available science,or to provide further justification for the current allocation that conforms to the requirements of the act and the treaty of neah bay.midwater ii,at emphasis added.midwater argues that the district court should have vacated the challenged regulation and remanded to the fisheries service for public rulemaking proceedings consistent with the act and the apa 
apa notice comment requirements 
under the apa,the fisheries service must provide notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register and allow a thirty day comment period.such notice shall include a statement of the time,place,and nature of public rule making proceedings reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed and either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.b.
midwater suggests that the fisheries service failed to engage in a public comment period as required by the apa.however,even before midwater moved the district court to remand to the fisheries service,the agency had already conducted a new rulemaking for the allocation.see.this rulemaking provided for a comment period.in making the allocation to the makah tribe,the fisheries service expressly referred to the administrative record and court proceedings and explained that it had reviewed and was relying upon the best available scientific information regarding the distribution and migration pattern of pacific whiting.see id.at the fisheries service is relying on the existing information as the best scientific information available.
moreover,before the district court ruled on the for summary judgment,the fisheries service again instituted a new rulemaking procedure and sought public comment on its proposed rule to allocate the makah tribe treaty share using the sliding scale method.two months later,the fisheries service issued its final rules establishing the allocations of pacific whiting.see.in so doing,the fisheries service again referred to the administrative record and court records in the consolidated challenges to the pacific whiting allocations and declared that the allocations were based on the best scientific information currently available.at finding that the treaty indian allocation of pacific whiting,based on the sliding scale methodology that has been in use since,is based on the best scientific information available,and is within the indian treaty right s as described in midwater trawlers department of commerce,cir.
midwater,however,argues that both the fisheries service and federal register notices failed to cogently explain why the allocation satisfies the act.in particular,midwater complains that the fisheries service has failed to explain exactly why a particular fixed but sliding percentage of the overall harvest of pacific whiting reasonably reflects the amount of pacific whiting that is harvestable in tribal usual and accustomed fishing areas.
midwater correctly notes that we have previously confirmed that the fisheries service is obligated to comply with the notice and comment provisions of the apa.see nrdc evans,cir.however,evans did not address the contours of the notice requirement,only that the fisheries service must comply and that it must engage in analysis when seeking a good cause exception to the apa notice requirement.se
