martin,south dakota is a city of people located adjacent to the pine ridge and rosebud indian reservations.the city is divided into three,dual member wards,each of which elects its two aldermen every two years in staggered terms.make up nearly of the total population and of the population.only twice since has an candidate been elected alderman.in each case,their election was uncontested.
the american civil liberties union brought an action on behalf of two native americans in district court,challenging the,and elections.the complaint alleged that the city wards were configured in a manner that intentionally and effectively diluted the voting strength of and kept aldermen candidates from being elected,contrary to the provisions of the voting rights act of and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the district court denied relief,concluding that the white majority did not usually vote in a way to defeat the candidate.we disagree and remand the matter to the district court to complete the analysis required by the united states supreme court pursuant to section of the voting rights act as construed by thornberg gingles,d.if the district court then finds in favor of the plaintiffs,it shall develop a plan under which will have a reasonable opportunity to elect an candidate.
background 
for more than a decade martin has been the focus of racial tension between and whites.in the,protests were held to end a racially offensive homecoming tradition that depicted in a demeaning,stereotypical fashion.concurrently,the united states justice department sued and later entered into a consent decree with the local bank requiring an end to redlining loan practices and policies that adversely affected,and censuring the bank because it did not employ any.most recently,resolution specialists from the justice department attempted to mediate an end to claims of racial discrimination by the local sheriff against.
with these conflicts as a background,martin redrew the city wards because population shifts had rendered the existing boundaries obsolete.after the new wards were drawn and published as ordinance,attorneys for a public interest group alleged the new boundaries violated the,principle,see reynolds sims,d,and that the boundaries violated section of the voting rights act.
in march,new districts were drawn to address the,violation.after review by the south dakota attorney general office,the city council adopted the new ward boundaries and implemented them under ordinance after a failed attempt under south dakota law to refer the ordinance to a voter referendum,see south dakota codified laws,plaintiffs initially brought suit alleging ordinance violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the district court dismissed the complaint as moot because that ordinance had been repealed by ordinance,but the court also granted plaintiff motion to supplement its complaint to include the allegations currently pending before this court.
in march,the district court entered a final judgment disposing of all of the parties claims.it found that although the plaintiffs met the first two conditions of gingles,the plaintiffs failed to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,the third gingles precondition.as a result,the district court concluded the plaintiffs could not prevail in their vote dilution claim.additionally,the court concluded that,since there was not sufficient evidence to prove a or effects claim,the plaintiffs also could not prove that the city of martin adopted and maintained ordinance for a discriminatory purpose.
the district court findings regarding the factual context are reviewed for clear error.harvell blytheville sch,cir en banc.legal conclusions,including those that may infect a mixed finding of law and fact,or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law,are subject to de novo review.id.quoting gingles,at.
the essence of a claim is that a certain electoral law,practice,or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred candidates.gingles,at.section of the voting rights act provides that a denial of the right to vote occurs when 
based on the totality of the circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
the supreme court in gingles established three preconditions to establishing a section claim 
that the minority group is large enough and geographically compact enough that it would be a majority in a district that the minority group is politically cohesive in the sense that its members vote in a similar fashion and that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it,in the absence of special circumstances,to usually defeat the minority preferred candidate.
harvell,at citing gingles,at.if the three gingles preconditions are met,the court then considers the totality of the circumstances.id.at.failure to establish all three preconditions defeats a section claim.clay bd.of,cir 
the district court found that the plaintiffs met the first two,but failed to meet the third,gingles preconditions.we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs fulfilled the first two preconditions.as to the third precondition,we hold the plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the white majority votes as a bloc to usually defeat candidates.
to establish the first gingles precondition,a plaintiff must demonstrate a proper and workable remedy exists.stabler county of thurston,cir.the plaintiffs in this case offered three redistricting plans.the first redistricts martin into three wards and creates at least one majority ward.the second redistricts martin into six wards and creates at least two majority wards.both would allow in martin a more reasonable opportunity to place two representatives on the martin city council.the third plan eliminates all ward boundaries and implements a system in which three members of the city council would be elected in each election.according to expert testimony,this would allow a reasonable opportunity to elect at least two representatives to the martin city council.the district court found that the first two plans presented proper and workable remedies that could be implemented to alleviate the inequalities of the current system,but determined that it lacked the authority to authorize the remedy proposed in the third plan.
martin disagrees with the district court and argues that the first two plans presented by the plaintiffs are not viable or stable.we agree with the district court.the ultimate viability and effectiveness of a remedy is considered at the remedial stage of litigation and not during analysis of the gingles preconditions.at the initial stage,the plaintiff must only show that minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practices.gingles,at.see also dickinson indiana state election,cir houston lafayette county,cir.although martin argues the plans are not viable or stable,the ultimate end of the first gingles precondition is to prove that a solution is possible,and not necessarily to present the final solution to the problem.gingles,at.
the equal protection clause is violated if race is the predominant factor motivating the placement of a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.stabler,at stating that bizarrely shaped districts considered in combination with racial and population densities of the proposed districts,support a finding that race was the predominant factor in drawing proposed districts to create a district.as the district court noted,examples of bizarrely shaped districts that should raise concern include those that look like a sacred mayan bird,with its body running eastward s pindly legs reach south while the plumed head rises northward an open beak appears to be searching for worms.appellants add.at quoting bush vera,d additional citations omitted.section compactness inquiry should take into account traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries.abrams johnson,d quoting bush,at.miller johnson,d recognizing respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests as a traditional,districting principle shaw reno,d recognizing population equality as a sound districting principle.
in this case,we agree that the shapes of the proposed districts would not draw constitutional scrutiny because the districts are not primarily based on race.the record reflects that the proposed plans follow census blocks,marked streets,exhibited more than point contiguity,created wards of equal population,and recognized traditional neighborhoods.moreover,martin has maintained a ward system for at least forty years,proving its stability.furthermore,according to census figures used at trial,it is highly unlikely that a majority district would fail to maintain its majority over time because the population in martin is increasing rather than decreasing for these reasons,we affirm the district court finding that the community in martin is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.
to satisfy the second gingles precondition,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the minority group is politically cohesive.if the minority group is not politically cohesive,it can not be said that the selection of a multimember electoral structure thwarts distinctive minority group interests.gingles,at.evidence of political cohesiveness is shown by minority voting preferences,distinct from the majority,demonstrated in actual elections,and can be established with the same evidence plaintiffs must offer to establish racially polarized voting,because political cohesiveness is implicit in racially polarized voting.sanchez colorado,cir.
proving political cohesiveness requires evaluating elections through statistical and evidence.growe emison,d finding the district court erred in concluding political cohesiveness was proven where it was unsupported by statistical or anecdotal evidence.the district court relied on three proven approaches to evaluating elections homogenous precinct analysis,bivariate ecological regression analysis,and ecological inference.see rural.affairs council sundquist,cir considering homogenous precinct analysis and bivariate ecological regression analysis teague attala county,cir holding that the district court erred by disregarding the established acceptance of regression analysis as a standard method for analyzing racially polarized voting.
we agree with the district court that the record is clear that the statistical and analysis proved political cohesion within the community.statistically,experts from both sides found that the population on average voted for the same candidates more than of the time.see african american voting rights legal def.fund,villa,cir noting that majority is merely a guideline,not an absolute threshold,for finding political cohesion.lay testimony demonstrates that in martin and the surrounding area were politically cohesive.examples of cohesion include political protests against the abuse of rights,the endorsement of a slate of political candidates,and the use of tribal governments to confront social issues such as education and housing.
martin argues that if are politically cohesive,it is because of their political partisanship,and not because of racial identity.although potentially relevant in the totality of the circumstances analysis,the reason for the cohesion is irrelevant in the threshold determination of whether the gingles preconditions are met.goosby town,cir interpreting gingles as treating causation as irrelevant in the inquiry into three gingles preconditions lewis alamance county,cir same.to imply that party affiliation should negate political cohesion would have the effect of denying minority voters an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice regardless of the reason.goosby,at.for these reasons,we affirm the district court decision that the community in martin is a politically cohesive minority group.
a racial voting bloc exists where there is a consistent relationship between the race of the voter and the way in which the voter votes,or to put it differently,where black voters and white voters vote differently.gingles,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.to be legally significant for the purposes of gingles,the plaintiff must show that whites vote sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the minority preferred candidates.id.at.see also sanchez,at.the correct question is not whether white voters demonstrate an unbending or unalterable hostility to whoever may be the minority group representative of choice,but whether,as a practical matter,the usual result of the bloc voting that exists is the defeat of the candidate.jenkins red clay consol.sch.dist.bd.of,cir.t he presence of racially polarized voting will ordinarily be the keystone of a vote dilution case.buckanaga sisseton indep.sch,cir.
to determine whether the white majority voted as a bloc to defeat the candidate,three inquiries are required.first,who are the candidates old person cooney,cir.second,did the white majority vote as a bloc to defeat the minority preferred candidate id.and third,were there special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running unopposed,present when candidates won gingles,at.
in our view the district court erred in three respects when it determined the white majority usually did not defeat the candidate.first,it did not give sufficient weight to the exit poll of the elections.second,it did not give any weight to the results of the,and aldermanic elections.finally,the district court relied exclusively on county,state,and national elections in determining that the evidence failed to prove that candidates usually lost elections.
first,the district court rejected the exit poll results of the aldermanic races in wards i and iii.in ward i,the candidate received an adjusted of the white vote and of the vote.in ward iii,the candidate received almost of the white vote and almost of the vote.the district court rejected these results because it believed the poll failed to ascertain a representative sample of the voters as a whole and because there was inconsistency between the poll results and the actual returns.
in our view,it was clear error to reject these statistics.although the exit poll probably white voters and likely voters,the results show that despite a cohesive political effort by voters,their candidates for alderman were defeated.we find this,at the very least,probative.see johnson de grandy,d jenkins,at holding that the third gingles factor may be satisfied with a variety of evidence,including lay testimony or statistical analysis of voting patterns.because the record reflects that and whites are,by and large,the only racial groups in martin,the only conceivable explanation for the results of the exit poll and the final election tallies is that the white majority voted as a bloc against candidates.see buckanaga,at stating that t he surest indication of race conscious politics is a pattern of racially polarized voting extending over time collins city of norfolk,cir holding that racially polarized voting patterns can establish both cohesiveness of the minority group and the power of white bloc voting to defeat the minority candidates.
second,the district court ignored the results of the,and aldermanic elections.the record clearly reflects that in,the candidates for alderman in each of the three wards lost.in,the candidates for alderman in wards i and iii lost.and in,the candidates for alderman in each of the wards lost.
the district court clearly erred when it ignored these election results.the plaintiffs presented eight aldermanic elections over the span of three years that established a sufficient pattern of defeat for candidates in martin aldermanic elections.see gingles,at.finding data from three election years,involving minority candidates,sufficient to uphold district court ruling citizens for a better gretna city of gretna,cir,cert.denied,d stating that gingles suggests flexibility in the face of sparse data.importantly,it is these martin aldermanic are at the center of this litigation.clark calhoun county,cir holding that virtual absence of electoral success in relevant district has the greatest impact on the evaluation of claims.in short,the absence of aldermen,combined with evidence of racially polarized voting,provides striking proof of vote dilution in martin.
third,the district court found that the results of county,state,and national elections supported the view that candidates did not usually lose elections in martin.at the national level,the district court factored in the and races for united states senate and house of representatives as indications that candidates were able to win elections.at the state level,victories by the candidate in the elections for state senate district,state house district,state auditor,state secretary of state,and state treasurer were considered as part of the analysis of the third gingles precondition.the district court also used county elections such as the races for county commissioner,sheriff,and school board as examples of candidates who won elections.the court held these elections were evidence that the candidates did not usually lose their elections in spite of the white majority bloc.
in our view,these elections provide very little evidence of whether martin ward system allows to elect their preferred candidates.although it can be appropriate to factor in exogenous elections these elections are meant to supplement,not replace,endogenous elections.see clay,at.the data gained from state and national elections did little to reveal whether there was racial polarization within the city of martin ward system.for example,citing tom daschle victory in the united states senate race may prove the relevance of the vote throughout the state,but daschle victory fails to reveal whether martin ward system allows residents to elect their preferred candidates to alderman.accord westwego citizens for better gov t city of westwego,cir stating that evidence derived from exogenous elections must be evaluated according to its probative value.because of their scope,state and national elections offered little probative insight into whether martin ward system violated section of the voting rights act.the same can be said for election results from bennett county,where martin is located.candidates fare better in the county simply because make up percent of the county population while whites make up percent of the county voting age population.see id.at focusing its analysis on the exogenous data from the precincts of the jurisdiction directly at issue 
considering the entirety of evidence presented in this case,we hold that the plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the white majority usually defeated the candidate in martin aldermanic elections.first,the exit poll clearly showed racial polarization.see de grandy,at.recognizing that the ultimate conclusions about equality or inequality of opportunity were intended by congress to be judgments resting on comprehensive,not limited,canvassing of relevant facts harvell,at considering statistical analysis,exit polling,and lay testimony.although predominantly voted for the candidates,those candidates lost when the actual votes were counted.because and whites make up more than of martin population,the only conclusion available is that whites voted as a bloc to defeat the candidates.see buckanaga,at.
secondly,whereas the district court did not give the aldermanic election results of through probative value,we consider these elections central to the analysis of whether there was a section violation.the plaintiffs proved the third gingles precondition in part because the aldermanic election results of through reveal the candidates for alderman always lost these elections.see gingles,at.jenkins,recognizing the most important aspect of the analysis is to determine whether the white voting bloc usually results in the defeat of the candidate.finally,county,state,and national election results were not probative in determining whether martin ward system denied a reasonable opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.
conclusion 
for each of the reasons noted herein,we reverse the decision of the district court and find that the plaintiffs met,by a preponderance of the evidence,all three gingles preconditions.thus,we remand the matter to the district court with instructions to initially determine whether,in view of the fact that plaintiffs have met all three gingles preconditions,the plaintiffs are entitled to relief in light of the totality of the circumstances.the supreme court has listed the following factors as relevant in the totality of the circumstances analysis 
the history of discrimination in the state or political subdivision the extent to which voting in the state or subdivision is racially polarized the extent to which the state or subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance opportunities for discrimination against the minority group whether minority candidates have been denied access to any process the extent to which minorities have borne the effects of past discrimination in relation to education,employment,and health whether local political campaigns have used overt or subtle racial appeals the extent to which minority group members have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of members of the minority group and whether the policy underlying the use of voting qualifications is tenuous.
harvell,at citing gingles at.this court has previously focused the totality of the circumstances analysis on racial polarization and the ability to elect candidates under the challenged scheme.id.at.
plaintiffs do not need to prove a particular number of the factors or prove that a majority of them point one way or the other.rather,the final determination of whether the voting strength of minority voters is canceled out demands the court overall judgment,based on the totality of the circumstances and guided by those relevant factors in the particular case.whitfield democratic party,cir quoting,at internal quotations and modifications omitted.
in the event the district court finds that under the totality of the circumstances,the plaintiffs are entitled to relief,the district court shall devise and implement a remedy that will give in martin a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates to alderman.in so doing,the defendant shall be given an opportunity to propose a remedy within a specified amount of time.see cane worcester county,cir.the court should then review the proposed order to determine whether it is legally unacceptable.id.if the defendant fails to propose a legally acceptable remedy,the district court shall devise a plan that ensures that candidates have a reasonable chance of prevailing in martin municipal elections for alderman.among its options,the district court has the discretion to implement any of the three plans presented by the plaintiffs 
the appeal in this case,involving a claim under section of the voting rights act,focuses on the third precondition for such a claim established in thornburg gingles,d.the district court found that the plaintiffs had not established that the white majority in martin,south dakota,votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running to defeat the minority preferred candidate.id.at.because i do not believe the district court clearly erred in its conclusion that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden,i would affirm the judgment of the district court.
vote dilution claims are peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case,requiring an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral me
