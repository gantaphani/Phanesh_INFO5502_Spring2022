ii.background 
the events giving rise to the charged conduct occurred while benally was acting as guardian to his twelve year old granddaughter,mother,rowena,had left and her two sisters,and,ages six and four,respectively,in the care of benally while rowena was living in phoenix,arizona.benally also had custody of two of his natural children,a old boy,and,a old girl.on august,benally took all five children swimming at a river near the family sheep farm on the navajo reservation in white mesa,utah.the group spent the night in the family hogan.
according to testimony at trial,and her sisters were sharing a bed,and slept on a separate bed,and benally slept on a couch between the two beds.at some point during the night,woke up to find benally naked and holding a knife to her neck.testified benally said he would cut her if she resisted him.she claimed to have pushed benally away with her legs and to have grabbed the knife and thrown it across the room.said benally then choked her and attempted to remove her from the hogan by pulling her hair and dragging her towards the door.she claimed that at least some of the other children were awake and crying.testified she lost consciousness from being choked,but that when she regained consciousness,she was back on the bed,her clothing had been removed,and benally was applying lotion to and rubbing her genitals with his fingers and penis and kissing her legs and breasts.asserted benally eventually stopped,put his clothes on,grabbed his car keys,and said he was going to commit suicide.she said he gave her dollars and asked her not to disclose the events that had transpired.benally ultimately did not leave because asked him to stay to drive and back to their boarding school.
the other young children present during the alleged assault also testified at trial.none had a very detailed recollection of the incident,which occurred almost three years earlier,but most remembered either seeing benally without his clothes on top of or said benally was next to on the bed.several indicated they were scared or crying or heard crying or screaming.the testimony of,the oldest child among the group other than,corroborated testimony as to benally use of a knife in threatening,but testimony was that benally put the knife away when he got off of and put on his clothes.also corroborated assertion that benally gave her money at the end of the incident.
testified that,after benally got off of her,she went outside with her sisters,but when it started sprinkling,benally told her to come back inside and go to sleep.the next day,benally took all the children back to his house in teec nos pos,arizona.after returning to benally home,told her fifteen year old neighbor and friend that her grandfather had almost raped her,but asked him not to tell anyone.a few days later,she told another neighbor,georginda pierce,that benally had almost raped her and repeated the same allegations to pierce mother,lucinda pierce.lucinda pierce called mother,rowena.and her sisters were then taken to child haven,a child welfare agency,and then sent to live with virginia,benally sister.admitted she did not reveal all of the details of the encounter to the first doctor she spoke with because he was a male and she did not feel comfortable talking to him.she also admitted she omitted details when initially interviewed by defense investigators because other children were present.
physical examinations of did not reveal evidence indicative of the alleged assault.georginda pierce testified that,at the time related the story to her,she did not see any bruising on neck.herself admitted she did not sustain any cuts even though she had grabbed the knife blade with both hands.a nurse at child haven who saw after reported the incident to pierce did not indicate on an intake form that had any bruises or other injuries.thirteen days after the incident,the indian health service doctor who examined did not see any marks or bruising on body.a nurse who examined about five weeks after the incident found no physical evidence of the attack described but said that in most cases,there would be no evidence of digital penetration of female genitalia.
there was also testimony at trial about propensity for truthfulness uncle and benally son,stanford benally,testified had lived with him for two years when she was about seven years old,five years before the alleged assault,and was often untruthful.virginia,who had herself been raped by benally as a child,testified lived with her during the school year following the alleged assault and said sometimes told lies.she agreed that,if said something,one could not know if it was true.the nurse at child haven who examined after the incident knew from multiple stays at the agency and testified was not honest most of the time.another child haven employee indicated lies and steals and was dishonest.a social worker from the school attended during the school year preceding the incident,however,testified that was pretty honest and took responsibility for her actions.the defense also highlighted inconsistencies in account of the incident,bringing out the differences between the story she told the doctor who initially examined her,the nurse who examined her five weeks after the alleged assault,and testimony at trial.
finally,evidence of four of benally other sexual assault and child molestation crimes was admitted under federal rules of evidence and.the admission of this evidence is the sole issue on appeal.ruling on benally motion in limine to exclude the evidence,the court admitted evidence of three of benally prior offenses without an evidentiary hearing because each had resulted in a conviction and the court determined their probative value was not substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,pursuant to rule.the court also ultimately admitted evidence of a fourth incident involving the rape of rowena,benally daughter and mother,after holding an evidentiary hearing and concluding a jury could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the rape occurred and that the evidence should not be excluded under rule.
in brief,the four incidents testified to were as follows 
betty testified that benally sister was married to her brother.she stated that when she was about twenty years old,about forty years earlier,benally came to her house when she was home alone babysitting,chased her into a sheep corral about a half a mile from her home,pushed her and held her down,hit her in the eye and on the cheek,and had sexual intercourse with her.benally was charged with rape,but pleaded guilty to assault and battery.the rape charge was dismissed.
sarah testified benally was once married to her older sister daughter.she indicated that,when she was thirteen,or about forty years prior to the current trial,benally came to her home,threw her on the floor,and had forcible sexual intercourse with her.benally pleaded guilty to rape.
virginia,benally sister,testified that,when she was thirteen or fourteen,she lived at the sheep camp with her mother.after a drunken benally and their mother argued,virginia left the family home and ran toward a nearby hill.benally followed virginia down the hill,stabbed her in the arm with a can opener,and pushed her back up the hill and into his truck.he drove a mile or two,put her in the back of the truck and had sexual intercourse with her.her mother came to retrieve her and took her to a hospital where she spoke with police.benally was ultimately convicted by a jury of raping his sister.
rowena,mother and benally daughter,testified that benally raped her when she was approximately ten or twelve years old,nineteen to years before the alleged incident involving benally had picked up rowena and her brother,stanford,from school on a friday.he took them to the sheep camp and hogan in which the alleged assault against occurred.benally had been drinking and asked rowena if she would have sex with him.rowena tried to escape to her grandmother house next door by asking if she could go outside to the bathroom,but benally accompanied her outside.when rowena and benally the hogan,benally instructed rowena to lie on his bed and had sexual intercourse with her.rowena testified she told her grandmother and stepmother about the incident,but that neither did anything to help her.she indicated her brother,stanford,had been present during the rape.later in the trial,stanford corroborated rowena testimony.no criminal charges were ever filed.
the district court twice gave cautionary jury instructions to mitigate the prejudicial impact of the rule evidence.before the testimony regarding the prior incidents began,the court instructed the jury as follows 
members of the jury,i want to give you a cautionary instruction now because we are about to hear some evidence with this witness and two witnesses that will follow after her,some evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault or child molestation.
in a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault or child molestation,evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault or child molestation is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.however,evidence of a prior offense on its own is not sufficient to prove the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the indictment.bear in mind as you consider this evidence,at all times the government has the burden of proving that the defendant committed each of the elements of the offense charged in the indictment.i remind you that the defendant is not on trial for any act,conduct or offense not charged in the indictment.
before the jury began deliberating,the court again cautioned the jury against improper use of the rule evidence,instructing the jury,
in a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault or child molestation,evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault or child molestation is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.
however,evidence of a prior offense on its own is not sufficient to prove the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the indictment.bear in mind as you consider this evidence at all times,the government has the burden of proving that the defendant committed each of the elements of the offense charged in the indictment.i remind you that the defendant is not on trial for any act,conduct,or offense not charged in the indictment.
on appeal,benally contends the district court erroneously concluded in its rule analysis that the probative value of the rule evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.benally argues the prior acts have little probative value because they are dissimilar from the alleged assault involving,happened too long ago,and were infrequent.benally also argues the prior incidents all occurred when he was an alcoholic and that he no longer drinks.finally,benally claims the rule evidence was unnecessary.benally contends the admission of the evidence prejudiced the jury and amounted to error that was not harmless.
iii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.united states stiger,cir.a district court ruling will not be disturbed absent a distinct showing it was based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact or an erroneous conclusion of law or manifests a clear error of judgment.id.quotation omitted.if this court concludes the admission of evidence was erroneous,it must then consider whether the error was harmless.id.
federal rules of evidence and address propensity evidence in the context of sexual assault and child molestation.these rules provide an exception to the general rule codified in rule a,which prohibits the admission of evidence for the purpose of showing a defendant propensity to commit bad acts.see united states guardia,cir.pursuant to rule a,when the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault,evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible,and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.rule a contains identical language related to accusations of child molestation consistent with congressional intent regarding the admission of evidence tending to show the defendant propensity to commit sexual assault or child molestation,courts are to liberally admit evidence of prior uncharged sex offenses.united states meacham,cir.
under guardia and united states mchorse,cir,evidence of a prior sexual assault must meet three threshold requirements before it may be considered for admission.the district court must determine the defendant is accused of a crime involving sexual assault or child molestation,the evidence proffered is evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses involving sexual assault or child molestation,and the evidence is relevant.mchorse,at guardia,at.relevant evidence is that which has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.even where evidence is determined to be relevant,however,the admissibility of rule evidence is subject to the rule balancing test,which permits the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.guardia,at quoting.holding rule applies to determine the admissibility of rule evidence meacham,at stating rule evidence is subject to rule balancing.
in united states enjady,cir,this court explained that in cases where the government seeks to introduce rule evidence,the district court must make a preliminary finding that a jury could reasonably find that the other act occurred by a preponderance of the evidence.the district court should then consider 
how clearly the prior act has been proved how probative the evidence is of the material fact it is admitted to prove how seriously disputed the material fact is and whether the government can avail itself of any less prejudicial evidence.when analyzing the probative dangers,a court considers how likely it is such evidence will contribute to an jury verdict the extent to which such evidence will distract the jury from the central issues of the trial and how time consuming it will be to prove the prior conduct.
id.quotation omitted.to further assist district courts in analyzing probativeness under the second enjady factor,the guardia court enumerated considerations which may influence the court analysis,including the similarity of the prior acts and the charged acts,the time lapse between the other acts and the charged acts,the frequency of the prior acts,the occurrence of intervening events,and the need for evidence beyond the defendant and alleged victim testimony.guardia,at.
when the government seeks to introduce rule or evidence,the district court has an obligation to fully evaluate the proffered evidence and make a clear record of the reasoning behind its findings as to whether the evidence survives the rule balancing test.see also united states castillo,cir.the district court fulfilled that obligation in this case.it carefully addressed the enjady and guardia factors and reached a permissible conclusion regarding the admissibility of the testimonial evidence.
the district court first determined benally prior conduct was relevant and the other guardia threshold requirements had been met.the court then methodically addressed the enjady factors to determine whether the evidence was excludable under rule.as to the first three incidents,the court co
