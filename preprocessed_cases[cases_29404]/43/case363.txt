the cabazon band of mission indians tribe appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to the county of riverside county and its sheriff larry smith sheriff collectively,defendants.through its suit,the tribe seeks a determination that vehicles operated by its public safety department are authorized emergency vehicles permitted to use and display emergency light bars while traveling on public roads between the noncontiguous portions of the tribe reservation.before the tribe suit,defendants repeatedly stopped and cited the tribe police officers for violating california vehicle code whenever the officers traveled on nonreservation roads to respond to emergency calls from different portions of the reservation.the tribe argues that prohibiting its emergency vehicles from displaying emergency light bars creates an undue burden on its ability to effectively perform law enforcement functions.because we conclude that applying the light bar prohibition to the tribe police vehicles is discriminatory,we reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
the tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe located in riverside county,california.the tribe operates a public safety department with seventeen officers who provide civil and criminal law enforcement services on its reservation lands.the reservation comprises four noncontiguous sections of land,with approximately thirteen miles of roads linking the most distant sections.because of this separation,it is not possible to drive between the different sections without leaving reservation land and driving on public roads.consequently,the tribe police officers must drive across sections of public highways on nonreservation land in the county of riverside in order to provide law enforcement services to the entire reservation.
uniformed and armed tribal police officers patrol the reservation in marked tribal police vehicles.the tribe public safety department receives federal funding and its officers receive mandatory federal law enforcement training.the vehicles bear government licenses issued by the bureau of indian affairs bia and are marked on the sides and rear with the words tribal law enforcement and on the sides with cabazon.in the past,the vehicles were also equipped with emergency light bars on their roofs.however,because the tribe police officers were repeatedly stopped and cited by local law enforcement for violations of the california vehicle code when driving on nonreservation lands,the tribe removed the light bars.
the california vehicle code vehicle code limits the display or use of emergency light bars to authorized emergency vehicles performing emergency services.see cal.a.prior to commencement of this suit,the county of riverside sheriff department repeatedly stopped the tribe police officers vehicles on public highways between the sections of the tribe reservation.the tribe officers were cited for displaying emergency light bars in violation of the vehicle code because the tribal police vehicles were not designated authorized emergency vehicles within the meaning of vehicle code section.
to avoid repeated stops and arrests,chief paul hare,the tribe director of public safety,instructed his officers to place canvas covers over their vehicles light bars when they left the reservation.as a result,an officer responding to an emergency call had to stop before leaving the reservation,get the covers out of the vehicle trunk,attach the covers over the vehicle light bars,and then continue on the emergency call.according to chief hare,the efforts to cover the lights proved to be unworkable and hazardous,delaying response time by several minutes and creating a serious officer safety issue.consequently,chief hare ordered the light bars removed from the vehicles to avoid further stops and the resulting delays.chief hare maintains that operating the vehicles without the light bars or with covered light bars creates a continuing danger to the safety of his officers and compromises their ability to perform their duties further,operating the vehicles without the light bars conflicts with bia requirements that the tribe police officers display such light bars when acting in their law enforcement capacity 
in june,the tribe filed suit seeking to enjoin the county and sheriff from stopping and arresting its police officers when they traveled across nonreservation lands in tribal police vehicles on official business.the tribe also sought a declaration that its police vehicles could be equipped with uncovered emergency light bars while traveling on public roads between the noncontiguous sections of its reservation 
the district court denied the tribe summary judgment motion,finding that prohibiting the tribe from using or displaying emergency light bars on public highways not located in indian country did not create an undue or excessive burden on the tribe ability to effectively perform its law enforcement functions.cabazon band of mission indians smith,d hereinafter cabazon i.in reaching this result,the district court applied the balancing test set out in white mountain apache tribe bracker,d.because it found that the vehicle code did not significantly interfere with the tribe law enforcement activities or federal policies promoting those activities,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.
in an opinion that was later withdrawn,a divided panel of this court affirmed the denial of the tribe summary judgment motion,but on grounds that differed from those relied on by the district court.cabazon band of mission indians smith,cir.hereinafter cabazon ii,vacated,cir.in the cabazon ii majority view,the county regulation of the tribe use of emergency light bars occurred entirely off reservation and,thus,white mountain balancing test was inapplicable.instead,the majority applied the standard articulated in mescalero apache tribe jones,d.under mescalero,a nondiscriminatory state law applied to indian activities outside a tribe reservation boundaries is federally preempted only where the state law is contrary to express federal law.id.at.finding no express law to the contrary,and concluding that it was undisputed that california vehicle code is nondiscriminatory state law,the cabazon ii majority held that the vehicle code limitation on the use and display of emergency light bars to authorized emergency vehicles,applied to the tribe police vehicles traveling on public highways.at.
on july,while the tribe petition for rehearing in cabazon ii was pending,the tribe and the bia office of law enforcement services entered into a deputation agreement.pursuant to that agreement,the bia can issue special law enforcement commissions commissions to tribal police officers.the purpose of the agreement is to provide for efficient,effective,and cooperative law enforcement efforts in and around indian country in the state of california,and its terms are to be interpreted in that spirit.in keeping with its goal,the deputation agreement delegates certain federal law enforcement authority to tribal police officers commissioned by the bia.deputation of tribal law enforcement officers authorizes them to assist the bia in its duties to provide law enforcement services and to make lawful arrests in indian country so that law enforcement officers are able to react immediately to observed violations of the law and other emergency situations.
the bia has established certain minimum standards and certification requirements with which its commissioned officers must comply to obtain and maintain their commissions.to receive commissions,applicants must be at least years old,must undergo an fbi background check performed by the tribe chief law enforcement officer,must be employees with a law enforcement program,and must be certified by the bia or by the state.commissioned officers are also required to undergo firearms certification and must not have any felony convictions.id.an application must include,among other things,proof of the applicant police training,current firearms qualifications,and a written acknowledgment that the applicant has reviewed and has agreed to comply with the bia law enforcement services code of conduct.the commissions expire every three years,after which the officers must reapply to the bia and the tribe chief law enforcement officer must their qualifications.id.
since the tribe entered into the deputation agreement,nearly all of its police officers now carry commissions and,therefore,are commissioned as agents of the federal government.commissioned officers are granted the same law enforcement authority as officers of the bia,and tribal police offers carrying commissions are authorized to enforce a ll federal criminal laws applicable to indian country.while exercising any bia law enforcement responsibility in indian country,commissioned tribal police officers are treated as federal employees under the federal tort claims act the deputation agreement also requires that the tribe comply with the bia law enforcement handbook of the office of law enforcement services,which mandates that police vehicles operated by commissioned officers be equipped with emergency light bars.
in light of the deputation agreement,the cabazon ii panel withdrew its opinion and remanded for the district court to consider the deputation agreement impact on the issues in this case.cabazon band of mission indians smith,cir hereinafter,cabazon iii.
on february,the bia published internal policies on the authority and obligations of parties to the deputation agreement,including officers.according to the bia,i t is common for tribes to have difficulty getting local or state law enforcement to respond to crimes,such as domestic violence,occurring on the reservations.this difficulty creates a critical void in law enforcement in indian country that the commissions fill.id.
the bia february notice highlights the bia requirement that its commissioned officers use certain equipment and drive certain vehicles for both the officers and the public safety.the notice stresses that federally commissioned tribal officers should be able to respond to calls immediately and with all of the necessary and recommended law enforcement tools.it further specifies that tribal officers maintain their law enforcement responsibilities and certain authorities irrespective of whether they are located in indian country.according to the bia,the boundaries of indian country should not impede officers travel,use of marked vehicles,emergency response,and other incidental aspects of their indian country policing authority.
on july,bia law enforcement services issued a revised model deputation agreement model agreement,which the bia will use in issuing future commissions under the model agreement,tribal police officers are expected to operate marked police vehicles with light bars.according to bia law enforcement services,such equipment is necessary for the safety of the officers,and to communicate to the general public and those suspected of criminal activities the officer status and authority.
the model agreement also recognizes that tribal officers may sometimes be required to leave indian country to carry out their official duties,and cites as an example the need for officers to respond to an incident in another area of indian country.thus,the model agreement specifies that even when traveling outside indian country commissioned officers maintain their federal law enforcement status and are still required to use marked vehicles equipped with emergency light bars.accordingly,commissioned officers responding to a call that may involve a federal offense or undertaking any duty that may relate to their federal functions continue to function as bia officers irrespective of the boundaries of the tribe reservation or the location of indian country.moreover,when responding to an emergency that may involve a federal offense,officers must respond in emergency mode and travel to the site of the call as quickly and safely as possible,irrespective of the boundaries of indian country.
on may,the tribe received a letter from the commissioner of the california highway patrol,helmick.helmick letter takes a position contrary to that of the defendants.in his letter,helmick recognizes that vehicle code section would allow the tribe commissioned police officers to utilize authorized emergency vehicles in the performance of their duties.he further expresses his opinion that it was reasonable for vehicles equipped with light bars to be used when tribal officers traveled off reservation.nevertheless,helmick recommends that the tribe officers not activate their vehicle emergency light bars when traveling on public roads absent extraordinary conditions.this recommendation is at odds with the deputation agreement requirement that the tribe commissioned police officers respond in emergency mode and travel to an emergency as quickly and as safely as possible,regardless of reservation boundaries.
on june,the tribe filed a renewed motion for summary judgment,based primarily on the deputation agreement and commissioner helmick letter.the district court again denied the tribe motion and,instead,granted summary judgment to defendants.
in granting summary judgment to defendants,the district court held that the deputation agreement did not convert the tribe police vehicles into authorized emergency vehicles under vehicle code section d the bia requirement that tribal police vehicles have emergency lights did not constitute federal law preempting the state law prohibiting the tribe use or display of light bars while traveling public roads between reservation sections and the commissioner letter did not grant a permit to the tribe allowing its vehicles to operate on state highways exempt from the vehicle code prohibition on light bars.the tribe filed a timely notice of appeal on november.

ii.federal preemption 
the supreme court has articulated two tests to deter mine whether a particular state law is preempted in litigation involving indian tribes.ostensibly,which test applies depends upon whether the activity to be regulated occurs on or off reservation.here,the tribal activity at issue arguably takes place both on and off the tribe reservation.on the one hand,the tribe law enforcement and public safety activities occur within its reservation lands.however,to fully perform these law enforcement functions,the tribe must occasionally use public roads to reach one of the noncontiguous portions of its reservation lands.it is only when tribal police officers cross into nonreservation lands that they are stopped and cited by local law enforcement for running afoul of the vehicle code.because the regulated activity is the tribal police officers display of emergency light bars when traveling on public roads,we conclude that the appropriate test is that for activities as set forth in mescalero.
under mescalero,tribal activities occurring off reservation are subject to nondiscriminatory state laws absent an express federal law to the contrary.mescalero,at.absent express federal law to the contrary,indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.the mescalero court did not define what constitutes a nondiscriminatory state law.in determining the meaning of the supreme court phrase,we deem it appropriate to follow the same procedures we employ in ascertaining the meaning of an undefined statutory term.when a statute does not define a term,a court should construe that term in accordance with its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.san jose christian coll.city of morgan hill,cir citation omitted.
