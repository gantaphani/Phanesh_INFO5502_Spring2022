in september,the american civil liberties union brought an action on behalf of two native americans plaintiffs against the city of martin,south dakota,and various city officials in their official capacities collectively martin.plaintiffs challenged ordinance,which redistricted the martin city council city council ward boundaries,as intentionally and effectively diluting the voting strength of native americans and keeping native aldermen candidates from being elected in violation of section of the voting rights act of vra and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the united states constitution.after a trial,the district court denied relief,finding that plaintiffs had not met their burden of proving that the white majority in martin usually voted as a bloc to defeat native candidates.a panel of this court disagreed and remanded the matter to the district court to complete the analysis required by the supreme court pursuant to section of the vra as construed by thornburg gingles,d.cottier city of martin,cir cottier i.
on remand,the district court held,based on the totality of the circumstances,that ordinance impermissibly diluted the native american vote and violated section of the vra.consequently,the district court instructed martin to submit a remedial proposal consistent with the district court opinion.martin failed to propose a remedial plan,instead arguing no possible remedy existed for the violation.in contrast,plaintiffs proposed three plans.subsequently,in a remedial order,the district court adopted plaintiffs plan c,an,cumulative voting scheme.martin now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in finding that,under the totality of the circumstances,ordinance diluted the vote of native americans in martin in violation of section of the vra and in ordering remedial plan c.we affirm.
background 
plaintiffs,pearl cottier and rebecca three stars,are native americans,qualified electors,members of the oglala sioux tribe,and residents of martin,south dakota.martin is located in the southwestern part of south dakota and is part of bennett county,which is adjacent to the pine ridge and rosebud indian reservations.according to the census,martin had a total population of persons and a population vap of persons.the city is small in both population and land area it covers slightly more than one half of a square mile.the native american population in martin is,which is of the total population and of the vap.
as described by a prior panel in this case 
for more than a decade martin has been the focus of racial tension between and whites.in the,protests were held to end a racially offensive homecoming tradition that depicted in a demeaning,stereotypical fashion.concurrently,the united states justice department sued and later entered into a consent decree with the local bank requiring an end to redlining loan practices and policies that adversely affected,and censuring the bank because it did not employ any.most recently,resolution specialists from the justice department attempted to mediate an end to claims of racial discrimination by the local sheriff against.
cottier i,at.
historically,martin was divided into three wards,each electing two city council members to staggered terms on a ballot.in addition,martin has elected a mayor who ran for a term on a ballot.the district court noted that the record is unclear as to when the ward lines were originally drawn but,by,the wards had not been changed in years and the wards within the city were not within the requisite variation of population.
pursuant to south dakota law,the city council had the power and duty to redistrict the ward boundaries following the decennial federal census.martin contracted with black hills council of local governments bhclg to reconfigure the wards so that they would comply with the,requirement in the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,see reynolds sims,d.initially,bhclg used incorrect population data in drawing the new wards,and so,on january,the city council,unaware of the errors,adopted the flawed redistricting recommendations submitted by bhclg in ordinance.
once these new wards were published in the local newspaper,plaintiffs contacted their attorneys because they suspected the new boundaries were flawed.after analyzing the new boundaries in ordinance,the attorneys concluded the new wards were severely malapportioned in violation of the,principle.counsel for plaintiffs also concluded that the new wards unlawfully fragmented the native american population in violation of section of the vra.in early march,bhclg received a letter detailing these concerns and martin mayor,bill kuxhaus,was copied on the letter.the city council then asked bhclg to redraw the wards to comply with the,requirement,and a new map was submitted to the city council.
on march,plaintiffs attorneys received a copy of the new redistricting plan,again drafted by bhclg.plaintiffs believed this revised plan did not fix the fragmentation problem,and they wrote a letter to the mayor expressing this concern that same day.despite the expressed concern,the city council proceeded to adopt the revised redistricting plan enacted as ordinance.as has been done historically,ordinance divided martin into three wards with no ward having a native american majority.the district court created the following figure to summarize the total population and vap under ordinance 
ordinance became effective on may,and it is the plan currently in effect in martin.
in an attempt to prevent the city from implementing this new plan,native american voters submitted a petition to have ordinance referred to the voters as a ballot issue.city finance officer janet speidel reviewed this petition and decided that the petition did not contain a sufficient amount of valid signatures.speidel did not tell the petitioners that the signatures were insufficient until the deadline for petitioning ballot initiatives had passed.
on april,plaintiffs brought suit alleging ordinance violated the,requirement,and the district court dismissed the complaint as moot because ordinance had been replaced by ordinance,which the court found equally redistributed the population into three wards alleviating the,problem.the district court also granted plaintiffs motion to supplement its complaint.plaintiff supplemented complaint challenged ordinance,as intentionally and effectively diluting the voting strength of native americans and keeping native aldermen candidates from being elected in violation of section of the vra and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
following an bench trial,the district court found that plaintiffs had met the first two conditions of met their burden of showing that a permissible remedy in the context of the challenged system could be fashioned and that native americans in martin were politically cohesive.gingles,at.however,the district court also found that plaintiffs failed to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,the third gingles the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate and therefore,the district court entered judgment for martin on the vote dilution claim.id.at.the district court also found that plaintiffs could not prevail on their intent claim because there was no evidence that ordinance had been adopted and maintained for a discriminatory purpose.
plaintiffs appealed,and a panel of this court reversed and remanded holding that the white majority in martin usually voted in a way to defeat native candidates.we remanded,instructing the district court to complete the analysis required by gingles,and i f the district court then finds in favor of the plaintiffs,it shall develop a plan under which will have a reasonable opportunity to elect an candidate.cottier i,at.
on remand,the district court reviewed the senate factors as well as other relevant circumstances such as proportionality,and found that,based on the totality of the circumstances,ordinance impermissibly diluted the native american vote in violation of section of the vra.having concluded that ordinance violated the vra,the court held that plaintiffs were entitled to a full and complete remedy.thereafter,the court gave martin the first opportunity to propose a redistricting plan that would remedy the section violation.
martin failed to propose a remedial plan,and,instead,argued that no remedy could be crafted for the violation.because martin refused to propose a remedy,in an order dated february,the district court found it could either fashion its own remedy or use a remedy proposed by plaintiffs.the district court chose to adopt plaintiffs plan c which the district court described as follows 
in plan c,martin is not divided into aldermanic wards.instead,plan c adopts an voting scheme using cumulative voting.docket.martin will still have six city council members,elections for which will be held in a staggered cycle.elections will be held in for the three seats whose current members terms expire in.elections will be held in for the remaining three seats.candidates shall run as a field without designation of positions or number posts.candidates can be from any part of martin.pursuant to the cumulative voting scheme,each voter will receive three votes.each voter can cast one,all,or any whole number of his or her votes for any one or more of the candidates.no voter shall be required,however,to cast one vote,or any other minimum number of votes,for any candidate.nor shall any voter be required to cast all of the votes available to that voter in a particular election.the winners of the election will be the three candidates that receive the highest number of votes.

the district court concluded that no form of municipal government authorized by south dakota council structure or board of remedy the section vra violation in this case,and that plan c was the proper remedy.
ii.discussion 
martin argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that,under the totality of the circumstances,ordinance dilutes the vote of native americans in martin,in violation of section of the vra and ordering remedial plan 
section of the circumstances 
martin argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs established,through the totality of the circumstances,a violation of section of the vra.the district court determination whether the requirements are satisfied must be upheld unless clearly erroneous.where the ultimate finding of dilution is based on a misreading of the governing law,however,there is reversible error.league of united latin am.citizens perry,d internal citations and quotations omitted.
using the clear error standard 
w e will overturn a factual finding only if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,if it is based on an erroneous view of the law,or if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that an error was made.we give due regard to the district court opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.a district court choice between two permissible views of evidence can not be clearly erroneous.

section of the vra provides that a denial of the right to vote occurs when 
based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
b.the essence of a claim is that a certain electoral law,practice,or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by minority and white voters to elect their preferred candidates.cottier i,at quoting gingles,at.
in order to establish a section violation,plaintiffs must prove the following three referred to as the gingles preconditions by a preponderance of the evidence the racial group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district the racial group is politically cohesive and the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.bone shirt hazeltine,cir internal citation and modifications omitted.
in the first appeal,this court held that plaintiffs have proven all three gingles preconditions by a preponderance of the evidence.cottier i,at.satisfying the three gingles preconditions takes the plaintiff a long way towards showing a section violation,however,the analysis does not stop here.bone shirt,at quoting harvell,at.
if all three gingles requirements are established,the statutory text directs us to consider the totality of circumstances to determine whether members of a racial group have less opportunity than do other members of the electorate.the general terms of the statutory standard totality of circumstances require judicial interpretation.league of united latin am.citizens.at.the senate committee report accompanying the vra amendment noted the following inexhaustive,objective factors in determining whether the totality of the circumstances indicate a section violation 
the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register,to vote,or otherwise to participate in the democratic process 
the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized 
the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election districts,majority vote requirements,shot provisions,or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group 
if there is a candidate slating process,whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that process 
the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,employment and health,which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process 
whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals 
the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.
bone shirt,at internal citations omitted.also useful inquiries include was there a significant lack of response from elected officials to the needs of the minority group,and was the policy underlying the jurisdiction use of the current boundaries tenuous.id.at 
the two factors that predominate the totality analysis are the extent to which voting is racially polarized and the extent to which minorities have been elected under the challenged scheme.bone shirt,at quoting harvell,at.the district court found that seven of the above factors weighed in plaintiffs favor history of discrimination racially polarized voting voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance opportunity for discrimination effects of past discrimination in education,employment and health success of minority candidates lack of responsiveness and proportionality.
the district court found the following two factors weighed in favor of martin denial of access to process plaintiffs conceded there is not a formal slating process in martin and tenuousness of the city policy drawing district lines the court found martin began the redistricting effort because it was obligated to do so after the census and that it was done to reduce an unacceptable level of variation in population among the three wards.according to the district court,the use of racial appeals in campaigns weighed in favor of neither plaintiffs nor martin.the district court found that although there was some evidence that racial appeals were used,the court gave the evidence little weight because most involved elections outside of martin.
as to the two primary factors in our totality of the circumstances analysis the extent to which voting is racially polarized and the extent to which minorities have been elected under the challenged scheme,harvell,at record supports the district court finding that these factors weigh in favor of plaintiffs.as the cottier i panel acknowledged and the district court found on remand,the exit polls in the aldermanic election along with the loss of every native candidate since the adoption of ordinance strongly indicate racially polarized voting in endogenous elections the exit polls revealed that in the aldermanic election in in ward i,of native americans supported the native candidate but that candidate still lost therefore,at most,only of whites voted for that candidate indicating a high degree of polarization.the ward iii exit polls showed that the native candidate received of the native american vote and still lost.also,exit polls for the school board election revealed that two native candidates received and of the native american vote and,at most,only and of the white candidates came in fourth and fifth out of six.expert and witness testimony also indicated racially polarized voting in martin.
regarding the extent to which native americans have been elected under the challenged scheme,there is also substantial evidence in the record to support the district court finding that native americans have rarely been elected to the city council and this factor weighs in favor of plaintiffs.the record indicates that four native americans have won a total of seven city council elections between and in martin,and during that time there have been elections for city council in ward i.the only native americans elected in ward i were melva marshall,who won a contested election in and molly risse,who was not a native candidate,who won a contested election in.ward ii has had elections and the only native american elected was dick rose who ran unopposed in both and.there have been elections in ward iii and only one native american won in,and he ran unopposed.therefore,out of elections for city council,native americans have won only elections.this evidence shows that native americans have some limited success in seeking election,but,on the whole,success is rare.in of the successful elections,the native american candidate ran unopposed.in of the unopposed successes by native americans,the candidate was incumbent.the district court findings that this important factor weighs in favor of plaintiffs was not clearly erroneous.
the record also shows that native americans in martin,bennett county and south dakota at large have faced a history of discrimination see bone shirt hazeltine,d,south dakota officially excluded indians from voting and holding office until the.even after state laws were repealed that expressly denied indians the right to vote,as late as indians were effectively denied the right to vote in certain county elections,and indians in certain counties were denied the right to run for the office of county commissioner in violation of the equal protection clause until internal citations omitted.
further,the record also supports the district court finding that native americans in martin continue to suffer from the effects of past discrimination including lower levels of income,education,home ownership,automobile ownership and standard of living.p olitical participation by minorities tends to be depressed where minority group members suffer effects of prior discrimination such as inferior education,poor employment opportunities,and low incomes.gingles,at.we have explicitly recognized that native americans in south dakota continue to bear the burden of past discrimination,which hinders their political participation.see bone shirt,at.as the district court found,this case is similar the record supports the district court finding that native americans in martin continue to suffer the effects of discrimination,including lower levels of income and education and that native americans in martin suffer from depressed levels of political activity 
we conclude that the district court overall weighing of the totality of the circumstances was not clearly erroneous because the ultimate finding of dilution is not based on a misreading of the governing law,and it is supported by substantial evidence in the record.vertac chem,at.
martin also argues on appeal that the district court erred in imposing plan c because it lacked the authority to impose a remedial plan.martin contends all plans proposed to the court were either unworkable,ineffective,or in violation of south dakota law.we review the district court remedial order for an abuse of discretion.bone shirt,at.
the abuse of discretion standard means that a court has a range of choice,and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.an abuse of discretion occurs if a relevant factor that should have been given significant weight is not considered,if an irrelevant or improper factor is considered and given significant weight,or if a court commits a clear error of judgment in the course of weighing proper factors.

upon finding a section violation,the district court must develop a constitutional remedy and give the defendant the first opportunity to submit a remedial plan.bone shirt,at cottier i,at.if the defendant refuses to submit a remedial plan,it is then up to the district court to fashion its own remedy or adopt a remedial plan proposed by the plaintiff.bone shirt,at.
in formulating a remedial plan,the first and foremost obligation of the district court is to correct the section violation.id.second,the court remedy should achieve population equality while avoiding,when possible,the use of districts and it should be narrowly tailored.id.at.third,the remedial plan must not violate sections or of the vra.id.at.finally,the plan should not intrude on state policy any more than is necessary to uphold the requirements of the constitution.id.quoting upham seamon,d per curiam.
in cottier i,this court reviewed the district court denial of relief to plaintiffs.cottier i,at.before that appeal,the district court had denied relief to plaintiffs on the basis that they had not established the third gingles factor.specifically,the district court ruled that plaintiffs had not established that the white majority usually voted in a way to defeat the native candidate the cottier i panel reversed that decision in part,concluding that plaintiffs had established the third,and therefore all,gingles factors.the prior panel affirmed the district court finding that plaintiffs had met their burden under the first gingles factor in establishing that the native american community in martin was sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.id.at.in discussing the first gingles factor the prior panel stated 
the ultimate viability and effectiveness of a remedy is considered at the remedial stage of litigation and not during analysis of the gingles preconditions.at the initial stage,the plaintiff must only show that minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practices.gingles,at,d see also dickinson indiana state election,cir houston lafayette county,cir.although martin argues the plans are not viable or stable,the ultimate end of the first gingles precondition is to prove that a solution is possible,and not necessarily to present the final solution to the problem.gingles,at,d.
id.at emphasis in the original.after holding that plaintiffs had established all three gingles preconditions,the prior panel stated that it would remand the case to the district court to determine if plaintiffs were entitled to relief under the totality of the circumstances.id.at.the prior panel then stated 
in the event the district court finds that under the totality of the circumstances,the plaintiffs are entitled to relief,the district court shall devise and implement a remedy that will give in martin a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates to alderman.in so doing,the defendant shall be given an opportunity to propose a remedy within a specified amount of time.see cane worcester county,cir.the court should then review the proposed order to determine whether it is legally unacceptable.id.if the defendant fails to propose a legally acceptable remedy,the district court shall devise a plan that ensures that candidates have a reasonable chance of prevailing in martin municipal elections for alderman.among its options,the district court has the discretion to implement any of the three plans presented by the plaintiffs.
id.at.emphasis added.at the end of the above paragraph,in a footnote,the prior panel stated 
we disagree with the district court finding that it is unable to apply an voting system in martin.in cane,the court considered the amount of deference due to a legislative policy decision underlying proposed electoral schemes.cane,at.even where the legislative body fails to propose a plan or where the plan proposed is legally unacceptable,the court,in exercising its discretion to fashion a remedy that complies with,must to the greatest extent possible give effect to the legislative policy judgments underlying the current electoral scheme or legally unacceptable remedy offered by the legislative body.id.at.if,at the remedy stage,a redistricting of martin wards appears unworkable,it appears that plaintiffs third plan would be a viable option.whereas the plan in cane completely eliminated elected positions,plaintiffs plan continues martin practice of staggering its aldermanic elections and maintains the current number of aldermen.moreover,its current form of aldermanic government is by choice,not by legislative mandate.see codified laws.in essence,an election would change martin into a single ward rather than three wards.more importantly,an system would conform martin to the requirements of section of the voting rights act.
id.at.emphasis added.in the remedial order at issue the district court explicitly stated that it was following our panel decision as law of the case 
defendants argue that south dakota law prohibits the court from adopting plan specifically,defendants argue that martin uses the common council form of municipal government,and that state law permits neither districts nor cumulative voting in the common council structure.see sdcl.defendants also argue that only the voters of martin,not the court,can change martin form of government.the court disagrees that south dakota law prevents the court from adopting plan indeed,the eighth circuit explicitly held that the court had the power to adopt plan c if,at the remedy stage,a redistricting of martin wards appears unworkable,it appears that plan c would be a viable option.cottier,at.the eighth circuit decision on this matter is the law of the case,and this court is bound to follow it.see mosley city of northwoods,cir.the court thus concludes that it has the power to adopt plan 
cottier city of martin,d at.
although the prior panel acknowledged that the gingles analysis dealt only with possible solutions instead of ultimate,viable or stable solutions,the panel also concluded that the district court had the authority to implement plan c,and the district court stated that it was bound by that holding as law of the case.we realize that the third gingles factor was at issue in our prior panel decision,and so the statements about plan c were dicta.however,the prior panel did instruct the district court that on remand,in determining a remedy,a mong its options,the district court has the discretion to implement any of the three plans presented by the plaintiffs.cottier i,at.we conclude,given the prior panel instruction,that the district court reasonably believed that it had the discretion to adopt plan c.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in adopting plan 
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
after the district court dismissal of this case was reversed by a divided panel in cottier city of martin,cir cottier i,the district court on remand ruled that the city of martin was liable for diluting the voting strength of native americans,in violation of of the voting rights act of.cottier city of martin,d.as a remedy,the district court ordered the city to adopt a municipal government structure that is not authorized by south dakota law,and to implement an,cumulative voting scheme designed to result in the election of a candidate preferred by native american voters in each election cycle.cottier city of martin,d.
i would reverse the judgment of the district court.to the extent the plaintiffs made a sufficient showing to justify a finding of liability for vote dilution under,this showing required proof that native americans were sufficiently large and compact to constitute a majority in a district.thornburg gingles,d.if the record supports that conclusion the first gingles precondition,then it was unnecessary for the district court to impose a remedy contrary to south dakota law.the appropriate remedy would have been to create a district or ward in which native americans constitute a majority.the district court concluded,however,that it could not draw a plan that contains an effective majority of indian voters in one ward.cottier,d at.if this conclusion is correct,then there was no liability for vote dilution in the first place,because the first gingles precondition was not satisfied.accordingly,i would remand the case to the district court with directions either to revisit the finding of liability and dismiss the case if the plaintiffs have failed to meet the first gingles precondition,or to implement a remedy that conforms to south dakota law by creating a ward in which native americans constitute a majority.
the supreme court in gingles established three preconditions to a finding of liability under.the first precondition is that the minority group is large enough and geographically compact enough that it would be a majority in a district.at.the court explained that the reason for this precondition is to ensure that minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice.id.at.emphasis in original.if minority voters are not a sufficiently large and compact group to constitute a majority in a district the smallest political unit from which representatives are elected then it follows that they have no potential to elect a representative of their choice,and there is no principled basis to find that their voting strength has been diluted.id.
to establish the first gingles precondition,a plaintiff must demonstrate a proper and workable remedy exists.cottier i,at.in stabler county of thurston,cir,this court recognized that where the plaintiffs fail to present a workable remedy in which native americans are geographically compact to form an effective voting majority in a district,they do not meet the first precondition of gingles,and they fail to establish liability under.id.at.stabler thus echoed the conclusion of other circuits that t he inquiries into remedy and liability can not be separated,and that a district court must determine as part of the gingles threshold inquiry whether it can fashion a permissible remedy in the particular context of the challenged system.nipper smith,cir en banc id.at edmondson,concurring in part and concurring in result accord sanchez colorado,cir.as the supreme court put it in growe emison,d,u nless these points are established,there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.id.at.
in cottier i,the district court found that the first precondition was satisfied,at,and a panel of this court,applying a clearly erroneous standard of review,id.at,affirmed the district court finding.id.at.after this court reversed the district court finding that the third precondition was not established,id.at,the district court on remand found that under the totality of the circumstances,the plaintiffs had established vote dilution that violated.d at.when it turned to the remedy,however,the district court effectively backtracked on its previous conclusion that the plaintiffs had established the first gingles precondition.at that point,the court concluded that r edistricting martin system will not remedy the violation,cited an expert who could not create a plan in martin th
