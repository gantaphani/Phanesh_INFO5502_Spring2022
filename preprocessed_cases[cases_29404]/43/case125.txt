in september,kelly sued the nords in tribal court,seeking damages for personal injuries sustained in the accident.the nords filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,citing strate contractors,d holding tribal courts may not entertain claims against nonmembers arising out of accidents on state highways,absent a statute or treaty authorizing the tribe to govern the conduct of nonmembers on the highway in question.the tribal court did not rule on the motion to dismiss until september,when it ultimately determined that it had jurisdiction over the dispute.in the meantime,the nords had filed an action in federal court for a declaratory judgment that the tribal court lacked jurisdiction.the parties stipulated to a stay of the federal court action pending resolution of the tribal court appeal.the stay was lifted in early february after the red lake court of appeals affirmed the tribal court determination that it had jurisdiction.
the tribal court then moved the federal district court to dismiss the declaratory judgment action and to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss.the nords filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the tribal court lacked jurisdiction over kelly suit against them.the tribal court moved alternatively for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing in order to permit discovery pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted summary judgment to the nords and denied the tribal court motions.the tribal court and kelly appeal the adverse grant of summary judgment.

this case is controlled by the supreme court decision in strate,holding that tribal courts may not entertain claims against nonmembers arising out of accidents on state highways,absent a statute or treaty authorizing the tribe to govern the conduct of nonmembers on the highway in question.at.the court analysis in strate began with the general and proposition that absent express authorization by federal statute or treaty,tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of nonmembers exists only in limited circumstances.id.at.see also id.at.as to a tribe adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction,absent congressional direction otherwise.the court explained that,while tribes retain considerable control over nonmember conduct on tribal land,id.at,generally,in the absence of a statute or treaty authorizing otherwise,and subject to two limited exceptions,indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on land within a reservation,id.at.this general rule was set forth in montana united states,d,which the court in strate referred to as the pathmarking case concerning tribal civil authority over nonmembers.at.
the court in strate determined that the state highway at issue was the equivalent of fee land for purposes of determining the tribe jurisdiction over nonmembers,subject to the general rule of montana,and found that neither of montana exceptions applied.the montana exceptions provide that indian tribes retain inherent sovereign powers to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over on their reservations,even on fee lands in the following circumstances to regulate,through taxation,licensing,or other means,the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe,or its members,through commercial dealing s and to exercise civil authority over the conduct of on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity,the economic security,or the health or welfare of the tribe.at.both montana and strate rejected tribal authority to regulate nonmembers activities on land over which the tribe could not assert a landowner right to occupy and exclude.nevada hicks,d internal marks omitted.but see id.at.cautioning that t he ownership status of land is only one factor to consider in determining whether regulation of the activities of nonmembers is necessary to protect tribal or to control internal relations,though i t may sometimes be a dispositive factor quoting montana,at.these supreme court precedents indicate that,in applying the montana exceptions,the key concept is that tribal authority to regulate nonmember activities exists where it is necessary to protect tribal or to control internal relations.id.at.quoting montana,at.see also strate,at.
the district court determined that the facts of the present case are on all fours with strate,and we agree.in strate,as here,the dispute involved claims against a arising out of an automobile accident that occurred on a state highway within an indian reservation on land in north dakota held in trust for the three affiliated tribes the tribes.the court considered the federally granted for the highway,finding that tribal officials had consented to the,the tribes had received just compensation,the purpose of the was to facilitate public access,the traffic was subject to the state control,and the easement included no reservation of tribal dominion or control over the.see strate,at.in light of these facts,the court determined that the tribes did not enjoy a landowner right to occupy and exclude on the stretch of highway at issue,rendering it the equivalent of fee land within the reservation,and that neither of montana exceptions applied to a commonplace automobile accident dispute between strangers on a state public highway.id.at.the strate court concluded that the parties were therefore left to pursue their claims in the state court forum open to all who sustain injuries on north dakota highway.id.at.similarly here,the district court determined that no statute or treaty authorized the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers on the state highway,the state had a federally granted to construct and maintain this stretch of road as a public highway with the consent of the red lake band and the payment of just compensation to individual members,and neither of the montana exceptions applied because the parties were strangers involved in a commonplace automobile accident dispute.
the tribal court argues on appeal that the district court categorical application of strate ignores the supreme court reasoning,which carefully considered the nature of the particular at issue.we respectfully disagree.to the contrary,consistent with the analysis set out in strate,the district court properly considered,and gave effect to,the relevant public records and pertinent regulations that established the federally granted.
specifically,the record contains minnesota stipulation and application to the department of the interior,pursuant to federal regulations,seeking permission to open and establish a public highway on this stretch of indian land and stating that it will be part of the state trunk highway system pursuant to the constitution of the state of minnesota at.the record also contains the tribal resolution,unanimously approved by the red lake band general council,referencing minnesota application to construct the stretch of public highway at issue.id.at.the resolution indicates that the road improvement will benefit the tribe,that the tribe waives compensation for damages,and that fair damages should be paid to individual tribal members.id.an affidavit of the supervisor of the minnesota department of transportation,office of land management,certifies the existence of the easement,that the highway is serviced and maintained by the state of minnesota,and that it is open to the public.id.at.having considered these documents,the district court then categorically applied the holding of strate,finding it unnecessary to consider evidence of the parties particular conduct with regard to the,and we agree with the district court analysis.
consistent with the reasoning of strate,we give effect to the plain language of the granting instruments.there is no indication in the public records that the red lake band retained any gatekeeping right over the public highway,no assertion that the is no longer maintained as part of the state highway,and no assertion that any statute or treaty grants or retains tribal authority over nonmembers in this situation.see strate,at.therefore,the red lake band has no right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of that land,id.internal marks omitted,and the public highway at issue,as in strate,is the equivalent of alienated,land for purposes of regulating the activities of nonmembers.see also boxx long warrior,cir considering the plain language of a for a national park service road over indian land and determining that the tribe had expressly reserved no right to exercise dominion or control over the internal marks omitted,cert.denied,d,disapproved on other grounds,smith salish kootenai,cir en banc.
the tribal court argues that additional discovery was necessary to demonstrate that the parties to the agreement believed the would confer only limited rights to the state.specifically,the tribal court asserts that evidence of the course of conduct between the red lake band and the state would confirm their understanding that the permitted only the construction,use,and maintenance of a highway and did not confer regulatory or adjudicatory authority on the state with regard to nonmembers.
we need not look to evidence in this case.the court in strate plainly indicated that absent explicit authority otherwise,the loss of regulatory jurisdiction is implied with the loss of a landowner right to occupy and exclude and as long as the stretch is maintained as part of the state highway,the tribe can not assert a landowner right to occupy and exclude.at.south dakota bourland,d stating that by taking reservation land for a dam and reservoir project,and broadly opening up those lands for public use,congress,through the flood control and cheyenne river acts eliminated the tribe power to exclude from these lands,and with that the incidental regulatory jurisdiction formerly enjoyed by the tribe.this legal nature of a federally granted and unrestricted to construct and maintain a public highway as a part of the state highway system on a reservation can not be altered for purposes of nonmember governance by state practices that are merely deferential to,and respectful of,tribal authority.mcdonald means,cir holding that a bia road was a tribal road by considering the nature of the at issue and finding that,although the tribe had relinquished certain gatekeeping rights by allowing public use of the road and collaborating with the bia in maintaining it,the tribe had maintained other significant gatekeeping rights because the was not granted to the state and the road did not form any part of the state highway system.we do not understand the band to be asserting that the parties conduct will show that this stretch of highways and is no longer a state highway.absent some specific language reserving regulatory or adjudicatory powers to the red lake band in the documents or an assertion that the highway is no longer maintained as part of the state highway system,no further evidence is needed.
alternatively,the tribal court argues that the state stipulation accompanying its application for a did not comply with the federal regulations,and as a result,the is void ab initio.we respectfully disagree.the regulations in effect at the time of the agreement required the state application to include a stipulation expressly agreeing to the terms of,which placed certain obligations on the party applying for a.at.the state application included the required stipulation,stating explicitly that the state agreed to abide by all pertinent rules and regulations of the department of the interior.id.at.the stipulation then made special reference to three of the five subsections listed in.because the state expressly agreed to abide by all pertinent regulations,we agree with the district court conclusion that the failure to individually reference each subsection of does not render the void additionally,the red lake band tribal resolution evidences consent to the as requested in the application and stipulation,and the band has never administratively challenged the validity or scope of this.
finally,the tribal court asserts that additional discovery is necessary to determine the applicability of the montana exceptions,but we conclude that the record is adequate for this analysis as well.the first exception covers activities of nonmembers who enter consensual commercial relationships with the tribe or its members.see strate,at.internal marks omitted.the record indicates that nord was driving a owned by nord trucking,a company that had a consensual commercial relationship with the red lake band to haul and remove timber from the reservation,but the accident gave rise to a simple tort claim between strangers,not a dispute arising out of the commercial relationship.the accident did not involve the red lake band itself,and although the individual injured was a member of the red lake band,he was not a party to the commercial relationship.the tribal court asserts that additional discovery is necessary to determine the facts regarding whether nord was driving in connection with a contract with the red lake band or on a personal errand.we conclude that such facts would not be material in this situation because the dispute merely involves the tortious conduct of a highway accident between strangers,and no amount of discovery can alter the nature of that claim.see id.at
