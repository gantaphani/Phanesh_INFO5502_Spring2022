in,representatives of the united states met with leaders of the sioux tribes at fort laramie,in wyoming,to negotiate a right of passage for settlers and military personnel through sioux territory.negotiations broke down,and the sioux,led by the oglala chief red cloud,fought a series of battles against the army for control of wyoming powder river basin.in,the two sides met again at fort laramie,this time signing a peace treaty establishing the great sioux reservation.the treaty provided that the sioux tribes would enjoy absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the reservation and prohibited unauthorized from entering the land.treaty with the sioux indians,stat.the treaty also provided that n o treaty for the cession of any portion or part of the reservation herein described which may be held in common shall be of any validity or force as against the said indians,unless executed and signed by at least three fourths of all the adult male indians,occupying or interested in the same id.
after the discovery of gold in the western portion of the great sioux reservation in and more battles between the army and the sioux including the battle of little big horn,congress passed a law in providing for the cession to the united states of more than million acres of reservation land in the black hills area of western south dakota.see act of,stat.united states sioux nation of indians,d.the act of march,ch,stat,passed only months before south dakota was admitted as a state,purported to dissolve the great sioux reservation,restoring roughly million acres of land to the public domain and dividing the remaining territory into six smaller reservations for the various sioux tribes.the act was to take effect only when consent had been obtained from of all adult male sioux in accordance with the fort laramie treaty,an event to be made known by proclamation by the president of the united states,upon satisfactory proof presented to him and upon failure of such proof and proclamation this act becomes of no effect and null and void.act of march.a commission appointed by the secretary of the interior the crook commission obtained the requisite number of signatures on quitclaim deeds and submitted a report to president benjamin harrison.in president harrison issued a proclamation declaring the act to be in full force.
settlers later gained title to much of the former great sioux reservation land.thereafter,the army corps of engineers acquired portions of former reservation land from indian and owners in order to build dam and reservoir projects and more than one hundred shoreline recreational areas along the missouri river.see flood control act of,stat.the water resources development act of august,stat,directed the secretary of the army to transfer title to or grant perpetual leases for many of these federal properties to the state of south dakota,the cheyenne river sioux tribe,and the lower brule sioux tribe.
the oglala sioux tribe filed its initial complaint in december,seeking to enjoin the transfers of these missouri river properties.the complaint contained several claims under the national historical preservation act,and other cultural and environmental resource protection statutes.in a previous lawsuit,the crow creek sioux tribe had filed a complaint making essentially the same claims.in crow creek sioux tribe brownlee,we determined that the resource protection statutes continued to apply to the missouri river properties even after their transfer.thus,the crow creek tribe had suffered no injury and lacked article iii standing to challenge the transfers.id.
after our decision in crow creek,the district court ordered the oglala sioux tribe to show cause why their case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the tribe amended its complaint,dropping its prior claims and asserting four new or modified ones.the first three were based on the assertion that the tribe had an interest in the missouri river properties because those properties are part of the great sioux reservation,an interest allegedly never diminished or altered by any act of congress specifically,the tribe alleged that the act dissolving much of the reservation never went into effect because the crook commission failed to obtain valid signatures from of the adult male sioux population.the tribe last claim sought mandamus relief requiring the army corps of engineers to evaluate,inventory,and include in the national register of historic places all native american cultural items and historic areas within the missouri river properties.pet r br.at.the district court dismissed the complaint,ruling that the tribe lacked standing to bring its first three claims and that mandamus relief could not be granted on its fourth claim.the court determined that,regardless of the fairness or propriety of the ratification,the act had taken effect and abrogated any rights held by the tribe based on the fort laramie treaty.accordingly,the tribe did not have a legally protected interest in the lands at issue.the court also ruled that mandamus relief was inappropriate because the corps had no plainly prescribed duty to evaluate federal properties in the manner requested by the tribe.
congress has expressly deprived courts of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the tribe first three claims each of these claims rests on the contention that the united states did not validly implement the act,rendering it a nullity.in,the indian claims commission act,stat,imposed a limitations period on indian claims in law and equity then existing and arising under the constitution,federal law,and treaties between indian tribes and the united states.the act limitations period applies here.
