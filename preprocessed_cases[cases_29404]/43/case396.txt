background 
the county rests between puget sound and the cascade mountain range in northwest washington.over the past two decades the county population has increased faster than any county in washington.
the tribes constitute a federally recognized indian tribe.the tribes reservation is located entirely within the county and comprises approximately of the county land area.about two thousand tribal members and eight thousand inhabit the reservation thousand acres.the united states holds nearly half the reservation land in trust for the tribes or individual members.the other half of the reservation is owned in fee simple by tribal members and nonmembers alike.
in,pursuant to article vi of the tribal constitution,the tribes established a comprehensive system of land use regulations and an administrative structure for implementing those regulations.in,the tribes created a planning commission charged with updating the land use regulations.over the next decade,the planning commission developed a plan balancing competing economic,development,housing,and natural resource priorities.upon completion of the revised regulations,the planning commission prepared a zoning ordinance and map to implement and preserve the integrity of the plan.the zoning ordinance,ordinance,was reviewed and approved by the bureau of indian affairs and the solicitor office in the department of the interior.
the tribes zoning ordinance,ordinance,establishes use and density restrictions throughout the reservation.it requires a building permit for all new construction and that structures be built in conformity with the uniform building code.it also facilitates development by authorizing rezoning if a proposed project adheres to certain open space and density requirements.other aspects of the tribes land use regulations ensure that building projects include utility easements,water and sewage systems that comply with the tulalip utilities ordinance,a drainage plan based on the washington stormwater management manual,and protection for environmentally sensitive lands,including wetlands.
pursuant to ordinance,gobin submitted to the tribes an application to rezone and subdivide a acre parcel of land located on fire trail road.gobin proposed subdivision would connect to septic systems because sewer service is not available on that part of the reservation.water would flow from wells or private water systems because no established water lines connect to county water,and only fire trail road,which is maintained by the county,would provide access to gobin proposed subdivision.once built,gobin planned to market these homes to the general public without regard for tribal affiliation.
gobin paid the necessary regulatory fees and submitted an environmental checklist addressing environmental impacts,transportation,and public services.the planning commission evaluated gobin proposal and considered the necessary land use restrictions.the planning commission also sought public comments on gobin proposal and held public hearings to vet the matter.the tribes notified the county of gobin proposal,but the county neither appeared at the public hearings nor offered any substantive comments.the county indicated only that if the land is placed in trust,the county will recognize subdivision of individual trust land.if the land is not acquired in trust,its development will continue to be subject to snohomish county jurisdiction and the applicable county zoning,subdivision,and development regulations.under the applicable county regulations,gobin could construct only ten homes instead of the proposed.the county acknowledges that it would reject gobin proposed subdivision.
on june,the tribes conditionally approved gobin home development project.the conditions included grading restrictions,a buffer surrounding an wetland,erosion and controls,and approval of a public water system by the tulalip utilities authority.
despite the tribes approval,however,gobin could not begin development without exposing herself to civil and criminal liability because of the county asserted land use jurisdiction.moreover,gobin lender would not finance the project without resolution of the conflict.gobin,therefore,sought a judicial declaration that the county has no land use jurisdiction over lands owned by a member of the tulalip tribes and situated within the reservation,and in particular has no jurisdiction to impose county zoning,subdivision and building code regulations on her development.the tribes intervened,seeking a declaration that the county lacks jurisdiction over the land use activities of gobin.
gobin and the tribes moved for summary judgment.the county resisted,arguing that congress expressly authorized its jurisdiction over reservation fee lands when it made those lands freely alienable and encumberable.in the alternative,the county argued that exceptional circumstances warranted its exercise of jurisdiction over reservation fee lands.the district court rejected the county arguments.it found no express authorization from congress and no circumstances so exceptional as to justify interfering with the tribes governance of its reservation.the county appealed.the united states appeared as amicus in support of the tribes.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.united states muckleshoot indian tribe,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the county,whether there exist any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.
discussion 
the parties agree on the dispositive questions whether congress expressly authorized the county to regulate reservation fee lands owned by tribal members,and whether exceptional circumstances warranted the county exercise of jurisdiction over the tribal members activities on those lands.before turning to these pressing questions,we recount the relevant history.

land speculators took advantage of the ability of the indians to alien freely their lands.the result nearly million acres of land passed out of in
