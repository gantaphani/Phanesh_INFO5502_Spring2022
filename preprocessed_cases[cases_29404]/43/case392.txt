discussion 
tribal jurisdiction 
tribes maintain broad authority over the conduct of both tribal members and nonmembers on indian land,or land held in trust for a tribe by the united states.strate contractors,d williams lee,d.we presume that tribal courts maintain civil jurisdiction over the activities of on tribal land unless affirmatively limited by federal law.iowa mutual insurance laplante,d.however,in montana united states,d,the supreme court held that a tribal court lacks authority over the conduct of nonmembers on land within a reservation that is owned in fee by a id.at.
strate contractors addressed tribal court jurisdiction over a suit arising from an accident on a state highway that ran through the fort berthold indian reservation in north dakota.at.the court held that by granting north dakota a to maintain the highway,the tribe had,in effect,alienated the land to a,and that the general rule in montana thus applied to bar civil jurisdiction over the suit.id.at.the strate court reserved the question of civil jurisdiction over nonmember conduct on tribal roads.id.at.
the district court rejected tribal jurisdiction because it equated route with the state highway held in strate to constitute alienated land governed by the rule in montana.means argues that route is in fact a tribal road exempted from the strate analysis,and that the tribe retained an interest in the road sufficient to survive the montana rule barring tribal jurisdiction.the primary issue in this case is thus whether bia roads,like the state highway considered in strate,are fee land subject to the montana rule.we conclude that bia roads constitute tribal roads not subject to strate,and that the bia did not extinguish the tribe gatekeeping rights to the extent necessary to bar tribal court jurisdiction under montana.
route is a tribal road not governed by strate.
strate held that a tribal court may not hear civil claims against nonmembers arising from accidents on a state highway that crosses a reservation,because the tribe had relinquished all gatekeeping rights over the highway.strate,at.however,the court qualified that holding by noting that it express ed no view on the governing law or proper forum when an accident occurs on a tribal road within a reservation.id.at.we conclude that route,as a bia road,is a tribal road expressly reserved from the rule in strate.
title,part of the code of federal regulations roads of the bureau of indian affairs makes clear that a bia road is considered an indian reservation road.this is so even where a road serves both indian and land,see id.at,and even though bia roads are generally open to public use,id.at.bia roads are constructed on reservations to provide an adequate system of road facilities serving indian lands,id.at,and are held by the bia in trust for the benefit of the tribe,see united states mitchell,d.an indian reservation road serving indian land and held in trust for a tribe is a tribal road.
precedent supports this conclusion.the supreme court declined to distinguish between tribal and bia roads in white mountain apache tribe bracker,d noting,in the context of federal preemption,we see no basis,and respondents point to none,for distinguishing between roads maintained by the tribe and roads maintained by the bureau of indian affairs.the ninth circuit also equated a bia road with a tribal road in allstate stump,cir describing an accident on route,a bia road as occurring on a tribal road in the rocky boy reservation.as a definitional matter,route is a tribal road not subject to the rule barring jurisdiction in strate.
route is not fee land under montana.
having concluded that route falls outside the direct scope of strate,we nevertheless consider whether the facts support tribal jurisdiction under the montana rule that tribes lack authority over the conduct of nonmembers on fee land within a reservation.montana,at.strate,at.summarizing montana and stating that t he term fee lands,as used in this passage and throughout the montana opinion,refers to reservation land acquired in fee simple by owners.we hold that they do,because route can not be considered fee land.
although the northern cheyenne tribe reserved no express right of dominion when it granted the route to the bia,the grant is held by the federal government in trust for the tribe.it is hardly an unencumbered fee and only loosely owned by a.it is well established that the bia holds a fiduciary relationship to indian tribes,and its management of tribal is subject to the same fiduciary duties.mitchell,at.the route was granted to the bureau of indian affairs to provide an adequate system of road facilities serving indian lands.the state recipient of the held in strate to constitute fee land had no comparable duty.that was granted to north dakota for a specific,related purpose to facilitate public access to lake sakakawea,a federal water resource project under the control of the army corps of engineers.strate,at.route is not land acquired in fee simple by owners.strate,at.
that the tribal court may exercise jurisdiction over a claim arising on route is buttressed by the supreme court application of the montana test in strate in determining that the state highway there in question constituted fee land,the strate court hinged tribal jurisdiction on the degree to which the tribe had retained gatekeeping rights over the.strate,at.examining the route against similar standards,we conclude that the scope of rights and responsibilities retained by a tribe over a bia road exceed those retained over the state highway in strate,and that these additional retained rights suffice to maintain tribal jurisdiction over nonmember conduct on bia roads.
in strate,the court found that the highway was fee land because the grant extinguished in the tribe the landowner right to occupy and exclude 
forming part of the state highway,the is open to the public,and traffic on it is subject to the state control.the tribes have consented to,and received payment for,the state use of the stretch for a public highway.they have retained no gatekeeping right.so long as the stretch is maintained as part of the state highway,the tribes can not assert a landowner right to occupy and exclude.we therefore align the,for the purpose at hand,with land alienated to.our decision in montana,accordingly,governs this case.
id.at.citations omitted.in determining that the tribe had lost its right to occupy and exclude and the corresponding right to exercise tribal jurisdiction,strate relied on five factors the right of way formed part of the state highway,it was held open to the public,traffic was subject to state control,the tribe consented to the state use of the property,and the tribe received payment for use of the property.id.
we consider these factors in evaluating the status of the route.although the northern cheyenne relinquished certain gatekeeping rights in allowing public use of route and in collaborating with the bia to maintain it,the tribe maintained others of significance.the bia is not granted to the state,and forms no part of the state highway system.the code of federal regulations specifically distinguishes bia roads on reservations from other public roads on reservations that are federally funded via the state through the federal aid highway act.f.
moreover,the route grant preserves to the tribe considerable rights and responsibility over traffic and maintenance on the.see generally.for example,the code of federal regulations makes clear that t he administration and maintenance of indian reservation roads and bridges is basically a function of the local government,which,as regards route,is the northern cheyenne tribe.the commissioner of indian affairs,who is responsible for bia road planning and design,must secure tribal consent at every stage of road design and construction 
the commissioner shall keep the appropriate local tribal officials informed of all technical information relating to the project alternatives of proposed road developments.the commissioner shall recommend to the tribe those proposed road projects having the greatest need as determined by the comprehensive transportation analysis.tribes shall then establish annual priorities for road construction projects.subject to the approval of the commissioner,the annual selection of road projects for construction shall be performed by tribes.
a.the commissioner must also obtain tribal consent before assigning for surveying and construction.a.the commissioner must make recommendations to local tribal officials about maximum speed and weight limits,and other regulatory needs,and may only erect corresponding signs with tribal permission.b.only the tribe is authorized to enact and enforce such ordinances on indian lands.id.although part a designates bia roads as generally open for public use,the commissioner may,on behalf of the tribe,restrict such use or close the road to all public use when required for public safety,fire prevention or suppression,or fish and game protection,or to prevent damage to unstable roadbed.a because of these provisions,traffic on route is subject to a degree of tribal control not present in strate.
in granting the route,the northern cheyenne tribe relinquished some,but not all,of the sticks that form the landowner traditional bundle of gatekeeping rights.the tribe has consented to public use of the road.however,traffic on the road remains subject to the authority of the tribe,both in rulemaking and enforcement.no meaningful compensation was received by the tribe in exchange for the presumably because the is maintained,as all bia properties are,for the benefit of the tribe.we conclude that under montana,the tribe retained enough of its gatekeeping rights that route can not be considered fee land,and that the tribe thus maintains jurisdiction over route.
we hold that the nature and purpose of the grant,the continuing control exercised by the tribe over the road,and the supreme court previous treatment of bia roads support the conclusion that the tribal court had jurisdiction to entertain means suit against the mcdonald family.
intervention 
the tribe sought and was denied intervention in the district court action the tribe argues the district court applied the wrong standard,inappropriately requiring that an intervenor must possess a direct economic stake in the action.the tribe asserts that its interest in preserving jurisdiction over route and to provide a judicial forum for its members suffices to justify intervention.
a petitioner seeking intervention of right under federal rule of civil procedure rule a must make a timely motion,claim a significantly protectable interest in the property that is the subject of the action,demonstrate an impairment of its ability to protect that interest,and prove that the interest is inadequately represented by the parties to the action.montana environmental protection agency,cir.
the petition for intervention fails because the tribe can not show a protectable interest in the property that is the subject of the action.the tribe lacks any interest in the means damages claim it seeks only to protect a general sovereignty interest in controlling route.when we considered the similar question of whether a tribe is an indispensable party under rule a,we concluded that a tribe does not have a legally protected interest in maintaining a court system,and that holding that a tribe is a necessary party whenever its jurisdiction is challenged would lead to absurd results.yellowstone county pease,cir.the tribe also claims as a protectable property interest its ability to collect fees from contractors who work on route,but the property at issue here is not route itself but a tort claim for damages.
the tribe has not shown that its interest is inadequately represented.appellant means has argued vigorously that the tribal court has jurisdiction over torts occurring on route.as evidence that means can not adequately represent the tribe interests,the tribe points to his omission of one argument that it believes provides support for a finding of tribal jurisdiction.however,means has presented a wide array of arguments to show that route is the equivalent of a tribal road.
courts have broad discretion to deny permissive intervention under federal rule of civil procedure b.see,san jose mercury news,at.we can not say that the district court erred in denying the tribe permission to intervene.
conclusion 
accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendant on grounds that the tribal court lacked jurisdiction is reversed.the district court decision to deny the northern cheyenne tribe petition to intervene is affirmed.
the majority concludes that a tribal court has the inherent authority to exercise civil jurisdiction over tribal nonmembers acting on tribal land within reservation boundaries.i dissent because i believe the majority decision is inconsistent with over two decades of supreme court precedent on the subject of tribal inherent authority.the court long ago cast aside the notion that a tribe has the inherent authority to exercise jurisdiction over anyone within reservation boundaries.montana united states,d.indeed,tribal inherent authority has consistently been confined to those circumstances in which a particular jurisdictional exercise is necessary to protect the tribe ability to govern itself.strate contractors,d.
as the supreme court has stated,a tribe has the inherent authority to punish tribal offenders,to determine tribal membership,to regulate domestic relations among members,and to prescribe rules of inheritance for members.montana,at.citation omitted.however,a tribe does not have the inherent authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a non member who commits a criminal act within reservation boundaries.oliphant suquamish indian tribe,d a tribe lacks inherent authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction over.a tribe also,with two exceptions,lacks the inherent authority to exercise civil jurisdiction over acting on fee land land owned in fee by tribal nonmembers within reservation boundaries.montana,at.tribe lacks the inherent authority to ban hunting and fishing by nonmembers on property within reservation boundaries,strate,at.tribal court lacks the inherent authority to exercise jurisdiction over tribal nonmember that allegedly committed a tort on fee land.
in its decisions on the subject of tribal inherent authority,the court has repeatedly emphasized that a tribe inherent power does not reach beyond what is necessary to protect tribal or to control internal relations.id.quoting montana,at.quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.in keeping with this principle,the court has stated that 
the restriction on tribal criminal jurisdiction recognized in oliphant rested on principles that support a more general proposition.in the main,the inherent sovereign powers of an indian powers a tribe enjoys apart from express provision by treaty or not extend to the activities of nonmembers of
