this appeal focuses on the interplay between two federal statutes temporary assistance for needy families tanf and the indian and education assistance act isdeaa.the specific question we address is whether an indian tribe may administer tanf,a welfare grant program,through a contract under the isdeaa.like the district court,we conclude that tanf does not qualify as a contractable program under the isdeaa.
background 
until recently,the federal government played a dominant role in administering welfare.although states made many determinations about their own programs,welfare oversight and funding were centralized in the hands of the federal government from the to the late during the,however,the federal government began to decrease its direct involvement in welfare,simultaneously granting states more latitude in their programs and reducing both eligibility for and the scope of benefits 
the federal government initiated its most dramatic break with the past ending welfare as we know it when congress passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of prwora,stat.prwora signaled a major shift in welfare law and policy,jettisoning the old aid to families with dependent children afdc program in favor of tanf.et.tanf was intended to increase the flexibility of states in operating welfare programs by shifting administration of welfare benefits almost entirely from the federal government to the states.a.tanf explicitly provides that it shall not be interpreted to entitle any individual or family to assistance.b.in order to receive funds under tanf,states must submit a plan and apply for block grants.in other words,tanf is simply a program that funnels federal money to states for welfare programs.
tanf also authorizes indian tribes to apply for welfare funds.tanf provision for direct funding and administration by indian tribes directs the secretary of health and human services hhs to pay to each indian tribe that has an approved tribal family assistance plan a tribal family assistance grant for the fiscal year.a a.tanf mandates that e ach indian tribe to which a grant is made shall use the grant for the purpose of operating a program to make work activities available to such population and such service area or areas as the tribe specifies.a c.finally,tanf gives indian tribes somewhat more flexibility than states in applying for block grants.the secretary of labor,for instance,is permitted to waive or modify a set of limitations normally imposed on states,see a c,to the extent necessary to enable the indian tribe to operate a more efficient or effective program.a c ii.
in addition,tanf ensures that the state will provide aid to tribal members who are not part of a tribal assistance program.for a state to be eligible for tanf funds,the state must certify that it will provide each member of an indian tribe,who is domiciled in the state and is not eligible for assistance under a tribal family assistance plan with equitable access to assistance under the state program funded under this part attributable to funds provided by the federal government.a.
notwithstanding prwora explicit funding provision for indian tribes,the navajo nation the tribe applied in october to the secretary of hhs for tanf funds through the isdeaa.the isdeaa directs the secretaries of the interior and of health and human services,
upon the request of any indian tribe by tribal resolution,to enter into a contract or contracts with a tribal organization to plan,conduct,and administer programs or portions thereof,including construction programs

a a e.a contract is defined as a contract entered into between a tribal organization and the appropriate secretary for the planning,conduct and administration of programs or services which are otherwise provided to indian tribes and their members pursuant to federal law.j.
the tribe applied for a contract under a e,claiming that tanf is a program for the benefit of indians because of their status as indians.the tribe chose to apply for tanf funds through the isdeaa rather than through prwora primarily because the isdeaa provides supplemental administrative funds in addition to the money for the contracted programs.see a there shall be added to the amount of funds provided under the contract contract support costs which shall consist of an amount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on by a tribal organization as a contractor.
the secretary of hhs,in a november letter to the tribe,rejected the tribe application because the tanf program is beyond the scope of programs authorized under the isdeaa.section a e authorizes the secretary to reject a contract if the program,function,service,or activity that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs,functions,services,or activities covered.the secretary observed that because tanf was intended to operate for the benefit of needy families without consideration for the status of these families as indian or,it did not satisfy a e.she also determined that a contract for tanf funds did not fall within the statutory definition of a contract because the tanf program is not a program under which the federal government would otherwise directly provide services to indian tribes pursuant to federal law at no time is tanf assistance planned,conducted or administered by the federal government.see j.
when the tribe attempted to appeal the secretary decision through administrative channels,the board of indian appeals determined that the only remedy available was a federal court challenge.accordingly,the tribe filed suit in federal court in arizona,seeking an order requiring the secretary to enter into a contract with the tribe for tanf funds.the secretary filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,urging dismissal on the same grounds set out in her rejection letter.in granting the motion to dismiss,the district court found that b ecause the tanf is not a program providing or administering services directly to indian tribes tanf is not a program contractable under the isdeaa.the tribe appeal of the district court ruling presents a purely legal issue that we review de novo.five bunch,cir.
discussion 
in interpreting the statutes in question,o ur task is to construe what congress has enacted.we begin,as always,with the language of the statute.duncan walker,d.a plain reading of the language of the two statutes leads us to conclude that the isdeaa is not available as an alternate route for administration of tanf funds because tanf is not a program for the benefit of indians because of their status as indians.a e.
further,because tanf simply makes block grants available to the states as a funding mechanism rather than placing the federal government in the role of providing welfare services,tanf is not a federal program subject to contracting under the isdeaa.
to understand why tanf is not contractable,it is instructive to walk through the language of the isdeaa.the contract provision authorizes contracts for programs or portions thereof falling within one of five categories.see a a e.the first three categories refer to specific statutes that fund programs under which tribes may apply for contracts.id.at a c.these subsections help delineate the boundaries of programs that are for the benefit of indians because of their status as indians,id.at e,and illustrate the types of initiatives that constitu
