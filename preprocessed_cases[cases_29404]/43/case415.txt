the issue for decision is whether the hoopa valley indian tribe tribe has authority to regulate logging by a on fee land that she owns,located wholly within the borders of the tribe reservation,in order to protect tribal lands of cultural and historic significance.the district court held that congress expressly delegated such authority to the tribe.we agree,and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
we begin with a brief overview of the historical context in which the present question arises.
establishment of the reservation 
in the middle of the nineteenth century,numerous conflicts erupted between white settlers and native americans in northern california.as california grew,due in part to the discovery of gold,clashes between the white settlers and the tribes increased in frequency and severity,usually to the detriment of the native american populations.in response,congress determined that the best policy was to set aside small tracts of land in the new state for the tribes,in order to protect them from the worst effects of settlement.see partitioning certain reservation lands between the hoopa valley tribe and the yurok indians,to clarify the use of tribal timber proceeds,and for other purposes,at senate report.in accordance with that policy,congress enacted legislation authorizing the president to establish four indian reservations in california.act of april,stat,et.
pursuant to the act,president lincoln appointed austin wiley as superintendent of indian affairs for the state of california.wiley then issued a proclamation,which was subject to the approval of the president,establishing the hoopa valley reservation on the trinity river in klamath county,california.short united states,quoting text of proclamation see also,generally byron nelson,our home forever a hupa tribal history providing a detailed history of the hupa tribe.the reservation extended six miles on either side of a stretch of the trinity river,up to the junction of the trinity and the klamath rivers.the square,the common name of the reservation,did not garner presidential authorization until,when president grant issued an executive order approving wiley action.short,at.as defined by president grant,the square consisted of acres on an area of land populated primarily by the hoopa valley tribe.senate report at.
fifteen years later,in,president harrison issued an executive order enlarging the square by adding a tract of land one mile wide on each side of the klamath river,extending to the pacific ocean.see generally mattz arnett,d providing a detailed history of the klamath river reservation.the order created a single reservation by joining the square with the klamath river reservation,which was populated mainly by the yurok indians but was not officially recognized as a reservation.the original klamath river reservation became known as the extension or addition.
congress changes course allotment and reorganization 
contemporaneously with the events just described,congress began to rethink its policy toward native americans.instead of encouraging communalism and separatism through land grants to the tribes,congress decided to encourage individual land ownership and,hopefully,eventual assimilation into the larger society.solem bartlett,d.with that new goal in mind,in congress passed the indian general allotment act,stat,codified at.that act 
permitted the president to make allotments of reservation lands to resident indians and,with tribal consent,to sell surplus lands.its policy was to continue the reservation system and the trust status of indian lands,but to allot tracts to individual indians for agriculture and grazing.when all the lands had been allotted and the trust expired,the reservation could be abolished.unallotted lands were made available to with the purpose,in part,of promoting interaction between the races and of encouraging indians to adopt white ways.
the allotment policy did not have its desired effect that is,in many respects it did not benefit native americans.philip frickey,a common law for our age of colonialism the judicial divestiture of indian tribal authority over nonmembers,yale.one result of allotment was that large swaths of reservation land were lost from indian control altogether,due to sales and tax foreclosures.congress recognized this problem,so it reversed course and passed the indian reorganization act ira in,in which it proclaimed that no land of any indian reservation shall be allotted in severalty to any indian.the ira was an attempt to encourage economic development,cultural plurality,and the revival of tribalism.felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law ed.
section of the ira,gave each indian tribe the right to organize for its common welfare,and adopt an appropriate constitution and bylaws,which were to be approved by the secretary of the interior secretary.the tribe did so and,in,the secretary approved its constitution and bylaws.
although the ira was congress attempt to reduce the negative effects of allotment,congress did not try to undo the dramatic effects of the allotment years on the ownership of former indian lands.it neither imposed restraints on the ability of indian allottees to alienate or encumber their lands nor impaired the rights of those who had acquired title.county of yakima confederated tribes bands of the yakima indian nation,d.thus,the policy of allotment shriveled some reservations much property that once was under indian control was sold off to.cohen at.
the square emerged from this period mostly,although not completely,unscathed.that outcome was due,in part,to the government unwillingness to commit to allotment on the hoopa valley reservation.nelson at.the court below,the northwest regional tribal supreme court for the hoopa valley tribal court of appeals,found that less than one percent of the square approximately acres is presently owned by bugenig hoopa valley tribe,no,indian.this one percent includes the land that now is owned by plaintiff roberta bugenig and is at issue in this case 
c.the settlement act 
members of at least four different native american tribes lived within the boundaries of the hoopa valley reservation.senate report at.however,neither the congressional act nor the or executive orders,by their terms,granted any governing rights to any particular tribe.short,at.despite that omission,throughout the twentieth century,the bureau of indian affairs bia governed the reservation as if the square were a reservation for the hoopas and as if the extension were a reservation for the yuroks.senate report at.that distinction became important,because the square was a source of substantial revenues from the sale of commercial timber,all of which was being divided among the hoopas.short,at.
not surprisingly,the yuroks were dissatisfied with those financial arrangements.in,they sued the secretary of the interior,challenging his decision to exclude them from sharing in the revenue from the harvest of timber grown in the square.ten years later,the court of claims agreed with the yuroks position.id.at.the court of claims held that the executive orders and congressional acts described above established a single reservation for the benefit of all the indians who were living within its boundaries.the federal acts did not vest in any particular tribe rights to the reservation natural resources,at least not to the exclusion of any other tribe that was living in the hoopa valley.id.at.therefore,the court of claims concluded that all the indians of the reservation were entitled to the proceeds from the sale of the square natural resources.id.at.
after short was decided,several yuroks filed another action against the bia and the hoopa tribe,alleging that those defendants had violated their rights to participate in reservation administration and to benefit from the reservation resources.puzz united states,no,wl,at,order vacated,dismissing as moot after passage of the settlement act.the crux of the yuroks complaint was that,although several tribes resided in the hoopa valley reservation,only one tribe,the hoopas,was allowed to administer it.as noted,the hoopas had formed a tribal government in which indians were ineligible to participate.id.
the district court agreed that the executive orders and congressional acts did not grant any territorial or political rights to the hoopa valley tribe to the exclusion of other indians living on the reservation.id.at.the court ordered the bia to exercise supervisory power over reservation administration,resource management,and spending of reservation funds,to ensure that all indians receive the use and benefit of the reservation on an equal basis.id.at.
congress entered the fray in with the settlement act settlement act.in the settlement act,congress sought to establish a fair and equitable settlement of the dispute relating to the ownership and management of the hoopa valley reservation.senate report at.congress did so by partitioning the reservation.the square became the hoopa valley reservation,with the unallotted trust land and assets held in trust by the united states for the benefit of the hoopa valley tribe,while the extension became the yurok reservation,with a similar trust arrangement for the yurok tribe.b c.
congress also established a settlement fund and authorized the secretary to prepare a roster of all persons who could be considered indian s of the reservation as discussed by the court of claims in short.and.moreover,as part of its plan to define the rights of the parties involved in the settlement act,congress stated 
the existing govening sic documents of the hoopa valley tribe and the governing body established and elected thereunder,as heretofore recognized by the secretary,are hereby ratified and confirmed.
congress provided that the partition of the reservation,and the ratification and confirmation of the hoopa valley tribe governing documents,were contingent on the tribe adopting a resolution that i waived any claim that the tribe otherwise might have against the united states arising out of the settlement act,and ii consented to the establishment of the settlement fund.a a.the resolution had to be reviewed by the secretary and published in the federal register,both of which occurred.
d.the present dispute 
article ix of the tribe constitution provides that the governing body of the tribe is the hoopa valley business council council.the jurisdiction of the tribe is set forth in article iii the jurisdiction of the hoopa valley tribe shall extend to all lands within the confines of the hoopa valley reservation boundaries and to such other lands as may hereafter be acquired by or for the hoopa valley indians.one of the council enumerated powers,found in article ix,section l l,is to 
safeguard and promote the peace,safety,morals,and general welfare of the hoopa valley indians by regulating the conduct of trade and the use and disposition of property upon the reservation,provided that any ordinance directly affecting of the hoopa valley tribe shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner of indian affairs 
on january,pursuant to those constitutional provisions,and after a public notice and period for public comment,the council adopted a plan.the plan included a mitigation measure,adopted after consultation with the bia,that was designed to protect certain sites of cultural significance to the tribe.the plan established a buffer zone,where no timber could be harvested,around the white deerskin dance ground.the white deerskin dance ground is located on a trail that winds through the reservation,and on a portion of the reservation called bald hill.the prohibition against harvesting timber applied to tribal trust land,trust allotments,and fee land within the mile buffer.decision of hoopa valley tribal council alternative for fy timber sale program.
the parties dispute somewhat the religious centrality of the white deerskin dance,although they agree that it is of significant historical and cultural importance to the tribe.the tribe describes the dance as a world renewal dance.the tribe also asserts that the bald hill dance site is the most important dance site of all dances that the tribe has the site is very ancient.there scientific evidence that indicates that it could be one of the oldest dance sites,oldest ceremonies in the country.bugenig,indian at.
shortly after the council passed its plan,plaintiff purchased her property,which is located on bald hill within the buffer zone.plaintiff applied to the california department of forestry and the county of humboldt for a timberland conversion to convert approximately acres of her land from timberland to pasture.the state granted the permit.plaintiff then applied to the tribe for a permit to haul logs over reservation land.the tribe denied the request.nevertheless,plaintiff sent the tribe a check to cover the hauling fee,but the tribe returned it to her.the tribe also included a letter that explained the tribe position that,within the square,only the hoopa valley tribal council has the authority to make land use changes.
undeterred,plaintiff began clearing timber,which she eventually hauled off her land.the hoopa valley tribal court issued a temporary restraining order and a notice of hearing.after the hearing,which plaintiff declined to attend,the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining her from carrying out any timber operations within the buffer zone.shortly thereafter,the state revoked plaintiff logging permit,stating that no timber operations are allowed on significant historical or archaeological sites defined as sites that have significant or religious importance to california indians.
after another hearing,the tribal court held that the tribe has the power and authority to define areas of sacred significance and,through establishment of the buffer zone in the bald hill area,has exercised that power.hoopa valley tribe bugenig,indian,july.in support of its decision,the tribal court cited montana united states,d.the tribal court then found that plaintiff had acted with blatant disregard of tribal law.bugenig,indian at.accordingly,the court issued a permanent injunction,which barred plaintiff logging activities in the buffer zone and ordered plaintiff to undertake certain remedial measures respecting the trees that she already had felled.id.
the injunction was affirmed on appeal by the tribal court of appeals.that court held that the tribe had acted pursuant to its inherent authority to regulate land in certain circumstances,and also pursuant to the express authority delegated to it by congress in the settlement act.plaintiff did not comply with the injunction.on october,the tribal court held her in civil contempt and ordered her to pay a sanction of.
plaintiff then filed a complaint in the northern district of california,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.she argued that,because she is a who owns her land in fee simple,neither the tribe nor the tribal courts have regulatory or jurisdiction over her land.the district court disagreed,holding that congress,in the settlement act,had delegated authority to the tribe to regulate all the lands within the square,regardless of ownership.
plaintiff filed this timely appeal.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision concerning the scope of a tribe authority to regulate matters affecting.pub.serv.aspaas,cir.additionally,the question whether congress delegated regulatory jurisdiction to the tribe in the settlement act involves the interpretation of a federal statute,which we likewise review de novo.united states fiorillo,cir,cert.denied,d.
discussion 
a.the analytical framework 
at the outset,it bears repeating that certain important facts are undisputed the square was created pursuant to an congressional act and an executive order the land that plaintiff bought had become private property as a result of the operation of the general allotment act and in,congress partitioned the hoopa valley reservation and ratified and confirmed the tribe governing documents.
those facts are noteworthy because the supreme court has ruled that,after allotted land is conveyed to a pursuant to the general allotment act,the indian tribe loses the right of absolute use and occupation of lands so conveyed and no longer has the incidental power to regulate the use of the lands by.south dakota bourland,d.the court has observed that,although congress eventually repudiated the policy behind the general allotment act,it defie s common sense to suppose that congress would intend that purchasing allotted lands would become subject to tribal jurisdiction.atkinson trading shirley,d quoting montana,at.
this presumption against tribal jurisdiction over fee land owned by within reservation boundaries is not absolute,however.the supreme court has set out three limited exceptions to the general rule.id.at.first,a tribe can regulate on fee land that is within a reservation if that power is delegated to the tribe by congress.id.at united states mazurie,d.the other two exceptions come from an indian tribe retained,inherent sovereignty to a regulate,through taxation,licensing,or other means,the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,through commercial dealing,contracts,leases,or other arrangements and to b exercise civil authority over the conduct of on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity,the economic security,or the health or welfare of the tribe.montana,at.see also nevada hicks,d.these two exceptions are the montana exceptions.
in the present case,the district court held that the first exception was satisfied congress,in the settlement act,delegated authority to the tribe to regulate plaintiff land.that is,even if the tribe no longer retained inherent authority to regulate timber harvesting on land within the reservation boundaries in order to protect cultural resources,the settlement act gave the tribe authority to do so.
there is ample support for the general proposition that congress can delegate jurisdiction to an indian tribe.the supreme court has stated,repeatedly,that congress can delegate authority to an indian tribe to regulate the conduct of on land that is within a reservation.see,atkinson trading.at strate contractors,d bourland,at.brendale confederated tribes bands of the yakima indian nation,d white,plurality opinion montana,at.mazurie,at.
whether congress actually delegated authority here is a difficult question,however,because the supreme court has discussed only rarely the concept of express congressional delegation.indeed,the only opinion in which the court has done so in any depth is mazurie.see cohen at noting the paucity of cases discussing congressional delegation of jurisdiction to indians.
at issue in mazurie was a tribal ordinance that required every liquor store located within the wind river reservation to obtain a tribal liquor license.the wind river tribes had enacted the ordinance pursuant to a federal statute that prohibited the introduction of alcoholic beverages into indian country,unless it was done in conformity with both state law and an ordinance duly adopted by the tribe having jurisdiction over such area of indian country.for the purposes of,indian country is defined as all land within the limits of any indian reservation,but excluding lands in communities or through indian reservations,c.
the defendants in mazurie owned a bar on private,fee land within the boundaries of the reservation.the land did not fit the definition of the statutory exclusion because,although the land was,it was not in a community.mazurie,at.defendants,who were,were arrested by federal officers for operating their bar without a tribal liquor license and were convicted in federal district court.the court of appeals reversed the convictions,holding that was an invalid congressional attempt to delegate authority to indian tribes.id.at.the supreme court reversed,holding that 
congress has the constitutional authority to control the sale of alcoholic beverages by on land within the boundaries of an indian reservation,and that congress could validly make a delegation of this authority to a reservation tribal council.
in reaching that conclusion,the court first noted that article i,section,of the united states constitution grants to congress the power to regulate commerce with the indian tribes.id.at.this clause,the court observed,combined with court precedent,leaves no room for doubt that congress has the power to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages to indians and to regulate the introduction of alcoholic beverages into indian country,even if the affected land is owned by a and even if the person regulated is a.id.at.
having determined that congress possessed the power to regulate the defendants land and business,the court then analyzed whether this power could be delegated to the wind valley tribes.the court said yes.although there are limits on the authority of congress to delegate its legislative power,
t hose limitations are less stringent in cases where the entity exercising the delegated authority itself possesses independent authority over the subject matter.thus it is an important aspect of this case that indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory they are a separate people possessing the power of regulating their internal and social relations.
id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also rice rehner,d approving mazurie holding after montana atkinson trading.at citing mazurie with approval.
mazurie instructs that any determination that congress expressly delegated to the tribe authority to regulate logging on plaintiff land involves two distinct questions.first,we must be sure that congress,in the settlement act,actually delegated regulatory authority to the tribe.second,if we conclude that congress did delegate such authority,we must analyze whether that delegation was lawful.we answer each question in turn.
b.did congress delegate to the tribe authority to regulate logging activities on fee land in order to protect cultural and historical resources 
the tribe delegation argument goes as follows in of the settlement act,congress stated that the existing governing documents of the hoopa valley tribe and the governing body established and elected thereunder,as heretofore recognized by the secretary,are hereby ratified and confirmed.emphasis added.that section,argues the tribe,gave their constitution,an existing governing document,the force of law 
article iii of the constitution states that the jurisdiction of the hoopa valley tribe shall extend to all lands within the confines of the hoopa valley reservation boundaries as established by executive order of june,and to such other lands as may hereafter be acquired by or for the hoopa valley indians.emphasis added.article ix,section l,states that the hoopa valley business council,the tribe governing body,may regulate the use and disposition of property upon the reservation,provided that any ordinance directly affecting of the hoopa valley tribe shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner of indian affairs.emphasis added.therefore,the tribe concludes,when congress ratified and confirmed the tribe constitution,congress delegated power to the tribe to regulate the use of all land that is within the boundaries of the reservation,in certain circumstances.
in response,plaintiff observes that the supreme court has ruled that any delegation of power to an indian tribe to regulate a must be express.because the settlement act and the tribe constitution are subject to varying interpretations,argues plaintiff,they do not rise to the level of express delegation that the supreme court has required.
for the reasons that follow,we agree with the tribe.
in the settlement act,congress ratified and confirmed the tribe constitution.
as with all matters of statutory interpretation,we begin by examining the statute text.consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.title states that the tribe governing documents are hereby ratified and confirmed.it is notable that congress used those terms of art.black law dictionary ed defines ratification as the confirmation of a previous act,t he affirmance of a prior act whereby the act is given effect as if originally authorized.similarly,confirmation is defined as to give formal approval the ratification or approval of executive acts by a legislature.id.at.referring to the ordinary legal significance of the terms,when congress ratified and confirmed the governing documents that were heretofore recognized by the secretary,congress was authorizing,giving effect to,and formally approving the tribe constitution.
the phrase ratified and confirmed has additional significance because it is the same phrase that congress historically has used to give legal recognition to agreements between native americans and the united states.see,act of,stat.establishing that an agreement between the manypenny commission and the sioux indian tribes was ratified and confirmed act of,stat,establishing that two agreements between the commissioner of indian affairs and the coeur indian tribe were ratified and confirmed curtis act,stat,establishing that an agreement between the dawes commission and the choctaw and chicksaw tribes was ratified and confirmed 
furthermore,in,congress was well aware of the significance of the term ratified,for the supreme court recently had held that an agreement with an indian tribe is given the force of law when ratified by congress.in antoine washington,d,the court had to interpret a statute ratifying an agreement between the colville confederated tribes and the united states.id.at.quoting stat.the question before the court was whether a provision in the ratified agreement preempted a washington state law.the washington supreme court had interpreted the statute as not giving the agreement the force of law because the agreement was not a treaty.the supreme court disagreed,holding that,o nce ratified by act of congress,the provisions of the agreements become law,and like treaties,the supreme law of the land.id.at.we presume that congress knew of this interpretation.see goodyear atomic miller,d we generally presume that congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts.
in view of the usual meaning of the terms,their historic usage,and the supreme court interpretation,the plain text of the settlement act establishes that,when congress ratified and confirmed the tribe governing documents,it intended to give the tribe constitution the force of law.
our conclusion is buttressed by the legislative history,which makes clear that the settlement act was a response to confusion over who had the right to make management decisions relating to the lands and resources of the square or,for that matter,the reservation as a whole.senate report at.the senate report explains that congress understanding of the law governing the reservation was that,absent statutory delegations,the hoopas could not manage the square.id.the ratification and confirmation of the tribe constitution was exactly that a statutory delegation of authority to the tribe to make management decisions relating to the lands and resources of the square.
the dissent argues that any delegation of authority to regulate land within the reservation was not consciously made and hypothesizes that congress use of the words ratified and confirmed in,when juxtaposed against congress repetition of those words in,expressed congress intent to recognize the tribe and the yuroks as the governing authorities of their respective reservations.dissent at.that forced parallelism will not withstand contextual scrutiny.the phrase ratified and confirmed can not exist in isolation it requires an object.section ratifies and confirms the yurok tribe status as an indian tribe,a status that was previously unrecognized,while ratifies and confirms the hoopa tribe governing documents.emphasis added.as we have explained,the hoopa valley tribe had a longstanding government,while the yuroks had none.
in sum,the natural reading of by its context and that congress was giving legal force to the tribe governing body and governing documents,and that is the reading that we give it.we turn now to the meaning of the tribe constitution with respect to the use of fee lands within the reservation.
the constitution grants the tribe authority over plaintiff land.
the tribe points to two provisions of its constitution that,it claims,give it regulatory authority over plaintiff land in order to protect the tribe cultural and natural resources articles iii and ix l.we agree that the plain text of those provisions supports the tribe position.
article iii states that the jurisdiction of the hoopa valley tribe shall extend to all lands within the confines of the hoopa valley reservation boundaries as established by executive order of june,and to such other lands as may hereafter be acquired by or for the hoopa valley indians.emphasis added.article iii is clear.the tribe has jurisdiction over all lands within the borders of the square 
plaintiff argues that the last clause of article iii,which refers to such other lands,renders ambiguous the first clause,shall extend to all lands within the confines of the reservation.specifically,plaintiff posits that,if the other lands that may be acquired later must be acquired by or for the hoopa valley indians,then the original lands referred to in the first clause also must be assumed to include only lands acquired by or for the hoopa valley indians and thus must be assumed to exclude fee lands owned by.
plaintiff reading of article iii is labored it gives too much weight to the word other and gives too little weight to the word all.article iii reference to all lands within the confines of the hoopa valley reservation boundaries as established by executive order of june,means the square.o ther lands simply adds to the first in addition to the square,which may be acquired later by or for the tribe.
plaintiff also argues that the reference to such other lands as may hereafter be acquired must mean all land that the tribe did not own at the time of the settlement act,including fee land such as hers.under that interpretation,fee land does not qualify for inclusion in all lands within the confines of the hoopa valley reservation boundaries.to read article iii otherwise,she says,would be to make the second clause surplusage.
that conclusion does not follow.the such other lands clause refers to a meaningful category of outside the could be acquired later,but that do not fall within the category of all lands within the square.
our understanding of article iii makes perfect sense when it is read in the light of the overall historical context.the first clause of article iii refers to all lands within the confines of the hoopa valley reservation boundaries as established by executive order of june.emphasis added.at that time,there was no fee land yet checkerboarding the reservation,because the general allotment act was not passed until.thus,our reading of the first clause gives meaning to the historical reference in article iii,while plaintiff does not.
additionally,the indian reorganization act authorizes the secretary of the interior to acquire land for indians within or without existing reservations,and to add such lands to existing reservations.the second clause of article iii appears to be designed to foresee that contingency,extending tribal jurisdiction over any new lands so acquired.
in short,article iii provides that the tribe has jurisdiction over all lands within the borders of the square.we conclude that this assertion of jurisdiction includes plaintiff land.
the second provision on which the tribe relies is article ix l.article ix sets out the powers of the hoopa valley business council.section l grants the council the power to 
safeguard and promote the peace,safety,morals,and general welfare of the hoopa valley indians by regulating the conduct of trade and the use and disposition of property upon the reservation,provided that any ordinance directly affecting of the hoopa valley tribe shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner of indian affairs 
emphasis added.
that provision unambiguously contemplates tribal regulation of the use of property upon the reservation,even if the regulation affects.plaintiff acknowledges that article ix l refers to as individuals,but notes that it does not refer to fee lands.again,we are not persuaded.
plaintiff position is that fee lands owned by do not count as property upon the reservation.in view of our reading of article iii,however,we believe that article ix l plainly refers to all property upon the square,whoever owns it.
moreover,plaintiff reading of article ix l would make some of its provisions meaningless.the proviso that any ordinance directly affecting is subject to approval contains no further limitation that is,it assumes that any of the kinds of ordinances covered by article ix l could affect.emphasis added.plaintiff interpretation gives full force to the grant of power to regulate conduct of trade but would give no force to the grant of power to regulate use and disposition of property.if the tribe could not regulate fee lands,there would be no reason to provide for approval of ordinances that affect for example,disposition of property upon the reservation.
like article iii,article ix l is unambiguous.it states unequivocally that the council can pass an ordinance that affects and their lands,so long as the ordinance safeguards and promotes the peace,safety,morals,and general welfare of the tribe and is approved by the commissioner of indian affairs.an ordinance that is designed to protect a tribe significant historical and cultural resources safeguard s and promote s the peace,safety,morals,and general welfare of the tribe.it is undisputed that the ordinance was approved by the commissioner of indian affairs.
under article iii and article ix l,then,the tribe had the power to pass the ordinance that affected plaintiff logging activity on her fee land within the borders of the reservation 
read together with the tribal constitution,the settlement act is an express delegation to the tribe.
plaintiff argues that,even if the settlement act and the tribal constitution,read together,constitute a delegation of authority to the tribe,it is not the kind of express authorization that the supreme court has required before a tribe may regulate lands that are within a reservation boundaries.see strate,at.our case law establishes that,absent express authorization by federal statute or treaty,tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of nonmembers exists only in limited circumstances.we come to the opposite conclusion.
as the preceding analysis establishes,neither the settlement act nor the tribe constitution contains any ambiguity.when congress ratified and confirmed the tribe constitution,congress delegated authority to the tribe to regulate all the lands within the square,including that owned by plaintiff.
we presume,as we must,that congress understood the contents of the governing documents that it ratified and confirmed.as the supreme court has taught,the argument that congress was unaware of what it accomplished or that it was misled by the groups that appeared before it lacks force.united states ret.bd.fritz,d.if this test were applied literally to every member of any legislature that ever voted on a law,there would be very few laws which would survive it.id.if the text of a statute is clear,as it is here,we must assume that congress intended what it enacted.id.
even if that presumption did not apply,the events surrounding the enactment of the settlement act show that congress understood the scope of its delegation.as noted,the legislative history makes clear that congress was under the impression that,absent statutory delegations,the hoopas could not make management decisions relating to the lands and resources of the square.senate report at.
the tribe had been attempting to make such management decisions before congress enacted the settlement act.in doing so,the tribe took the position that its constitution enabled it to promulgate ordinances affecting and their fee lands within the square.for example,section of the law and order code of the hoopa valley tribe,which was enacted in,asserts that 
the effective area of this code shall include all territory within the hoopa valley indian reservation,as defined by the hoopa tribal constitution,including fee patent lands,allottments sic,assignments,and existing and future lands outside the boundaries of the reservation owned or controlled by the hoopa valley tribe.
similarly,the comprehensive plan for the hoopa valley indian reservation,adopted in,grants the tribe government the power to provide for assessments or license fees of all commercial ventures within the limits of the reservation,while at the same time acknowledging that percent of all commercial business services are owned by and are located on former tribal land.hoopa valley indian reservation comprehensive plan,adopted june.
moreover,it is significant that the ratification of the tribe constitution was not.instead,its implementation was contingent on actions that were to occur within sixty days after the act passage.section a a provided that the partition of the reservation and the ratification and confirmation of the tribe governing documents would occur only if the tribe passed a resolution waiving claims against the united states and consenting to the settlement fund.the tribal resolution had to be approved by the secretary and published in the federal register.
the tribe passed the requisite resolution and had it approved by the secretary and published in the federal register.the resolution sheds more light on the circumstances surrounding the settlement act.it stated,among other things,that the puzz and short cases had crippled the power of the hoopa valley business council to exercise the authorit y granted under the tribe constitution to govern.at emphasis added.with the settlement act,congress expressly gave that authority to the tribe.
after that resolution was published and approved,congress amended the settlement act,see,but it did nothing to alter the tribe interpretation,which the secretary had approved,and which had been duly published.although postenactment developments can not be accorded the weight of contemporary legislative history,we would be remiss if we ignored these authoritative expressions concerning the scope and purpose of the statute.haven bd.of educ.bell,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.when an agency statutory construction has been fully brought to the attention of the public and the congress,and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects,then presumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we acknowledge that the settlement act does not contain a detailed explanation,such as we hereby delegate to the tribe the power to regulate all lands within the reservation,notwithstanding any patent owned by.but no particular verbal formula is required.
on this issue,we agree with the district of columbia circuit opinion in arizona public service epa,cert.denied,d.there,the court responded to an argument that because congress had,in the past,delegated authority to regulate to indian tribes by using the words notwithstanding the issuance of any patent,any delegation that did not use these words could not be an express delegation of authority to regulate non members.the court disagreed and observed that a provision uses a new formulation is not dispositive of the question as to whether it constitutes an express delegation.at.
the settlement act is not ambiguous.when congress ratified and confirmed the tribe constitution,it gave that constitution the force of law.neither is the tribe constitution ambiguous.it contemplates regulation of all land within the square,in order to protect the general welfare of the tribe,even if that regulation affects the use of lands owned in fee by.in sum,when the tribe passed the ordinance,it was acting pursuant to authority expressly granted by congress.
could congress delegate that authority to the tribe 
plaintiff final argument is that congress could not delegate such authority to the tribe,even if it meant to.plaintiff asserts that there is no authority or precedent for finding that an act of congress can take regulatory jurisdiction over owned property away from a state government and give it to a tribe.
plaintiff has framed the question incorrectly,because her question assumes that state and federal jurisdiction can not exist simultaneously over land within a reservation.it is true that a state has some jurisdiction over land within an indian reservation,county of yakima,at.cohen at.it also is true,however,that federal jurisdiction reaches activities that occur on fee patented land within a reservation,mazurie,at.put differently,the want of state regulatory jurisdiction over land is not a necessary condition for federal regulatory jurisdiction over the same land.see white mountain apache tribe bracker,d explaining preemption law applicable to indian reservations in fact,the supreme court has suggested that tribal jurisdiction and state jurisdiction are not mutually exclusive.see brendale,at.the possibility that the county might have jurisdiction to prohibit certain land uses does not suggest that the tribe lacks similar authority.stevens,plurality opinion see also confederated tribes washington,cir holding that tribal fishing regulations on waters within the colville reservation did not preempt state fishing regulations concerning the same waters.
regardless,the question whether california may also have jurisdiction over plaintiff land is not before us we are concerned only with whether congress,in order to protect sites of cultural or religious significance to a tribe,can regulate timber harvesting on private property that is located within a reservation and,if so,whether it can delegate that power to the tribe.the answer to both questions is yes.
congress has plenary jurisdiction over the reservation.
congress power over native american affairs is unusual in our federal system because it includes general federal authority to legislate over health,safety,and morals.cohen at.it is now generally recognized that the power derives from federal responsibility for regulating commerce with indian tribes and for treaty making.mcclanahan state tax comm n,d citing const.art.i,cl.const.art.ii,cl.the supreme court has referred to congress power over indian affairs as plenary and has noted that,
in the exercise of the war and treaty powers,the united states overcame the indians and took possession of their lands,sometimes by force,leaving them needing protection against the selfishness of others and their own improvidence.of necessity the united states assumed the duty of furnishing that protection,and with it the authority to do all that was required to perform that obligation and to prepare the indians to take their place as independent,qualified members of the modern body politic.
morton mancari,d quoting bd.of county comm rs seber.of course,the power of congress in indian affairs,although plenary,is not absolute it must be rationally related to the protection of indians.tribal bus.comm.weeks,d.
it is clear that congress,exercising its plenary power over indian tribes,could enact the ordinance in question and could regulate all the land within the reservation that is owned by the tribe or held in trust for the tribe.white mountain apache tribe,at.and we do not read the supreme court cases as holding that congress plenary power to act on behalf of native americans necessarily ends at the border of allotted land,owned by a,that is located wholly within a reservation.rather,although the ownership status of land is one factor in determining the jurisdictional reach of the federal government,it is not dispositive.
as we noted earlier,the court has held that congress can delegate to an indian tribe the power to regulate a private landowner whose property is located wholly within a reservation,montana,at.by necessary implication,it follows that congress itself could regulate the same property in the first instance.
a more express version of that proposition is found in mazurie,in which the court noted that the federal government retains authority,under its indian commerce clause power,to regulate the use of land within a reservation that is owned by a,if the that case,a regulation pertaining to the sale of meant to benefit the tribe.at.indeed,the court in mazurie upheld the constitutionality of,which defines indian country,for purposes of federal criminal jurisdiction,as including lands.id.at.
the court in mazurie was guided by two other cases,seymour superintendent of washington state penitentiary,d,and perrin united states.in seymour,the court held that the federal government had jurisdiction over a crime committed by an indian on land patented in fee to a.at.in so holding,the court reasoned that making criminal jurisdiction dependent on land ownership would create an impractical pattern of checkerboard jurisdiction,which would be unworkable.id.
similarly,in perrin,the court held that the federal government could regulate the sale of alcohol on surplus lands that were formerly part of a reservation as distinct from allotted land within a reservation,but now were owned by.at.the defendant argued that the federal regulation exceeded the power of congress,but the court disagreed.congress did have the authority to protect the tribe 
as the power is incident only to the presence of the indians and their status as wards of the government,it must be conceded that it does not go beyond what is reasonably essential to their protection,and that,to be effective,its exercise must not be purely arbitrary,but founded upon some reasonable basis.
mazurie,seymour,and perrin establish that,when evaluating a regulation aimed at protecting a tribe,land ownership and tribal membership are not determinative of jurisdiction.more support for that proposition can be found in the legal doctrine that has developed around the surplus land act cases,in which the court has attempted to define the applicable jurisdictional regime on unallotted surplus reservation lands that congress opened to settlement.generally,the court has instructed,the states have jurisdiction over unallotted surplus lands if the applicable surplus land act diminished the reservation boundaries.solem,at.by contrast,if a surplus land act simply offered the opportunity to purchase land within established reservation boundaries,then the entire opened area remained indian country,including fee land,and was subject to federal regulation.south dakota yankton sioux tribe,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in those cases,the court has determined jurisdiction by examining the text of the surplus land act in question,as well as the historical context surrounding the act and the subsequent treatment of the land.id.at.notably,in solem,the court observed that,o nce a block of land is set aside for an indian reservation and no matter what happens to the title of individual plots within the area,the entire block retains its reservation status until congress explicitly indicates otherwise.at.emphasis added.
from that jurisprudence we derive support for the principle that federal jurisdiction within a reservation is not dependent solely on the ownership status of the land in question.instead,following the cases described above,we must a examine whether congress intended to divest itself of all jurisdiction when it authorized allotment of the reservation,and b then determine whether the ordinance is necessary for the protection of the tribe.
congress retained jurisdiction after allotment.
we do not believe that congress intended to divest itself of jurisdiction in this case.the hoopa valley reservation,even after allotment,remains percent intact.less than one percent of the land is owned in fee simple by.again,reasoning by analogy to the surplus land act cases,when determining congress intent to divest itself of jurisdiction,congress own treatment of the affected areas has some evidentiary value,as does the manner in which the bia and local judicial authorities dealt with unallotted open lands.solem,at.here,less than one percent of the land is owned in fee by,due primarily to the federal government own unwillingness to authorize allotment in the square.see nelson at summarizing the history of allotment on the hoopa valley reservation.that unwillingness also is illustrated by congress failure to pass an allotment act that was directed specifically to the hoopa valley reservation,as it did for several other reservations.see mattz,at.noting that congress occasionally enacted special legislation in order to assure that a particular reservation was in fact opened to allotment.
the supreme court opinion in mattz is especially instructive.there,the question for the court was whether the klamath river indian reservation,the extension was terminated by congressional act,or whether it remained indian country.the state of california argued for the former result.it reasoned that,although in the extension was joined to the square,in congress passed an act to provide for the disposition and sale of lands known as the klamath river indian reservation,which opened the extension to allotment to indians and to homesteading by.id.at.the statute,said the state,extinguished the entire extension reservation status.id.at.
the supreme court disagreed.the court noted that the act was similar to the general allotment act,in which congress had established its intention to continue the reservation system and the trust status of indian lands,but to allot tracts to individual indians for agriculture and grazing.when all the lands had been allotted and the trust expired,the reservation could be abolished.id.emphasis added.the court determined that the provisions of the act do not differ materially from those of the general allotment act of and,therefore,allotment under the act is completely consistent with continued reservation status.id.at.emphasis added.the court then stated that when congress has once established a reservation all tracts included within it remain a part of the reservation until separated therefrom by congress.id.at.emphasis added quoting united states celestine.
as we have noted,the supreme court also has held that land retains its reservation status after being ceded to under a surplus land act and,thus,may be subject to federal jurisdiction.this is in contrast to a statute that diminished the reservation boundaries,leaving the fee land outside the reservation.see yankton sioux tribe,at.evaluating whether a landfill was subject to federal environmental regulations by determining whether the land,which was owned in fee by a,was still a part of the reservation,and concluding that it was not part of the reservation.the key to determining reservation status is congressional intent.id.at.and mattz establishes that congress meant for tracts of land within a reservation that were allotted pursuant to the general allotment act to retain their reservation status until all reservation lands eventually could be allotted and the reservation could be abolished.at.
the foregoing analysis,combined with mazurie holding that it is constitutional for congress to regulate conduct on privately owned,allotted land within a reservation,leads us to conclude that plaintiff is wholly within a reservation and which was allotted pursuant to the general allotment subject to plenary federal jurisdiction.
it is true,as plaintiff points out,that the court has stated that it defies common sense to suppose that congress would intend that purchasing allotted lands would become subject to tribal jurisdiction.montana,at.however,that statement was a reference to a tribe inherent authority,not to the jurisdiction of the united states that may have remained after allotment.id.
moreover,even concerning a tribe remaining inherent authority,the court recently held that congress could not have intended,in enacting the general allotment act,that tribes would lose control over the character of their reservations upon the sale of a few,relatively small parcels of land.brendale,at.stevens,plurality opinion emphasis added.in brendale,the court,in a fractured opinion,held that an indian tribe retains authority to zone a fee land that is within a closed part of a reservation.id.we believe that the same can be said of congress plenary authority over the square.congress could not have intended,after the sale of a few,relatively small parcels of land,to lose its power to pass regulations that protect the tribe,including regulations that encompass the entire reservation.
b.the ordinance protects the tribe.
the ordinance in question,like the regulations in mazurie,perrin,and brendale,is a rule of general applicability that is intended to protect the internal and social relations of tribal life.mazurie,at.while plaintiff has deconstructed the ordinance into a regulation that is only about cutting trees,we view it more holistically as a reasonable means to preserve and protect tribal resources that possess significant historical and religious value.we see no principled reason why the federal government can prohibit a from selling alcohol on land that he owns in fee within a reservation,in order to protect the physical health of an indian tribe,but can not prohibit a from using such lands so as to put the spiritual health of a tribe at risk.
we conclude,then,that the federal government did retain jurisdiction to protect the cultural and natural resources of the reservation,despite the fact that land owned by would be affected by such regulation.
congress could delegate that authority to the tribe.
finally,we must determine whether congress could delegate that regulatory authority to the tribe.again,we look to mazurie for our answer.there,the court noted that,although there are limits on the authority of congress to delegate its legislative power,those limits are less stringent in cases where the entity exercising the delegated authority itself possesses independent authority over the subject matter.at.indian tribes,the court observed,are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory.id.at.see also atkinson trading.at citing mazurie with approval.
this case,like mazurie,involves the regulation of a conduct on land owned by a wholly within the boundaries of a reservation.as in mazurie,the ordinance at issue affects the internal and social relations of tribal life,a subject as to which the tribe retains at least some independent authority.at.see also brendale,at.holding that an indian tribe retained inherent authority to zone land held in fee by a in a closed area of a reservation montana,at.noting that indian tribes retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of on fee lands within the reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the health or welfare of the tribe 
plaintiff also argues that congress could not delegate regulatory power to the tribe because she can not become a member of the tribe and therefore can not participate in its government.the court in mazurie rejected a similar argument,noting that were protected from arbitrary tribal conduct in at least two ways by,which applies constitutional prohibitions to tribal governments and by the fact that the tribal ordinances had to be approved by the secretary.at.the same is true here.section applies to the tribe and,pursuant to the tribe constitution,any ordinance directly affecting must be approved by the this ordinance was.
because the tribe possesses unique attributes of sovereignty,and because the tribe has at least some independent authority over the subject matter at issue,we hold that the federal government could delegate to the tribe its authority to protect cultural and historical resources of significance,even though the lands were held in fee by,and even though the persons regulated were.mazurie,at.
conclusion 
we hold that congress expressly delegated authority to the tribe to enact the ordinance in question and that congress had the power to do so.
because i disagree with the majority holding that congress has expressly conferred jurisdiction upon the hoopa valley tribe over lands held in fee by,i dissent.
in reaching this conclusion,i have given,as i must,the greatest deference to the supreme court insistence that jurisdiction over on land is exceptional.that is because tribes have limited authority and jurisdiction over.see atkinson trading,shirley,d strate contractors,d montana united states,d.that limitation is surely proper and should be treated with respect,especially in light of the fact that if j
