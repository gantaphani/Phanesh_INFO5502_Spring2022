blue lake rancheria,an indian tribe,seeks a refund of federal unemployment tax act taxes paid by mainstay business solutions,an employee leasing company wholly owned by the tribe.section c of title of the united states code excepts from the definition of employment and thus exempts from the payment of employment tax services performed in the employ of an indian tribe,or any instrumentality of a tribe.we hold today that this exception does not apply where a tribe is merely a statutory employer in essence,nothing more than a paymaster.the exception granted by c applies only where a tribe is the employer.however,undisputed facts show that mainstay was,indeed,the employer of the workers at issue here and,therefore,was entitled to the special tax treatment congress saw fit to grant to indian tribes.
background 
blue lake rancheria is a member,federally recognized indian tribe located in humboldt county,california.in may,the tribe established mainstay business solutions as a business owned by and operated for the benefit of the tribe.mainstay provided employee leasing and temporary staffing for businesses located in california,hawaii,and nevada.mainstay contracted with each of its clients to hire the client employees as its own and then lease those employees back to the client.the client supervised the leased employees on a basis,but mainstay paid their wages,provided benefits,and performed other human resources functions.according to mainstay,this arrangement allowed the client to free itself from responsibilities and focus on its business,and resulted in better benefits for employees.during the years at issue in this case and,mainstay paid wages for approximately workers.
mainstay reported and paid in futa taxes for and for.mainstay later filed claims for refunds with respect to these tax payments,asserting that,as a tribally owned business entity,it was exempt from futa tax liability under c having received no formal response from the irs regarding the refund claims,the tribe filed suit in the northern district of california.the complaint sought a full refund of the futa taxes paid by mainstay for and,plus statutory interest.
the tribe and the united states filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the united states motion for summary judgment and denied the tribe motion.the court held that c exception for services performed in the employ of an indian tribe applies only where the tribe is a employer.the court further held that the tribe failed to present facts sufficient to establish that mainstay was the employer of the workers in question.
the tribe now appeals.we have jurisdiction under.

standard of review 
the first question presented by this case the scope of c s exception from employment is one of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see idaho farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.
the second question whether mainstay is the employer of its leased employees is a mixed question of law and fact.see chin united states,cir citing prof l exec.leasing,comm r,cir.where a case turns on a mixed question of law and fact and,as here,the only disputes relate to the legal significance of undisputed facts,the controversy collapses into a question of law suitable to disposition on summary judgment.thrifty oil bank of am.trust sav.ass n,cir.we review de novo the district court decision on for summary judgment.trunk city of san diego,cir.
scope of c exception 
this case requires us to interpret c,which excepts services performed in the employ of an indian tribe from the definition of employment for purposes of futa.statutory interpretation begins with the text of the statute itself.see brock writers guild of,cir.the plain meaning of a statute controls where that text is unambiguous.see green comm r,cir.
subtitle c of the internal revenue code governs employment taxes on individuals and their employers.see.subtitle c includes the federal insurance contributions act chapter,futa chapter,and provisions regarding income tax withholding chapter.futa funds the joint unemployment insurance program by imposing an employment tax 
there is hereby imposed on every employer as defined in section a for each calendar year an excise tax,with respect to having individuals in his employ,equal to percent of the total wages as defined by section b paid by him during the calendar year or portion of the calendar year with respect to employment as defined in section c.
the futa tax applies only to the first an employer pays to each employee during the year.b.employers may take a credit against the tax for amounts paid to state unemployment funds,reducing the minimum effective futa tax rate to.central to this case is futa definition of employment.section c defines employment as,in relevant part,any service,of whatever nature,performed after by an employee for the person employing him,irrespective of the citizenship or residence of either.c.futa incorporates by reference the definition of employee from fica,d,which defines the term in relevant part as any individual who,under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the relationship,has the status of an employee.see i referring to d.
section c contains a number of exceptions to the definition of employment.see c.services falling under one of these exceptions are not considered employment and,therefore,do not give rise to futa tax liability.among c exceptions is the governmental and tribal employer exception,which excludes from employment 
service s performed in the employ of a state,or any political subdivision thereof,or in the employ of an indian tribe,or any instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing which is wholly owned by one or more states or political subdivisions or indian tribes 
this case turns on the interpretation of c exception from employment of services performed in the employ of an indian tribe.the government argues and the district court agreed that this exception applies only where a tribe is the employer of a worker the tribe,on the other hand,contends that the phrase in the employ of also covers situations where a tribe is only the statutory employer.a employer is the employer under the general common law of agency.see cmty.for creative non violence reid ccnv,d.in contrast,a statutory employer is merely a paymaster the person having control of the payment of wages,where the person for whom an individual performs or performed services does not have control of the payment of the wages for such services.d.
the tribe asks us to hold that an indian tribe or instrumentality thereof is exempt from paying futa taxes whenever it acts as a statutory employer in other words,whenever it controls the payment of wages for services performed for another entity.to support this argument,the tribe relies primarily on the supreme court decision in otte united states,d,which extended the application of d definition of employer to the context of fica.in otte,a bankruptcy case,the supreme court had to decide whether priority claims for wages earned prior to an employer bankruptcy,but paid by the trustee after the inception of bankruptcy proceedings,were subject to withholding of income and fica taxes.at.section a requires every employer making payment of wages to deduct and withhold income tax upon such wages,and a provides that fica tax shall be collected by the employer of the taxpayer,by deducting the amount of the tax from the wages as and when paid.otte,the bankruptcy trustee,argued that he did not have to withhold income or fica taxes because he was not the employer and because the claim payments were not wages.at.the court rejected these arguments,pointing to d definition of employer 
for purposes of this chapter,the term employer means the person for whom an individual performs or performed any service,of whatever nature,as the employee of such person,except that if the person for whom the individual performs or performed the services does not have control of the payment of the wages for such services,the term employer except for purposes of subsection a means the person having control of the payment of such wages.
d at.the court explained that this definition obvious
