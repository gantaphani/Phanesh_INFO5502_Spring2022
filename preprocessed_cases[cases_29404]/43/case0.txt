petitioners brian and michelle lewis were driving on a connecticut interstate when they were struck from behind by a vehicle driven by respondent william clarke,a mohegan tribal gaming authority employee,who was transporting mohegan sun casino patrons.the lewises sued clarke in his individual capacity in state court.clarke moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that because he was an employee of the gaming authority an arm of the mohegan tribe entitled to sovereign immunity and was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident,he was similarly entitled to sovereign immunity against suit.he also argued,in the alternative,that he should prevail because the gaming authority was bound by tribal law to indemnify him.the trial court denied clarke motion,but the supreme court of connecticut reversed,holding that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit because clarke was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.it did not consider whether clarke should be entitled to sovereign immunity based on the indemnification statute.
in a suit brought against a tribal employee in his individual capacity,the employee,not the tribe,is the real party in interest and the tribe sovereign immunity is not implicated.
a in the context of lawsuits against state and federal employees or entities,courts look to whether the sovereign is the real party in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit,see hafer melo.a defendant in an action where the relief sought is only nominally against the official and in fact is against the official office and thus the sovereign itself may assert sovereign immunity.kentucky graham.but an officer in an action which seeks to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of state law,hafer,at may be able to assert personal immunity defenses but not sovereign immunity,at.the court does not reach clarke argument that he is entitled to the personal immunity defense of official immunity,which clarke raised for the first time on appeal.
b applying these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign immunity,it is apparent that they foreclose clarke sovereign immunity defense.this action arises from a tort committed by clarke on a connecticut interstate and is simply a suit against clarke to recover for his personal actions.clarke,not the gaming authority,is the real party in interest.the state supreme court extended sovereign immunity for tribal employees beyond what sovereign immunity principles would recognize for either state or federal employees.
an indemnification provision can not,as a matter of law,extend sovereign immunity to individual employees who would otherwise not fall under its protective cloak.
a this conclusion follows naturally from the principles discussed above and previously applied to the different question whether a state instrumentality may invoke the state immunity from suit even when the federal government has agreed to indemnify that instrumentality against adverse judgments,regents of of cal.doe.there,this court held that the indemnification provision did not divest the state instrumentality of eleventh amendment immunity,and its analysis turned on where the potential legal liability lay,not from whence the money to pay the damages award ultimately came.here,the connecticut courts exercise no jurisdiction over the tribe or gaming authority,and their judgments will not bind the tribe or its instrumentalities in any way.moreover,indemnification is not a certainty,because clarke will not be indemnified should the gaming authority determine that he engaged in wanton,reckless,or malicious activity.mohegan tribe code.
b courts have extended sovereign immunity to private healthcare insurance companies under certain circumstances,but those cases rest on the proposition that the fiscal intermediaries are essentially state instrumentalities,and clarke offers no persuasive reason to depart from precedent and treat a lawsuit against an individual employee as one against a state instrumentality.similarly,this court has never held that a civil rights suit under against a state officer in his individual capacity implicates the eleventh amendment and a state sovereign immunity from suit.finally,this court conclusion that indemnification provisions do not alter the analysis for sovereign immunity purposes is consistent with the practice that applies in the contexts of diversity of citizenship and joinder.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of connecticut 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
indian tribes are generally entitled to immunity from suit.this court has considered the scope of that immunity in a number of circumstances.this case presents an ordinary negligence action brought against a tribal employee in state court under state law.we granted certiorari to resolve whether an indian tribe sovereign immunity bars damages actions against tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment and for which the employees are indemnified by the tribe.
we hold that,in a suit brought against a tribal employee in his individual capacity,the employee,not the tribe,is the real party in interest and the tribe sovereign immunity is not implicated.that an employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time the tort was committed is not,on its own,sufficient to bar a suit against that employee on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity.we hold further that an indemnification provision does not extend a tribe sovereign immunity where it otherwise would not reach.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
the mohegan tribe of indians of connecticut traces its lineage back centuries.originally part of the lenni lenape,the tribe formed the independent mohegan tribe under the leadership of sachem uncas in the early.fawcett,the lasting of the mohegans.in,in accordance with the petition procedures established by the bureau of indian affairs,the tribe attained federal recognition see fed.reg.mohegan,preamble and art.ii.
as one means of maintaining its economic,the tribe entered into a gaming compact with the state of connecticut pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act,stat,et.the compact authorizes the tribe to conduct gaming on its land,subject to certain conditions including establishment of the gaming disputes court.see fed.reg.approving the compact between the mohegan indian tribe and the state of connecticut may,mohegan,art.xiii,mohegan tribe code a supp.the mohegan tribal gaming authority,an arm of the tribe,exercises the powers of the mohegan tribe over tribal gaming activities.mohegan,art.xiii,mohegan tribe code.
of particular relevance here,mohegan law sets out sovereign immunity and indemnification policies applicable to disputes arising from gaming activities.the gaming authority has waived its sovereign immunity and consented to be sued in the mohegan gaming disputes court.mohegan,art.xiii,mohegan tribe code b.neither the tribe nor the gaming authority has consented to suit for claims arising under connecticut state law.see mohegan,art.ix,t mohegan tribe code g see also blatchford native village of noatak,observing that indian tribes have not surrendered their immunity against suits by states.further,mohegan tribe code provides that the gaming authority shall save harmless and indemnify its officer or employee from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim,demand,or suit by reason of his or her alleged negligence if the officer or employee is found to have been acting in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment.the gaming authority does not indemnify employees who engage in wanton,reckless or malicious activity.mohegan tribe code.
petitioners brian and michelle lewis were driving down interstate in norwalk,connecticut,when a limousine driven by respondent william clarke hit their vehicle from behind.clarke,a gaming authority employee,was transporting patrons of the mohegan sun casino to their homes.for purposes of this appeal,it is undisputed that clarke caused the accident.
the lewises filed suit against clarke in his individual capacity in connecticut state court,and clarke moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity.see wl,super.clarke argued that because the gaming authority,an arm of the tribe,was entitled to sovereign immunity,he,an employee of the gaming authority acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident,was similarly entitled to sovereign immunity against suit.according to clarke,denying the motion would abrogate the tribe sovereign immunity.
the trial court denied clarke motion to dismiss,at.the court agreed with the lewises that the sovereign immunity analysis should focus on the remedy sought in their complaint.to that end,the court identified clarke,not the gaming authority or the tribe,as the real party in interest because the damages remedy sought was solely against clarke and would in no way affect the tribe ability to govern itself independently.the court therefore concluded that tribal sovereign immunity was not implicated,at.it also rejected clarke alternative argument that because the gaming authority was obligated to indemnify him pursuant to mohegan tribe code and would end up paying the damages,he should prevail under the remedy analysis,at.the trial court reasoned that a voluntary undertaking can not be used to extend sovereign immunity where it did not otherwise exist.ibid.
the supreme court of connecticut reversed,holding that tribal sovereign immunity did bar the suit.the court agreed with clarke that because he was acting within the scope of his employment for the mohegan tribal gaming authority and the mohegan tribal gaming authority is an arm of the mohegan tribe,tribal sovereign immunity bars the plaintiffs claims against him.at,at.of particular significance to the court was ensuring that plaintiffs can not circumvent tribal immunity by merely naming the defendant,an employee of the tribe,when the complaint concerns actions taken within the scope of his duties and the complaint does not allege,nor have the plaintiffs offered any other evidence,that he acted outside the scope of his authority.at,at.to do otherwise,the court reasoned,would eviscerate the protections of tribal immunity,at,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.because the court determined that clarke was entitled to sovereign immunity on the sole basis that he was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred,at,at,it did not consider whether clarke should be entitled to sovereign immunity on the basis of the indemnification statute.
we granted certiorari to consider whether tribal sovereign immunity bars the lewises suit against clarke,and we now reverse the judgment of the supreme court of connecticut.
two issues require our resolution whether the sovereign immunity of an indian tribe bars damages against tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment and what role,if any,a tribe decision to indemnify its employees plays in this analysis.we decide this case under the framework of our precedents regarding tribal immunity.
our cases establish that,in the context of lawsuits against state and federal employees or entities,courts should look to whether the sovereign is the real party in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit.see hafer melo.in making this assessment,courts may not simply rely on the characterization of the parties in the complaint,but rather must determine in the first instance whether the remedy sought is truly against the sovereign.see,ex parte new york.if,for example,an action is in essence against a state even if the state is not a named party,then the state is the real party in interest and is entitled to invoke the eleventh amendment protection.for this reason,an arm or instrumentality of the state generally enjoys the same immunity as the sovereign itself,regents of of cal.doe.similarly,lawsuits brought against employees in their official capacity represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent,and they may also be barred by sovereign immunity.kentucky graham,internal quotation marks omitted.
the distinction between individual and suits is paramount here.in an claim,the relief sought is only nominally against the official and in fact is against the official office and thus the sovereign itself.will michigan of state police,dugan rank.this is why,when officials sued in their official capacities leave office,their successors automatically assume their role in the litigation.hafer,at.the real party in interest is the government entity,not the named official.see edelman jordan.suits,on the other hand,seek to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of state law.hafer,at emphasis added see also,at discharged employees entitled to bring personal damages action against state auditor general bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents.o fficers sued in their personal capacity come to court as individuals,hafer,at,and the real party in interest is the individual,not the sovereign.
the identity of the real party in interest dictates what immunities may be available.defendants in an action may assert sovereign immunity.graham,at.an officer in an action,on the other hand,may be able to assert personal immunity defenses,such as,for example,absolute prosecutorial immunity in certain circumstances.van de kamp goldstein.but sovereign immunity does not erect a barrier against suits to impose individual and personal liability.hafer,at internal quotation marks omitted see alden maine.
there is no reason to depart from these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign immunity.it is apparent that these general principles foreclose clarke sovereign immunity defense in this case.this is a negligence action arising from a tort committed by clarke on an interstate highway within the state of connecticut.the suit is brought against a tribal employee operating a vehicle within the scope of his employment but on state lands,and the judgment will not operate against the tribe.this is not a suit against clarke in his official capacity.it is simply a suit against clarke to recover for his personal actions,which will not require action by the sovereign or disturb the sovereign property.larson domestic and foreign commerce.we are cognizant of the supreme court of connecticut concern that plaintiffs not circumvent tribal sovereign immunity.but here,that immunity is simply not in play.clarke,not the gaming authority,is the real party in interest.
in ruling that clarke was immune from this suit solely because he was acting within the scope of his employment,the court extended sovereign immunity for tribal employees beyond what sovereign immunity principles would recognize for either state or federal employees.see,graham,at.the protection offered by tribal sovereign immunity here is no broader than the protection offered by state or federal sovereign immunity.
accordingly,under established sovereign immunity principles,the gaming authority immunity does not,in these circumstances,bar suit against clarke 
the conclusion above notwithstanding,clarke argues that the gaming authority is the real party in interest here because it is required by mohegan tribe code to indemnify clarke for any adverse judgment 
we have never before had occasion to decide whether an indemnification clause is sufficient to extend a sovereign immunity defense to a suit against an
