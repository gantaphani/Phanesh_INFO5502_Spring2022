in february,carol gillmore,age,resided at a women shelter on the red lake indian reservation in minnesota.gillmore suffers from stress disorder ptsd and depression arising from sexual abuse she endured as a child,multiple rapes,and undergoing an abortion.gillmore also has a history of chemical dependency,and,at the time relevant to this case,she was addicted to crack cocaine.as a result of her addiction,gillmore left the shelter on a regular basis to obtain drugs or money for drugs.while gillmore resided at the shelter,she,on occasion,borrowed money from george stately,an elderly man who lived on the red lake reservation,a short distance from the shelter.
on the morning of february,gillmore smoked crack cocaine.that evening,gillmore left the shelter in search of additional drugs and went to stately home to obtain money to purchase the drugs.when stately declined to loan gillmore money,gillmore attacked and killed stately.during the brutal attack,gillmore,armed with a hammer and a knife,inflicted hammer blows to stately neck and head and slash wounds to his neck.gillmore then placed the knife and hammer on top of stately body.
in an attempt to conceal the murder,gillmore started at least two fires in stately home and left his body laying on the living room floor.in order to assist the burning of the body,gillmore placed a portion of a newspaper on top of the corpse.gillmore took stately wallet and went to a known crack house where she sought crack cocaine,although there was testimony that gillmore was unable to obtain cocaine at that time.eventually,gillmore returned to the shelter where she attempted to conceal evidence of her crime by cleaning up blood stains and hiding stately wallet in her mattress and her shoes in the back of a clock in her room.
in the morning hours of february,the red lake fire department responded to a report that smoke was coming from stately residence and found the home ablaze.firefighters discovered stately body and observed large amounts of blood on the walls,floor,and furniture near stately body as well as on the kitchen table.several pieces of furniture in the living room were in disarray,indicating that a physical struggle had taken place.firefighters extinguished the fire and secured the residence.
also,on the morning of february,gillmore reported to the emergency room at thief river falls hospital,stating that she had attempted suicide that morning by trying to drive into another vehicle.gillmore received an drug injection.later that day,blood stains were discovered at the shelter,both on the door and on the mattress that gillmore used.in addition,stately wallet was found in gillmore mattress.
in the late afternoon of february,federal bureau of investigation fbi special agent john egelhof interviewed gillmore.gillmore asked special agent egelhof if he was there to discuss her suicide attempt,and there was no mention of stately during this interview.during a second interview with special agent egelhof,gillmore gave differing accounts of her whereabouts on the evening of february,both admitting and denying stopping at stately home.when special agent egelhof noted the blood around the doorways of the shelter,gillmore mentioned a bloody nose she sustained during her suicide attempt.special agent egelhof informed gillmore of stately death,and she began to cry but maintained that she was not aware of any relevant information.however,gillmore stated that she had borrowed money from stately on previous occasions and that stately had made sexual advances toward her prior to february.
though gillmore initially stated that stately had not propositioned her on the evening of february,she later claimed that stately had done so and grabbed her breast.gillmore stated that,because she did not want to be raped,she picked up a hammer to protect herself.however,gillmore later claimed that stately first procured the hammer and struck her once before she was able to get the hammer away from him.gillmore went on to state that stately attempted to pick up a knife,and they struggled.gillmore alleged that,at some point,stately said that he was going to kill her and that she saw red.gillmore exhibited no visible injuries other than the injury to her nose sustained during her suicide attempt.due to gillmore admissions,she was arrested and taken to the red lake jail.
on february,gillmore was charged via compliant in the district of minnesota with intentional second degree murder within indian country,see a,and a,and one count of arson within indian country,see,and a.gillmore was taken to the beltrami county jail in bemidji,minnesota,for her first appearance on the complaint.there,special agent egelhof again interviewed gillmore,and gillmore claimed that she went to stately house in order to fix her tire,not to obtain money.gillmore also stated that stately took hold of her and that she picked up the hammer to protect herself.on march,a grand jury returned a three count indictment,charging gillmore with intentional second degree murder and arson,as well as one count of premeditated first degree murder,see a,and a.on february,a grand jury returned a four count superceding indictment adding one count of felony murder in the first degree in perpetration of a robbery,see a,and a.
on january,a bench trial commenced before the district court.the bench trial followed gillmore waiver of her right to a jury trial,her admission to the unlawful killing of george stately,and her waiver of any claim of justification,including or intoxication.however,gillmore made a legal claim of imperfect,alleging that she had the right to defend herself against stately alleged sexual advances.thus,gillmore went to trial before the district court on the sole issue of her level of criminal culpability.the government sought a first degree murder verdict,and gillmore contended that she was only guilty of manslaughter because,due to her mental illness,she overreacted to stately alleged sexual advances and acted in an unreasonable manner.
at trial,michael mcgee,the medical examiner who performed stately autopsy,testified that the cause of stately death was assault with multiple injuries,although mcgee noted that the deep slash wound to stately neck would have been enough to kill him.mcgee also pointed out that stately hands exhibited numerous cuts consistent with defense wounds commonly observed on assault victims.mcgee stated that there were hammer blows to george stately neck and head area and slash wounds to his neck area.according to mcgee,these blows and wounds were a conservative estimate of the victim total injuries.mcgee further testified that a great deal of force was needed to inflict the amount of damage that the victim skull sustained.though gillmore testified that she attacked stately because he had made a sexual advance toward her and that,due to her history,she feared that stately was going to rape her,she admitted that stately was always friendly and nice to her and characterized him as a nice old man.four mental health professionals testified as to gillmore mental state and whether it impacted her actions on february.the trial concluded on february,and the district court took the matter under advisement.
on march,the district court,found gillmore guilty of intentional second degree murder and arson.the court expressly rejected gillmore contention that she attacked stately because he had made a sexual advance toward her,finding all evidence to the contrary and concluding that if anything triggered the behavior of the defendant,it was not fear of sexual relations,rape,or abortion,but rather an intense urge and need to obtain money and drugs to get high and that this was the sole focus of the defendant conduct on the evening of february.
in addition,the district court,having received the testimony of four mental health professionals and gillmore medical and mental health records as well as mental health experts notes taken shortly before the attack,found that gillmore was not provoked in any way that would cause a person in her circumstance to lose,enter into an altered or dissociative state at the time of the killing,and engage in frenzied,behavior.furthermore,the district court found the facts supported a conclusion that gillmore engaged in deliberate and intentional conduct,noting the arson,the neat placement of the hammer,knife,and portion of a newspaper on george stately body in order to assist in the burning of the body,the taking and concealing of stately wallet,and cleaning up blood at the shelter.
following gillmore convictions,the united states probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr.with respect to the second degree murder conviction,the psr calculated an offense level of,and the arson conviction produced an offense level of.because the homicide carried the higher offense level,its level controlled as the top count for sentencing purposes.gillmore had a criminal history category of ii.pursuant to the guidelines in effect at the time of offense,gillmore sentence range for the murder conviction was to months.
on september,the district court conducted a sentencing hearing.numerous members of stately family and friends provided statements.counsel for both parties supplemented written sentencing submissions with oral argument.the government recommended a sentence of at least months based on obstruction of justice and extreme conduct coupled with a criminal history that the government contended underrepresented the likelihood that defendant would commit other crimes in the future.the government also noted that the guidelines range for a second degree murder conviction committed under the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing would be to months,reflecting an upward revision to the base offense level for second degree murder from to.see united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual.gillmore requested a sentence of months,contending that no obstruction of justice enhancement was applicable and that her conduct was not extreme for sentencing purposes.
the district court accepted the psr calculation of gillmore guidelines range,finding that it was to months,see a a,and declined to apply any specific offense level enhancements,including obstruction of justice.the court recognized that the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing would have resulted in a much higher sentencing range and then proceeded to address the other relevant section a factors at length.
the district court first considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and concluded that the unusually brutal nature of gillmore offense conduct,as evidenced by the severity of the hammer blows and knife wounds sustained by the victim,presented a serious set of circumstances takes it outside the normal intentional murder case,necessitating a longer sentence than the guidelines range.see a.the court declined to determine which injury actually caused stately death,finding it irrelevant for sentencing purposes.with regard to the history and characteristics of the defendant,the district court noted gillmore history of sexual abuse,chemical dependency,and mental illness and found that these characteristics made gillmore a danger to herself and the public,warranting a significantly longer sentence than the guidelines range.see id.a,a c.the district court also stated that he considered the other section factors but specifically mentioned the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense,see id.a a the kinds of sentences available,see id.a pertinent policy statements,see id.a and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants,see id.a.
the district court sentenced gillmore to months imprisonment on the second degree murder conviction and months on the arson conviction to be served concurrently,followed by years supervised release.gillmore was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of.subsequently,the district court issued its written statement of reasons and,in addition to the section a factors discussed at sentencing,the court cited the following bases for gillmore sentence mental and emotional condition,ussg aggravating or mitigating circumstances,ussg and extreme conduct,ussg.
gillmore appeals the district court upward variance on the murder conviction,months of additional incarceration or percent,as unreasonable.
where,as here,neither party contests the district court calculation of the guidelines range,and gillmore appeals only the variance from the guidelines range,the issue we examine on appeal is whether the sentence imposed is reasonable in light of the factors articulated in a.see united states miller,cir quoting united states,cir see also c requiring a sentencing judge at the time of sentencing to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence rita united states,d where the judge imposes a sentence outside the guidelines,the judge will explain why he has done so.
though there is a presumption of reasonableness attributed to sentences imposed within the guidelines range,there is no presumption that a sentence is unreasonable.see rita.at a nonbinding appellate presumption that a guidelines sentence is reasonable does not require the sentencing judge to impose that sentence.still less does it forbid the sentencing judge from imposing a higher sentence than the guidelines provide united states gall,cir,cert.granted,d rejecting the notion that a presumption of unreasonableness applies to sentences.
in reviewing gillmore sentence,we must determine whether the district court decision to grant a a variance from the appropriate g uidelines range is reasonable and whether the extent of any a variance is reasonable.see miller,at quoting united states mashek,cir.a district court imposes an unreasonable sentence 
if a sentencing court fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight,gives significant weight to an improper factor or irrelevant factor,or considers only appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear error of judgment by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.
id.at quoting gall,at.
because gillmore challenges the extent of the variance,t he further the district court varies from the presumptively reasonable g uideline s range,the more compelling the justification based on the a factors must be.an extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances.id.quoting united states bryant,cir.the sentence in this case is an upward variance that amounts to months or approximately percent above the top of the guidelines range,which is the equivalent of a departure.under this court jurisprudence,this is an extraordinary variance from the presumptive sentence range.see united states meyer,cir finding a fifty percent increase from defendant guidelines range was an extraordinary variance see also united states,cir characterizing an almost percent upward departure as an extraordinary gall,at characterizing percent downward variance as extraordinary.thus,gillmore sentence must be accompanied by extraordinary circumstances in order to be reasonable.see meyer,at.
at the outset,we recognize that there is no numerical formula to determine whether a sentence is unreasonable and that significant deviations from g uidelines sentences have been affirmed.united states myers,cir citing united states rogers,cir affirming a more than percent upward variance see,at affirming percent upward departure where the extraordinary need to protect the public from defendant actions justify the sentence see also united states lewis,cir per curiam affirming a sentenc
