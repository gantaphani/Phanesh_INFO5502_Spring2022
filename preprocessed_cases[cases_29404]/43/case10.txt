respondent tohono nation nation filed suit in federal district court against federal officials who managed tribal assets held in trust by the federal government,alleging violations of fiduciary duty and requesting equitable relief.the next day,the nation filed this action against the united states in the court of federal claims cfc,alleging almost identical violations and requesting money damages.the cfc case was dismissed under,which bars cfc jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim pending against the united states or its agents in another court.the federal circuit reversed,finding that the two suits were not for or in respect to the same claim because,although they shared operative facts,they did not seek overlapping relief.
two suits are for or in respect to the same claim,precluding cfc jurisdiction,if they are based on substantially the same operative facts,regardless of the relief sought in each suit.
a since,congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the cfc and its predecessors when related actions are pending elsewhere.keene united states,held that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are based on substantially the same operative facts,at least if there is some overlap in the relief requested,but it reserved the question whether the jurisdictional bar operates if suits based on the same operative facts do not seek overlapping relief.the rule now codified in was first enacted to curb duplicate lawsuits by residents of the confederacy who,in seeking to recover for cotton taken by the federal government,sued the government in the court of claims and,at the same time,sued federal officials in other courts,seeking tort relief for the same actions.section robust response to this problem bars cfc jurisdiction not only if the plaintiff sues on an identical claim elsewhere,but also if the other action is related but not identical.the phrase in respect to does not resolve all doubt as to the bar scope,but it suggests a broad prohibition,regardless of whether claim carries a special or limited meaning.
b keene permits two constructions of for or in respect to the same claim,one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus remedial overlap.the former is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the statute use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only with factual overlap.the cfc bar applies where the other action is against a person who,when the cause of action arose,was,in respect thereto,acting under color of federal law.but at the time that a cause of action arose,the person could not act in respect to the relief requested,for no complaint was yet filed.although the phrase at issue involves a claim rather than a cause of action,there is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to relief.as keene explained,claim is used here synonymously with of action,at.and if the phrase that uses cause of action,the more technical term,does not embrace the concept of remedy,it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.
c this reading also makes sense in light of the cfc unique remedial powers.because the cfc is the only judicial forum for most nontort requests for significant monetary relief against the united states and because it has no general power to provide equitable relief against the government or its officers,a statute aimed at precluding duplicate cfc suits would be unlikely to require remedial overlap.remedial overlap was even more unusual when rule was first enacted in.the federal circuit could identify no purpose the statute served in light of that court precedent.but courts should not render statutes nugatory through construction.the statute purpose is clear from its origins the need to save the government from redundant litigation and the conclusion that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they share substantially the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve that aim.concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of claim preclusion,or res judicata.the nation errs in arguing that this court interpretation unjustly forces plaintiffs to choose between partial remedies available in different courts.the nation could have recovered any losses in the cfc alone.even if some hardship were shown,this court enjoy s no liberty to add an exception to remove apparent hardship.keene,supra,at.
the substantial overlap in operative facts between the nation district court and cfc suits precludes jurisdiction in the cfc.both actions allege that the united states holds the same assets in trust for the nation benefit,and they describe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty.

united states,petitioner tohono nation 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the tohono nation is an indian tribe with federal recognition.the nation main reservation is in the sonoran desert of southern arizona.counting this and other reservation lands,the nation landholdings are approximately million acres.
the nation brought two actions based on the same alleged violations of fiduciary duty with respect to the nation lands and other assets.one action was filed against federal officials in district court and the other against the united states in the court of federal claims cfc.the court of appeals for the federal circuit held that the cfc suit was not barred by the rule that the cfc lacks jurisdiction over an action for or in respect to a claim that is also the subject of an action pending in another court.the question presented is whether a common factual basis like the one apparent in the nation suits suffices to bar jurisdiction under.
the case turns on the relationship between the two suits the nation filed.the first suit was filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia against federal officials responsible for managing tribal assets held in trust by the federal government.the complaint alleged various violations of fiduciary duty with respect to those assets.the nation claimed,for example,that the officials failed to provide an accurate accounting of trust property to refrain from or to use reasonable skill in investing trust assets.the complaint requested equitable relief,including an accounting.
the next day the nation filed the instant action against the united states in the cfc.the cfc complaint described the same trust assets and the same fiduciary duties that were the subject of the district court complaint.and it alleged almost identical violations of fiduciary duty,for which it requested money damages.the cfc case was dismissed under for want of jurisdiction.
a divided panel of the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed.two suits are for or in respect to the same claim,it reasoned,only if they share operative facts and also seek overlapping relief.finding no overlap in the relief requested,the court held that the two suits at issue were not for or in respect to the same claim.
this court granted certiorari.
since,congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the cfc and its predecessors when related actions are pending elsewhere.section,identical in most respects to the original statute,provides 
the united states court of federal claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any other court any suit or process against the united states or any person who,at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose,was,in respect thereto,acting or professing to act,directly or indirectly under the authority of the united states.
the rule is more straightforward than its complex wording suggests.the cfc has no jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim pending against the united states or its agents.
the question to be resolved is what it means for two suits to be for or in respect to the same claim.keene united states,provided a partial answer.it held that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are based on substantially the same operative facts,at least if there is some overlap in the relief requested.at.the keene case did not decide whether the jurisdictional bar also operates if the suits are based on the same operative facts but do not seek overlapping relief.still,keene narrows the permissible constructions of for or in respect to a claim to one of two interpretations.either it requires substantial factual and some remedial overlap,or it requires substantial factual overlap without more.
congress first enacted the jurisdictional bar now codified in to curb duplicate lawsuits brought by residents of the confederacy following the civil war.the cotton claimants named for their suits to recover for cotton taken by the federal government sued the united states in the court of claims under the abandoned property collection act,stat,while at the same time suing federal officials in other courts,seeking relief under tort law for the same alleged actions.see keene,supra,at schwartz,section of the judicial code and duplicate suits against the government and its agents,geo.although the rule embodied in originated long ago,congress reenacted the statute at various times,most recently in.see act of june,stat.keene,at.
the text of reflects a robust response to the problem first presented by the cotton claimants.it bars jurisdiction in the cfc not only if the plaintiff sues on an identical claim elsewhere a suit for the same claim but also if the plaintiff other action is related although not identical a suit in respect to the same claim.the phrase in respect to does not resolve all doubt as to the scope of the jurisdictional bar,but it does make it clear that congress did not intend the statute to be rendered useless by a narrow concept of identity.at.it suggests a broad prohibition,regardless of whether claim carries a special or limited meaning.united states jones,claim in the little tucker act refers only to requests for money.
of the two constructions of for or in respect to the same claim that keene permits one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus remedial overlap the former is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the statute use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only with factual overlap.the cfc bar applies even where the other action is not against the government but instead against a person who,at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose,was,in respect thereto,acting or professing to act,directly or indirectly under the authority of the united states.the statute refers to a person who acts under color of federal law in respect to a cause of action at the time it arose.but at that time,the person could not act in respect to the relief requested,for no complaint was yet filed.this use of the phrase in respect to a cause of action must refer to operative facts and not whatever remedies an aggrieved party might later request.a person acts under color of federal law in respect to a cause of action by claiming or wielding federal authority in the relevant factual context.
although the two phrases are not identical one is in respect to a claim,the other a cause of action they are almost so,and there is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to relief.as the keene court explained,the term claim is used here synonymously with of action.at.and if either of the two phrases were to include both operative facts and a specific remedy,it would be the one that uses the term cause of action rather than claim.cause of action is the more technical term,while claim is often used in a commonsense way to mean a right or demand.here,for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph,in respect to a cause of action refers simply to facts without regard to judicial remedies.so,if the phrase with the more technical of the two terms does not embrace the concept of remedy,it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.even if the terms claim or cause of action include the request for relief,the phrase for or in respect to gives the statutory bar a broader scope.
reading the statute to require only factual and not also remedial overlap makes sense in light of the unique remedial powers of the cfc.the cfc is the only judicial forum for most requests for significant monetary relief against the united states.see ed.and supp.iii a ed.unlike the district courts,however,the cfc has no general power to provide equitable relief against the government or its officers.compare united states king,with see also united states alire,wall,t he only judgments which the court of claims are authorized to render against the government are judgments for money found due from the government to the petitioner the distinct jurisdiction of the cfc makes overlapping relief the exception and distinct relief the norm.for that reason,a statute aimed at precluding suits in the cfc that duplicate suits elsewhere would be unlikely to require remedial overlap.
remedial overlap between cfc actions and those in other courts was even more unusual when rule was first enacted in.at that time the cfc had a more limited jurisdiction than it does now,for the tucker act general waiver of sovereign immunity for claims for monetary relief had not yet been enacted.see stat.and while the district courts can today adjudicate suits against the united states for money damages under the little tucker act,a,and the federal tort claims act b,in the united states could only be sued in the court of claims.united states mitchell,sisk,litigation with the federal government a ed.because the kinds of suits and forms of relief available against the united states were few and constrained,remedial overlap between cfc suits and those in other courts was even less common then than now.if the statute were to require remedial as well as factual overlap,it would have had very limited application in despite its broad language that bars not only identical but also related claims.the rule in effects a significant jurisdictional limitation,and congress reenacted it even as changes in the structure of the courts made suits on the same facts more likely to arise.doing so reaffirmed the force of the bar and thus the commitment to curtailing redundant litigation.
the panel of the court of appeals could not identify any purpose that serves today,at,in large part because it was bound by circuit precedent that left the statute without meaningful force.for example,the panel cited tecon engineers,united states.cl,which held that does not prohibit two identical suits from proceeding so long as the action in the cfc,or at that time the court of claims,is filed first.the tecon holding is not presented in this case because the cfc action here was filed after the district court suit.
still,the court of appeals was wrong to allow its precedent to suppress the statute aims.courts should not render statutes nugatory through construction.in fact the statute purpose is clear from its origins with the cotton claimants the need to save the government from burdens of redundant litigation and that purpose is no less significant today.the conclusion that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are based on substantially the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve its aim.keene,supra,at.developing a factual record is responsible for much of the cost of litigation.discovery is a conspicuous example,and the preparation and examination of witnesses at trial is another.the form of relief requested matters less,except insofar as it affects what facts parties must prove.an interpretation of focused on the facts rather than the relief a party seeks preserves the provision as it was meant to function,and it keeps the provision from becoming a mere pleading rule,to be circumvented by carving up a single transaction into overlapping pieces seeking different relief.casman united states.cl.cfc had jurisdiction notwithstanding common facts in district court suit because the plaintiff sought different relief in each forum.
concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of claim preclusion,or res judicata,which bars repetitious suits involving the same cause of action once a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final judgment on the merits.commissioner sunnen.the jurisdictional bar in was enacted in part to address the problem that judgments in suits against officers were not preclusive in suits against the united states.matson nav.united states.so it is no surprise that the statute would operate in similar fashion.the test in preclusion law for determining whether two suits involve the same claim or cause of action depends on factual overlap,barring claims arising from the same transaction.kremer chemical constr,see also restatement second of judgments.the transactional test is of course much younger than the rule embodied in,but even in the century it was not uncommon to identify a claim for preclusion purposes based on facts rather than relief.see wells,res adjudicata and stare decisis,the true distinction between demands or rights of action which are single and entire,and those which are several and distinct,is,that the former immediately arise out of one and the same act or contract,and the latter out of different acts or contracts internal quotation marks omitted black,law of judgments,the test for identity is would the same evidence support and establish both the present and the former cause of action reading to depend on the underlying facts and not also on the relief requested gives effect to the principles of preclusion law embodied in the statute.
there is no merit to the nation assertion that the interpretation adopted here can not prevail because it is unjust,forcing plaintiffs to choose between partial remedies available in different courts.the hardship in this case is far from clear.the nation could have filed in the cfc alone and if successful obtained monetary relief to compensate for any losses caused by the government breach of duty.it also seems likely that indian tribes in the nation position could go to district court first without losing the chance to later file in the cfc,for congress has provided in every appropriations act for the department of interior since that the statute of limitations on indian trust mismanagement claims shall not run until the affected tribe has been given an appropriate accounting.see,stat.stat.
even were some hardship to be shown,considerations of policy divorced from the statute text and purpose could not override its meaning.although congress has permitted claims against the united states for monetary relief in the cfc,that relief is available by grace and not by right.see beers arkansas,how,a s this permission is altogether voluntary on the part of the sovereignty,it follows that it may prescribe the terms and conditions on which it consents to be sued,and the manner in which the suit shall be conducted if indeed the statute leads to incomplete relief,and if plaintiffs like the nation are dissatisfied,they are free to direct their complaints to congress.this court enjoy s no liberty to add an exception to remove apparent hardship.keene,at quoting corona coal united states.
keene reserved the question whether common facts are sufficient to bar a cfc action where a similar case is pending elsewhere.to continue to reserve the question would force the cfc to engage in an unnecessary and complicated remedial inquiry,and it would increase the expense and duration of litigation.the question thus demands an answer,and the answer is yes.two suits are for or in respect to the same claim,precluding jurisdiction in the cfc,if they are based on substantially the same operative facts,regardless of the relief sought in each suit.
the remaining question is whether the nation two suits have sufficient factual overlap to trigger the jurisdictional bar.the cfc dismissed the action here in part because it concluded that the facts in the nation two suits were,for all practical purposes,identical.fed.cl.it was correct to do so.
the two actions both allege that the united states holds the same assets in trust for the nation benefit.they describe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty that the united states engaged in and imprudent investment,and failed to provide an accurate accounting of the assets held in trust,for example.indeed,it appears that the nation could have filed two identical complaints,save the caption and prayer for relief,without changing either suit in any significant respect.
under,the substantial overlap in operative facts between the nation district court and cfc suits precludes jurisdiction in the cfc.the court of appeals erred when it concluded otherwise.
the holding here precludes the cfc from exercising jurisdiction over the nation suit while the district court case is pending.should the nation choose to dismiss the latter action,or upon that action completion,the nation is free to file suit again in the cfc if the statute of limitations is no bar.in the meantime,and in light of the substantial overlap in operative facts between them,the two suits are for or in respect to the same claim under,and the cfc case must be dismissed.the contrary judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

united states,petitioner tohono nation 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice breyer joins,concurring in the judgment.
congress enacted the statute currently codified at to put an end to parallel litigation seeking duplicative relief against the united states and its agents.respondent tohono nation seeks in the court of federal claims cfc some of the same relief on the same facts as it does in its pending district court action.accordingly,applying our decision in keene united states,i agree with the court that bars the nation cfc action.because the nation two actions seek overlapping relief,this case does not present the question that the court decides today whether bars an action in the cfc when the plaintiff actions share a common factual basis but seek different forms of relief.nonetheless,the court holds that a common factual basis alone suffices to bar jurisdiction in the cfc.under the court reading of the statute,a plaintiff can not pursue a claim in the cfc based on the same facts as another pending action,even when congress has required that plaintiff to file separate actions in two courts to obtain different forms of relief necessary to make the plaintiff whole.i can not agree that demands this result.
section bars jurisdiction in the cfc over any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff has pending in any other court any suit or process against the united states or any agent of the united states.in keene,we construed this statute to turn on whether the plaintiff other suit was based on substantially the same operative facts as the court of claims action,at least if there was some overlap in the relief requested.at.it was irrelevant for purposes of,we observed,that the two suits proceeded on different legal theories,at.because the plaintiff actions both sought the same monetary relief,albeit on different theories,we held that the cfc lacked jurisdiction,at.we thus found it unnecessary to consider whether barred a cfc claim that was based on substantially the same operative facts as another suit but that sought different relief.see,at.
as construed in keene,bars the nation cfc action.as the majority holds,see ante,at,the nation cfc and district court actions are based on nearly identical facts.the two actions also seek overlapping relief both complaints request money to remedy the same injury the government alleged breach of its fiduciary duty to maintain accurate accounts of the nation assets.the nation does not dispute that its district court complaint requests such relief see brief for respondent if the accounting reveals that assets that belong to the nation do not appear on the books,it may be appropriate to order equitable restitution of those assets the nation cfc complaint is fairly read to do the same.the cfc complaint alleges that the government has failed to keep and render clear and accurate accounts.app.to pet.for cert.it claims that by reason of this and other alleged breaches of fiduciary duty,the nation has been damaged in such amounts as may be proven at trial.at.and the complaint requests a determination that the defendant is liable to the nation in damages for the injuries and losses caused as a result of defendant breaches of fiduciary duty and a determination of the amount of damages due the nation.at.thus,just like the district court complaint,the cfc complaint requests money to remedy the government alleged failure to keep accurate accounts 
because the nation two complaints are based on substantially the same operative facts and there is at least some overlap in the relief requested,keene,at,bars jurisdiction over the nation cfc action.
the case does not present the question,left open in keene,whether common facts alone are sufficient to bar a cfc action where a similar case is pending elsewhere.ante,at.indeed,for most of the history of this case,the government did not even argue that common facts were sufficient to preclude cfc jurisdiction until its petition for rehearing in the court of appeals,the government argued only that keene required dismissal of the nation cfc action because the nation two actions were based on the same facts and sought overlapping relief.deciding this case on the basis of keene would have been the far more prudent course than recharacterizing the case in an attempt to reach premature decision on an important question.missouri jenkins,kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.instead,discarding the restraint we exhibited in keene,the court unnecessarily chooses to hold that bars jurisdiction in the cfc whenever a plaintiff cfc action is based on substantially the same facts as a suit pending elsewhere this reading of is,in my opinion,incorrect.
since the enactment of in,congress has expanded the avenues by which persons with legitimate claims against the united states may obtain relief.see ante,at.in some circumstances,congress has chosen to require plaintiffs to file actions in two different courts to obtain complete relief relating to a single set of operative facts.for example,with some exceptions,the cfc has no power to issue equitable relief.see bowen massachusetts,see also a.as a result,a plaintiff seeking both money damages and injunctive relief to remedy distinct harms arising from the same set of facts may be forced to file actions in both the cfc and federal district court.
for half a century,the cfc has recognized that does not preclude jurisdiction in that court when congress has required a plaintiff to split a claim into two actions to obtain different forms of relief necessary to make the plaintiff whole.in casman united states.cl,a terminated federal employee sought backpay in the court of claims and reinstatement to his position in district court.the plaintiff two suits arose from the same facts his termination but sought entirely different forms of relief within the exclusive jurisdiction of two courts,at.in light of our previous recognition that the purpose of was only to require an election between a suit in the court of claims and one brought in another court,at quoting matson nav.united states,the court of claims held that was inapplicable when a plaintiff has no right to elect between two courts,at.to hold otherwise,the court acknowledged,would be to say to plaintiff,if you want your job back you must forget your back pay conversely,if you want your back pay,you can not have your job back.see also loveladies harbor,united states,ca fed.en banc reaffirming casman inquiry into the form of relief sought.
by reserving the question whether two actions based on the same operative facts,but seeking completely different relief,would implicate,our decision in keene expressly preserved the casman holding,at.the consequence of today decision is clear the casman rule is no longer good law.under the majority reading of,because casman two suits were based on common facts,barred jurisdiction in the cfc over his backpay claim even though he could not have obtained backpay in his district court action.
the jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the united states often requires other plaintiffs to file two actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in connection with one set of facts.as just one example,an action seeking injunctive relief to set aside agency action must proceed in district court,but a claim that the same agency action constitutes a taking of property requiring just compensation must proceed in the cfc.see,alaska united states,fed.cl.after today decision,may well prevent a plaintiff from pursuing a takings claim in the cfc if an action to set aside the agency action is pending in district court.this type of plaintiff may face a choice between equally unattractive options forgo injunctive relief in the district court to preserve her claim for monetary relief in the cfc,or pursue injunctive relief and hope that the statute of limitations on her takings claim,see,does not expire before the district court action is resolved 
the text,purpose,and history of provide strong reason to believe that congress did not intend for to put plaintiffs to a choice between two nonduplicative remedies that congress has made available exclusively in two forums.the statute bars jurisdiction in the cfc over a claim for or in respect to which a plaintiff has a suit or process pending elsewhere.when congress first enacted predecessor,the statute establishing the jurisdiction of the court of claims used the term claims to refer to demands for money damages.see act of,stat.see united states jones,noting that the statute provisions were inconsistent with the enforcement of any claims under the law except claims for money congress thus would have understood the term claim in to describe the particular relief sought in the court of claims.commissioner keystone consol.industries.
determining the meaning of claim is only part of the inquiry,however.the question remains what constitutes a suit or process for or in respect to a cfc claim.the purpose and history of the statute elucidate the meaning of this ambiguous phrase.as the majority explains,congress enacted the statute to prevent duplicative lawsuits brought by the cotton claimants in the aftermath of the civil war.keene,at see ante,at.the cotton claimants sought monetary compensation for seized cotton in the court of claims pursuant to the abandoned property collection act,stat.because they had difficulty satisfying the statutory requirement that,to obtain compensation,they must not have given aid or comfort to participants in the rebellion,see of the act,they also sought relief either in the form of money damages or actual cotton in separate lawsuits against federal officials on tort theories such as conversion.it was these duplicative lawsuits that induced congress to enact predecessor.keene,at.
this historical backdrop sheds light on what congress would have understood to be a suit or process for or in respect to a claim in the court of claims.congress undoubtedly intended to preclude a claim for money in the court of claims when the plaintiff was pursuing a suit for the same money in district court.because,however,some cotton claimants sought return of the cotton itself in district court,it was also necessary to preclude jurisdiction in the court of claims when the plaintiff other action was in respect to that demand for money,when the plaintiff was seeking duplicative relief.had the courts awarded such plaintiffs both the cotton itself and money damages,the plaintiffs would have obtained twice what they deserved.in this way,congress eschewed a narrow concept of identity that would have permitted plaintiffs to pursue and obtain duplicative relief to remedy the very same
