this case arises from the legislative redistricting of south dakota.the redistricting plan the plan created a state legislature that was split into districts.each district elected two members of the state house of representatives and one member of the state senate.district was an exception.it was divided into two districts district and.there were only two districts in the plan,districts and.district,with a ninety percent population,consistently elected candidates.district,with a lesser majority,frequently elected candidates.district,which neighbors district,had only a thirty percent population and did not elect an candidate from to.
at issue is whether the plan violated section of the voting rights act by packing district with at the expense of district,and whether the district court redistricted south dakota in a manner that assured in districts and the opportunity to elect candidates.the district court found this to be the case,and we agree.
background 
make up just over nine percent of south dakota population and nearly seven percent of its population.because of the history of discrimination against and the nature of the reservation system,much of this population is geographically compact under the plan,only three state house seats and one state senate seat are in districts.of those seats,two state house seats and a state senate seat are in district where comprise percent of the population.
in december,alfred bone shirt and three other indian hereinafter the plaintiffs voters filed suit,alleging that the plan violated sections and of the voting rights act of,as amended,and the plaintiffs contended that the plan violated section because it packed indian voters into district,which,in turn,diluted indian voting strength in district and left indian voters in district unable to elect representatives of their choice.the district court conducted a bench trial and found by a preponderance of the evidence that the plan violated section.after the defendants refused to advance a remedy,the district court imposed one of the remedial plans proposed by the plaintiffs.the defendants appeal the finding of a section violation and the imposition of the plaintiffs remedial plan.
the district court found that the plaintiffs had met the three preconditions listed under thornburg gingles,d,and concluded that the totality of the circumstances indicated that a section violation existed.the district court gave the defendants days to propose a remedy.the state rejected this opportunity and asked the district court to certify a legal question of whether the legislature had the power to redistrict the state in a year to the south dakota supreme court.certification was granted and the defendants were given thirty days after the state supreme court decision to propose a remedy,if necessary.although the south dakota supreme court decided the legislature did indeed have the continuing power and duty to redistrict when the past apportionment resulted in a section violation,bone shirt hazeltine,the defendants stated they would not propose a remedial plan.the district court then adopted one of the plaintiffs proposed redistricting plans,plan e and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.bone shirt hazeltine,d.the court subsequently denied the defendant motion to alter or amend the remedial order,and this appeal followed.
the defendants advance two basic arguments on appeal that the district court clearly erred in finding a section violation,and that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the plaintiff redistricting plan.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,including the district court factual determination of whether the section requirements are satisfied.league of united latin am.citizens perry,d.legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact are also reviewed de novo.harvell blytheville sch,cir en banc.the district court remedial order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see rodriguez bexar county,cir.
establishment of the gingles preconditions 
the essence of a claim is that a certain electoral law,practice,or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by minority and white voters to elect their preferred candidates.cottier city of martin,cir quoting gingles,at.a denial of the right to vote under section occurs when 
based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election are not equally open to participation by members of a a racial group in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
league of united latin am.citizens.at quoting b.
to establish a section violation,the plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the evidence three elements,often referred to as the gingles preconditions 
t he racial group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district the racial group is politically cohesive and the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.
league of united latin am.citizens.at internal citations and modifications omitted harvell,at.failure to prove each of the preconditions defeats a section claim.clay bd.of,cir.if the three preconditions are met,the court proceeds to consider the totality of the circumstances.cottier,at citing harvell,at.
in a vote dilution claim,b is violated when it is proven under gingles that the voting strength of a politically cohesive minority is diluted by either fragmenting minority voters among several districts so that a majority bloc can usually outvote the minority,or,as is in this instance,packing the minority into one or several districts so that the minority influence is minimized in its neighboring districts.see voinovich quilter,d noting both as usual device s for diluting minority voting power.
first gingles precondition sufficiently numerous and geographically compact 
at the outset,the plaintiff must show are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a proposed single member district in order to demonstrate that a workable solution is possible.clay,at.the plaintiffs submitted five redistricting plans,each of which created at least one additional legislative district.plan e maintained a senate district district and a house district district and created a new house district district by reconfiguring the boundaries of districts and into a new district and dividing it into districts and,giving each a state representative according to expert testimony,each district in the remedial plan possessed voter margins that ensured candidates an opportunity to win an election.see gingles,at.explaining justification for first gingles precondition.under the plaintiffs proposed plan,would comprise over percent of the population in district,and over percent of the population in district.furthermore,each proposed district includes incumbents,which increases the opportunity of voters to elect their preferred candidates.
the defendants argue the plaintiffs must prove that the minority group will enjoy sufficient status in the proposed remedial district this court recently held that at the initial stage of the gingles precondition analysis,the plaintiffs are only required to produce a potentially viable and stable solution.cottier,at see also gingles,at.t he ultimate end of the first gingles precondition is to prove that a solution is possible,and not necessarily to present the final solution to the problem.as the district court correctly noted,the gingles preconditions are designed to establish liability,and not a remedy.because the first gingles precondition seeks to establish whether a workable solution is possible,the supreme court at this stage requires only a simple majority of eligible voters in the district.the court may consider,at the remedial stage,what type of remedy is possible but this difficulty should not impede the judge at the liability stage of the proceedings.dickinson.state election,cir citations omitted.
the defendants also argue the district court violated the equal protection clause because it accepted a proposed remedial plan primarily based on race.we disagree.a redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause only if race is the predominant factor in placing voters within or outside of a particular district.easley cromartie,d.strict scrutiny does not apply where,as here,race was merely a factor in redistricting.harvell,at cir see also bush vera,d plurality opinion.
the borders proposed in the remedial plan easily pass muster.they are compact and respect traditional boundaries.under the remedial plan,district consists of four counties,plus the pine ridge reservation,as well as its trust lands.district also is made up of four counties,the rosebud reservation,and its trust lands.geographic boundaries were also considered.the proposed district uses the cheyenne river as a northern boundary and the proposed district uses the missouri river as its eastern boundary.this is consistent with traditional districting criteria,including respect for political and administrative boundaries,geographic considerations,and communities of interest.see codified laws abrams johnson,d cottier,at.the plaintiffs redistricting plan also is not so irregularly shaped that it seems the primary principle in shaping the district was to include or exclude from any one particular district.cottier,at.in fact,as the district court notes,the plaintiffs plan coincides in great detail with the previous state districting plan while creating a greater opportunity for indian voters to elect representatives of their choice.thus,the remedial plan was not based solely on race,and survives constitutional scrutiny.id.at.
second and third gingles preconditions minority political cohesion and majority bloc voting 
the second gingles precondition requires a showing that the minority is politically cohesive.league of united latin am.citizens.at.proving this factor typically requires a statistical and evaluation of the relevant elections.cottier,at.
evidence of political cohesiveness is shown by minority voting preferences,distinct from the majority,demonstrated in actual elections,and can be established with the same evidence plaintiffs must offer to establish racially polarized voting,because political cohesiveness is implicit in racially polarized voting.
id.quoting sanchez colorado,cir.
the third gingles precondition asks whether the white majority typically votes in a bloc to defeat the minority candidate.league of latin am.citizens.at.this is determined through three inquiries identifying the candidates determining whether the white majority vote as a bloc to defeat the minority preferred candidate and determining whether there were special circumstances such as the minority candidate running unopposed present when candidates won.cottier,at.
both the second and third gingles preconditions were established through use of expert testimony,employing bera or regression analysis and homogenous precinct analysis the defendants argue the district court erred in receiving this evidence.we review this evidentiary decision for an abuse of discretion.united states jordan,cir.the district court reviewed the testimony under daubert merrell dow,d,and found the plaintiffs expert testimony relevant and reliable.we agree.the statistical methods used by the plaintiffs have long been accepted by the supreme court,see gingles,at.regression analysis,and other courts,see,harvell,at regression analysis old person cooney,cir same rural.affairs council sundquist,cir homogenous and regression analysis.this court recently accepted the use of these methods as reliable evidence in determining the second and third gingles preconditions.cottier,at.and we do so here.
second,we agree with the district court interpretation of the evidence and the expert testimony.ordinarily,racially polarized voting is the keystone of a vote dilution case.buckanaga sisseton indep.sch,cir.endogenous and interracial elections are the best indicators of whether the white majority usually defeats the minority candidate.see cottier,at old person,at.the more recent an election,the higher its probative value.see uno city of holyoke,cir.in the only endogenous election in district in the past ten years,the candidate for state senate lost even though he received percent of the vote.in nine of the most recent endogenous district elections between white candidates,the candidate lost each time.in each election,the white majority voted as a bloc to defeat the candidate even though the candidate was able to carry a majority of the vote.
although they are not as probative as endogenous elections,exogenous elections hold some probative value.cottier,at.in two exogenous,interracial elections,the candidate lost.the white majority was able to vote as a bloc in each election to defeat overwhelming voter support for the candidate.it was only in exogenous elections between white candidates,that were finally able to elect their preferred candidate.on the basis of this record,we agree with the district court findings that in south dakota are politically cohesive and that the white majority voting bloc usually defeats the candidate.
ii.totality of the circumstances analysis 
although satisfying the three gingles preconditions takes the plaintiff a long way towards showing a section violation,harvell,at,the plaintiffs ultimately must prove that the totality of the circumstances indicates minority voters had less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice,b.
the senate committee report that accompanied the amendment to the voting rights act noted the courts should consider the following,inexhaustive,objective factors in determining whether the totality of the circumstances indicate a section violation 
the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register,to vote,or otherwise to participate in the democratic process 
the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized 
the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election districts,majority vote requirements,shot provisions,or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group 
if there is a candidate slating process,whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that process 
the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,employment and health,which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process 
whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals 
the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.
at gingles,at.two additional factors are also probative in determining whether section was violated was there a significant lack of response from elected officials to the needs of the minority group,and was the policy underlying the jurisdiction use of the current boundaries tenuous.gingles,at.
two factors predominate the analysis the extent to which voting is racially polarized and the extent to which minorities have been elected under the challenged scheme.harvell,at.here,the record reflects a high level of polarization in district,as well as an intolerable level of racial polarization in district,and it is clear that have consistently been excluded from district elected positions.moreover,the record reflects that not one candidate was elected to the state legislature from the area that includes district during the period of to 
the defendants opine that the actual cause of racially polarized voting in south dakota is the establishment and continued maintenance of the reservation system.as a result,have a low interest in south dakota politics.we reject this argument.the presumption that south dakota is relieved of liability for discriminatory voting practices because the reservation system makes less involved in state politics and more involved in tribal matters is untenable.see united states south dakota,cir.the record is clear that south dakota history of discrimination against has limited their ability to succeed in the state political process.id.at.the vestiges of this discrimination remain,dampening interest in south dakota politics and affecting the ability of to register,to vote,and to participate in the electoral process.see westwego citizens for better gov t city of westwego,cir.further,the historic effects of discrimination in the areas of health,employment,and education impact negatively on the ability of indians to participate in the political process.harvell,at.
iii.the remedial plan 
when a section violation is found,the district court is responsible for developing a constitutional remedy.as required,the defendants were afforded the first opportunity to submit a remedial plan.cottier,at williams city of texarkana,cir.they refused,thus leaving it to the district court to fashion its own remedy or,as here,adopt a remedial plan proposed by the plaintiffs.williams,at.
in formulating a remedial plan,the first and foremost obligation of the district court is to correct the section violation.see westwego citizens for better gov t,at.second,the plan should be narrowly tailored,and achieve population equality while avoiding,when possible,the use of districts.abrams johnson,d chapman meier,d.third,the plan must not violate sections or of the voting rights act.finally,the plan should not intrude on state policy any more than is necessary to uphold the requirements of the constitution.upham seamon,d per curiam quoting white weiser,d.
the defendants argue the district court committed three reversible errors in adopting the remedial plan the plan is not an appropriate remedy,since it will still result in losses for candidates the court did not seek preclearance from the department of justice and the court ignored evidence that reformulating a new district may result in a new dynamic.appellant br.at.we disagree.in our view,the district court remedial plan assures voters the opportunity to elect representatives of their choice and meaningful participation in the political process.harvell,at.the record reveals the remedial plan affords more than a percent majority in district and a percent majority in district.see ketchum byrne,cir acknowledging recognized percent guideline neal coleburn,t he general guideline for remedial districts is not a required minimum which the plaintiffs must meet before they can be awarded any relief under rather,the standard is a flexible and practical guideline to consider in fashioning relief for a violation.furthermore,the district court correctly considered other factors,including turnout rate and incumbency in formulating the plan.dickinson,at.the defendants argument that the remedial plan must provide some sort of guarantee that candidates will be elected is not persuasive all that is required is that the remedy afford a realistic opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.this is true here.
the defendants further contend that the remedial plan violates section of the voting rights act because it will result in an overall loss of representation for in district.see beer united states,d.section is designed to combat retrogression which,by definition,requires a comparison of a jurisdiction new voting plan with its existing plan and necessarily implies that the jurisdiction existing plan is the benchmark against which the effect of voting changes is measured.reno bossier parish sch,d internal citations omitted.the burden is on south dakota to prove that the change does not have a discriminatory purpose or an effect that would deny or abridge the voting rights of minorities based on race when compared to the status quo of the previous plan.reno bossier parish sch,d.the defendants have not carried this burden.a retrogressive effect is one that decreases minority voting power in comparison with a preexisting plan when it eliminates a majority minority district or otherwise reduces the voting power of a minority community beer,at.here,the plan increases the number of majority districts by one,and enhances the voting power of the minority.thus,the remedial plan is consistent with the goals of the supreme court,as stated in beer,at.reapportionment that enhances the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise can hardly have the effect of diluting or abridging the right to vote on account of race within the meaning of.
as to the defendants claim that section was violated due to the lack of preclearance,we find no merit.section clearly states that the preclearance requirement applies to legislative apportionment plans that are adopted without judicial discretion or approval.mcdaniel sanchez,d.in this case,the plan was privately developed,and thus not subject to preclearance.id.t he act preclearance requirement does not apply to plans prepared and adopted by a federal court.
finally,the defendants opine that the district court erred when it reformulated a plan that may result in a new dynamic.the defendants do not describe the dynamic they fear,nor do they direct us to any evidence in support of their position.moreover,we have found no case law suggesting that a district court must analyze the changing political dynamics of remedial districts.therefore,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in implementing the plaintiffs remedial plan.
conclusion 
for each of the reasons noted herein,we affirm the decision of the district court and find that the preponderance of the evidence shows that the plaintiffs met their burden in proving a section violation.we also affirm the district court decision to impose the plaintiffs proposed remedial plan.
because i do not find that the district court clearly erred in the essential holdings of its opinion,i concur in the judgment.i write separately because my analysis of the district court findings and my application of the clearly erroneous standard differs from that of the court.
we review the district court factual findings for clear error.harvell,at.using this standard,we will overturn a factual finding only if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,if it is based on an erroneous view of the law,or if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that an error was made.united states vertac chemical,cir quotation omitted.under this standard,affirmance may be proper regardless of whether we agree with the district court interpretation of the evidence and the expert testimony.ante at see also ante at.we instead review the district court factual findings only to ascertain whether the district court interpretation of the facts is a permissible one,as a district court choice between two permissible views of the evidence can not be clearly erroneous.vertac,at qutoation omitted see also cottier,at colloton,dissenting to preserve the benefit of the trial court particular familiarity with the indigenous political reality,we apply a clear error standard of review both to the predicate factual determinations and to the ultimate finding regarding vote dilution.internal quotations and alterations omitted.
i.the gingles preconditions 
the court opinion adequately describes the gingles preconditions.see ante at.while i can not join the court analysis of the gingles preconditions,i concur in its conclusion.i set forth what i find to be the proper analysis of the issues below.
a.the first gingles precondition 
under the first gingles precondition,bone shirt must show that indians constitute a minority that is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.gingles,at.this first precondition focuses upon whether the district court can fashion a permissible remedy in the particular context of the challenged system.sanchez colorado,cir quoting nipper smith,cir.if no proper and workable remedy exists,then a plaintiff claims fail as a matter of law.cottier,at.in cottier,this court sustained redistricting plans under the first gingles precondition so long as the proposed plans offered indians a more reasonable opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.id.
the state contends that the district court erroneously determined that indians need not have a supermajority in the district.this court rejected a similar argument in cottier.id.the question is whether the minority population has an equal opportunity to elect its preferred candidate,not whether it will actually muster the votes to do so.league of united latin am.citizens perry,d.in any event,the state argument is beside the point,as bone shirt demonstrated that there were five potential remedial plans that gave indians a supermajority of over percent in the new district,the remedial district.as such,i can not say that the district court clearly erred when it concluded that indians constituted a minority that was sufficiently large and compact to constitute a majority in a district.in addition,the court accurately described the proposed remedial districts,ante at,and i likewise conclude that the proposed remedial districts are not themselves racial gerrymanders.
b.the second and third gingles preconditions 
gingles second precondition required bone shirt to show that indians are politically cohesive.gingles,at.a showing that a significant number of minority group members usually vote for the same candidates is one way of proving the political cohesiveness necessary to a vote dilution claim,and,consequently,establishes minority bloc voting within the context of.id.internal citation omitted.the third gingles precondition requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running to defeat the minority preferred candidate.gingles,at.internal citation omitted.
much of the argument before the district court and in this court addressed whether the statistical methods employed by bone shirt expert,steven cole,were sufficiently reliable.cole employed bivariate ecological regression analysis bera and homogenous precinct analysis hpa.the state expert,zax,employed ecological inference ei or king method.using bera and hpa,cole determined that indian voters are highly cohesive that is,indians tend to vote for the same candidates.the district court accepted cole statistical analysis,even though cole admitted that his equation contains an error and that the effect of that error is unknown.d at.the court points out that bera has long been accepted by the courts.ante at.
i find it difficult to rely upon a statistical method that incorporates an admittedly erroneous equation that yields a result with an error of unknown quantity and effect.daubert specifically requires a district court to consider the known or potential rate of error of the scientific method utilized by testifying experts.at.it is difficult to weigh this factor in daubert analysis if the effect of that error is unknown.d at.nor am i persuaded that previous acceptance of bera results permanently decides the matter.science evolves,and scientific methods that were once considered unassailable truths have been discarded over time.unreliable testimony based upon those outdated theories and methods must be discarded as well,lest scientific stare decisis ensure that such theories survive only in court.it may be that the validity of some scientific methods need not be constantly reestablished in case after case,but a statistical method that contains an apparently unquantified error would not be one of them.if cole testimony were the only basis for the district court opinion,i would likely hold that its conclusions were unsupported by competent evidence.
nevertheless,i do not find that the district court clearly erred when it found that indians vote sufficiently cohesively and the white majority voted as a bloc to usually defeat the minority preferred candidate mpc,thereby establishing the second and third gingles preconditions.as the district court correctly noted,all three methods employed by the parties experts in this case generate sufficiently similar results.id.at.in other words,cole bera and results and zax results are substantially similar.while the state contends that this is not the case,the analysis it presents in its brief is based upon a misunderstanding of the proper approach to the issue.
first,the state expert used an approach that conflates the second and third gingles preconditions.according to the state brief,dilution may be found when there is first,racial polarization and,second,in a case in which there is racial polarization,the minority candidate loses.the state further refines its approach by arguing that a particular race does not qualify as polarized unless at least percent of indians voted for the mpc and at least percent of the white majority voted against him.but there is no support for this approach,as no gingles precondition asks whether the white majority is also cohesive.to the contrary,the questions under gingles second and third preconditions are whether the minority votes cohesively and whether the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc in most elections to defeat the candidate that the cohesive minority population prefers.gingles,at.nothing in the case law prescribes that the white majority bloc must be of a certain size beyond the requirement that the bloc be large enough to defeat the mpc.as such,zax assumption that only races where at least percent of the white majority votes for the same candidate improperly skews his results.
second,the state diluted the proper analysis by relying heavily upon election results in races in other districts and for other offices,known as exogenous elections.as we have held previously,endogenous results are preferable to exogenous ones.cottier,at.moreover,the district court clearly found that endogenous results were preferable to exogenous results,and the state did not attack that finding in its appeal.
the state also relied heavily upon results from district when arguing that the white majority does not usually defeat the mpc.but it is hardly shocking that the white population usually can not vote as a bloc sufficient to defeat the mpc in district district created to ensure that indians could elect their mpc and where indians enjoy a large supermajority.contrary to the state argument,the precedent addressing this issue makes clear that courts must focus on election results from the district.see,gingles,at.holding that the minority proves the third precondition by showing that submergence in a white multimember district impedes its ability to elect its chosen representatives because the district white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc emphases added see also league of united latin amer.citizens.at the court has rejected the premise that a state can always make up for the opportunity of some individuals by providing greater opportunity to others.de grandy,at.holding that the third precondition was satisfied by a tendency of whites to vote as a bloc to bar minority groups from electing their chosen candidates except in a district where a given minority makes up a voting majority emphasis added.
if the state approach were correct,packing would be both the problem and the,having illegally packed indians into one district,the state could then point out that indians are sometimes able to elect their preferred candidate in the packed district.see old person,at noting that this approach would permit white bloc voting in a district to be washed clean by electoral success in neighboring districts.as the case law illustrates,the state approach to the issue is inappropriate.
in this case,then,the elections that speak to this critical issue are those in district,the white majority district in question.and,at bottom,when analyzed under the proper framework,both experts analyses using all three,hpa and the conclusion that the indians vote cohesively in that district and that the white majority usually votes as a bloc to defeat the mpc.as such,the district court did not clearly err when it held that the second and third gingles pr
