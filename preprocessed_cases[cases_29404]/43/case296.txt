in substance,one indian tribe seeks against other tribes an equitable apportionment of a shared fishery.though this case was filed as a proceeding in the still pending district court case of united states washington neither the united states nor the state of washington asserts a claim or defends against one.
in the,the united states signed a series of treaties with the tribes of the pacific northwest these treaties were between the tribes and the united states,and did not purport to settle disputes between different tribes the tribes ceded their aboriginal lands to the united states for settlement,receiving in exchange exclusive title to defined lands,free medical care,schools,occupational training,and annuity payments.what matters for this case is that the treaties also reserved to the tribes the right of taking fish in common with all citizens of the united states.
in,the united states in united states washington sued the state government to enforce the treaties on behalf of the indians.the complaint sought an injunction to prevent the state of washington from enforcing the provisions of state laws or regulations in such manner as to prevent or restrict members of said tribes from taking fish without previously having established that the imposition of state regulation is necessary for the conservation of fish.no injunction was sought against any tribe by any party.
as part of his lengthy and detailed opinions in that and technically still this case judge boldt described the treaty fishing right as a reserved right,which is linked to the marine and freshwater areas where the indians fished during treaty times,and which exists in part to provide a volume of fish which is sufficient to the fair needs of the tribes.a tribe has treaty rights at every fishing location where members of a tribe customarily fished whether or not other tribes then also fished in the same waters.the district court has then and subsequently denoted more than tribes usual and accustomed fishing grounds the adjudicated fishing areas of several tribes overlap.
judge boldt determined that the treaties entitled the tribes to roughly of the resources within traditional tribal fisheries.the supreme court ultimately affirmed this decision both the trial court and the supreme court disclaimed any responsibility for intertribal allocation of the indian when the same fishery was shared by multiple tribes.the court left it to the individual tribes involved to agree among themselves on how best to divide the indian share of runs that pass through the usual and accustomed grounds of more than one tribe 
pursuant to the request of the united states in its initial complaint against the state of washington the district court retained jurisdiction over this case for the life of this decree to take evidence,to make rulings and to issue such orders as may be just and proper upon the facts and law in implementation of this decree.judge boldt set forth the grounds for invoking that jurisdiction 
a the parties or any of them may invoke the continuing jurisdiction of this court in order to determine 
whether or not the actions,intended or effected by any party including the party seeking a determination are in conformity with final decision i or this injunction 
disputes concerning the subject matter of this case which the parties have been unable to resolve among themselves and 
such other matters as the court may deem appropriate 
decision i had previously defined the subject matter of the case as the application of the tribes treaty rights to anadromous fish in washington waters 
to invoke the court continuing jurisdiction,parties must file requests for determination,which are functionally the same as a complaint,but get two file numbers,the original number of the treaty case,and an sp number to indicate a new subproceeding within that case.this bit of administrative trivia matters,as we shall see,to jurisdiction over the tribes.after decision i,when requests for determination concerning nonanadromous fish and other matters outside the defined subject matter of the case were filed,the court decided that equity favored the consolidation of matters related to,but not included within,final decision.it thus expanded the subject matter of the case.later,the district court concluded it had jurisdiction over intertribal allocations 
in,the skokomish indian tribe requested a determination that it had the primary right to fish in the hood canal.the claim for a primary right in these cases entails the power to regulate or prohibit fishing by members of other treaty tribes with fishing rights in the same territory primary right adjudication depends on the historical relationship between tribes at the time of the treaties 
several tribes with pending claims of a right to fish in the hood canal objected to skokomish claim skokomish settled its claims with the lower elwha klallam,port gamble,and jamestown tribes.these stipulating parties entered the hood canal agreement which resolved skokomish primary rights claim as well as the territorial claims of port gamble and lower elwha the hood canal agreement created a joint fishery north of ayock point in the hood canal where all of the parties may exercise their respective treaty fishing rights without any limitation or control whatsoever by any of the stipulating parties,except as the stipulating parties may mutually agree by compact or otherwise.the skokomish tribe specifically agrees that it will not seek to exercise its primary right on hood canal north of ayock point 
after the hood canal agreement,the stipulating parties managed their joint fishery together through the point no point treaty council.they entered into successive fisheries management compacts.the compact was the last agreement.this scheme for resolution of disputes among the tribes eventually dissolved.skokomish and the lower elwha klallam tribe withdrew from the point no point treaty council in and,respectively.the tribes could no longer reach an agreement on the intertribal allocation of the joint fishery north of ayock point.
skokomish unilaterally issued a harvest plan for,allocating to itself certain percentages of the indian share port gamble and jamestown filed a request for determination that skokomish violated the hood canal agreement skokomish filed a seeking an equitable allocation of the joint fishery in order to prevent a race fishery from interfering with its ability to manage its fishery and meet tribal needs.its request acknowledged that it was harvesting the same amount of fish as before.the district court bifurcated the two claims.this appeal concerns skokomish for an equitable allocation,which lower elwha supported.
the district court granted the port gamble and jamestown tribes motion to dismiss.the district court held that t he dispute here does not arise from the hood canal agreement,and it can not be settled by looking to its terms.instead,the skokomish are asking the court to bypass the agreement and create an allocation for the parties because they can not agree among themselves as required by the agreement.the court noted that nothing in the agreement empowers the court to allocate harvest shares in the absence of the agreement of the parties.the provision in judge boldt decree retaining jurisdiction for d isputes concerning the subject matter of this case which the parties have been unable to resolve among themselves,did not apply because t he subject matter of this case is treaty fishing rights,not the equitable rights of any one tribe to harvest a certain allocation of fish nowhere in these decisions is there a finding that allocation as opposed to allocation between treaty and fishermen is the subject matter of this case.as for the language in judge boldt order,s uch other matters as the court may deem appropriate,t his is a discretionary section,and the court does not deem it appropriate to take jurisdiction of this matter.because the request for allocation did not fall within the purposes of enforcing the treaty or the hood canal agreement,and neither provided for court allocation if the tribes could not agree among themselves,the court exercised it
