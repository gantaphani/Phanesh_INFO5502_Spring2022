while on the spirit lake nation reservation on june,lara was arrested for public intoxication by bureau of indian affairs police officers.the officers informed lara,who is not a member of the spirit lake nation,of an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering the reservation.upon hearing of the exclusion order,lara struck one of the officers with his fist.lara was charged with five violations of spirit lake tribal code violence to a policeman,resisting lawful arrest,public intoxication,disobedience to a lawful order of the tribal court,and trespassing.on june,lara pled guilty to the first three charged offenses and was sentenced to a jail term of days.on august,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging lara with assault on a federal officer in violation of a.after consenting to proceed before a united states magistrate judge,lara moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy and selective prosecution grounds or,in the alternative,that discovery be allowed on the claim of selective prosecution.as recounted above,the magistrate judge denied the motions,and lara entered a plea of guilty conditioned on his right to seek appellate review of his motion to dismiss the indictment.
we review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.united states alverez,cir.the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.the right to be free from multiple prosecutions is limited by the dual sovereignty doctrine,which permits an independent sovereign to prosecute an individual who has been prosecuted by another sovereign for the same act.one who violates the laws of two independent sovereigns commits an offense against each,and thus a second prosecution is not for the same offence.heath alabama,d.
the application of the dual sovereignty doctrine turns on whether the two entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power.id.the double jeopardy clause does not permit successive prosecutions under the dual sovereignty doctrine where the authority for the prosecution derives from the same sovereign source.see,waller florida,d a city and its parent state puerto rico shell.the federal government and a territorial government united states mills,en banc the federal government and the district of columbia.conversely,the dual sovereignty doctrine permits a state to prosecute a defendant who has previously been prosecuted for the same act by another state or the federal government.heath,at.two states bartkus illinois,d upholding state prosecution following federal prosecution united states williams,cir upholding federal prosecution following state prosecution.consequently,whether the dual sovereignty doctrine applies to lara double jeopardy challenge turns on whether the spirit lake nation exercised sovereign authority emanating from a sovereign source distinct from that of the overriding federal sovereign.
in oliphant suquamish indian tribe,d,the supreme court held that a tribe had no inherent power to prosecute residents of its reservation.by submitting to the overriding sovereignty of the united states,indian tribes therefore necessarily give up their power to try citizens of the united states except in a manner acceptable to congress.id.at.in united states wheeler,the defendant raised a double jeopardy challenge to a federal prosecution commenced after wheeler,an enrolled member of the tribe,had been convicted in tribal court on a lesser included offense,d.wheeler argued that because congress has plenary authority to abrogate tribal sovereignty,the tribe was in effect an arm of the federal government.id.at.the court explained that its dual sovereignty precedents did not turn on the extent of control one sovereign had over another,but whether the two prosecutions exercised authority derived from the same ultimate source of power.id.at.the court held that among the unique and limited sovereign powers retained by the tribe was the power to punish members of the tribe for violations of tribal law.id.at.the distinction expressly and repeatedly drawn by the court was not premised on the racial status of the defendant but on his membership status.although tribes retained authority over their internal affairs,they had been implicitly or explicitly divested of authority over nonmembers.id.at.the areas in which such implicit divestiture of sovereignty has been held to have occurred are those involving the relations between an indian tribe and nonmembers of the tribe.id.at.because wheeler was an enrolled member of the tribe,he was prosecuted pursuant to an inherent sovereign power that had never been divested from the tribe,and thus subsequent federal prosecution for the same act was not barred.id.at.
in montana united states,d,the court again emphasized the distinction between the retained or inherent sovereignty over internal relations between members of the tribe and the sovereignty over external relations that necessarily had been divested from the tribes.t he dependent status of indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently to determine their external relations.id.at.quoting wheeler,at,emphasis added by montana court.the court held that the tribe retained inherent sovereignty did not authorize it to regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers on reservation land owned in fee by nonmembers.id.at.
the question of what power a tribe has over nonmember indians was addressed in duro reina,d.duro,an enrolled member of a different tribe,was charged in indian community court with unlawful firing of a weapon,a misdemeanor,in connection with the death of an indian boy.id.at.his motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was denied.id.at.because the salt river indian community did not claim that its jurisdiction over dura stemmed from congressionally delegated authority,the court was faced with the question whether the tribe retained or inherent sovereignty provided it with jurisdiction over a nonmember indian.the court held that it did not.id.at in the area of criminal enforcement,however,tribal power does not extend beyond internal relations among members.
in response to the decision in duro,congress amended the indian civil rights act icra,by revising the definition of powers of to include the inherent power of indian tribes,hereby recognized and affirmed,to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all indians.the amendment also defined indian to include all indians subject to federal jurisdiction under the indian major crimes act.thus,under the icra amendments,indians who are enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe are subject to the jurisdiction of all tribes.
although the supreme court has not yet construed the icra amendments,it has repeatedly reaffirmed its holdings limiting tribal sovereign authority to tribe members.atkinson trading shirley,d rejecting under the montana test the imposition of a hotel occupancy tax on reservation hotel on fee land nevada hicks,d citing oliphant for the general rule that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.
although indian tribes retain inherent authority to punish members who violate tribal law,to regulate tribal membership,and to conduct internal tribal relations,united states wheeler,d,the exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes,and so can not survive without express congressional delegation.montana,at.

in united states weaselhead,cir,we construed the icra amendments in a double jeopardy case factually similar to the present case.the district court had held that duro and oliphant were federal common law decisions within the ultimate authority of congress to overrule.d.a divided panel of this court reversed,concluding that ascertainment of first principles regarding the position of indian tribes within our constitutional structure of government is a matter ultimately entrusted to the court and thus beyond the scope of congress authority to alter retroactively by legislative fiat.at.on rehearing en banc,the panel opinion was vacated and the district court affirmed by an evenly divided court.cir.
the ninth circuit has held duro to be a common law decision that congress had the power to override via the icra amendments.united states enas,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.although the enas court conceded that sovereignty has constitutional implications,id.at,it concluded that the lack of an express citation to a constitutional provision indicated that duro was a common law decision,an area in which congress is supreme.id.at.
with all due respect to the holding in enas,we conclude that the distinction between a tribe inherent and delegated powers is of constitutional magnitude and therefore is a matter ultimately entrusted to the supreme court.absent a delegation from congress,a tribe powers are those inherent powers of a limited sovereignty which has never been extinguished.wheeler,at.quoting cohen,handbook of federal indian law emphasis omitted.once the federal sovereign divests a tribe of a particular power,it is no longer an inherent power and it may only be restored by delegation of congress power.
congress broad authority over indian affairs derives from and is limited by the constitution.some decisions root this power in the indian commerce clause.alaska native village of venetie tribal government,d mcclanahan arizona,d.prior to,the federal government negotiated agreements with indian tribes pursuant to its treaty power,const.art.ii,cl,but the combination of an statute and the development of the plenary power doctrine ended this process.antoine washington,d.the supreme court has suggested that we must be guided in part by structural principles that are both implicit and explicit in the constitution.see seminole tribe florida,d see also duro,at.the question we must answer is whether the sovereignty retained by the tribes in their dependent status within our scheme of government includes the power of criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers.some decisions have found plenary authority in the government trust responsibility,stephens cherokee nation,or in the relationship between the federal government and the tribes,morton mancari,d,but references to these sources of power have largely been supplanted by a reliance on the commerce power.see,alaska native village,at.
the icra amendments are a legislative enactment purporting to recast history in a manner that alters the supreme court stated understanding of the organizing principles by which the indian tribes were incorporated into our constitutional system of government.weaselhead,at.in exercising its commerce power,congress may not override a constitutional decision by simply rewriting the history upon which it is based.enas,at.duro determination of first principles regarding indian sovereignty within the federal system of government is ultimately one for the court.the court reaffirmed this principle subsequent to the icra amendments 
the dissent complaint that we give barely a nod to the tribe inherent sovereignty argument is simply another manifestation of its disagreement with montana,which announced the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.at.while the dissent refers to our myopic focus on the tribe prior treaty right to absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the taken area,it shuts both eyes to the reality that after montana,tribal sovereignty over nonmembers can not survive without express congressional delegation,at,and is therefore not inherent.
bourland,at.internal citations omitted.thus the icra amendments can not have the effect that they plainly sought to achieve a retroactive legislative reversal of duro.we need not construe the icra amendments as a legal nullity,however.it is apparent that congress wished to allow tribes to exercise criminal misdemeanor jurisdiction over nonmember indians.see hicks,at.in response to our decision in duro,congress passed a statute expressly granting tribal courts jurisdiction over nonmember indians.souter,concurring.nothing in our decision today in any way circumscribes the jurisdiction so conferred.
the spirit lake nation exercises authority over external relations only to the extent that such a power has been delegated to it by congress.as a nonmember,lara was necessarily prosecuted pursuant to that delegated power.because the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply where the ultimate source of power is the same,the double jeopardy clause bars the government from maintaining a second prosecution for the same act.accordingly,the motion to dismiss the indictment should have been granted.
the order denying the motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the indictment.
the essential difficulty that i see with the result that the court reaches today is that the supreme court in duro reina,d,did not base its decision on the constitution,nor did the constitution require the result that the court reached there.the result in that case was instead based on federal common law,nothing more and nothing less,and in the icra amendments congress exercised its plenary legislative power over federal common law in general and indian affairs in particular to define the scope of inherent indian sovereignty.in other words,congress restored to the tribes a power that they had previously exercised but had lost over the years as a result of supreme court decisions.because the spirit lake nation,in trying lara,was simply exercising its own sovereignty,and not a power that congress delegated to it,lara double jeopardy rights were not violated.
according to current legal thought,indian tribes possessed criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians as part of their full territorial sovereignty prior to colonization by us or our european predecessors.see duro,at.the supreme court held in duro,however,that the indians had lost this aspect of their sovereignty because of their dependent status.see oliphant suquamish indian tribe,d.
the court opines in the present case that o nce the federal sovereign divests a tribe of a particular power,it is no longer an inherent power and it may only be restored by delegation of congress power.this holding draws on statements in supreme court opinions that a tribe inherent sovereignty consists of those aspects of sovereignty that the tribes retained despite the federal government overriding sovereignty.see,duro,at.the court apparent premise is that power can not be a retained one once the supreme court holds that it no longer exists.
this premise,however,fails both as a matter of history and of logic.historically,it misapprehends the materials that the supreme court has used over the years to fashion the relationship between the united states and indian tribes logically,it improperly assumes that there is only one way that a power can be retained.in my view,the icra amendments did not create a new tribal power out of whole cloth,it merely relaxed a restriction on a power previously possessed.regardless of the fact that the icra amendments are a cause of the spirit lake nation ability to try lara here which of course they
