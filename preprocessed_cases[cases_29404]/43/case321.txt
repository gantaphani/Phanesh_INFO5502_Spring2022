the pit river tribe,the native coalition for medicine lake highlands defense,and the mount shasta bioregional ecology center collectively pit river appeal from the district court summary judgment on their claims against the bureau of land management,the united states forest service,and the department of the interior collectively agencies.pit river alleges that the procedures followed by the agencies in extending certain leases in the medicine lake highlands,and the subsequent approval of a geothermal plant to be built there,violated the national environmental policy act nepa,the national historic preservation act nhpa,the national forest management act nfma,and the administrative procedure act apa.pit river also contends that the agencies violated their fiduciary obligations to native american tribes.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we conclude that the agencies did not take a hard look at the environmental consequences of the lease extensions and never adequately considered the alternative.we therefore reverse.
medicine lake and the highlands surrounding it are of great spiritual significance to the pit river tribe and to the other native american tribes in the region.although the highlands are within the pit river tribe ancestral homelands,they are not part of the tribe reservation.tribe members,however,consider the region sacred and continue to use numerous important spiritual and cultural sites within the highlands.
this litigation concerns the efforts of calpine corporation calpine a california power company,to develop a geothermal power plant at fourmile hill near medicine lake.the geothermal steam act of,as amended,allows the secretary of the interior to issue leases for the development and utilization of geothermal steam on federal land and in national forests.id.pursuant to the geothermal steam act in effect at the time,the federal government designated the general area of the medicine lake highlands as the glass mountain known geothermal resource area resource area.
in,the department of the interior issued a programmatic environmental impact statement eis considering how to implement the geothermal steam act nationwide eis.except for three california locations not at issue in this litigation,the eis did not address the environmental implications of geothermal development in particular locations.rather,the eis provided for tiered environmental review because of the wide geographical distribution of potentially affected lands.specific details will be identified,evaluated,and described in the environmental analysis record prepared for each lease area prior to any leasing action.
the eis repeatedly discussed the interplay between nepa and the geothermal steam act,admitting that issuing geothermal leases may constitute major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,thus requiring the preparation of subsequent eiss under nepa.that eis further provided that w here the interdisciplinary evaluations or studies of any lease program reveal that a particular activity may constitute major federal action significantly affecting the human environment,an environmental statement will be prepared and circulated in accordance with section c of the national environmental policy act.the eis stated that,in addition to review of leasing decisions,p rior to the construction of power plants and transmission lines,and possibly of water and mineral extraction facilities,further environmental evaluation will be made.if there are significant potentially adverse environmental impacts not previously considered,an additional environmental statement may be necessary.
subsequently,in april,the bureau of land management bureau and the forest service released an environmental assessment ea for casual use exploration of the resource area.the stated purpose of the ea was to decide whether to allow geothermal leasing and casual use exploration on approximately acres of national forest land in the medicine lake planning unit,and an adjacent acres.the ea stated that o ne of the management directives in the land management plan was to provide for geothermal development where it is compatible with other uses,and recommended leasing in all areas with special stipulations applied to sensitive areas.it contained no discussion of the cultural or tribal impacts of the proposed leasing.
the ea acknowledged that,in general,a decision to lease carries with it the right to develop a discovered resource,subject to the limitations of the lease.it also made clear that t he details of future exploration and development can not be evaluated prior to leasing,and that f urther analysis will be required for the later stages of exploration and,if a resource is discovered,development.the ea observed that a t each step in the process there are numerous environmental safeguards required by the system,including eas or eiss,and public participation.in an appendix to the ea,the ea made clear that several staged eas or eiss would be required to proceed to subsequent phases of the project.
in,the bureau and the forest service jointly issued a supplemented environmental assessment for leasing activity in the medicine lake area ea.while the ea focused on casual use exploration,the ea explicitly addressed the exploration,development and production phases of the geothermal program,with an eye to deciding which lands should be leased and what measures are required to protect valuable resources.the ea also required t he lessee to file an operating plan for subsequent activities in exploration,development,and operation of the lease.each operating plan will require an additional environmental analysis and approval.additional conditions are then required before the lessee can begin activities.the document was tiered to the eis and specifically incorporated its evaluation of geothermal exploration,development effects,and related issues.
unlike the eis or the ea,the ea considered the possible effects of development on the cultural,recreational,and spiritual significance of certain features in the medicine lake area.for example,although the ea acknowledged that n atural attractions could be impaired by construction and development so as to lose their recreational appeal,it suggested that geothermal production could become an attraction itself.
the document stated that the area remained culturally significant to native americans.the discussion of the area cultural significance read,in its entirety,as follows 
the modern native american peoples who have cultural traditions extending back to the prehistoric period,continue to use resources found in the study area in an effort to preserve their cultural identities.these resources not only include tangible materials such as food and ceremonial items but some natural features of the landscape have spiritual significance as well.these areas have not yet been completely recorded,nor are they likely ever to be.some general areas of spiritual significance known to be of concern to local native americans include shasta,black fox mountain,little black fox mountain,medicine lake,medicine mountain and various other peaks,mountains and springs.the american indian religious freedom act of requires ongoing consultation with local native american organizations and individuals during all phases of altering activities for protection of the sites and areas important to the preservation of these cultural traditions.
the ea also discussed the historical significance of the area although no sites in the study area are currently on the national register of historic places,many have been judged eligible and several are in the process of being nominated.nomination acceptance is,however,no obstacle to a site removal by scientific excavation.
the ea entire discussion of the effects of the proposed leasing on cultural and historical resources is as follows 
any ground activity within the boundaries of a prehistoric,protohistoric or historic site will disturb destroy the patterning of surface and subsurface artifacts and features from which archaeologists infer past human behavior and construct a record of past human lifeways.any landscape altering activities have the potential to adversely affect the spiritual significance of natural features important to native american groups.
to address these and other potential impacts,the ea included a table of mitigating measures.the table indicated that some of the measures would be required as lease stipulations,while others would be analyzed further at the plan of operation stage.the sole mitigation measure listed for the impact on the spiritual significance of landscape features was c onsultation with local native american groups.the ea optimistically concluded that such consultation would be effective as a mitigation measure.nevertheless,three pages later,the ea contained an alternate finding in a listing of unavoidable adverse impacts 
cultural resources.it is possible that geothermal development will alter the character of the landscape,or certain features of the landscape,to such an extent as to adversely affect those tangible and intangible qualities that native american groups feel are of spiritual significance.continuous consultation with native american groups throughout all phases of the development process,from exploration through design and actual development,may succeed in minimizing such conflicts.
with regard to the impact on historical sites,the ea remarked that t he blm provides a copy of all proposed plans of operation to the state historic preservation officer shpo.the shpo is asked to provide comments on each proposal.
the bureau and the forest service subsequently mailed the ea to approximately one hundred individuals and organizations who were known to have been interested in the project.it is uncertain whether the ea was mailed to pit river.the bureau received only four letters in response,none of which was from pit river.
following the ea,the blm committed itself to leasing acres in the resource area in a record of decision rod adopted in.the rod stated that numerous environmental concerns,including that cultural resources be protected and that local native american groups be consulted,would be addressed at the plan of operation review stage.it then concluded that with application of appropriate mitigation,geothermal development can take place in this area without significant adverse impacts.the potential economic and energy benefits from this relatively clean resource are expected to outweigh any residual adverse impacts.on january,the bureau california director approved the leasing,concluding that this action will result in no significant impacts to the human environment and,therefore,an eis is not necessary.
in june,the bureau entered into the leases at issue in this case,ca and ca,without undertaking any further environmental or cultural impacts analysis.the lessee was calpine predecessor in interest,resource partners limited partnership.the leases were for an initial term of ten years effective june,both leases granted the lessee 
the exclusive right to drill for,extract,produce,remove,utilize,sell,and dispose of the geothermal resources in the lands described in item together with the right to build and maintain necessary improvements thereupon,for a primary term of years.rights granted are subject to applicable laws,the terms,conditions,and attached stipulations of this lease,the secretary of the interior regulations and formal orders in effect as of lease issuance and,when not inconsistent with lease rights granted or specific provisions of this lease,regulations and formal orders hereafter promulgated.
both leases contained two additional stipulations 
existing water in stock tanks,ponds,lakes,reservoirs,springs,creeks or streams is not available for use in any activity unless specifically permitted by the forest supervisor,except where the lessee has water rights or the authorized use of such water rights.access for wildlife at all natural water sources appropriated for operational uses,must be provided.no surface disturbance is allowed within feet of streams,lakes,ponds,springs,wet meadows or other water sources unless specifically permitted by the forest supervisor.
no activities will be allowed on the following described lands,unless the lessee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the forest service and the bureau of land management through an appropriate plan of operation or permit application that unacceptable environmental impacts will not occur to areas with exceptional visual qualities.description of affected sections for respective lease areas 
in addition,ca contained a third stipulation 
no activities will be permitted from april to august,unless the lessee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the forest service and the bureau of land management through an appropriate plan of operation or permit application that unacceptable environmental impacts will not occur to goshawk nesting habitat in specific sections of the parcel.
neither lease contained any other stipulation or restriction related to the use of the leasehold.the agencies did not complete an ea or eis,or consult with the interested tribes,before issuing the leases.
little activity occurred during the initial lease term.in,the bureau authorized two exploration core holes for lease ca.calpine later proceeded with one temperature gradient core hole in the fall of,and received approval to deepen the hole in april.
in,calpine submitted a plan of operations for a proposed fourmile hill geothermal exploration project exploration plan on the leased parcels,in the same general location as the power plant.the agencies conducted a nepa review and distributed an ea for public comment in december.the ea was sent to the pit river tribe.the agencies received little public comment and no comment from the pit river tribe.the agencies issued a finding of no significant impact and approved the project in april.
meanwhile,in september,calpine submitted a plan of utilization for the power plant project at issue in this litigation the fourmile hill geothermal development project fourmile hill plant.the proposed megawatt plant was to be located approximately three miles northwest of medicine lake.the power plant itself would cover ten and a half acres of land.the project would also involve construction of five production well pads,each covering approximately two and a half acres.the power plant and well field would disturb about fifty acres of land.the bulk of the activity,some acres,would be related to the construction of a transmission line,in a corridor,to carry the power produced at the fourmile hill plant to an existing transmission line operated by the bonneville power administration,located miles away.after three years of construction,the plant would be expected to generate electricity for years before being decommissioned.
the agencies began preparing an eis for the fourmile hill plant in june,sending a notification letter to over potentially interested agencies,groups,and members of the public.eventually,the agencies engaged in consultations with tribes,including the pit river tribe.they also commissioned an ethnographic report to consult local tribes to identify cultural resources located in the area of the fourmile hill plant.a draft form of the ethnographic report was completed by december.in july,the agencies issued a draft eis for the fourmile hill plant.the draft eis received much criticism from the public,including criticism from pit river.
in may,the bureau extended calpine leases for another five years.it appears that no environmental review was conducted with respect to this extension.
in september,the agencies issued a final eis for the fourmile hill plant eis.the eis considered various options for routing the transmission line.alternatives to the proposed structure and operations were considered earlier in the environmental review.while the eis mentioned the no action alternative of denying the project entirely,it was rejected because it would not meet the purpose and need for the proposed action.the eis defined the purpose and need of the project as follows 
the purpose of the fourmile hill geothermal project is to develop the geothermal resource on calpine federal geothermal leases in order to economically produce and deliver electrical energy to the bonneville power administration bpa and others.the need for the project was stated by the geothermal steam act of,the geothermal energy research,development,and demonstration act of,the federal land policy and management act flpma of,and the energy policy act of.the proposed project is consistent with these federal regulations which seek to foster and encourage private enterprise in the development of alternative energy resources.
the eis maintained that all of the alternatives considered would have significant adverse effects on traditional cultural values and traditional cultural uses.the alternative chosen was found to have the least overall effect on the environment because it would m inimize effects to traditional cultural values and uses specifically,to avoid effects near medicine lake and timber mountain.
in july,the keeper of the national register of historic places determined that the medicine lake caldera was eligible for listing in the national register.the report also called for further studies on the eligibility of other areas in the region.also in july,a briefing paper recommended that the fourmile hill plant project be denied because no mitigation could offset the significant impact to the very nature and intrinsic value of the medicine lake area.the paper also stated there is no mitigation that can offset the significant impact,which was a premise under which the leases were held.however,the paper pointed out that ogc and doi solicitors advised that denial of the projects would be a taking of private property rights associated with the lease.
the agencies issued a rod approving the fourmile hill plant on may.the rod stated that calpine had been issued federal leases for the right to develop the geothermal resource on federal lands,and that this vested property interest superceded an executive order on indian sacred sites.as part of the mitigation efforts,the bureau plac ed a moratorium on further geothermal development in the resource area for a minimum of five years until an analysis of actual impacts of geothermal development can be completed by the authorizing agencies.based on the moratorium,the bureau suspended operations and production in multiple leases in the resource area.
pit river appealed the rod to the interior board of land appeals and the regional forester for the pacific southwest region.both appeals were denied in their entirety.
while the appeals were pending,the bureau unilaterally lifted the moratorium on further development of the resource area.the decision stated that the energy situation in the country,and particularly in the west,ha d changed.the agency did not provide an opportunity for public review or comment.
in may,the bureau extended calpine leases for another forty years.no additional environmental analysis was undertaken in connection with this extension.the following month,pit river initiated this litigation in the eastern district of california,alleging various statutory violations throughout the leasing and development process.the district court entered summary judgment for the agencies on all claims on february.pit river tribe bureau of land management,d.

we must answer two threshold questions before reaching the merits of pit river claims regarding the lease extensions.first,we must consider whether pit river has article iii standing to raise the claims.second,we must decide whether the amendments to the geothermal steam act affected the justiciability of the claims.see energy policy act of,stat,amending g.we address these issues in turn.
the supreme court has identified three constitutional standing requirements the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,the injury must be fairly traceable to the conduct of the defendant,and the plaintiff must establish that a favorable federal court decision would be likely to redress the injury.see bennett spear,d.pit river relies on procedural harms to assert standing.the agencies argue that pit river does not satisfy the first or third part of this test and consequently lacks standing.
the agencies initially argue that pit river did not suffer an injury in fact.to satisfy the injury in fact requirement,a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.beeman tdi managed care,cir,quoting citizens for better forestry usda,cir.e nvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d,quoting sierra club morton,d.
the first sentence of the draft ethnographic report commissioned by the agencies reads previous research has indicated that the medicine lake highland and timber mountain areas have long been recognized by scholars as traditional cultural properties of the pit river nation pit river states that it has used the lands in question for cultural and religious ceremonies for countless generations.pit river has adequately demonstrated an injury in fact for standing purposes.
once a plaintiff has established an injury in fact under nepa,the causation and redressability requirements are relaxed.cantrell city of long beach,cir.t he members must show only that they have a procedural right that,if exercised,could protect their concrete interests defenders of wildlife epa,cir emphasis in original.
the agencies do not challenge the second part of the test.in any event,we conclude that the harm pit river complains of is fairly traceable to the agencies conduct.the agencies do contend,however,that pit river challenge to the lease extensions is no longer justiciable because the extensions were supplanted by the lease extensions and are thus not redressable.we conclude that the lease extensions do not foreclose our ability to provide effective relief,as the relief pit river has requested will remedy its harm.ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir as amended.the procedural injury would be redressed if the agencies followed proper procedures.beeman,at.if we hold that the environmental review was inadequate,the agenc ies would have to correct the process columbia basin land prot.ass schlesinger,cir.we could therefore invalidate the leases as of,thus nullifying the extensions,or we could enjoin any activity until the agencies comply fully with nepa and other statutes.see conner burford,cir as amended enjoining activity.thus,pit river can still receive effective relief from this court.
the agencies final argument about redressability is that the preparation of the eis forecloses relief on pit river claims.in part.of this opinion we reject that argument.accordingly,pit river has article iii standing.
in,congress amended the geothermal steam act.see energy policy act of,stat,amending g.the amendments to the act restrict the bureau discretion to deny geothermal lease extensions.because these amendments potentially render this appeal moot,we ordered supplemental briefing on the effect of the amendments.
a case becomes moot whenever it loses its character as a present,live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.cantrell,at,quoting hall beals,d.the relevant question is whether there can be any effective relief.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
before august,the portion of the act regarding lease extensions stated 
any geothermal lease issued pursuant to this chapter for land on which,or for which under an approved cooperative or unit plan of development or operation,geothermal steam has not been produced or utilized in commercial quantities by the end of its primary term,or by the end of any extension provided by subsection c of this section,may be extended for successive periods 
g repealed emphasis added.
the amended act provides as follows 
initial extension.the secretary shall extend the primary term of a geothermal lease for years if,for each year after the year of the lease 
a the secretary determined under subsection b that the lessee satisfied the work commitment requirements that applied to the lease for that year or 
b the lessee paid in annual payments sic accordance with subsection c.
additional extension.the secretary shall extend the primary term of a geothermal lease after an initial extension under paragraph for an additional years if,for each year of the initial extension under paragraph,the secretary determined under subsection b that the lessee satisfied the minimum work requirements that applied to the lease for that year.
a emphasis added.
by changing may to shall,the statute eliminated the bureau discretion in extending geothermal leases,provided that certain conditions are met by the lessees.nepa eis requirements apply only to discretionary federal decisions.see dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d.accordingly,if the statute effect is retroactive,effective relief to pit river would be foreclosed.
in landgraf usi film products,d,the supreme court considered whether to apply the civil rights act of,enacted while landgraf was on appeal,to a cause of action that arose before the statute.the court discussed in general terms when a statute should be given retroactive effect 
when a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit,the court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.if congress has done so,of course,there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.when,however,the statute contains no such express command,the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if the statute would operate retroactively,our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.
applying landgraf to the geothermal amendments,we conclude that we should not apply the statute retroactively.the energy policy act does not expressly state whether the statute is to be applied retroactively.the sole reference to potential retroactive application orders the secretary to create transition rules for leases issued before enactment of this subsection d.these transition rules have not yet been issued.moving to the second half of the landgraf analysis,we conclude that retroactive application of the statute would impose new duties on calpine,such as new minimum work or payment requirements.landgraf makes clear that such retroactive operation is heavily disfavored.
therefore,the amendments have not rendered this case moot.we proceed to the merits of pit river claims.
because the statute of limitations has run,pit river does not challenge the leasing decisions.rather,pit river argues that the agencies violated nepa,nhma,and their fiduciary trust obligations to the pit river tribe by failing to undertake any environmental review before extending the leases in.the agencies respond that the eis,the ea,and the ea were sufficient to cover the lease extension.in the alternative,the agencies argue that we can not provide effective relief because of the preparation of the eis.
nepa requires that a federal agency consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action and inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.earth island inst.forest,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the reviewing court must ensure that the agency took a hard look at the environmental consequences of its decision.kleppe sierra club,d.the statute dictates procedural safeguards rather than a certain result.marsh or.natural res.council,d salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir.because the statute is procedural in nature,we will set aside agency actions that are adopted without observance of procedure required by law.natural res.def.council forest,cir,quoting d.pit river argues that the agencies were required to prepare an eis before issuing the lease extensions to calpine.
in conner,federal agencies sold oil and gas leases on acres of national forest land in montana.after undertaking eas,the agencies issued findings of no significant impact,meaning that eiss were not required at the leasing stage.at.the bureau then sold over leases for oil and gas exploration.leases were of two basic types.some of the leases contained no surface occupancy nso stipulations,which,on their face,seemed to prohibit the lessees from using the surface of the leased land without specific approval from the bureau.other leases contained standard stipulations authorizing the government to impose reasonable conditions on drilling,construction,and other activities however,unlike the nso stipulations,they did not appear to allow the government to preclude such activities altogether.id.at.
the central issue in conner was whether the sale of any of the leases constituted an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of federal forest land that could have a significant impact on the environment.id.at.we held that,in the case of the leases,it did constitute such a commitment t he leases do not reserve to the government the absolute right to prevent all activity.id.at.we continued 
a fter the lease is sold the government no longer has the ability to prohibit potentially significant inroads on the environment.by relinquishing the no action alternative without the preparation of an eis,the government subverts nepa goal of insuring that federal agencies infuse in project planning a thorough consideration of environmental values.the heart of the consideration of reasonable alternatives to the proposed federal agencies to consider seriously the no action alternative before approving a project with significant environmental effects.that analysis would serve no purpose if at the time the eis is finally prepared,the option is no longer available.
id.at citation omitted.
bob marshall alliance hodel,cir,involved similar oil and gas leases in another montana national forest.as in conner,the bureau issued several leases,some of which had nso stipulations and some of which did not.all of the leases contained threatened or endangered species stipulations,stating that activity may be restricted if it would have a detrimental effect on endangered or threatened species.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs,holding,among other things,that the agencies violated nepa by failing to give meaningful consideration to the alternative.id.we affirmed,reiterating our recent holding in conner s ale of the leases required preparation of an eis unless the lease absolutely prohibits surface disturbance in the absence of specific government approval.id.at,quoting conner,at.
in contrast,an eis is not required in cases where the government has not irretrievably committed resources.in friends of southeast future morrison,cir,we held that an eis was not required where the agency retained the ultimate right to decide how much timber was to be harvested.id.at.
we must therefore resolve whether the leases and lease extensions at issue in this litigation reserve to the agencies the right to preclude activity altogether.the leases and the lease extensions grant the lessee the exclusive right to drill for,extract,produce,remove,utilize,sell,and dispose of the geothermal resources in the leased lands.they do not reserve to the agencies an absolute right to deny exploitation of those resources.all that is reserved to the agencies is the right to limit development in accordance with general statutory and regulatory requirements,and,critically,when not inconsistent with lease rights granted,with later regulations and orders.while specific stipulations attached to the leases provide some absolute limits on activities,these stipulations only cover select sections of the lease parcels or certain periods of the year.
the agencies have consistently interpreted this lease language as a grant to calpine of an absolute right to develop,subject only to procedural regulatory restrictions.a agency briefing paper stated that the bureau and forest service supervisors were strongly considering selection of the no action alternative for the projects in the medicine lake area.according to the briefing paper,department of the interior solicitors advised that denial of the projects would be a taking of private property rights associated with the leases.the decision makers would like to have the authority to deny the geothermal projects,which may require compensation to the leaseholders for the taking.this language implies that the decision makers did not have the authority to deny the projects.
similarly,the rod for the fourmile hill plant explicit discussion of what were viewed as calpine vested property rights supports the conclusion that the agencies viewed the leases as granting an absolute right to develop.the rod analyzed the project compliance with executive order,entitled indian sacred sites,and concluded that the leases rendered the executive order without effect.in other words,although adverse effects to sacred sites had not been avoided,denial of the project was not possible without also denying calpine its vested rights as a leaseholder.
this view of the leases is consistent with the earlier eiss and eas prepared by the agencies.the eis on geothermal energy recognized that the issuance of geothermal leases may constitute major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,thus necessitating further eiss.similarly,the ea declared that a decision to lease carries with it the right to develop a discovered resource,subject to the limitations of the lease further analysis will be required for the later stages of exploration and,if a resource is discovered,development.the rod,in turn,stated that development within a conditional no surface occupancy zone will be permitted if the agencies so concur.however,there is no guarantee to the lessee that proposed operations will be found to be feasible within those nso areas there are,however,areas where the nso stipulations do not apply.
a comprehensive programmatic impact statement generally obviates the need for a subsequent or impact statement,unless new and significant environmental impacts arise that were not previously considered.salmon river,at.however,the eis does not adequately address the potential impacts of leasing in fact,we have already held as much in sierra club hathaway,cir.there,the plaintiffs sought an injunction to stop the government issuance of casual use geothermal exploration leases,contending that the eis was insufficient.casual use exploration involves practices which do not ordinarily lead to any appreciable disturbance or damage to lands,resources,and improvements.id.at.we held that a supplemental eis was unnecessary at that stage,affirming the district court denial of an injunction,because the casual use leases did not constitute irreversible and irretrievable commitments of specific resources to development.id.at.however,our ruling also depended on our conclusion that it was unlikely that the blm and the usgs will permit the leasing program to proceed into its advanced phases without fully considering their obligation to comply with the eis requirements of nepa.id.at.
the and eas are also insufficient.they did not consider the impacts of actual geothermal development,but only of leases and casual use exploration the actual leases later granted,purportedly based on those eas,are inconsistent with their terms.we held in salmon river that when an impact statement is prepared,impacts need not be fully evaluated until a critical decision has been made to act on site development.at.once a critical decision is made,though,any vague prior programmatic statements are no longer enough.the lease language,and the agencies interpretation of the lease language,make clear that the critical decisions here occurred when the agencies extended absolute development rights in and again in.
the agencies urge that the lease extensions merely preserved the status quo and do not require separate assessment.discretionary agency action that does not alter the status quo does not require an eis.wildlife fed espy,cir.in other words,an eis is not required in order to leave nature alone.kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because pit river did not challenge the leases,the agencies argue that they were free to do as they wished in.
in espy,the government took title to a ranch from a delinquent borrower and subsequently sold the ranch.the new owners continued to graze cattle on the land.we held that the title transfer was not subject to nepa because cattle had grazed on the land before the title transfer.espy,at.in kootenai tribe,though,we held that the forest service plan to reduce human intervention in national forests altered the status quo.we held that nepa applied and that the initiative required an eis.kootenai tribe,at.
we conclude that the situation presented here is different from the continued use scenario in espy.without the affirmative of the leases,calpine would have retained no rights at all to the leased property and would not have been able to go forward with the fourmile hill plant.the status quo before the extensions was that calpine owned rights to produce geothermal steam valid through may,after which calpine owned nothing.instead of preserving the status quo,the lease extensions gave calpine an extra five years to develop the land and the possibility of obtaining a future lease extension of up to forty years.
like the original leases,the extensions of calpine leases did not reserve to the agencies the absolute right to deny development and did not merely preserve the status quo.under nepa and our case law,the agencies were required to complete an environmental impact statement before extending the leases.this obligation was not satisfied by the earlier environmental reviews.
calpine urges that any deficiency in the environmental review before the lease extensions has been rendered moot by the preparation of the eis for the fourmile hill plant.the district court held that the preparation of the eis mooted the claim,because preparation of the eis was the relief sought by pit river.pit river tribe,d at.the issue is actually one of standing rather than mootness,because the eis was completed before the beginning of this litigation.see friends of the earth,at.describing difference between standing and mootness.the question is whether the relief pit river has requested will remedy its harm.ocean advocates,at.
nepa requires that federal agencies include a detailed statement of alternatives to the proposed action in any recommendation or report on actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c iii.additionally,the statute mandates that the agencies study,develop,and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.id.e.the alternatives section is the heart of the environmental impact statement.the consideration of alternatives requirement
