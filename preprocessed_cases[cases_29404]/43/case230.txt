peabody western coal peabody mines coal at the black mesa complex and kayenta mines on the hopi and navajo reservations in northeastern arizona under leases with the tribes.at issue in this appeal are two leases with the navajo nation the nation that permit peabody to mine coal on navajo reservation land.each lease requires peabody to give preference in employment to navajo indians.both leases received approval from the department of the interior interior under the indian mineral leasing act of,imla.since at least as early as the,mineral leases,including the two at issue here,have routinely included tribal hiring preference provisions.
this appeal is the latest stage in a legal dispute about the tribal hiring preferences the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc sued peabody in the district of arizona in,alleging that peabody implementation of the tribal hiring preference constituted national origin discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.the eeoc also claimed that peabody had violated title vii requirements.see c.several years of litigation on procedural matters resulted in the joinder of the nation under federal rule of civil procedure and impleader of the secretary and assistant secretary of the interior collectively,the secretary under federal rule of civil procedure.the principal issue now before us is the eeoc claim that title vii prohibits the tribal hiring preference contained in the peabody leases.
in the decision now on appeal,the district court granted summary judgment against the eeoc on the merits.it held that the navajo hiring preference in the leases is a political classification,rather than a classification based on national origin,and therefore does not violate title vii.we have jurisdiction over the eeoc appeal pursuant to.we agree with the district court that the tribal hiring preference is a political classification.we therefore affirm.
background 
peabody entered into two leases with the navajo nation.the first,lease,signed in,permits peabody to mine coal on the navajo reservation.the second,lease,signed in,permits peabody to mine on reservation land formerly held in trust for both the navajo and hopi tribes,now partitioned between the tribes.
in lease,peabody agrees to employ navajo indians when available in all positions for which,in the judgment of peabody,they are qualified,and to pay prevailing wages to such navajo employees and to utilize services of navajo contractors whenever feasible.the lease also provides that peabody shall make a special effort to work navajo indians into skilled,technical and other higher jobs in connection with its operations under this lease.lease contains a similar provision,and also states that peabody may at its option extend the benefits of the hiring preference to hopi indians.interior drafted the leases and required the inclusion of the navajo hiring preferences.the leases were approved by interior under the imla.peabody iv,at.
in,two members of the hopi tribe and one member of the otoe tribe filed discrimination charges with the eeoc.they alleged that they had applied to peabody for positions for which they were qualified,and that they were not hired because they were not navajo.after an investigation,the eeoc sued peabody in federal district court in arizona in.the eeoc alleged that peabody implementation of the tribal hiring preference provisions constituted national origin discrimination forbidden by title vii.
after the eeoc brought its title vii claims,peabody moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion on two grounds,holding that the suit presented a nonjusticiable political question and that the nation was a necessary party for whom joinder was not feasible.peabody i,at.we reversed,holding that the suit did not present a political question and that rule joinder was feasible,provided that the eeoc sought no affirmative relief against the nation.peabody ii,at.the supreme court denied review.peabody coal eeoc,mem.
on remand,the eeoc amended its complaint to join the nation under rule.the district court again granted summary judgment against the eeoc.it held that the eeoc sought affirmative relief against the nation,defeating rule joinder that the secretary was a necessary party for whom joinder was not feasible and that the tribal hiring preference did not violate title vii because it was authorized by the navajo hopi rehabilitation act of.peabody iii,wl.
on appeal,we reversed in part and vacated in part.we again held that joinder of the nation was feasible.we held further that,although the eeoc could not join the secretary as a defendant under rule,peabody or the nation could implead the secretary as a defendant under rule a on claims for injunctive or declaratory relief.we vacated the judgment on the title vii claim in order to allow the district court to consider the secretary arguments.peabody iv.the supreme court again denied review.eeoc peabody coal.mem.
on remand,the eeoc filed a second amended complaint.peabody impleaded the secretary and counterclaimed against the eeoc for declaratory relief.the district court granted the eeoc motion to dismiss peabody counterclaims.
the secretary then moved for summary judgment on peabody complaint on the ground that the tribal hiring preferences in the leases were permissible under title vii.the nation and peabody also moved for summary judgment.
the day before argument on those motions,the eeoc moved to supplement the record with the declaration and supporting documents of a former eeoc investigator who had interviewed peabody hiring officials in.the district court denied the motion as untimely,noting that the information that the eeoc sought to introduce had long been available,and that,in any event,the information was not relevant because it pertained to pre practices.
the district court upheld the tribal hiring preferences in the leases.after an examination of the status of indian tribes in general and their relationship to the federal government,and drawing on the principles the supreme court articulated in morton mancari,the court held that the preference was a political classification rather than a national origin classification.the eeoc timely appealed the grant of summary judgment and the denial of its motion to supplement the record.

iii.discussion 
title vii national origin discrimination 
the eeoc argues that title vii prohibits hiring preferences based on tribal affiliation,which it contends is a form of impermissible national origin discrimination.the eeoc is responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of title vii.the secretary argues that the tribal hiring preferences are based on political classifications that title vii does not reach.the secretary maintains that tribal hiring preferences serve to promote tribal in accordance with congressionally mandated federal indian policy.none of the parties has argued that chevron deference applies to the eeoc or interior interpretations of the statutes each is charged with administering.see chevron,natural res.def.council.
the question before us is one of first impression.but we do not walk on untrodden ground.we have previously stated that differential treatment in employment based on tribal affiliation can give rise to a title vii national origin discrimination claim.see dawavendewa salt river project agric.improvement power dist.dawavendewa i,cir.outside the context of title vii,however,we have recognized that where differential treatment serves to fulfill the federal government special trust obligation to the tribes as political entities,tribal preferences are permissibly based on political classifications.means navajo nation,cir kahawaiolaa norton,cir see mancari.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the tribal hiring preferences in the peabody leases are based on tribal affiliation,a political classification.we also hold that title vii does not prohibit differential treatment based on this political classification.
statutory framework 
we begin by reviewing the relevant provisions of the imla and of title vii.
a.the indian mineral leasing act of 
the peabody leases are authorized and governed by the imla.see united states navajo nation.that statute provides,in relevant part 
on and after may,unallotted lands within any indian reservation or lands owned by any tribe,group,or band of indians under federal jurisdiction,except those specifically excepted from the provisions of sections to of this title,may,with the approval of the secretary of the interior,be leased for mining purposes,by authority of the tribal council or other authorized spokesmen for such indians,for terms not to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals are produced in paying quantities.
the imla was designed to advance tribal independence.navajo nation,at.congress aimed to foster tribal by giving indians a greater say in the use and disposition of the resources found on indian lands.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the imla was intended to achieve uniformity so far as practicable of the law relating to the leasing of tribal lands for mining purposes,h,at to ensure that indians received the greatest return from their property,id.at and to bring all matters in harmony with the indian reorganization act,id.at.see montana blackfeet tribe of indians.
the indian reorganization act ira,also known as the wheeler howard act,enacted four years prior to the imla,has been described as probably the most important single statute affecting indians since its passage.elmer rusco,a fateful time the background and legislative history of the indian reorganization act,at ix.the drafters of the ira sought to reverse half a century of assimilationist policy.see id.at.the ira was a comprehensive reform statute,providing,among other things,for tribal,restoration of lands to tribal ownership,economic development,and vocational training.indian reorganization act,stat.codified as amended at et.in the decades since its enactment,the ira has been criticized for the lack of involvement of indian communities during the drafting process,as well as for perceived failures in its implementation.rusco,supra,at.but it remains the case that the statute was conceived as a means to restore tribal sovereignty and to promote the tribes and economic independence.mancari,at quoting the statement of john collier,commissioner of indian affairs,that the ira is designed not to prevent the absorption of indians in white communities,but rather to provide for those indians unwilling or unable to compete in the white world some measures of in their own affairs see generally rusco,supra.
in enacting the imla,congress expressly intended to further the policy goals articulated in the ira.in the imla,congress delegated broad discretion to the secretary to approve mineral leases.see navajo nation,at.the imla does not mention hiring preferences of any kind,but in the exercise of its discretionary authority,interior since the has routinely approved mineral leases that require a tribe lessee to give preference in hiring to members of that tribe.this practice serves to ensure that the economic value of the mineral leases on tribal lands inures to the benefit of the tribe and its members,consistent with the purpose of the imla.
stewart udall,secretary of the interior when the peabody leases were prepared,stated in a declaration and in a deposition that interior negotiated and drafted the leases.he affirmed that the navajo preference provisions were a key provision,given the economic importance of coal resources on the reservations.peabody iv,at.secretary udall understood interior role in approving mining leases as carrying out a special trust duty owed to indian tribes in general and,with respect to these leases,owed in particular to the navajo and hopi tribes whose coal was being mined.
title vii of the civil rights act of 
title vii prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.the eeoc contends that the tribal preference in the leases violates the prohibition against national original discrimination.title vii does not define national origin.the legislative history tells us very little about congress understanding of the term.the only discussion of national origin came in the context of permitting employers to indicate hiring preferences based on sex,religion,or national origin where those qualities are a bona fide occupational qualification.that discussion centered on the distinction between discrimination based on race and discrimination based on national origin.representative james roosevelt stated,may i just make very clear that national origin means national.it means the country from which you or your forebears came from.you may come from poland,czechoslovakia,england,france,or any other country.eeoc,legislative history of titles vii and xi of the civil rights act of,at cong.rec.representative john dent stated,national origin,of course,has nothing to do with color,religion,or the race of an individual.a man may have migrated here from great britain and still be a colored person.eeoc,supra,at cong.rec.
title vii contains two provisions specifically addressing indian tribes.first,it provides that the term employer does not include an indian tribe,thus excluding indian tribal governments entirely from coverage under title vii.b.second,section i,known as the indian preference exemption,expressly permits preferential hiring over of indians living on or near reservations.it provides 
nothing contained in this subchapter shall apply to any business or enterprise on or near an indian reservation with respect to any publicly announced employment practice of such business or enterprise under which a preferential treatment is given to any individual because he is an indian living on or near a reservation.
the legislative history of section i is sparse.we at least know that it was intended to help remedy past and present discrimination against indians as a minority group.see cong.rec.statement of karl mundt.we have previously noted that the primary impetus behind i was concern that by enacting title vii congress would render unlawful otherwise permissible hiring preferences for native americans.malabed slope borough,cir.the exemption was designed to protect existing or future preference programs.see also cong.rec.statement of karl mundt stating that section i,along with the exclusion of indian tribes from title vii definition of employer,will assure our american indians of the continued right to protect and promote their own interests and to benefit from indian preference programs now in operation or later to be instituted.but the legislative history and statutory text give little indication as to congress views,if any,on preferences for tribal members over indians from other tribes,as distinct from general preferences for indians over.
the eeoc issued a policy statement in in which it concluded that section i is limited to general indian hiring preferences and does not,in itself,authorize preferential employment practices based on tribal affiliation a statement to which we have accorded deference.see dawavendewa i,at.but this statement does not end the inquiry.that section i does not itself authorize or create an exemption for tribal hiring preferences on or near indian reservations does not dispose of the question before us whether title vii prohibition against national origin discrimination prohibits the tribal hiring preferences in the mineral leases.
tribal affiliation and national origin 
the correspondence between tribal membership,on the one hand,and national origin,on the other,is not.see generally matthew fletcher,tribal membership and indian nationhood,am.indian.tribal membership,often based on blood quantum and lineage,see id.at,incorporates notions of race and ethnicity that the drafters of title vii explicitly understood the term national origin to exclude.the federal government interactions with indians have,in many cases,shaped their political structures and constituencies,such that even the notion of the tribe may lack direct correlation with actual or historical group politics.see felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law,at nell jessup newton,see also id.b,at t he very concept of enrollment and maintenance of citizenship lists is largely an artifact of federal actions.carole goldberg ambrose,of native americans and tribal members the impact of law on indian group life,law soc y.nonetheless,our decision in dawavendewa i established that,at least in some cases,a tribal hiring preference can give rise to a title vii national origin discrimination claim.
at issue in dawavendewa i was the claim of a hopi indian who had been denied employment at a power station on a navajo reservation,the salt river project srp,pursuant to a tribal hiring preference in the power company lease agreement with the navajo nation.id.at.we held at the pleading stage that the plaintiffs had stated a title vii national origin discrimination claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.id.at.we observed that,in its implementing regulations,the eeoc has given the term national origin an expansive construction that could plausibly be read to encompass tribal affiliation.id.at.the eeoc defines national origin discrimination broadly as including,but not limited to,the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual,or his or her ancestor,place of origin or because an individual has the physical,cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group.we also drew on our own broad construction of the term.in pejic hughes helicopters,cir,we had written unless historical reality is ignored,the term national origin must include countries no longer in existence.given world history,title vii can not be read to limit countries to those with modern boundaries,or to require their existence for a certain time length before it will prohibit discrimination.id.at citation omitted.
in light of this,we held in dawavendewa i that,b ecause the different indian tribes were at one time considered nations,and indeed still are to a certain extent,discrimination on the basis of tribal affiliation can give rise to a national origin claim under title vii.at.we noted that native americans interests in were not at issue.id.we suggested that the presence of such interests would trigger a separate analysis,grounded in the supreme court decision in mancari,and its recognition that at least some forms of preferential treatment of indians are based on political classifications rather than national origin.see infra subsection.we also held,giving eeoc policy statement due weight,that section i did not authorize tribal hiring preferences.dawavendewa i,at.
the eeoc contends that our analysis must begin and end with dawavendewa i.but four years later,in a second appeal in that case,we limited the scope of what we had earlier written.in dawavendewa salt river project agricultural improvement power district dawavendewa ii,cir,we heard an appeal from the district court dismissal of a claim for failure to join the nation as a defendant under rule.we affirmed.in doing so,we specifically rejected the plaintiffs contention that we had previously held that salt river project hiring practices violated title vii.we wrote in dawavendewa ii that dawavendewa i 
held only that a hiring preference policy based on tribal affiliation,as described in the complaint,stated a national origin discrimination claim upon which relief could be granted w e did not address the merits of the nation proffered legal justifications in defense of the challenged hiring preference policy.in particular,we declined to consider whether the nation navajo treaty,the federal policy fostering tribal,the navajo preference in employment act,or any other legal defense justified srp hiring preference policy.
dawavendewa ii,at emphasis added citation omitted.we observed that i n appropriate situations,federal law yields out of respect for treaty rights or the federal policy fostering tribal.id.as we explain below,this case presents such a situation.
tribal affiliation as political classification 
in mancari,employees of the bureau of indian affairs bia sued to enjoin the implementation of a provision of the ira that granted appointment and promotion preferences to indians seeking positions in the bia.see.the plaintiffs argued that the preference was contrary to,and impliedly repealed by,the equal employment opportunity act eeoa prohibition against discrimination in federal employment,and that it constituted invidious racial discrimination in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.mancari,at.the court rejected both arguments.id.at,
the court held that the eeoa had not impliedly repealed the bia employment preference.id.at.the court noted that the overriding purpose of the ira was to establish machinery whereby indian tribes would be able to assume a greater degree of,both politically and economically,and that the participation of indians in the operation of the bia was crucial to achieving that goal.id.at.the court observed that title vii explicitly exempts tribal employers from its coverage and permits the preferential hiring of indians on or near indian reservations.id.at.it would be anomalous to conclude that congress intended to eliminate the longstanding statutory preferences in bia employment,as being racially discriminatory,at the very same time it was reaffirming the right of tribal and private employers to provide indian preference.id.at.the court noted further that congress had enacted indian preferences in other legislation contemporaneous to title vii,which suggested that it likely did not intend to repeal the indian preference in the ira by passing title vii.id.at.
the court also held that the indian employment preference did not constitute invidious racial discrimination in violation of the due process clause.the ira reflected the congressional determination that proper fulfillment of its trust obligations required turning over to the indians a greater control of their own destinies.id.at.the court reasoned that t he preference is granted to indians not as a discrete racial group,but,rather,as members of tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the bia in a unique fashion.id.at.the indian employment preference was not based on a racial designation but on a political preference that triggered only review.id.as long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of congress unique obligation toward the indians,such legislative judgments will not be disturbed.id.at.the preference was reasonable and rationally designed to further indian and did not violate due process.id.
the court has reaffirmed mancari on several occasions.the court continues to distinguish between permissible differential treatment of indian tribes based on political classifications,on the one hand,and impermissible differential treatment of groups based on racial or national origin classifications,on the other.in rice cayetano,the court stated,
of course,as we have established in a series of cases,congress may fulfill its treaty obligations and its responsibilities to the indian tribes by enacting legislation dedicated to their circumstances and needs.as we have observed,every piece of legislation dealing with indian tribes and reservations single s out for special treatment a constituency of tribal indians.
id.at citations omitted alteration in original quoting mancari,at.we have applied the distinction in our own cases.see,kahawaiolaa,at see also means,at applying mancari and upholding against an challenge a law subjecting to tribal criminal jurisdiction a person who is not a member of the tribe,but is an enrolled member of a different indian tribe.
we recognize that mancari addressed a political classification providing a general indian hiring preference rather than a preference.but mancari logic applies with equal force where a classification addresses differential treatment between or among particular tribes or groups of indians.indeed,based on mancari,the court has specifically upheld differential treatment among indians.in delaware tribal business com
