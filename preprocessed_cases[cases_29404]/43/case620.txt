mother appeals from orders terminating her parental rights over twins and za,and selecting adoption as their permanent plan after a hearing under welfare and institutions code,section she does not challenge the merits of the rulings but claims reversible error in denials of motions,late in the hearing,to relieve and substitute counsel,and failure to comply with notice mandates of the indian child welfare act of icwa et.we affirm the orders.
background 
mother has five children the twins born in april,their half siblings and dexter born in and,and another half sibling,benjamin born in.all but benjamin were in mother custody when removed and detained in november on information that she was incarcerated and,during months of being homeless before then,had left them in the care of others.
the san francisco human services agency hsa filed an original petition that same month,and the twins were eventually declared wards,subds.b failure to protect,g no provision for support j abuse of sibling on amended allegations regarding mother that she was on felony probation for grand theft and was convicted of battery on a police officer she was under investigation for welfare fraud in receiving aid in more than one county for benjamin she had a history of domestic violence,with incidents witnessed by the children her transience left her unable to meet the children medical,dental,educational and emotional needs she was currently incarcerated for a probation violation,her second incarceration since an arrest on a warrant in november for noncompliance with community service half siblings dexter and and benjamin were subjects of pending dependency petitions mother had refused to reveal the location of benjamin so that a health and safety evaluation could be done mother continued to conceal the whereabouts of benjamin,who had not been seen since he was six months old and mother had given conflicting accounts of his whereabouts,telling family members that he lived with his father,telling hsa that he was voluntarily placed with a paternal aunt,and saying he had been with an unidentified family since he was very young.
the twins entered foster care immediately,in november,with a family that mother chose.they remained together in the same home throughout these proceedings,bonded quickly and made great progress,transforming from children with emotional problems to children who thrived physically,emotionally and socially,and excelled academically.by the time of the proceedings we review here,nearly two and a half years later,the foster parents were committed to adopting and were completing a home study.
mother progress was dismal throughout the reunification period.she signed an initial services plan in december,while jailed three months for an underlying grand theft,and was granted reunification services at disposition in june.mother was represented by counsel throughout but did not personally attend a hearing until september nearly two years into the case,electing not to attend early hearings because she knew she was being criminally investigated for welfare fraud related to benjamin,whose whereabouts she continued not to reveal.
mother was also incarcerated for most of that time.the record is confusing,but it appears that in march,just a month after her time in san mateo and san francisco county jails for the grand theft,she was jailed in san francisco for child concealment.in the criminal matter,she ultimately pled guilty to welfare and food stamp fraud,subds.c,for collecting on the absent benjamin in two counties,and perjury and child concealment,in return for a prison sentence.she was jailed in san francisco until february,when she was transferred to state prison and served out a further six months until released in.she had a period of weekly visits with the twins in the brief interval between jailings,then twice monthly visits part of the time while in jail the second time.she declined to have visits while in prison,but sent them some letters.
meanwhile,mother reunification services were terminated in june,over months after removal,for lack of substantial progress.we do not have full records for the half siblings,but by the start of the twins section hearing in march,dexter age was in foster care,and age was with her father,her case having been dismissed.the whereabouts of benjamin age were never ascertained.the twins presumed father who has not appealed here was not a part of the twins lives when the case began and had not been in contact with them,or hsa,since january.
within a week of her parole release from state prison in august,mother took up residence at a walden house facility on treasure island,participating in a month program female offender treatment employment program fotep designed to ready her for employment and independence.she was nearly seven months through that program by the time of the section hearing,had successfully completed various classes,was working at an internship at the san francisco county jail,and felt she was in compliance with parole.she did not have permanent housing but had applied for it,and her housing would allow children.her release from fotep was set for september,six months off.
the court had suspended mother visits with the twins upon terminating services and setting a section hearing,and hsa thereafter consistently recommended terminating parental rights and choosing adoption as the permanent plan.
in early january,mother counsel filed a modification petition to reinstate visits and reunification services based on mother progress in fotep and earlier history of positive visits with the twins while jailed in san francisco.hsa filed opposition,and the matter was heard on march,the first day of the section hearing.mother counsel presented the petition first,calling social worker tomy joseph,fotep case manager avonelle hanley mills,and mother as witnesses.counsel effort to present the director of a program was met with a successful objection that the witness was not timely designated.the court denied modification,citing lack of evidence that it was in the children best interest.
moving on to the section matters,the court excluded the views of half sibling dexter for lack of standing see,subd.b.his counsel related that dexter did not want to come to court,and mother counsel related that she had chosen not to force his appearance by subpoena,thinking that his counsel could relate his views.counsel sought a continuance,and the court granted it after hsa had briefly recalled tomy joseph to the stand.
at the start of the continued hearing,on april,mother counsel raised a mckenzie motion to be relieved as counsel people mckenzie cal d,while mother raised a marsden motion to change counsel people marsden cal d.the court cleared the courtroom and heard each movant relate,in essence,that their relationship had deteriorated to the point that they could no longer communicate effectively.the court denied both motions,citing in part the lateness of the request and the children need for resolution.mother left the courtroom for the rest of the hearing.her counsel the case worker and,there being no further witnesses or evidence,urged foster care based on a claimed exception,subd.c b v.the court terminated the rights of both parents and selected adoption as the plan.
the absence of challenge to the merits of the section or rulings on this appeal leaves no need to detail the evidence,but we note that mother insisted on a story of benjamin absence that differed from prior explanations she had given to family who had not seen benjamin since infancy and to officials.she now said that she had let benjamin stay with a man in hunter point named richard anderson,someone she had been dating or seeing but who she did not believe was benjamin biological father.benjamin had now lived with anderson since,and mother had not seen them since late or early.she had no idea where he was or whether he was safe or alive.
discussion 
marsden mckenzie ruling 
mother contends that denial of her motions was an abuse of discretion that denied her due process and rose to structural error in the circumstances,such that reversal is required without any need to establish prejudice.we note that she defines a mckenzie motion as one by appellant or his counsel to request the removal of counsel people mckenzie,supra,cal d at,yet she does not offer any analysis distinct from marsden review.since review of a mckenzie motion ruling is similar,people mcdade d.reviewing for abuse of discretion,we proceed with marsden review as briefed by the parties.they agree that marsden principles,forged in the criminal law context,apply by analogy to dependency proceedings.in re james d,fn.
the motions were based on these oral exchanges between the court,mother,and her counsel,nina bhutani the court bhutani,you are asking that you be given leave to withdraw from the case 
bhutani yes.
the court can you tell the court why 
bhutani well,i first of all have had the case for three years,and i think it fair to say that my client and i can not speak to each other.we do not get along.our communication has severely broken down,as our body language reflects.i can not represent mother anymore.
i realize where we are at this stage of the proceedings.
i find,as i am sure she does,her messages are not appropriate,sometimes threatening.i can not do it anymore.and we have no relationship.
in the meantime of me coming to this conclusion after last week and this morning,i did advise the parties.i also had a conversation with blumberg in order to expedite the process,who is backup in here right now.if i was relieved i am prepared to hand him the file.he said if he is appointed he is prepared to take it.and i think it would be beneficial in case of appeal,and also beneficial for mother to have a new lawyer even at this juncture,because i think we are both just over each other at this point.
the mother i concur.when we were here and i first want to say,your honor,that this for me is not a ploy to put this hearing off.
i have been very frustrated with bhutani almost from the beginning.i was incarcerated in san francisco county jail from june to february before i was transported to cdc.only one time did she come to see me.it was impossible to reach her by phone.there was a high toll block on her telephone.and a couple of times when i did speak to her it was through calls,and i would tell her how frustrated,i never knew what was going on in this courtroom,what was going on with my kids.
at the hearing on the in this courtroom the city attorney made references to that i was here in court,i was present in court during my incarceration.i have always asked to be transported.
i never it was just very frustrating dealing with bhutani.even my criminal court lawyer,she also wrote a statement that i have here about how frustrating and how she had called bhutani on my behalf numerous times,her interns,friend outside program left massages for bhutani,never to any avail.
my criminal case judge,carol yaggy,had to contact bhutani to order her to come and see me.
you know,just,and even since i have been out,your honor,i have asked things of her.we have never sat down and gone over this case.she made comments.
i have asked,you know,i even contacted some of the other contacts that i wanted to fire bhutani as my attorney.
so it not like we are here and now i am trying to do this to delay,because i know what is going to happen and i am making piece sic with that,but i just think that her behavior has been atrocious and no person going through this situation should be treated like this.and i sit in courtrooms and i talk to lawyers every day in my position as a case manager,and this has just been unbelievable,i mean really unbelievable.
i have asked for documents,i have asked for things,i do get them.you know,the,i have been asking her to file that from almost the time that i first got out.you know,i am going to the courthouse on friday,i will be there on friday and i come down here mondays and tuesdays,and i check,nothing has been filed.it been one thing,your honor,after another.
the court this is the that was filed in january you are referring to 
the mother yes,your honor.i have been asking her to file that for months,for months.and i was released in august of.
regardless of what the outcome is,if the city attorney does agree,whoever does agree,i say take it to the judge,that is my right,take it to the judge,and it took all the way until then and even then it was served properly.and i asked if we can get in here before march,you know,okay,i am going to file it,i am going to refile it.i called every day.at one point i would call her office,i would call her cell phone every day.it was like a routine when i would get to the office,it was like one of the first things i would do.no return phone calls,your honor,absolutely nothing.
and yes,some of my messages have gotten,i do believe threatening,she may perceive it as threatening.but what is it going to take for you to call me back do i need to go sit on your stairs to call me back 
these are my children,and irregardless sic of what the court may think of me,i love my kids and i have been prepared to fight,you know.
bhutani your honor,i am not going to respond to most of that,even though i would.i just do feel it appropriate at this point because the case is before you.
i do feel bad that mother feels that way.i think in the beginning with epley and all the things that were going on,we had a good relationship,but after three years it has deteriorated.
the mother it been two years,six months.
bhutani okay.i agree at this point that there is no way we can work together,even through the remainder of this hearing.
the court just a couple of things i like to point out to mother,and that is kind of obvious maybe.
the first thing is that just because you want your lawyer to do something does mean that it the best thing to happen right then.so when the petition got filed was a matter of legal judgment and not a matter of not doing what you want.sometimes underlying a lot of these motions by parents to get rid of their lawyers is he or she does do what i tell them to do.
the mother.i understand that.
the court that is not their role to do what you tell them to do.
the mother.and i understand that.
the court so just keep that in mind that maybe your complaints about the,there might be something else behind that.
secondly,i understand that you are frustrated when you say you did get calls back in the beginning,but generally calling somebody every day does help.
and the last thing i am going to say is for the times that you were not in court,i think i can say with a lot of clarity that bhutani fought for you like a tiger.she came in here and she made excuses for you and she made arguments for you and she put herself out there for you,understanding that her job was not made much easier because of the reason you were in jail in the first place.so you need to know that even though you may not have observed a lot of what was going on here,it was happening.
the mother.and i understand that,your honor.but there was absolutely no communication,letters when i was incarcerated,i mean to even state what happened in court.the only thing i knew is i had a court date and i was transported.what was the outcome i have absolutely no idea,absolutely no idea.
and i am not saying,you know,that 
the court okay,if your main complaint at this point is that you were not having communication with bhutani,we can fix that.
the mother.okay.
the court i also need to tell you that there is anybody on this panel of attorneys who is going to fight any harder for you.and there is anybody on this panel who is going to do what you say because you want to do it.i need to disabuse you of that idea if that is something that you were holding close.
the mother.i mean that is the final.it been two years and six months,you know,with this,your honor.and no preparation,absolutely nothing,even before the she had never really had a conversation with any of the witnesses,even with myself.i had no idea.i walked into this situation completely blind,no nothing,not a meeting,not a,not a come to my office.i invited her to come to the island,there was a space available,she got lost or something.nothing.
bhutani no,i came to the island.i am shutting up.
after ascertaining that mother had nothing further to say,the court ruled it the day of the.i do think these children should have to wait any longer.i think i need to hear the evidence and make the decision today.
if you wish,the two of you,to renew your motion at some time in the near future,you certainly may.but for today the marsden motion is denied and the mckenzie motion is denied.
and i would really like to say one more thing to both of you,and that is you have a working relationship.it on the rocks right now clearly from both of you.if this can be solved by a little more returning of phone calls or returning of letters or meetings on your part,bhutani and on your part,mother,if you would stop using intemperate language that can be perceived as threatening,if you can stop calling every single day,you ca talk and listen at the same time,and right now i desperately need you to listen because there is so much at stake.
if after today and after you have had a chance to work on your relationship and you think it still would work out,you come back and see me.but i am not going to grant this on the day of trial.the court then added,after unreported discussion we are back on the record.the court has denied counsel mckenzie motion and mother marsden motion.both motions are denied without prejudice,and i am prepared to go forward now.and mother is not present in the courtroom.i believe counsel told us off the record that mother prefers to not be in the courtroom.the court then proceeded with a further five transcript pages of examination of social worker tomy joseph last name legally changed to pazhempallil since the last hearing date.this consisted principally of on mother behalf by bhutani.all sides then rested,without further witnesses,and bhutani vigorously argued,without success,for foster care rather than terminating parental rights and choosing adoption as the children plan.
when a defendant seeks new counsel on the basis that her appointed counsel is providing inadequate representation,makes what is commonly called a marsden motion people marsden,supra,cal d,the trial court must permit the defendant to explain the basis of her contention and to relate specific instances of inadequate performance.a defendant is entitled to relief if the record clearly shows that the appointed counsel is not providing adequate representation or that defendant and counsel have become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result.substitution of counsel lies within the court discretion.the court does not abuse its discretion in denying the motion unless the defendant has shown that a failure to replace counsel would substantially impair the defendant right to assistance of counsel.citation.people smith cal th,d.
on review,we consider the timeliness of the motion,the adequacy of the court inquiry into the defendant complaint,and whether the conflict was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.people smith,supra,cal th at,d.on factor it is within the trial court discretion to deny a motion to substitute made on the eve of trial where substitution would require a continuance.citation.this is even more true if the motion is made during trial.id.at,d.on factor,inquiry is adequate if it allows the defendant to express herself fully,as comprehensively as the circumstances reasonably permit.ibid.on factor,and even where the defendant refuses to cooperate with counsel or participate further in trial after the denial of substitution,there is no abuse of discretion where the reason for a complete breakdown was the voluntary conduct of defendant,not any failure by the trial court to adequately inquire into the reasons for the conflict.citation.ibid.
factor supported denial.the motion came not only during the hearing contest,but in the final or so of a hearing continued from a month earlier.bhutani had another attorney blumberg standing by to take the file if appointed in bhutani stead,but the record does not show that blumberg was ready to proceed without a continuance.factor also supported the denial.we have set out the court extensive inquiry into the reasons of client and counsel,and mother makes no argument at all that the inquiry was inadequate.nor does she convincingly argue that bhutani rendered ineffective assistance in the legal work she did in the case.the trial court in fact praised bhutani for vigorous advocacy in a case made difficult by mother conduct.there is no reason to think that the two instances mother cites on appeal without having mentioned them on the motion below would have dissuaded the judge of that assessment overall 
that leaves factor,whether there was a conflict so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.people smith,supra,cal th at,d.necessary subparts are a a complete lack of communication b not caused by the voluntary conduct of the client that would c prevent an adequate defense.ibid.the court found that a working relationship was clearly on the rocks right now but held out hope that it was remediable,denying the motions without prejudice to renew if there was no improvement.that hope,as the court surely appreciated,did not cure the problem for the brief remainder of the hearing,but the court was obligated to look further to whether this was due to mother conduct and whether the breakdown would prevent an adequate defense for the remainder of the hearing.
the court appeared to fault both counsel and client for the communication breakdown counsel for being less responsive than she could have been,and mother for expecting too much control,making demands,and using intemperate or threatening language.thus the court did fault mother voluntary conduct,at least in part,which works in favor of the denial.
the court did not speak directly to the question of the breakdown preventing an adequate defense,but did praise bhutani work on mother behalf.this included her advocacy on the section relief sought at the last hearing.the court could reasonably infer that loss of that motion had contributed to the recent breakdown,as counsel and client realized that,without resumed reunification services,there was little hope of halting the recommended plan of adoption for the twins and concomitant termination of parental rights,given the twins longtime security and success in a home and that mother services had been terminated for over a year.the question for the court was whether the breakdown would now prevent a defense on those questions,and the appellate record supports an implied conclusion that it would not.most of the evidence had been presented at the last hearing,when the relationship was perhaps strained,but still intact.the parties had explored the reports,and examined their author,and examined mother herself,evidence that overlapped the plan and questions.there is no indication that mother expected to testify further and that the denial of the motions affected any such strategy.
no abuse of discretion appears in denying substitution and proceeding with the rest of the hearing.even if we found abuse,we would not reverse.while this was the point where parental rights would finally be severed,we reject mother arguments that any error at that point was structural and requires automatic reversal.mother cited cases are easily distinguished,in re jasmine th,d failure to give notice of selection and implementation hearing but see in re james cal th,d,cautioning against importation of structural error ideas into dependency proceedings,d,denial of notice and a hearing may be harmless where the outcome of the proceeding has not been affected.with the termination of reunification services a year earlier,the focus had shifted to the needs of the children for stability and permanency in re marilyn cal th,d,and the brief absence of an relationship here was not a total deprivation of the right to counsel gideon wainwright,d.the ultimate breakdown was not until a week before the continued hearing,when all that remained was some further examination of a social worker,plus legal argument.after the court denied mother motions,bhutani the social worker and presented valiant argument that a exception made guardianship and continued parental rights the better solution.any error was not structural.
for many of the same considerations,we would find no prejudice,even by the heightened federal constitutional standard of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.we see no record suggestions that anything would have gone more favorably for mother had the court granted the motions.
ii.icwa issues 
mother claim of icwa error is based on a lack of tribal notice compliance on the face of the record on this appeal.hsa argues that mother forfeited the issue by not raising it below,that to enforce notice requirements at this late stage would violate the twins constitutional rights to permanence and stability,that the information before the court was too vague to trigger a need for tribal notice,and that if notice was required,we should take judicial notice of icwa efforts in two of the half siblings cases as showing substantial compliance here.mother resists each of hsa arguments,and we find it appropriate to group the issues into a compliance,b judicial notice,and c prejudice.
compliance.we reject hsa view that mother failure to raise the issue below bars the issue on appeal.we acknowledge a split of authority on the question but adhere to cases reasoning that because notice serves the interests of indian tribes,failure to give tribal notice is not an issue forfeited by a parent failure to object.in re robert th,d robert nicole superior court th,d in re samuel th,d in re marinna th,d.we therefore reach the compliance arguments.
the icwa is designed to protect the interests of indian children,and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.it sets forth the manner in which a tribe may obtain jurisdiction over proceedings involving the custody of an indian child,and the manner in which a tribe may intervene in state court proceedings involving child custody.when the dependency court has reason to believe a child is an indian child within the meaning of icwa,notice on a prescribed form must be given to the proper tribe or bureau of indian affairs bia,and the notice must be sent by registered mail,return receipt requested.in re elizabeth th,d.
the january disposition report,written when the twins and half siblings cases were being considered together for disposition,read the icwa does or may apply.father reported that he does have any native american ancestry.in an investigation narrative completed by martinez cps worker,esmeralda okendo,dated,s he interviewed mother regarding the family native american ancestry.mother states that her maternal grandmother was cherokee and her paternal grandmother was part apache.she is not registered with any tribe and does not believe her mother established any affiliation.maternal grandmother name is sharon randle.dexter father is african american.a report addendum of february restated that the icwa may apply,for possible apache cherokee tribal eligibility.it added that dexter and father had informed the court that he might have native american ancestry and that hsa had submitted form jv notice of involuntary child custody proceedings involving an indian child to the court office regarding and benjamin.
each child case bore a separate number below for dexter for for benjamin and and for the twins,and because the orders we review here affected only the twins,our appeal record includes only the proceedings directly involving their cases.this creates a problem in that,except for bare statements in a july status review report,and the august report and november addendum for the section hearing,our record contains no further mention of icwa.those statements are that the icwa does not apply,but are unexplained,resulted in no express finding by the court,and are unsupported by any form jv tribal notices for the twins.
hsa implicitly concedes the deficiency but argues that,because the icwa applies only to indian children,defined by congress as those who are members or who are eligible for membership and a child of a member in re th,d,the scant and general information available to the court here did not require tribal notice.in re found information that a father may have indian in him too vague and speculative to give the juvenile court any reason to believe the minors might be indian children.id.at,d.here,we additionally had mother belief that one of her grandmothers was cherokee and another part apache tribes unidentified,yet mother also reported that she herself was not registered and did not believe her mother established any affiliation.whatever the status of the grandmothers,they were great grandmothers to the twins,and this information did not suggest that the twins were members or eligible for membership as children of a member.we agree with hsa that this did not trigger a duty to notify tribes.thus there was no error.alternatively,we hold that any error was harmless.
an initial point of disagreement is whether we may take judicial notice of tribal notices from the half siblings cases for the purpose of assessing whether there was substantial compliance here,defined by case law as actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.stasher harger haldeman cal d.mother observes that we generally assess error by what was before the court when it ruled in re zeth cal th,d,zeth,that the icwa notice materials in the half siblings cases were not before the court in the twins cases,that judicial notice is usually inappropriate for resolving facts,and that there was,in any event,no express court finding here of icwa inapplicability to which we might look to the half siblings cases for evidentiary support.
we express no opinion on those questions,for even if mother prevailed on each of them,it would not keep us from assuming noncompliance for argument sake and taking judicial notice to find lack of prejudice.we do so,and explain below.
judicial notice.when determining whether a trial court committed error,we are generally limited to matters that were before the court when it ruled zeth,supra,cal th at,d,and there is some authority for not taking judicial notice of icwa efforts for that purpose,including a case from our own division in re th,d judicial notice declined for the purpose of providing evidence to support an implied icwa finding.here,however,we take judicial notice not to assess whether error occurred,but to assess whether there was resulting prejudice to any affected tribe.in re elizabeth,supra,th at,d agency could have attempted to mitigate the damage it caused by sending a new notice pending appeal in re christopher th,d augmentation allowed alicia superior court th,d same.as for mother protest that doing so introduces evidentiary material unsuited for resolution through judicial notice,we observe that the only materials at issue here are documents.documents speak for themselves,and where there is no extrinsic evidence,the interpretation of a written instrument is a pure question of law.state farm mut.auto.ins.partridge cal d,estate of dodge cal d,parsons bristol development cal d.mother raises no challenge to the accuracy or authenticity of these documents,which are all certified.finally,of course,the question of prejudice itself is one of law for this court cal,art.vi,not one for the trier below.
in resisting judicial notice,mother relies on robert,supra,th,d,which found a lack of icwa notice despite indications of the father cherokee heritage,and declined the agency request to find the error harmless based on icwa notices and documents filed in the separate dependency case of robert half sibling,who shared the same biological father.id.at fn,d.reasons given were numbering ours the sibling case was heard by a different judge the icwa notices were issued after the error in robert case they were not filed in robert case documents did not include a court finding of compliance in the sibling case an appeal determines the correctness of a record that was before the trial court when it ruled citing zeth,supra,cal th at,d,and the agency had a duty to give notices and file them,and any response
