plaintiffs oklevueha native american church of hawaii,oklevueha and michael rex mooney raging bear appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint and judgment in favor of defendants the attorney general,the administrator of the drug enforcement administration dea,and the attorney for the district of hawaii collectively,government.plaintiffs action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief barring the government from enforcing the controlled substances act csa against them and for return or compensation for marijuana taken by the government.plaintiffs allege that they consume marijuana as a in their religious ceremonies,and that their use is protected by the first amendment and the religious freedom restoration act rfra.the district court dismissed the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on ripeness grounds.it also dismissed the claim for the return of,or compensation for,the seized marijuana because the marijuana had been destroyed and monetary damages are not available under rfra.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff oklevueha native american church of hawaii,is a member independent chapter of the native american church nac.nac has an estimated national members in branches throughout states.plaintiff michael rex raging bear mooney is the founder,president,and medicine custodian of the oklevueha chapter.he is of seminole native american ancestry,and is an authorized spiritual leader,or medicine man.
according to plaintiffs,nac is an healing religion,the primary purpose of which is to administer sacramental ceremonies.these ceremonies involve the consumption of drugs indeed,plaintiffs explain that the church only exists to espouse the virtues of,and to consume,entheogens.nac members religious use of peyote is exempted from the prohibitions of the csa,see but there is no such exemption for marijuana.plaintiffs explain that marijuana use is a crucial part of nac tradition and that members consume marijuana as a sacrament and eucharist in their religious ceremonies and rites,in addition to or as a substitute for peyote,which is their primary of choice.all oklevueha members consume marijuana in religious ceremonies.members use marijuana to enhance spiritual awareness and facilitate direct experience of the divine.mooney uses marijuana daily,and other oklevueha members use marijuana in sweat ceremonies,which occur twice a month at various private locations in oahu and are only open to nac members.
in june,federal law enforcement officers in hawaii seized from fedex one pound of marijuana that was addressed to mooney and intended for oklevueha use.the marijuana was turned over to the honolulu police department and later destroyed.the seized marijuana was worth approximately.plaintiffs do not allege that mooney or any oklevueha member has been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution in connection with the seizure or in relation to any other procurement or use of marijuana.
despite the nonexistence of any criminal charges,plaintiffs claim that they fear for their ability to continue to cultivate,consume,possess,and distribute marijuana for religious purposes without being branded criminals and made to face fines and imprisonment.in support of this fear,they point to a dea raid in march on another church that purports to use marijuana as a religious sacrament.
plaintiffs assert seven claims violation of rfra,violation of the american indian religious freedom act,violation of the right to equal protection under the fifth and fourteenth amendments violation of the first amendment right to freedom of religion theft conversion of one pound of marijuana declaratory judgment that the government seizure of the marijuana was unlawful and that the csa may not be enforced against their possession,cultivation,provision,and distribution of marijuana for personal religious use and injunctive relief ordering the return of the seized marijuana,or its monetary value,and prohibiting the government from arresting or prosecuting oklevueha members for marijuana use or seizing their marijuana.
the district court granted in part and denied in part the government first motion to dismiss oklevueha first amended complaint.it dismissed the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief related to future use of marijuana the preenforcement claims and the tort claims,but not the claim for return of,or compensation for,the seized marijuana under rfra.the court dismissed the preenforcement claims on ripeness grounds,concluding that plaintiffs claims did not satisfy the constitutional ripeness test for preenforcement challenges and that even if they did,prudential considerations also warranted dismissal.the court further held that oklevueha lacked associational standing to assert the claims for prospective relief.plaintiffs claims for theft and conversion of the marijuana were also dismissed because they are barred by sovereign immunity.then in a subsequent order,the district court dismissed plaintiffs remaining claims related to the seizure of the marijuana.with respect to plaintiffs request for compensation,the court explained that it could not order the government to return something it does not have,and that it could not award money damages because rfra does not unambiguously waive sovereign immunity to authorize money damages.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.knievel espn,cir.we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.however,conclusory allegations and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.johnson lucent techs,cir.
a.the preenforcement claims 
plaintiffs challenge the district court determination that their claims for prospective relief are not ripe.the constitution limits article iii federal courts jurisdiction to deciding cases and controversies.const.art.iii.ripeness is one component of the article iii case or controversy requirement.the basic rationale of the ripeness requirement is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.abbott labs.gardner.the ripeness inquiry contains both a constitutional and a prudential component.portman cnty of santa clara,cir.we consider each in turn.
constitutional ripeness 
the constitution mandates that prior to our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional case or controversy,that the issues presented are definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc quoting ry mail ass corsi.however,arrest is not necessarily a prerequisite for an individual to challenge the applicability of a criminal statute.
when the plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder,he should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.
babbitt united farm workers union,internal quotation marks omitted.
to bring such a preenforcement claim,we require plaintiffs to allege a genuine threat of imminent prosecution.thomas,at internal quotation marks omitted.we consider whether the plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question whether the government has communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the statute.id.
in reviewing these factors,we find that they do not apply easily to the unique circumstances of plaintiffs claims.the genuine threat analysis presumes that no enforcement has previously occurred,and therefore ascertains the likelihood of future enforcement.in contrast,the fedex seizure was an enforcement of the csa against plaintiffs,mitigating the relevance of a hypothetical.nonetheless,because plaintiffs claims are asserted for the first time in an action for prospective relief and not in a criminal proceeding,we consider the familiar preenforcement claim ripeness analysis,while acknowledging its strained applicability to the unusual allegations before us.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege a concrete plan to violate the csa because the complaint does not state exactly how,where,and in what quantities plaintiffs intend to consume marijuana,and does not specify how they intend to cultivate or acquire,store,and distribute marijuana.we disagree that the complaint must contain these factual allegations and conclude that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a concrete plan.
according to plaintiffs,they have used marijuana in violation of the csa countless times,and plan to continue to do so.we have explained that the concrete plan element of the genuine threat inquiry is satisfied where plaintiffs had more than a concrete plan to violate the laws at issue because they actually did violate them on a number of occasions.sacks office of foreign assets control,cir see also jacobus alaska,cir holding that challenge to validity of campaign finance laws was ripe because p laintiffs have gone far beyond the requirement that they articulate a concrete plan to violate the law,and instead have actually engaged in the illegal behavior at issue.plaintiffs allege that mooney violates the csa daily by consuming marijuana,and that other members of oklevueha violate the law at sweats,in addition to any other usages.they further allege that mooney and oklevueha members have no plan to stop their consumption.taking as true the facts alleged,plaintiffs are currently violating and plan to continue to violate the csa by purchasing and consuming marijuana.accordingly,plaintiffs allegations satisfy the concrete plan requirement.
the second component of a genuine threat is whether the government has communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings.the district court found that plaintiffs had not adequately alleged a specific threat of prosecution because the complaint lacked allegations of any threat or warning from federal authorities or that plaintiffs intended to continue to bring in marijuana in a way likely to be noticed by federal drug authorities.
the district court is correct that plaintiffs do not allege any threat of prosecution related to plaintiffs marijuana consumption.plaintiffs have never been arrested in connection with their marijuana consumption,nor has there been another seizure of their drugs in the more than two and a half years that have elapsed since the fedex seizure.moreover,the government lawyer clarified at oral argument that the seizure at issue was in a response to a call from fedex regarding plaintiffs package,and was not the result of any active government investigation.the government lawyer further explained that to his knowledge,neither mooney nor oklevueha is the target of any current investigation.additionally,the government decision to destroy the marijuana seized in without further investigation may give some insight into its enforcement priorities,which at this time apparently do not include plaintiffs.
we conclude,however,that the district court focus on future prosecution is inapposite.plaintiffs need not allege a threat of future prosecution because the statute has already been enforced against them.when the government seized plaintiffs marijuana pursuant to the csa,a definite and concrete dispute regarding the lawfulness of that seizure came into existence.see ry mail ass n,at stating that a justiciable case or controversy must present a definite and concrete dispute.this case is unique in that unlike most enforcements of criminal statutes,the seizure did not result in a criminal proceeding that could have afforded plaintiffs the opportunity to assert their constitutional and statutory challenges to the enforcement of the csa against them.but it does not follow that because this enforcement and seizure of property did not provide plaintiffs a process in which to raise their claims,those claims are not now ripe.we require a threat of prosecution to ensure that the plaintiff challenging a statute can demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement.babbitt,at.in this case,that injury has already occurred,thereby eliminating any concerns that plaintiffs fear of enforcement is purely speculative 
for the same reason plaintiffs need not demonstrate a threat of future prosecution under these facts,we conclude that plaintiffs need not establish the third prong of the genuine threat of prosecution inquiry,the history of enforcement of the statute.in other words,we need not rely on enforcement of the statute against other groups in determining whether plaintiffs are likely to suffer a similar fate in the future,because the csa has already been enforced against plaintiffs through the seizure of their marijuana.this is not the kind of abstract disagreement that the ripeness doctrine prevents courts from adjudicating.plaintiffs stake in the legal issues is concrete rather than abstract.colwell dep t of health human servs,cir.a case and controversy exists regarding plaintiffs entitlement to possess and consume marijuana for religious reasons.
prudential ripeness 
the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,quoting reno catholic soc.the question of prudential ripeness requires us to first consider the fitness of the issues for judicial review,followed by the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.colwell,at.the district court held that the case is not fit for judicial review because the complaint contains no factual allegations describing how marijuana is consumed or acquired and,for all the court knows,plaintiffs might be planning to import thousands of pounds of marijuana to sell to anyone claiming a religious need.we disagree and conclude that plaintiffs preenforcement claims are fit for review.
courts have regularly declined on prudential grounds to review challenges to recently promulgated laws or regulations in favor of awaiting an actual application of the new rule.see,toilet goods ass n,gardner,we believe that judicial appraisal of these factors is likely to stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific application of this regulation than could be the case in the framework of the generalized challenge made here.park hospitality ass n,at j udicial resolution of the question presented here should await a concrete dispute about a particular concession contract.colwell,at if and when the parties are able to provide examples of the manner in which the hhs has used the policy guidance we will be in a better position to determine whether the policy guidance functions as a substantive rule or as a general statement of policy.this is not such a case.in contrast to cases in which the courts are left to hypothesize about how the law might be applied,plaintiffs claims arise from an enforcement action that has already occurred.the seizure of plaintiffs marijuana presents a concrete factual scenario that demonstrates how the laws,as applied,infringe plaintiffs constitutional rights.thomas,at.
we also disagree with the district court conclusion that to present a case fit for review,plaintiffs need to frame the scope of the injunctive relief they seek through allegations about oklevueha members use,possession,cultivation,and distribution of marijuana.such specific pleadings are not required to establish fitness for review,which requires only the existence of a concrete factual situation.san diego cnty gun rights comm.reno,cir.the scope of any injunctive relief to which plaintiffs might ultimately be entitled may be determined at a later phase of the litigation.see lujan.defenders of wildlife,holding that justiciability must be supported with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.
likewise,we are unpersuaded by the government assertion that plaintiffs request for prospective relief is unripe because plaintiffs did not request an exception to the csa from the dea.see any person may
