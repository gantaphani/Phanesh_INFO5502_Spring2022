louella oldbear,a member of the indian tribes,used tribal funds to repair one of her personal vehicles and to purchase another.a federal jury convicted her of five counts of embezzling indian tribal funds in violation of and one count of making a false statement to a government agent in violation of a.
on appeal,oldbear contends the district court violated her constitutional rights when it excluded testimony from three defense witnesses who also received tribal funds for personal purposes her convictions should be overturned for lack of evidence and the district court improperly allowed the prosecutor to her regarding another instance of embezzlement,thus causing her to prejudicially invoke her fifth amendment right against.
we agree with the district court that the witness testimony was not relevant to her defense and that the did not unduly prejudice her.we also conclude the evidence was sufficient to prove the charges against her.exercising jurisdiction under,we therefore affirm her convictions.
background 
a.the emergency assistance program 
oldbear was an administrative assistant in an office of the tribes that disbursed funds to tribal members pursuant to an emergency assistance program.the head of the office was roy dean bullcoming,the business committee member for the district of the tribes.
according to official program guidelines,only members of the tribes could receive emergency assistance funds,and funds could be disbursed only as a last resort or for emergency services not otherwise available.roa vol.at.tribal members could apply for emergency assistance only once every quarter,every three months,and the maximum they could receive at any one time was.id.furthermore,funds were available only for certain categories of expenses,including groceries,temporary shelter,utilities,and medical needs.with respect to transportation,only bus fare or other transportation for emergency situations qualified.id.vehicle repairs were ineligible.
oldbear had significant authority over the emergency assistance program in the district,and administered it when bullcoming was unavailable.when disputes arose between district employees and tribal members regarding eligibility for emergency assistance,oldbear frequently resolved them.she processed tribal members emergency assistance applications and printed checks from her office and home computers to fulfill emergency assistance requests.she also had access to a rubber stamp of bullcoming signature,allowing her to sign checks for tribal funds.
unfortunately,the emergency assistance program was rife with abuse.some tribe employees in charge of administering the program did not follow the official guidelines.for example,in the district office,many emergency assistance requests went undocumented,and bullcoming approved them without following formal procedures.this led to arbitrary disbursement of emergency assistance funds and consequent anger among tribal members.
during this time,oldbear used emergency assistance funds to pay for repairs to her personal vehicle.first she spent to replace an engine in her gmc safari van.then she spent for additional repairs to the van.because she knew the two expenditures were quite a bit of an amount approved,she requested the in her son name rather than her own.roa vol.at.
around the same time,oldbear again used emergency assistance funds to pay for her personal transportation,this time purchasing a buick lesabre.oldbear planned to pay for the car in two installments of around,but claimed the lesabre was expensive and her office could afford to do that with the allocation of emergency assistance funds that we had.id.at.for this reason,oldbear asserted,she paid for the car in four installments of around.but in structuring her payments this way,oldbear apparently avoided a provision of the tribal guidelines requiring the business committee to explicitly approve purchases in excess of.
b.the federal investigation 
after receiving numerous complaints about mismanagement of the emergency assistance program,tribal officials referred the matter to federal investigators.as part of the investigation,fbi agents interviewed oldbear on several occasions.during these interviews,she gave conflicting statements.
in a interview oldbear told a federal agent that tribal funds were not to be used to purchase cars,though she cite d situations wherein those funds were used to purchase cars by others,the tribe in particular.roa vol.at.two years later,on september,oldbear stated during a second interview that she was not aware of any vehicles purchased by roy dean bullcoming or the district for anyone.id.at.
in a third interview,however,federal agents once again questioned oldbear about automobile expenditures.this time,the agents brought checks from the district,payable to the car dealership from which oldbear purchased her lesabre.
when presented with the checks,oldbear stated that she did use some of these checks to purchase a buick lesabre.id.at.an agent asked why she had not shared that information during her previous interviews,and oldbear explained that she was worried about her husband finding out about how the vehicle was purchased.id.at.oldbear then asked the agents,are you going to take me to jail now id.
oldbear was subsequently indicted for embezzlement and making false statements to federal agents.
oldbear proffer at trial 
at trial,oldbear defense was based on her state of mind at the time of her charged conduct.she sought to show that because bullcoming approved her expenditures,she believed she was entitled to the funds and thus did not form the requisite intent for embezzlement.to bolster her theory,she planned to call three witnesses who would have testified that they also received emergency assistance funds for personal vehicle repairs.
the government objected,claiming the witnesses testimony was not relevant because it would shed no light on what the emergency assistance guidelines allowed or prohibited.the witnesses,according to the government,were not tribal employees or administrators of the program,but were mere recipients of emergency assistance funds their emergency assistance applications were approved only because of poor bookkeeping,because of somebody who processed their applications for incorrect reasons or deliberately.roa vol.at.this,the government claimed,meant their testimony really does have anything to do with the facts of the case and what the law says is permissible.id.oldbear responded that she believed the testimony was evidence of a habit of the tribe to approve expenditures for personal transportation,and the testimony was therefore admissible under federal rule of evidence.
to aid its decision on the government objection,the court allowed oldbear to conduct a voir dire examination of one of her witnesses outside the presence of the jury.the witness testified she was a member of the tribes and lived in the district.she stated that in,she applied for of emergency assistance funds to pay for car repairs,and bullcoming approved her application.on,the witness admitted she had no knowledge of the official guidelines for the emergency assistance program,having simply filled out a form and presented it.id.at.
after this proffer,the court ruled to exclude the evidence on relevance grounds.the court characterized the testimony as attempting to establish an defense.id.at.the court stated that evidence of a mere deviation from the emergency assistance program guidelines is not probative of any matter that is put in issue and that all we have from the witness is evidence of a mere deviation.id.
the court then confirmed with oldbear counsel that her other witnesses would testify to the same effect,id.at,and extended its ruling to the remaining defense witnesses.
oldbear testimony 
as a result of the district court ruling,the only witness called on behalf of the defense was oldbear herself.she testified that bullcoming was the ultimate on whether someone would receive emergency assistance,and he had approved her expenditures.roa vol.at.she also stated her job required her to drive frequently and she needed transportation to fulfill her work duties.she claimed there was a lot of wear and tear on my vehicle and my husband was always upset that the car was always breaking down.id.at.this,she claimed,was the reason she needed tribal funds to repair her gmc and purchase the buick.
oldbear also claimed the purchase of the buick was not her idea.she asserted that another tribal employee had originally suggested she needed reliable transportation,and the employee had talked to bullcoming about purchasing oldbear a car.id.at.oldbear stated that at the time,i did not know that it was wrong to purchase a personal vehicle using tribal funds.id.at.
on,however,oldbear admitted t here was no emergency justifying her purchase of the buick and repair of the gmc using tribal funds.id.at.she also admitted she could have used vehicles,specifically a tribe van,to fulfill at least some of her work duties.furthermore,shortly after purchasing the buick,oldbear ceased driving it and gave the car to her son.she explained she had done so because she was worried other tribal members would not like that i had a new car.id.at.finally,she conceded she had helped bullcoming obtain his own car with tribal funds a pontiac grand am.nonetheless,she maintained she had done nothing wrong and claimed the federal investigation leading to her indictment was merely a product of tribal politics.roa vol.at.
ii.discussion 
oldbear makes three claims on appeal the district court violated her constitutional rights and the federal rules of evidence when it excluded testimony from three witnesses the evidence was insufficient to prove oldbear committed embezzlement or made a material misrepresentation to a federal agent and oldbear suffered prejudice when the trial court allowed the prosecution to inquire into a prior act of embezzlement,causing her to invoke her fifth amendment right against.
we address each claim in turn.
a.the excluded defense witnesses 
oldbear first claim centers on the three defense witnesses the district court excluded from trial.she argues the district court gutted her defense and thereby denied her due process when it excluded the witnesses testimony.aplt.br.at.in addition,she argues the testimony would have established it was the tribe habit to pay for car repairs,and the testimony was therefore relevant under federal rule of evidence to prove she believed she was entitled to the funds and could not have committed embezzlement.neither argument has merit.
due process 
before discussing the substance of oldbear due process argument,we must address the applicable standard of review.at trial,oldbear did not raise any constitutional objections to the exclusion of her witnesses she instead relied entirely on the federal rules of evidence.thus,we may review her due process claim for plain error only.see united states traxler,cir citing united states battle,cir.and because oldbear briefs on appeal fail to address the plain error standard,she has waived her constitutional argument.united states lahue,cir see also united states solomon,cir.nonetheless,even ignoring her waiver,the claim fails on the merits under plain error review.the court did not commit legal error.
although t he right to present a defense is a fundamental element of due process of law the right to present defense witnesses is not absolute.a defendant must abide the rules of evidence and procedure.united states bautista,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,an evidentiary ruling infringes a defendant due process rights only if the district court violates the federal rules of evidence.id.at.and a district court violates the rules of evidence only if it abuses its broad,only if its ruling is based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact or an erroneous conclusion of law,or the ruling manifests a clear error in judgment.united states dowlin,cir quoting united states jenkins,cir.additionally,to establish a due process violation,oldbear must show she was denied fundamental fairness,that the excluded evidence might have affected the outcome of her trial.see id.quoting richmond embry,cir.for several reasons,the district court neither abused its discretion under the rules of evidence nor denied oldbear fundamental fairness when it excluded the testimony of her proffered witnesses.
first,the district court properly concluded the testimony was irrelevant.though the standard for relevance under federal rule of evidence is quite generous,see united states jordan,cir,proffered evidence must,at minimum,advance the inquiry of some consequential fact to be considered relevant and admissible.see kenneth broun,mccormick on evidence ed.the consequential facts at issue during oldbear trial were whether the tribe authorized her expenditures and whether she possessed the requisite intent to commit embezzlement.oldbear has failed to show how her proffered witnesses testimony affected the degree of probability of these facts,see,or advanced the inquiry with respect to them.
the proffered witnesses were not employees of the tribe and were uninformed about the emergency assistance application process.indeed,during oldbear proffer,her witness admitted having no knowledge of whether the tribe had even enacted any guidelines controlling the disbursement of emergency assistance funds.as the district court noted,the witnesses testimony would merely have established that the emergency assistance program was being managed in a sloppy or corrupt manner.roa vol.at.such evidence could not prove whether the tribe approved oldbear expenditures,nor could it shed any light on her state of mind.see united states hernandez,cir concluding the district court did not err in excluding certain testimony on relevance grounds because the witnesses admitted they had no knowledge of the defendant intent.the district court therefore acted within its discretion in excluding the testimony on relevance grounds.
second,putting aside questions of relevance,the testimony was properly excluded under federal rule of evidence rule grants a district court discretion to exclude even relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by such considerations as unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.macsenti becker,cir.
here,the district court aptly characterized oldbear proffer as an attempt to establish an defense.roa vol.at.essentially,the witnesses would have testified that they,like oldbear,were allowed to use tribal funds to pay for personal transportation expenses.but only oldbear actions and state of mind were material to her guilt.and the fact that others may have been the beneficiaries of improper conduct does nothing to excuse oldbear.the witnesses testimony was a sideshow from which the jury could have gleaned little valuable information other than additional instances of sloppy or corrupt management of the emergency assistance program.see jordan,at noting that a defendant speculative blaming of another alleged perpetrator intensifies the grave risk of jury confusion quoting united states mcveigh,cir.
such testimony only would have served to sidetrack the jury into consideration of factual disputes only tangentially related to the facts at issue.id.at quoting mcveigh,at.moreover,ample evidence in the record showed that tribal officials frequently deviated from the emergency assistance guidelines,making the witnesses testimony,at best,cumulative.see.relevant evidence may be excluded due to considerations of needless presentation of cumulative evidence.the testimony was therefore properly excluded under rule as well.
third and finally,even if the district court somehow erred in excluding the testimony,any error was not a due process violation because it did not affect the fundamental fairness of oldbear trial the excluded testimony,if admitted,would not have create d reasonable doubt that did not exist without the evidence.richmond,at.as explained below,substantial evidence was presented at trial that oldbear knew the program guidelines and yet violated them in spending tribal funds on car repairs and a new car.indeed,she sought to hide her conduct from the tribe by giving the buick to her son instead of driving it herself.three additional witnesses testifying to
