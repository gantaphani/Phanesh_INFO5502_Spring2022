before us are five petitions for writs of mandamus filed by current and former officials and employees of the departments of the interior doi and of justice.each of the petitioners was the subject of an investigation,initiated by the district court,to determine whether that individual should be ordered to show cause why he or she should not be held in contempt for conduct relating to the litigation over the doi handling of monies held in trust for individual indians.
the petitioners originally sought the recusal of district court judge royce lamberth,special master alan balaran,and special joseph kieffer iii based upon alleged ex parte communications they made or received in the course of that litigation.special master balaran has since resigned and we ordered special kieffer removed in cobell norton.the petitioners still seek to recuse judge lamberth and to suppress the reports and recommendations written but not filed with the district court by special master balaran before he resigned.
we now deny the petition to recuse judge lamberth from the pending contempt proceedings because he has stated he did not receive ex parte communications substantively related to those proceedings from either balaran or kieffer,and we have no reason to conclude he abused his discretion by refusing to recuse himself.we do,however,vacate balaran proposed reports and recommendations relating to the contempt proceedings.
background 
the present petitions and the contempt proceedings to which they relate arise from the ongoing litigation over the doi mishandling of the individual indian money trust accounts created for each indian having an interest in certain allotted lands.see cobell,at.because the petitioners are not parties to that case,the facts and the procedural history relevant here may be recounted without laying waste the better part of a forest.
in february the district court held of the treasury robert rubin,of the interior bruce babbitt,and secretary of the interior kevin gover,in their official capacities,in civil contempt for violating two discovery orders issued in the trust reform litigation.see cobell babbitt,d.the district court,with the consent of the parties,then appointed alan balaran to serve as a special master pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure in order to oversee the discovery process in this case.in august the district court additionally authorized balaran to make visits to any location where trust account records are maintained in order to protect such records from destruction or threatened destruction.
in april the district court,again with the consent of the parties,appointed joseph kieffer to serve for one year as a court monitor,with a mandate to monitor and review all of the interior defendants trust reform activities and file written reports of his findings with the court.kieffer was permitted to make and receive ex parte communications with all entities necessary and proper to effectuate his duties.by october kieffer had issued four reports.the reports were unflattering to the doi and prompted the district court to order secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb to show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt of court in their official capacities,cobell,at see also cobell norton,d,contempt referrals.
the order to show cause set out five possible reasons or specifications for holding norton and mccaleb in contempt four were based upon court monitor kieffer reports and addressed the doi noncompliance with court orders relating to trust reform the fifth was based upon a report issued in november by special master balaran concerning the destruction of email records by officials and employees of the doi.see cobell,at see also cobell norton,d,order denying recusal.on september,the district court held both norton and mccaleb in civil contempt of court upon all five specifications.contempt referrals,at,rev,at vacating contempt charge against norton because specifications either did not support such a charge or were based upon conduct of her predecessor,and vacating contempt charge against mccaleb because court did not identify any specific act or omission whatsoever on his part.at the same time the district court referred to balaran the plaintiffs october motion for order to show cause why interior defendants and their employees and counsel should not be held in contempt for violating court orders and for defrauding this court,and their march motion for order to show cause why interior alleged contemnors and their counsel should not be held in contempt for destroying.see order denying recusal,at see also contempt referrals,at.
with respect to the first motion,the court instructed balaran to 
develop a complete record with respect to these individuals and,upon completing his review of these matters,issue a report and recommendation regarding whether each individual should be ordered to show cause why he or she should not be held in civil or criminal contempt of court,or whether other sanctions are appropriate against such individuals.
contempt referrals,at.with respect to the second motion,the court instructed him to issue a report and recommendation regarding the issues raised.id.at.
thereafter,of the named in the september referrals filed motions in the district court to recuse judge lamberth,special master balaran,and special kieffer from participating in the contempt proceedings.they argued that although the communications between the court and its special masters were not improper in the context of the underlying litigation,they were inconsistent with participation in the contempt proceedings because the master and the monitor furnished the court with extrajudicial knowledge about the current litigation.order denying recusal,at.in the alternative,the movants sought discovery regarding the substance of the ex parte communications balaran and kieffer had with employees and officials of the doi and with the district judge.the district court denied the motions in their entirety.
in february,of the movants petitioned this court for writs of mandamus providing the same relief.their petitions were held in abeyance while the court decided cobell,in which we concluded,among other things,that kieffer appointment as special was not valid because it was made over the objection of the defendants.
following our decision in cobell,we ordered further briefing and argument on the current petitions.the plaintiffs in the underlying trust reform litigation then responded to the five petitions,and the petitioners filed a consolidated reply.after oral argument on march,we ordered special master balaran to take no further actions with respect to the reports and recommendations he was going to issue pursuant to the september referrals.on april balaran resigned as a special master both in the contempt proceedings and in the underlying trust reform litigation.with the removal of kieffer and the resignation of balaran from all aspects of the cobell litigation,all that remained of the present petitions were the issues relating to the disqualification of the district court judge or so it seemed.
on april,the plaintiffs filed a suggestion of mootness in part,arguing there is no remaining controversy with respect to balaran.the petitioners,however,responded that the question of balaran recusal is not moot because balaran had completed and,but for our order of march,would submit to the district court his reports and recommendations relating to the contempt charges against the individuals who are not parties to the underlying litigation.therefore,the petitioners claimed any reports balaran completed after the time he should have been recused would be tainted and invalid and should not be released or shared with the district court.
ii.analysis 
in the light of our earlier disqualification of special kieffer,and of special master balaran resignation,two questions remain.first,must the district judge,as the petitioners claim,either a recuse himself or b allow discovery of the ex parte communications he had with kieffer and balaran second,may balaran submit to the court the reports and recommendations he prepared pursuant to the september referrals 
recusal of the district judge 
a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy,to be reserved for extraordinary situations.cobell,at.nonetheless,we will issue a writ of mandamus compelling recusal of a judicial officer where the party seeking the writ demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief.id.at.a party has such a right when a judicial officer has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts,b,or when the judicial officer impartiality might reasonably be questioned,a.
the petitioners argue judge lamberth should have disqualified himself pursuant to b because he acquired personal knowledge of disputed facts through his ex parte communications with kieffer and balaran.according to the petitioners,kieffer time sheets show that he met with the district judge ex parte more than times,for a total of more than hours.similarly,in the motions for recusal they filed in the district court,the petitioners claimed that balaran time records reveal ed seven private meetings with the court for a total of approximately eight hours.see order denying recusal,at.the petitioners also point to ex parte communications balaran had with numerous individuals involved in the cobell litigation,including doi officials and employees,plaintiffs counsel,and the independent counsel investigating secretary norton,which communications they claim balaran later transmitted to the district court in the form of memoranda regarding matters such as compliance with discovery obligations and sanctions.
the respondents reply that the district court fully addressed each of the petitioners claims in its ruling denying their motions for recusal.there the district judge acknowledged having met privately with the court monitor and the special master but rejected any suggestion those meetings constitute a proper ground for his recusal.far from it,the district court stated 
it is not only appropriate but necessary for the court,as principal,to consult with its agents regarding the manner in which they are carrying out their assigned duties t hroughout these regular consultations,the court discussed with the master the general nature of the ongoing tasks that the master was involved with,in order to ensure that the master was responsibly carrying out the duties to which he was assigned.
the district judge cast additional light upon the nature of his meetings in describing his consultations with kieffer 
in the course of a typical meeting,for example,the monitor might inform the court that he planned to travel to new mexico to meet with the office of the special trustee,and receive a briefing about their role in the historical accounting process.or he might explain that he traveled to billings,montana to meet with title records office personnel,examine their hard copy records,and review the pilot trust asset and accounting management system.or he might inform the court that he had been briefed by the deputy commissioner of the bureau of indian affairs about the organization of their office.
id.at.the judge concluded that the subject of these consultations was what the monitor was doing,not what he was finding they did not expose the court to any bare facts relevant to the underlying investigation.id.at.
the petitioners resist that conclusion upon the basis of statements in two opinions the judge rendered in the course of the cobell proceedings.the first is this snippet from the district court opinion of september,t he court is personally aware of the background of the april,meeting,the conversations at that meeting and at the subsequent meetings between the deputy secretary and the court monitor.cobell norton,d.they also point to the district court opinion of september,concerning court monitor kieffer request for compensation,in which the court stated it is sufficient that the court monitor has advised this court regarding his meetings and discussions with third parties and has always informed this court about the nature,extent,and substance of such meetings and discussions upon request.cobell norton,d.
as the respondents point out,the district judge addressed both the quoted statements in his opinion denying the petitioners motion to recuse,in which he concluded,any honest reading of these opinions demonstrates that movants have fundamentally misconstrued the relevant passages.order denying recusal,at.with respect specifically to the september opinion,the judge explained that the deputy secretary of the doi had requested that the court monitor attend the april meeting in order to resolve a dispute between the deputy secretary and the special trustee appointed by the court in the underlying trust reform litigation 
t he only reason that the court knew anything about the april meeting,or the background relating to that meeting,is that the monitor was compelled to present the facts surrounding the request of the deputy secretary to hold the meeting,in order that the court could make an informed decision about whether to authorize the monitor attendance at the meeting.
id.at.so understood,the september opinion does not show that the district judge acquired personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts.
similarly,the district court explained why the single sentence to which the petitioners pointed in the court september opinion,when viewed in its context,is innocuous.the court was not asking the court monitor for substantive information rather it was asking for information relevant to verifying the reasonableness and propriety of the monitor compensation requests.id.at.thus,the district court reasonably explained that in referring to the nature,extent,and substance of kieffer meetings with third parties,the court was concerned with the subject matter,not the actual content,of those meetings.
the petitioners nonetheless claim the district judge ex parte contacts with kieffer and balaran provided him with information that can not be controverted or tested by the tools of the adversary process,quoting edgar,cir.just like the petitioners in edgar,they claim,the petitioners here are completely in the dark about what transpired during the monitor hours of communications with the court.the respondents correctly point out,however,that unlike the district judge in edgar,who declined to state on the record his own memories of what happened in his private meetings with a panel of experts,id.at,the district judge here declared unequivocally he knows of no substantive information that was provided during any of his consultations with kieffer or balaran.order denying recusal,at see also id.at.
still unappeased,the petitioners question whether the district judge should be relied upon to recall what was discussed in so many unrecorded meetings lasting so many hours.but their question reflects a misconception about the assurance required of the judge he need not recall all that was discussed at those meetings he need only recall that the substance of the special masters findings was not discussed.if,as he represents,that was an implicit ground rule for the conduct of those meetings,then the pertinent question is whether it was ever violated.we see no reason for not accepting the judge unequivocal response.
moreover,it is not surprising that the district judge met many times with the special master and the court monitor he had to oversee and to coordinate their efforts on the court behalf during four years of complicated and contentious litigation.keeping a careful inventory of the tasks they had performed appears sensible,particularly in the light of the defendants several challenges to kieffer and balaran requests for compensation.see,cobell,d at defendants request adjustment or reconsideration of kieffer compensation because he failed to provide sufficiently detailed information about the work performed.
because neither the proffered evidence of ex parte meetings between the court and its agents nor the district court september opinions show the judge had acquired personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts,b,we hold the petitioners have failed to show the clear and indisputable right to relief that is required for this court to issue a writ of mandamus.
