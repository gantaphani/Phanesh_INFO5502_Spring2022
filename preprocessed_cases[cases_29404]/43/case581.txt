background 
factual background 
the sni is a sovereign native american tribe who presently reside on two separate land parcels.one is the cattaraugus reservation the other is the allegany reservation.the latter is located near the city of salamanca,in the western part of the state of new york.see banner,fed.cl.at.the allegany reservation,comprising acres,is approximately forty miles long,one mile wide,and tracks the course of the allegany river.
the sni is one of the six nations of the iroquois confederacy iroquois confederacy.the iroquois confederacy,or haudenosaunee,is believed to have been formed in the fifteenth century when the legendary hiawatha and the great peacemaker united the warring eastern native american tribes.prior to european colonization,the iroquois confederacy exercised active dominion over nearly million acres,most of what is now the states of new york and pennsylvania,and was considered the most powerful peacekeeping force of native americans east of the mississippi river.
the land erosion of the iroquois confederacy started with the french and indian war and culminated with the revolutionary war.by the end of the revolutionary war,individual member nations of the iroquois confederacy had lost most of their aboriginal land to european settlers.in october,under the authority of the articles of confederation,the united states and the iroquois confederacy entered into the treaty of fort stanwix,stat.this treaty secured peace between the united states and certain members of the iroquois confederacy,and guaranteed their land holdings in exchange for their relinquishing claim to certain western territory.in,at the urging of president george washington,the united states congress passed the first indian trade and intercourse act,stat,which required federal approval of all land transactions with native american tribes.in,the united states and the iroquois confederacy entered into the treaty of canandaigua,or the pickering treaty,stat.
this treaty,like the treaty of fort stanwix,recognized the land rights of certain members of the iroquois confederacy,including the sni,and was one of the first federal treaties executed between the united states and any native american tribe under the authority of the united states constitution.specifically,the treaty of canandaigua set the boundary of the land of the sni consisting of much of the western part of the state of new york it was bounded by lake ontario just west of rochester,west to the canadian border,south along the niagara river through buffalo,southwest along lake erie to the pennsylvania border,east to the genesee river,and north through geneseo back to lake ontario 
the early saw the growth of major new york cities such as buffalo,and the development of the state of new york canal system,linking lakes erie and ontario to the hudson river.consequently,the state of new york and white settlers continued to attempt to displace the iroquois from populated areas to lands west of the mississippi.in,certain iroquois chiefs entered into a treaty that provided for the sale of iroquois lands and the withdrawal of the iroquois confederacy to land in kansas.see buffalo creek treaty of,stat.however,it was widely believed that the chiefs entered into the treaty only after accepting bribes from land developers,and misappropriating treaty annuities.see,robert porter,strengthening tribal sovereignty,colum.hum.rts.negative reaction to the circumstances surrounding the treaty caused a revolution within the sni,and led to a subsequent compromise treaty.see buffalo creek treaty of,stat.under the treaty,the iroquois were displaced from areas south of buffalo,but among other things,the sni retained ownership of the allegany and cattaraugus reservations.
throughout the mid,white settlers began to settle in a certain area of the allegany reservation,located at the junction of three major railroads.this junction and settlement became what is now known as the city of salamanca in the county of cattaraugus in the state of new york.
early settlers entered into property leases with the sni to remain on the land.prior to,however,a new york state court invalidated the leases because the sni,a native american tribe,did not have congressional authority to lease land.banner,fed.cl.at.congress remedied that legal deficiency by adopting the act of february,stat.act of.the act of,among other things,ratified leases and established that they would be valid until february.id.the act of also provided that the leases were renewable for periods not exceeding twelve years on such conditions as may be agreed upon.id.if the parties could not agree on lease renewal terms,the act of provided that referees of the sni,the leaseholder,and a third person would determine the terms.id.the determination of the referees was to be final and binding on the parties.id.
when the leases expired in,the sni renewed them for twelve years in accordance with the act of.banner,fed.cl.at.with these leases set to again expire on february,congress unilaterally extended the renewal period of the leases to years in the act of september,stat.act of.accordingly,the sni again renewed the leases of approximately individuals for the year term,set to expire on february.id.the average rent on these leases was a nominal amount,between and annually,and did not increase over the entire year term of the leases.
in,anticipating the expiration of these yearleases,the city of salamanca created the salamanca indian lease authority sila to negotiate new leases with the sni.banner,fed.cl.at.in,the appellants in this case authorized sila to negotiate on their behalf the terms of a new lease.id.after twenty years of negotiation,sila and the sni reached an agreement on july,agreement.the agreement provided that the united states and the state of new york would pay a combined million to sni to remedy the severe value inequities of the year leases,the sni would offer new leases to the lessees with a term of forty years,renewable for another forty years at fair market value leases,and the leases would reserve a future determination on ownership of land improvements.id.
congress enacted the act of to effectuate the agreement,because the future economic success of the sni is tied to the securing of a future lease agreement.a.the act of provides for the payment to the sni of million from the federal government and million from the state of new york,provided that the sni both ratified the agreement and offered the leases to the lessees.furthermore,congress enacted the act of because it recognized that the united states had breached its fiduciary obligation arising from the unique trust relationship with native american tribes.see,county of oneida oneida indian nation,d.
by entering into a system of treaties,agreements,and statutes,a unique trust relationship has been created between the united states and native american tribes.the united states has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust,and its management of native american affairs must be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standard.see seminole nation united states.acting as a fiduciary,the united states authorized monetary compensation to the sni,not for gratuitous reasons,but to correct the breach of its trust responsibility when it unilaterally imposed the leases on sni lands by the act of.finally,the act of provided exclusive jurisdiction to the united states district court for the western district of new york over any action to contest its constitutionality or
