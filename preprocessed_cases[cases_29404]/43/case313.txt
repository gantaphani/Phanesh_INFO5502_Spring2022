in this case we are presented with a question of first impression who bears the burden of proof when a defendant is charged with occupation of forest service land in violation of b and k must the prosecution prove that the defendant does not have individual aboriginal title,or is the claim an affirmative defense we hold that the occupant claiming individual aboriginal title bears the burden of demonstrating such title as an affirmative defense.applying that standard,we conclude that the defendant in this case failed to meet this burden,and we affirm the judgment of the district court upholding the defendant convictions.
congress has charged the secretary of agriculture with regulat ing the occupancy and use of the national forests by rules and regulations.any person violating such regulations may be tried before a magistrate judge and,if convicted,punished.id.under the secretary regulations,no one may possess occupy,or otherwise us e national forest system lands for residential purposes without a authorization,or as otherwise authorized by federal law or regulation.b.section k similarly prohibits the u se or occupancy of national forest system land or facilities without authorization when such authorization is required.
there are effectively three ways that a claimant may be authorized to occupy national forest lands.first,a claimant may receive authorization.see.second,she may claim authorization under the forest allotment act,which permits indians who are not entitled to an allotment on any existing indian reservation,or for whose tribe no reservation has been provided to apply for an allotment.the secretary of the interior may grant such allotment if the secretary of agriculture finds that the land is more valuable for agricultural or grazing purposes than for the timber.see.third,she may claim individual aboriginal title to the land under the authority of the supreme court decision in cramer united states.see united states dann,cir.
the karuk people have occupied the oak bottom area of the klamath national forest in northern california from time immemorial.karen lowry,a karuk indian,has resided on property located in the oak bottom area since approximately.lowry has not received a authorization,nor has the secretary of interior granted lowry an indian allotment of land on this site.oak bottom encompasses a large area,including a forest service campground and work center,a acre parcel known as indian allotment,and lowry current residence,comprising about five acres.indian allotment,which is approximately fifty yards from lowry residence,was granted to oak bottom jack,one of lowry relatives,and has passed to relatives other than lowry.lowry,nupas,resided in the oak bottom area at least until.her,mahkhawa da,resided in a log cabin located on the property now occupied by lowry.the dates of mahkhawa da residence are unclear,but it appears that she was forced off the property by white miners at some point in the early.mahkhawa da later returned to the property after the miners left.
lowry paternal grandmother,bessie tripp,was born in the area in the.bessie was not raised on the land currently occupied by lowry,but in a house up at the upper end.bessie left the area to attend school and subsequently got married,though she returned on the weekends and during some summers.in,bessie took up permanent residence on indian allotment.lowry resided with bessie on indian allotment until lowry was eleven years old,when she was placed in foster care.lowry occasionally returned to oak bottom to visit bessie,although lowry did not take up residence on the property she currently occupies until about april,after bessie death on december.
in the late,the forest service accused lowry of trespassing on forest service lands and encouraged her to obtain an indian allotment for the land she occupied.she applied for an allotment in on july,a forest service supervisor determined that the land was not available for allotment because of its location within the wild and scenic river corridor of the salmon river.the supervisor also noted several other reasons that an allotment could not be granted,including lowry statutory ineligibility and her failure to substantiate the agricultural uses of the land.when lowry requested that the supervisor permit her to reopen the proceedings,the supervisor refused,citing the lack of any new information that would result in issuance of the allotment.california indian legal services sent the supervisor a notice of appeal on lowry behalf,which the supervisor denied because the governing regulations did not permit an administrative appeal in lowry case.lowry sought no further relief.
on august,the government charged lowry with occupancy of forest service land in violation of b and k prior to trial,the government filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence that the government denial of lowry application for an indian allotment was arbitrary and capricious.the magistrate judge granted this motion and precluded evidence related to lowry application.before the magistrate judge,lowry claimed a right to aboriginal title under cramer,because her family had resided in the area since at least the late.
on august,after a trial,the magistrate judge found lowry guilty of unlawful occupancy.he rejected lowry argument that she was authorized to occupy the land,holding that authorization is an affirmative defense as to which lowry had not met her burden of proof.the magistrate judge also considered lowry challenges to the denial of her allotment application.ultimately,he determined that the court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to to consider the denial of the allotment application and further found that lowry was not deprived of due process because she had voluntarily opted not to pursue an action in the district court following the denial.he then issued a sentence that required lowry to leave the disputed land by april.
on july,the district court issued a detailed opinion affirming lowry conviction,but on different grounds.the district court held that authorization was an element of the offense for which the government bore the burden of proof.however,the court then held that any error caused by the magistrate judge incorrect rule was harmless because the government had met its burden of proof.the district court also affirmed the magistrate judge exclusion of the evidence of lowry indian allotment application and the determination that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to consider lowry challenge to the forest service denial of that application.
lowry appeals her convictions for unauthorized residential occupancy of land in a national forest,see b,and for unauthorized use or occupancy of land or facilities in a national forest,see k.she raises two issues.first,lowry contends that the magistrate judge erroneously shifted the burden of proof and that the government failed to prove each element of the crime.specifically,she alleges that the government has the burden of proving that she did not have authorization based on a claim of individual aboriginal title to occupy the oak bottom area.second,lowry asserts that the magistrate judge precluded her from presenting a defense by excluding evidence that the denial of her indian allotment application was arbitrary and capricious,because,had the application been granted,would have provided an alternate means of authorization to occupy the land.we address each of lowry arguments in turn.
lowry claims that she has individual aboriginal title to the national forest service lands she now occupies.preliminarily,she disputes the burden of proof applied by the magistrate judge as to the authorization requirements in b and k.lowry contends that the government has the burden to prove all elements of the crime as defined in the regulations,and to do so,it must establish a she lacked authorization to occupy the land in question.consequently,she asserts that the magistrate judge erred by requiring her to establish that she held individual aboriginal title to occupy the land.with respect to the district court ruling,lowry does not challenge the burden of proof applied,but disputes that the government provided sufficient evidence to negate her authorization to occupy the land.the government contends that authorization operates as an affirmative defense,such that an occupant must raise and prove some right to possession 
our analysis is complicated by the fact that although lowry challenges the magistrate judge rule,she agrees with the one subsequently applied by the district court.the magistrate as the trial the allegedly erroneous burden of proof and convicted lowry.the district court then rejected the magistrate judge allocation of the burden of proof and adopted the rule endorsed by lowry,but nonetheless upheld the conviction.consequently,although lowry disagrees with the magistrate judge in full,she only disagrees with the district court in part lowry does not assert that the district court rule was plainly erroneous,but that the district court application of that rule was plainly erroneous.to assess lowry claim,however,we must first consider the allocation of the burden of proof as to the authorization requirement in b and k.only then can we turn to whether that burden was met.because we reject the rule applied by the district court,we do not ultimately reach the merits of lowry challenge to the district court ruling.
sections b and k do not explicitly allocate the burden of proof.the regulations make it a misdemeanor to occupy forest service land for residential purposes without a authorization,or as otherwise authorized by federal law or regulation.b.the magistrate judge held that lowry claim to individual aboriginal title was an affirmative defense and that she had the burden of going forward with these affirmative defenses,since they were not elements of the case in chief.the district court disagreed,citing its prior decision in united states lex,d,and held that the phrase without a authorization or as otherwise authorized by federal law was an element of the crime charged.
we have not explicitly addressed the allocation of the burden of proof of the authorization requirement in b and k.in fact,it appears that the burden of proof question is one of first impression in the circuit courts.because the absence of a authorization or indian allotment is not disputed here we do not address the burden of proof as to these potential grounds for authorization instead,we consider the burden of proof as to the specific basis raised is,lowry claim of individual aboriginal title.
we have previously considered whether a claim of individual aboriginal title satisfied the requisite authorization in b in a case very similar to lowry.in united states kent,cir,we addressed whether kent,a karuk indian,had an individual aboriginal right to occupy land within the klamath national forest.we did not explicitly address the burden of proof as to authorization,but we did speak in terms that appeared to put the burden on the defendant to establish individual aboriginal title.we phrased the defendant position as a defense,stating that a t trial,the defendant defended her occupancy of this parcel of land as protected by individual aboriginal title,id.at,and we required the defendant to demonstrate such title,observing that individual aboriginal title may be established when an indian can show that she or her lineal ancestors continuously occupied a parcel of land,as individuals,and that the period of continuous occupancy commenced before the land in question was withdrawn from entry for purposes of settlement.id.at emphasis omitted citing united states dann,cir.we held that the defendant claim fails to meet th ose requirements.id.although we did not expressly so hold,kent strongly implied that the defendant has the burden of proving a claim of individual aboriginal title.
lowry argues that kent does not govern her case and that the phrase in b,without a special use authorization,or as otherwise authorized by federal law or regulation,merely negates an element of the crime and may not be shifted to the defendant.see walker endell,cir.we disagree.it is a settled rule that an indictment or other pleading founded on a general provision defining the elements of an offense,or of a right conferred,need not negative the matter of an exception made by a proviso or other distinct clause,whether in the same section or elsewhere,and that it is incumbent on one who relies on such an exception to set it up and establish it.mckelvey united states.we do not think that the without clause in b negates an element of the crime.the charge from congress to the secretary of agriculture is to regulate the occupancy and use of the national forests and to preserve the forests thereon from destruction.this the secretary has done by prohibiting the t aking possession of,occupying,or otherwise using national forest system lands for residential purposes,b,and the u se or occupancy of national forest system land or facilities.k.the government bears the burden of proving possession,use or occupancy of the land.the statute prohibits possession or occupation generally,subject to specific exceptions authorized by law.the without clause simply recognizes the existence of such exceptions to the general prohibition against residing in the nation forests.we hold that the defendant bears the burden of proving these exceptions.
this approach is consistent with our approach in kent,in which we stated that the person claiming individual aboriginal title must demonstrate continuous individual occupation that commenced before the land in question was withdrawn from entry for purposes of settlement.see kent,at.placing the burden on the claimant to prove authorization is also consistent with other cases in a variety of areas in which we have addressed statutory exceptions.in united states freter,the statute at issue provided for the punishment of a ny person in charge of a facility from which a hazardous substance is released,other than a federally permitted release,who fails to notify immediately the appropriate agency,cir quoting b emphasis and alterations in original.the defendant argued that the government was required to prove,as an element of the offense,that its release was not federally permitted.he argued that the other than clause was an element of the offense because it was not set forth in a distinct statutory section,but is stated in a sentence describing the elements of the offense,and is set off only by commas.id.at.we rejected this argument,stating that t he doctrine we apply is not limited to statutes in which the relevant language is in a separate section,or in which the relevant language is in a separate sentence from that describing the elements of the crime,and derives from the rule that a defendant who relies upon an exception to a statute made by a proviso or distinct clause,whether in the same section of the statute or elsewhere,has the burden of establishing and showing that he comes within the exception.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.see also moore united kingdom,cir as the appellant is relying on an exception within the text of the treaty,the burden is on him to show that the exception applies.united states gravenmeir,cir construing o b as an affirmative defense.once the claimant proves that she comes within the exception,then the government must prove the inapplicability of the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states bruce,cir holding that indian status is an affirmative defense to a charge under,and that once the burden of production is satisfied,the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion.
aside from its theoretical support,our approach makes practical sense in this case given the nature of lowry claim to individual aboriginal title,it would be far easier for the defendant to present evidence of her indian ancestors and their history of land occupancy to establish that the exception applies than for the government to do so.freter,at see also gravenmeir,at that the government could prove the negative in this case,however,does not mean that it would be easier for the government to do so.united states hester,cir it is far more manageable for the defendant to shoulder the burden of producing evidence that he is a member of a federally recogniz
