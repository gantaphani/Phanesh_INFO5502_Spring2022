the opinion filed august,and appearing at cir,is withdrawn.pursuant to general order.a,an opinion is filed contemporaneously with this order.with the withdrawal and substitution of the opinion,the petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc are denied as moot.subsequent petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc may be filed.federal rule of appellate procedure now controls.
this case concerns whether an indian tribe can exercise criminal jurisdiction over a person who is not a member of the tribe,but who is an enrolled member of another indian tribe.
this is an appeal from a denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the petitioner,russell means,an enrolled member of the indian tribe,seeks to prevent the navajo nation from criminally prosecuting him in navajo tribal court for an incident that occurred on the navajo reservation.
in december,means allegedly threatened and battered his then,who is an omaha indian,and allegedly threatened another man,a navajo indian.the offenses are misdemeanors under the navajo code,with potential maximum penalties of days in jail and a fine for each threat and days in jail and a fine for the battery 
means moved in the navajo tribal court to dismiss the tribal proceedings.he argued that the tribal court had no jurisdiction over him because he was not a navajo.means testified that he is an enrolled member of the tribe of indians and a permanent resident of porcupine,a town in south dakota on the pine ridge sioux indian reservation.means lived on the navajo indian reservation from to when he was married to a woman who was a,indian.means moved back to the sioux reservation in,and the alleged offenses occurred later when means was visiting the navajo reservation.
means testified that the difference between an and a navajo is analogous to the difference in nationalities between an american and a french person.although means lived on the navajo reservation for a decade while married to his,he could never become a member of the navajo tribe because membership required at least one quarter navajo blood means does not speak navajo,and as a,he had difficulty obtaining employment because of tribal preferences given to navajos and restrictions that make it difficult for a to find employment,participate in civic life,and license a business.
the navajo nation trial court denied means motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.means appealed to the navajo nation supreme court which also denied his motion.the decision of the navajo supreme court explains that the navajo reservation covers about square miles,making it larger than many states and foreign countries over indians of other tribes live within the navajo nation,so domestic violence cases involving indians arise from time to time.the navajo supreme court explained that the considerable amount of violence arising from alcohol,when combined with the size and ethnic inclusiveness of the reservation,generates a need to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all who enter the navajo nation,not just navajo indians.the navajo supreme court decision says that while there are preferences for navajos in employment and contracting,they are not absolute barriers,and that means could have qualified for jury service in the navajo tribal courts had he been registered to vote in arizona.the navajo supreme court also noted that,because means had married a navajo,he was a hadane,or,during his residence on the reservation,connected by rights and obligations to his wife clan.as the navajo supreme court notes,however,becoming a hadane does not make one a navajo.
after exhausting his remedies in the navajo courts,means petitioned the united states district court for a writ of habeas corpus to enjoin the tribal courts from proceeding further in his case.the district court denied means petition,and he appeals.
all the questions before us are purely matters of law and arise on appeal of the district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus under,so we review de novo 
jurisdiction 
means has exhausted his tribal court remedies regarding jurisdiction,but he has still not been tried for the alleged threats and battery.nonetheless,means remains subject to conditions of pretrial release.means can not have any contact with his former or go within yards of his former home.means also must appear as ordered by the navajo trial court or face and additional punishment for any failure to appear.the district court therefore concluded that means was in custody for purposes of habeas jurisdiction under justices of boston municipal court and hensley municipal court the parties have not challenged that conclusion before us,and,although we are required to examine jurisdiction sua sponte we agree with the district court.the charges against means remain pending in the navajo nation trial court,and although the navajo nation and means have stipulated to a stay in the trial court until this appeal is decided,the navajo nation states that it fully intends to prosecute means if jurisdiction is resolved in its favor.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
ii.the amendments to the indian civil rights act 
in oliphant suquamish indian tribe the supreme court held that indian tribes do not possess criminal jurisdiction over in oliphant,the suquamish tribe had prosecuted two,one for racing down a highway and colliding with a tribal police car,and another for assaulting an officer and resisting arrest the tribe did not claim that congress had given it authority to exercise jurisdiction,but rather that the tribe had an inherent sovereign authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction over incidents that occurred on its authority that congress had never taken away the supreme court disagreed and held that,although indian tribes enjoy some sovereign powers,their domestic,dependent nature distinguishes them from the governments of foreign countries it also held that citizens of the united states who are not indians can not be subjected to indian tribal sovereignty for criminal purposes 
following oliphant,the supreme court suggested in united states that the inherent sovereignty of a tribe might extend only to its own enrolled members then,in duro reina the court explicitly held that the retained sovereignty of the tribe as a political and social organization to govern its own affairs does not include the authority to impose criminal sanctions against a citizen outside its own membership.duro reasoned that,as american citizens indians were entitled not to be subjected to the criminal authority of sovereigns of which they were not and could not become full members 
in congress responded to indian tribes concerns about the holding in duro by amending the indian civil rights act to say that the powers of of indian tribes means the inherent power of indian tribes,hereby recognized and affirmed,to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all indians.all indians plainly includes indians who are not enrolled members of the particular tribe exercising jurisdiction.it is significant for the equal protection discussion below,however,that the amendments do not cover all persons who may be ethnically indian.in addition to extending tribal criminal jurisdiction to all indians,the amendments make it plain that the definition of indian is the same as indian in the major crimes act 
the amendments define indian as any person who would be subject to the jurisdiction of the united states as an indian under section,title,if that person were to commit an offense listed in that section in indian country to which that section applies.the statute referred to,the major crimes act,says it applies to a ny indian.in united states antelope enrolled indians prosecuted under the major crimes act argued that they were denied equal protection of the laws,because,had they not been indians,they would have been prosecuted under more favorable state law.the court described the federal scheme as one in which e xcept for the offenses enumerated in the major crimes act,all crimes committed by enrolled indians against other indians within indian country are subject to the jurisdiction of tribal courts.the court rejected the equal protection challenge because respondents were not subjected to federal criminal jurisdiction because they were of the indian race but because they were enrolled members of the coeur tribe.the court pointed out that federal jurisdiction under the major crimes act does not apply to many individuals who are racially to be classified as indians.the court noted in dictum that lower courts had held that enrollment was not an absolute requirement for federal jurisdiction in some circumstances,but because respondents were enrolled,the court was not called upon to decide whether enrollment was an absolute requirement and therefore intimate d no views on the matter.
taken together,the amendments,the major crimes act,and antelope mean that the criminal jurisdiction of tribes over all indians recognized by the amendments means all of indian ancestry who are also indians by political affiliation,not all who are racially indians.for that reason,subjecting means to tribal court jurisdiction but not,is,as we explain further below,not a racial classification.
means argues that the amendments were outside the powers of congress because they were an unconstitutional delegation of federal governmental authority and because they went beyond the congressional power authorized under the indian commerce and treaty clauses.indian tribes are not bound by the united states constitution in the exercise of their powers,including their judicial powers so federal judicial power over nonmembers could not be delegated to them 
following the amendments,means theory was tested in other cases.double jeopardy cases examined whether the statutory language,recogniz ing and affirm ing the power of tribes over nonmember indians rather than delegating it,avoided double jeopardy problems when both a tribe and the federal government punished someone for the same conduct.if the tribe was exercising its inherent sovereign authority,an indian defendant could be punished in both the tribal court as well as in federal district court under the dual sovereignty doctrine if the tribe was exercising delegated federal power,then the federal government would be punishing the indian twice for the same conduct,which it could not do under the double jeopardy clause more broadly,after the supreme court in duro had concluded that the tribe had not retained sovereign power over nonmember indians the question was whether congress even had the ability to recognize an inherent power 
these questions raised by means statutory argument have,subsequent to the original briefing in this case,been definitively answered by the supreme court.united states holds that congress does possess the constitutional power to lift the restrictions on the tribes criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians as the statute seeks to do.as for whether the tribe exercise of criminal jurisdiction was a delegated power or an inherent sovereign power,the court held,with certain reservations,that the constitution permits tribes,as an exercise of their inherent tribal authority,to prosecute nonmember indians.thus,except for the questions reserved in lara it is settled law that,pursuant to the amendment to the indian civil rights act,an indian tribe may exercise inherent sovereign judicial power in criminal cases against nonmember indians for crimes committed on the tribe reservation.
iii.equal protection and due process 
equal protection 
lara expressly declined to answer the question of whether the tribal criminal prosecution of a nonmember indian would violate the due process and equal protection guarantees of the fifth amendment means argues that by recognizing tribal criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians,the amendments violate the equal protection guarantees of the fifth amendment and the indian civil rights act because they discriminate against him as an indian,subjecting him to adverse treatment on account of his race.
means equal protection argument has real force.he argues that,although the amendments permit the navajo tribe to criminally prosecute its own members and members of other indian tribes,the navajo tribe can not constitutionally prosecute whites,blacks,asians,or any other who are accused of crimes on the reservation this makes means case different from,say,an alaskan who threatens and batters his in los angeles,and then is prosecuted by the state of california.not only can an alaskan become a californian,but the state of california,although sovereign,nonetheless is bound by the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.although he is an indian,means is nonetheless a citizen of the united states,entitled to the full protection of the united states constitution.but unlike states,when indian tribes exercise their sovereign authority they do not have to comply with the united states constitution as an,means can never become a member of the navajo political community,no matter how long he makes the navajo reservation his home.
despite the force of means argument,we nonetheless conclude that the weight of established law requires us to reject means equal protection claim.morton holds albeit in the distinguishable context of indian employment preferences by the federal government that federal statutory recognition of indian status is political rather than racial in nature.means argues that mancari is undermined by adarand constructors,pena but both the supreme court and our court have continued to rely on mancari and we are bound to follow it under the doctrine of agostini felton 
mancari held that an employment preference for indians in the bureau of indian affairs was not invidious racial discrimination in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment because it is not even a racial preference.l egislation that singles out indians for particular and special treatment is in a special category because of the historical relationship of the united states with the indians and the indian commerce clause and a s long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of congress unique obligation toward the indians,such legislative judgments will not be disturbed.the preference at issue passed this rational tie standard,because it was reasonable and rationally designed to further indian.
we conclude that a law subjecting nonmember indians to tribal criminal jurisdiction in indian country passes the rational tie standard of mancari.first,recognizing criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts over nonmember indians furthers indian.the navajo reservation,larger than many states and countries,has to be able to maintain order within its boundaries.the amendments to the indian civil rights act were meant to protect indians and others who reside in or visit indian country against lawlessness by nonmember indians who might not otherwise be subject to any criminal jurisdiction.as the navajo supreme court notes,there are a significant number of indians who are not navajos but live on the navajo reservation because of intermarriage.it is a matter of ordinary experience that many people are not at their best when their marriages break up,so misdemeanor jurisdiction over nonmember indians is rationally related to indian in an area where rapid and effective tribal responses may be needed.the navajo nation has a sophisticated body of published laws,and an experienced court system in which trained trial and appellate judges adjudicate thousands of cases per year.if means was not subject to prosecution in the navajo courts,he could not be prosecuted in any court.the state of arizona,like the majority of states,does not have jurisdiction to try indians for offenses committed on a reservation and there is no federal court jurisdiction because means alleged offenses do not fall within the major crimes act 
second,the reason congress can recognize the power of a tribe to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember indian like not over a nonmember,who like means might become involved in a domestic the same reason given by the supreme court for the employment preference in mancari indian tribal identity is political rather than racial,and the only indians subjected to tribal court jurisdiction a
