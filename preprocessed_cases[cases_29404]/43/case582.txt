this case involves a claim for damages attributable to the government mismanagement of indian timber resources.the two plaintiffs are the confederated tribes of the warm springs reservation of oregon and warm springs forest product industries,a tribal corporation that engages in timber transactions on behalf of the confederated tribes.for convenience,we refer to the plaintiffs collectively as the tribes.following a trial on the tribes complaint,the court of federal claims found that the government had mismanaged the tribes timber resources in several ways.the court,however,held that the tribes were not entitled to damages on the issues that they have appealed to us.because the trial court erred in the analysis that led it to conclude that the tribes are foreclosed from obtaining a monetary recovery based on the acts of mismanagement complained of on appeal,we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
the warm springs indian reservation was created in by a treaty between the united states and the tribes of middle oregon.in,congress resolved a longstanding dispute about the boundaries of the warm springs reservation by enacting the mcquinn act,stat,which added an area of forest land known as the mcquinn strip to the reservation.the mcquinn act specified that timber within the mcquinn strip would be managed by the bureau of indian affairs bia as trustee for the tribes and that timber harvested from the strip would be sold at auction but could not be sold for export until after january.
as part of its management responsibilities,the bia developed a management plan defining maximum anticipated timber harvests for the mcquinn strip.the plan was designed to implement the bia statutory requirement for sustained yield management of timber lands that the bia managed as trustee.see.
by,the total amount of timber harvested from the mcquinn strip exceeded the amount that was to be harvested under the management plan.accordingly,at the tribes request the bia suspended timber harvests on the mcquinn strip.the suspension had two purposes to ensure prudent forest management by conforming to the maximum planned harvest,and to save the timber on the mcquinn strip until the export restrictions ended in.the tribes and the bia anticipated that the export price for the timber would be higher than the domestic as much as twice as that postponing the harvest would therefore produce much more income for the tribes.
during the winter of,windstorms caused severe damage to timber on the mcquinn strip,blowing down and damaging many trees.because of the risk that insects and disease would destroy the timber value of the downed and damaged trees,the tribes and the bia agreed that the damaged timber should be harvested immediately,despite the general moratorium on mcquinn strip logging.
in the summer of,the bia generated a plan to sell the damaged timber,referred to as blowdown timber.the bia plan included harvesting limited amounts of healthy,standing timber,referred to as green timber,to the extent necessary to provide access to the blowdown timber.the tribes timber committee approved the proposed plan,which called for the harvest of board feet of timber.in so doing,the tribes reiterated their desire to save as much timber as possible until after.
the bia issued a sale prospectus for the blowdown timber contract.after the prospectus was issued but before bids were received,the tribes objected to the amount of green timber that was included in the prospectus.accordingly,shortly before the sale,the bia removed board feet of timber from the designated areas covered by the proposed contract.vanport manufacturing,won the timber contract and began harvesting on august.
the bia controlled the timber accounting procedures during the harvest.truckloads of timber were divided into two categories merchantable loads and cull loads.payment for the merchantable loads,which contained clearly merchantable logs,was based on the size and type of each log.for the cull loads,which contained lumber,the tribes received only a small amount based on the overall weight of the removed material.the logging company representatives designated a load as either cull or merchantable lumber as the logs were loaded onto each truck.
two methods were used to measure the amount of timber on each load.merchantable loads were rollout scaled.in the logs are taken off the truck and counted individually based on length,circumference,and type of tree.cull loads were scan scaled.in the material remains on the truck,and the scaler walks around the truck to determine that no merchantable logs are present.additionally,the tribes identified records of loads,designated as cull,for which was performed after an initial.for each load cull or merchantable the scaler generated a truck ticket detailing the results of that scale.the sum of all the truck tickets formed the accounting records that provided the basis for payment to the tribes.
to verify the accuracy of the initial scaling,the bia used.in,a certain percentage of the loads are diverted to scalers who perform independent.these independent scalings are compared to the corresponding truck tickets to detect any systemic mistakes occurring in the initial scalings.in,bia guidelines suggested five percent of the loads,although a bia expert testified that the five percent guideline had not been used since the.in the blowdown sale in this case,was actually performed on less than one percent of the merchantable loads.
following the sale,the tribes filed suit in the court of federal claims,contending that the bia had mismanaged the sale in a manner that substantially reduced the tribes income from the harvested timber.the mismanagement,the tribes contended,constituted a breach of the bia fiduciary obligations and entitled the tribes to recover damages from the government for the diminution in value of the proceeds from the timber harvest.
the tribes presented several theories of fiduciary breach by the bia,three of which they continue to press on appeal.first,they asserted that too much green timber was included in the sale.according to the tribes,that timber should have been preserved for harvest and sale after,when it could have been sold in the export market for a much higher price.second,they complained that as a result of serious errors in the bia accounting procedures,the reported amounts of timber harvested substantially undercounted the actual amount harvested from the designated areas.third,they asserted that trees were taken from areas that were not designated in the timber contract,which constituted timber trespass as defined in the timber contract and relevant oregon statutes.
at trial,the tribes offered stump cruise data to show a disparity between the amount of timber taken and the amount for which they were paid.in a stump cruise,researchers count the number,size,and type of stumps in a subsection of a harvest area.based on that sample,an estimate is made of the total amount of timber taken from the entire harvest area.the tribes stump cruise resulted in an estimate of the amount of harvested timber that was substantially higher than the amount reflected in the bia records of the harvest.the bia performed its own stump cruises,which resulted in estimates of the amounts of harvested timber that closely matched the bia harvest records.
after the trial,the court issued an opinion in which it agreed with the tribes that the bia had mismanaged the timber sale in several respects.first,the court found that the bia erred by permitting the harvest of healthy as well as damaged trees.in doing so,the court found,the bia did not take into account the fact that the annual allowable harvest for the mcquinn strip had already been exceeded and that tribes goal was to save as much timber as possible until after,when it could be sold in the export market.the court noted that bia officials admitted that including green timber in the harvest was a poor decision,and that although instructions to remove green trees from the sale were passed down to bia employees,green timber that had been marked improperly was still harvested.while the court noted that some green timber had to be removed to ensure safety and to gain access to damaged timber,the court found that those instances were relatively few.the bia acted imprudently,the court concluded,when it did not remove the majority of the green timber from the salvage sale.
notwithstanding its finding that the bia breached its fiduciary duty to the tribes by improperly including green timber in the blowdown sale,the court held that the tribes were not entitled to damages for that breach.the court explained that the tribes had suffered no compensable loss because the tribes had received the full domestic price for the green trees that were improperly cut.the court added that it could only speculate on what prices in the export market might have been at some hypothetical time after january,when the trees could have been sold for export,and that we have no way of knowing whether they would have cut the timber in or at some later date.
with respect to the tribes contention that the amount of timber removed during the harvest was substantially undercounted,the court disagreed.as to that issue,the court ruled that the tribes bore the burden of showing that they did not receive the full benefit of the timber harvested and that although they raised some issues and inconsistencies with regard to the bia management and the procedures it used to account for the tribes timber,they did not prove that a substantial amount of timber was missing.
with respect to the tribes timber trespass claim,the argument that the bia improperly allowed the contracting logging company to cut trees that were not properly designated as part of the sale,the court understood the tribes claim to rest on an oregon statute that required proof of willful misconduct on the part of the government.because the court found that the government conduct with respect to the timber trespass claim was not willful,the court denied the tribes any recovery on that claim.
on appeal,the tribes renew each of the three claims discussed above.other claims disposed of by the court have not been appealed.the government has not challenged the court finding that the bia breached its fiduciary duty to the tribes by permitting green timber to be cut during the blowdown sale,but it argues that notwithstanding the breach of fiduciary duty,the tribes have not established a basis for an award of damages.
pursuant to statute and regulation,the united states exercises comprehensive control over the management and harvesting of timber on indian reservations.as a result,the united states has a fiduciary responsibility to manage those timber resources based upon a consideration of the needs and best interests of the indian owner and his heirs,a,and the proceeds from the sale of timber harvested from the reservations must be used for the benefit of the indians or transferred to them,see id.the secretary of the interior is directed to adhere to principles of forestry on all indian forest lands under government supervision,see united states mitchell,d,and to manage the forested reservation land so as to ensure that the indians receive the benefit of whatever profit the forest is capable of yielding,white mountain apache tribe bracker,d.tribes that own timber managed by the federal government enjoy the right of an injured beneficiary to seek damages for alleged breaches of the fiduciary obligations that are defined by the statutes and regulations that give the federal government the responsibility to manage indian timber resources for the indians benefit.see mitchell,at.
under trust law generally,a beneficiary is entitled to recover damages for the improper management of the trust investment assets.in determining the amount of damages for a breach of the trustee fiduciary duty with regard to investments of the trust property,courts attempt to place the beneficiary in the position in which it would have been absent a breach.see roth lumber,cir donovan bierwirth,cir william fratcher,scott on trusts,ed george gleason bogert,the law of trusts and trustees.with respect to the government management of indian timber resources,tribes whose timber resources are mismanaged are entitled to any from the income they would have received from their forests and lands resulting from the breach.see mitchell united states,aff,d.in the case of a breach consisting of a sale of timber assets for less than their full value,the tribes are entitled to recover the difference between the actual proceeds and the greatest appropriate revenue which should have been obtained.id.
although the trial court held that the united states breached its fiduciary duty by selling the green timber prematurely,the court denied the tribes any recovery for that breach on two grounds the tribes received full value for the green trees cut improperly,the tribes received the full domestic price for those trees and the court could only speculate on what prices in the export market might have been at some hypothetical time in the future.
neither of those grounds justifies refusing to award any damages for the improperly harvested green timber.to deny recovery on the ground that the tribes recovered the full value of the trees in the unfavorable market in which they were sold ignores the nature of the breach,which consisted of harvesting and selling the trees on the domestic market rather than waiting to harvest and sell them for export.it also disregards the legal principle,recognized by the court of claims in the mitchell case,that indian tribes in a case of improper sales of timber assets are entitled to recover the proceeds of the sales which should have been made under proper merely the actual proceeds of actual sales.mitchell,at.
the court was also wrong to refuse to award damages on the ground that any award would be speculative.it is a principle of long standing in trust law that once the beneficiary has shown a breach of the trustee duty and a resulting loss,the risk of uncertainty as to the amount of the loss falls on the trustee.the second circuit applied that principle in setting forth the proper damages analysis in donovan bierwirth,at 
where several alternative investment strategies would have been equally plausible,the court should presume that the funds would have been used in the most profitable of these.the burden of providing that the funds would have earned less than that amount is on the fiduciaries found to be in breach of their duty.any doubt or ambiguity should be resolved against them.

in light of the trial court findings that the bia failure to prevent the logging of substantial amounts of green timber constituted a breach of the bia fiduciary duty to the tribes and that the tribes and the bia had agreed to postpone the harvesting of the green timber until after january,when that timber could be sold at higher prices on the export market,there is no question that the tribes have established both a breach and some loss.the only question is whether the proof of loss was too speculative to support any recovery at all,as the trial court held.under the foregoing principles of trust law,the tribes should not have borne the risk of uncertainty as to precisely how much the green timber would have sold for if it had not been prematurely harvested.that is particularly true on the facts of this case,where resolving the issue of damages does not require
