beneficiaries of individual indian money trust accounts,as a class,sued the secretary of the interior and other federal officials,in their official capacities,for breach of fiduciary duty in the management of those accounts.in an earlier appeal,we affirmed the district court holding that the officials,who serve as for the federal government,had breached their fiduciary duties,and we remanded the case to that court for further proceedings.cobell norton,cobell vi.
in april,with the consent of the parties,the district court appointed joseph kieffer iii as court monitor and charged him to monitor and review all of the interior defendants trust reform activities and file written reports of his findings with the court.in april the court reappointed kieffer as court monitor,this time over the defendants objection.on september,the court held gale norton,secretary of the interior,and neal mccaleb,assistant secretary of the interior for indian affairs,in contempt of court,elevated kieffer to the status of special,and scheduled further proceedings.the department contends that in so doing the district court not only erred,it took control of functions constitutionally reserved to the executive branch.we agree that the district court erred,and we reverse kieffer reappointment and the citations for contempt.we lack jurisdiction,however,to consider the department contention that the court has overstepped its authority.
background 
we recounted the long history of the government trust responsibilities to native americans in cobell vi,and we therefore provide only an abbreviated version of that history here.pursuant to the general allotment act of,ch,stat.formerly codified at et,lands that had previously been set aside for indian tribes were allotted to individual indians in fixed amounts surplus lands were opened to settlement.the act created a system in which allotted lands would be held in trust by the united states for years or more,during which period an individual account individual indian money account or iim account would be created for each indian with an interest in the allotted lands.the united states would manage the lands for the benefit of the allottees until the expiration of the trust period,at which time each allottee would be issued a fee patent.the indian reorganization act of,ch,stat.codified as amended at et,ended the practice of allotment but extended indefinitely the trust period for lands.through the operation of these two statutes,therefore,the united states came to hold an estimated million acres of land as trustee for,and with a fiduciary duty to,individual indian beneficiaries.in the congress enacted the indian trust fund management reform act,stat.codified as amended at et act,recognizing these responsibilities and identifying some of the government duties to ensure it meets them.the plaintiffs lawsuit alleges a breach of these responsibilities.
the duties of the united states as trustee have been delegated to the secretary of the interior and the secretary of the treasury,see,each of whom is assigned specific tasks.also relevant to this appeal is the office of the special trustee within the department of the interior and subordinate to the secretary,which was created by the act to oversee the trust reform activities of the department.id.
previous proceedings 
the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in.in the district court divided the litigation into two phases.phase i was to address fixing the system,that is,reforming the management and accounting of the iim trust,and phase ii would concern correcting the accounts by performing a historical accounting of the iim trust accounts.in the district court held secretary of the interior bruce babbitt,assistant secretary kevin gover,and secretary of the treasury lawrence summers had breached their fiduciary duties.the court issued a declaratory judgment to that effect and remanded the case to the interior and treasury departments for them to bring themselves into compliance with the law,and to take certain steps the court deemed necessary to provide an accounting of the iim trust.cobell babbitt,d,cobell v.in order to assure the defendants compliance,the court retained jurisdiction and ordered the defendants to file quarterly status reports setting forth and explaining the steps that defendants have taken to rectify the breach.id.at.finally,the court certified its decision for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.id.
in february we affirmed the order of the district court the government indeed had breached its fiduciary duty.among many other things,it does not know the precise number of iim trust accounts that it is to administer and protect,and it does not know the proper balances for each iim account.cobell vi,at.although we determined that the district court had mischaracterized some of the defendants actions for instance,their failure to retrieve and retain all information concerning the iim trust that is necessary to render an accurate accounting as independent violations of a fiduciary duty,rather than as support for the court ultimate conclusion that appellants have unreasonably delayed the discharge of their fiduciary obligations to iim beneficiaries,at,we upheld the district court ultimate conclusion as fully justified.id.at.we also held the district court remand of the matter to the agencies and its retention of jurisdiction were appropriate remedies.id.at.
b.the orders on appeal 
while cobell vi was pending before us and thereafter,the department and its officers took a number of steps relevant to this appeal.beginning in march and continuing apparently to the present,the department filed the quarterly reports required by cobell v.in april the department published a notice in the federal register proposing a method for performing an historical accounting and seeking public comment thereon and in december it chose statistical sampling as the method it would use.
in april the district court appointed kieffer as court monitor.as noted,the department consented to this appointment,regarding which it expressed the hope that this will in fact be a positive step forward so that resources can be more directed towards trust reform and less directed towards litigation.the order appointing kieffer stated he would serve for at least year from this date.upon order of the court,after comment or objection thereto by the parties,his term of service may be extended for additional terms.in april the district court propose d to extend kieffer term of service for at least an additional year.the department objected to kieffer reappointment unless several conditions were met.the district court accepted some but not all those conditions,and reappointed kieffer.
four days later april kieffer,with authorization from the district court,attended a meeting with deputy secretary of the interior steven griles,the special trustee,and other departmental officials the plaintiffs were not represented at the meeting.the district court found this was one of many internal doi meetings kieffer attended the meeting was called at griles request it was a heated meeting that resolved nothing.the district court also found that at the meeting the court monitor discussed with interior officials his concerns about the way they were doing their jobs concerns that he was subsequently to report to the district court.the district court characterized kieffer actions as an effort to set the stage to convince the parties attending the meeting to find some way to work together.
on june the department moved the district court to revoke kieffer appointment as,and to clarify the role of,the court monitor.the department argued that its previous objections presaged the april meeting,at which,the department claimed,kieffer demonstrated his intention and his ability to assert powers constitutionally reserved to the executive branch of the government.
meanwhile the monitor reports,which were,to say the least,unflattering to the doi,had prompted the district court to order secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb,both of whom had taken office in,to show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt of court in their official capacities on five specifications,namely 
failing to comply with the court order of december,to initiate a historical accounting project.
committing a fraud on the court by concealing the department true actions regarding the historical accounting project during the period from march,until january.
committing a fraud on the court by failing to disclose the true status of the taams project between september and december.
committing a fraud on the court by filing false and misleading quarterly status reports starting in march,regarding taams and bia bureau of indian affairs data.
committing a fraud on the court by making false and misleading representations starting in march,regarding computer security of iim trust data.
cobell norton,d,contempt opinion.the district court held a bench trial on the contempt charges.
on september,the district court issued the three orders that are the subject of this appeal.first,the court issued an order that,among other things,held secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb in civil contempt of court.cobell norton,d contempt order.the contempt order was accompanied by and explained in the contempt opinion,released simultaneously.second,the district court issued a memorandum and order denying the defendants motion to revoke kieffer appointment as court monitor.cobell norton,d monitor order.finally,the court issued an order appointing kieffer to serve as special p ursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.cobell norton,wl,at,dist.lexis,at special order.
in the contempt order,the court addressed each of the five specifications of contempt.with regard to the first count,the court described norton and mccaleb failure to comply with its earlier order as litigation misconduct.in each of the other specifications,the court found norton and mccaleb to have committ ed a fraud on the court.d at.the district court used some harsh words in the contempt opinion,expressing its dissatisfaction with the defendants conduct.see,d at the department of interior is truly an embarrassment to the federal government in general and the executive branch in particular.the individual indian beneficiaries deserve a better than the secretary of interior id.at the court is both saddened and disgusted by the department intransigence.of particular note are the district court statement that secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb can now rightfully take their place alongside babbitt and formerassistant secretary gover in the pantheon of unfit,id.at,and the court invitation to secretary norton or any other individual at the department who feel s that as a result of th e court ruling they are unable or unwilling to perform their duties to the best of their ability to leave the department forthwith.id.at.
turning to the question of relief,the court refused the plaintiffs request that it appoint a receiver to take over the iim trust.the court did,however,determine that the relief it had ordered in cobell v remanding the case to the agencies to carry out their duties as instructed was and is insufficient,id.at,and it therefore contemplated granting further injunctive relief.id.at.to that end the court scheduled further proceedings,which it called the phase trial.id.in order to prepare for the phase trial,the court required interior to file a plan for conducting a historical accounting of the iim trust accounts and a plan for bringing themselves into compliance with the fiduciary obligations that they owe to the iim beneficiaries.contempt order,d at.the court also permitted the plaintiffs and the department of the treasury to file such plans,and permitted each party to respond to any other party plan.id.
in the monitor order,the court denied the department june motion to revoke the appointment of court monitor kieffer.the court found that kieffer participation in the april meeting was not inappropriate or beyond his authority because it was pursuant to the secretary of the interior own request and in conformance with the orders of the court.d at.finally,in the special order,the court sua sponte elevated kieffer to the position of special kieffer retained his duties as court monitor and as special master assumed new responsibilities for the management of discovery.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb appealed all three orders of the district court.they argue that the district court overstepped the bounds of judicial authority by declaring them unfit and by seizing control of the processes for creating and implementing plans for indian trust reform.they also argue that the district court erred when it held them in contempt of court,denied their motion to terminate kieffer tenure as court monitor,and appointed him special.
ii.analysis 
we understand the government to object to three distinct aspects of the district court orders in this case the court alleged overreaching through its assum ption of control over functions within the doi the court decisions regarding the status of kieffer and the court holding secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb in contempt of court.before we may reach these issues,however,we must confirm our jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.
jurisdiction 
the department argues we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.in the alternative it seeks a writ of mandamus.
section a provides that the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from i nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.as the supreme court stated in carson american brands,d,a provides jurisdiction over not just an injunction,but over any order having the practical effect of an injunction if the order threatens a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence and is of such a nature that it can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.an order by a federal court that relates only to the conduct or progress of litigation before that court ordinarily is not considered an injunction and therefore is not appealable under a.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d.
a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy,to be reserved for extraordinary situations.id.at.at.mandamus does not lie unless the petitioner right to relief is clear and indisputable,and there is no other adequate means by which the petitioner may attain the relief it seeks.in re sealed case.
with these legal principles in mind,we consider our jurisdiction over each of the department three claims.
judicial overreaching 
the department argues we have jurisdiction over its claim of judicial overreaching pursuant to a because the district court rulings imposed an injunction or had the practical effect of an injunction or worked a modification of a declaratory judgment that the district court has since held to be indistinguishable from a mandatory injunction.the gravamen of the department argument,however expressed,is that the district court orders both require action and implicitly enjoin the secretary future exercise of discretion.
we disagree.as the plaintiffs demonstrate,the orders and the opinion were full of sound and fury,but they signified very little to be done by the doi.in the contempt order the court appointed a special,d at,and required the defendants,in anticipation of the phase trial,to file with the court a plan for conducting a historical accounting of the iim trust accounts and to file a plan for bringing themselves into compliance with their fiduciary obligations.id.at.it also held secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb in contempt,id.at,and ordered them to pay the expenses the plaintiffs had incurred for the contempt trial.id.at.
none of this had the practical effect of an injunction.the contempt order compels the department only to prepare for the phase proceedings by making certain filings with the court.as such,we think it more akin to an order relat ing only to the conduct or progress of litigation,gulfstream aerospace,at.at,than to an injunction.
the department also points to the district court statement that it will order new relief following the phase trial rather than simply remand ing the matter back to the agency,contempt opinion,d at,as evidence that the court intends to take over the management of trust reform.such a claim is premature.to be sure,the district court stated it has determined that it will grant further injunctive relief,id.at specifically,a structural injunction,id.at presumably upon completion of the phase trial.any such injunction,once issued,would be appealable under a.but no such injunction has yet issued.at worst,the district court has threatened to take action that,according to the department,would violate the separation of powers.until the district court takes such action,however,we are without power under a to review its decisions.
anticipating that the court might lack jurisdiction to hear the present appeal,the department asks us in the alternative to issue a writ of mandamus providing equivalent relief.but we may not do that,either.the department challenge does not meet the criteria for the writ in particular,the department has not shown that an appeal from the district court eventual entry of an injunction,if and when that occurs,would not provide it with adequate relief.
kieffer appointment as monitor and as special 
the department concedes that t he court order elevating the court monitor to the judicial role of special master would not generally be immediately appealable.nevertheless the department claims that kieffer appointment is subject to interlocutory review both because it forms an integral part of the relief the court believed was required and because it has the effect of an injunction.these claims are essentially a restatement of those we have already rejected as part of the department claim of judicial overreaching.we see no need to revisit them under a new heading.
the orders appointing kieffer first as court monitor,and later as special and the order denying the department motion to revoke kieffer appointment as court monitor do,however,present an appropriate occasion for mandamus.first,as we explain below in part,the department entitlement to relief is clear.second,there is no other way for the department to obtain effective relief on its claims that kieffer should not have been appointed special,nor permitted to continue as court monitor.
the ordinary route to relief from an adverse interlocutory order is to appeal from the final judgment.when the relief sought is recusal of a disqualified judicial officer,however,the injury suffered by a party required to complete judicial proceedings overseen by that officer is by its nature irreparable.as the supreme court has explained 
the remedy by appeal is inadequate.it comes after the trial and,if prejudice exist,it has worked its evil and a judgment of it in a reviewing tribunal is precarious.it goes there fortified by presumptions,and nothing can be more elusive of estimate or decision than a disposition of a mind in which there is a personal ingredient.
berger united states.see in re united states,cir a case involving a motion for disqualification is clearly distinguishable from those where a party alleges an error of law that may be fully addressed and remedied on appeal.the parties agree that after his elevation to special status,kieffer was serving as a judicial officer.
although this court does not seem to have ruled upon the propriety of seeking the recusal of a judicial officer by petition for a writ of mandamus,every circuit to have addressed the issue has found it proper.the first through seventh circuits and the tenth circuit have each issued the writ for this purpose,see in re boston children first,cir in re ibm,cir in re antar,cir in re sch.asbestos,cir in re rodgers,cir in re faulkner,cir in re aetna cas.sur,cir en banc in re hatcher,cir in re edgar,cir nichols alley,cir,and the eighth,ninth,and eleventh circuits have suggested they would do so in an appropriate case.see pfizer,lord,cir holding mandamus is an appropriate avenue to review recusal decision but denying the writ on the facts presented cordoza pac.states steel,cir similar in re,cir denying writ seeking review of recusal decision because petitioners have not carried their burden of showing their right to issuance of a writ of mandamus.the federal circuit looks to the law of the regional circuit in which the officer to be recused sits.baldwin hardware franksu enter,in re solex robotics.unpublished.we join the unanimous view of our sister circuits and hold that we will issue a writ of mandamus compelling recusal of a judicial officer where the party seeking the writ demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief.
we also find it appropriate to issue the writ in order to clarify that the district court exceeded its authority when it reappointed kieffer as court monitor over the department objection.as we discuss below,the department right to relief is clear,and the injury it alleges interference with the internal deliberations of a department of the government of the united states can not be remedied by an appeal from the final judgment.in re sealed case,at.
contempt findings 
the district court styled the contempt in which it held the appellants civil in nature.in this circuit an order holding a party in civil contempt in an proceeding is not appealable as a final order.byrd reno,per curiam.in contrast,c riminal contempt judgments are immediately appealable pursuant to because they result from a separate and independent proceeding to vindicate the authority of the court and are not a part of the original cause.marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.as we explain below in part,the district court findings of contempt are functionally criminal rather than civil in nature.therefore,we have jurisdiction over this appeal from the contempt aspects of the contempt order.
court issues 
we turn now to the merits of the department claim the district court erred by retaining kieffer in this case.specifically,the department argues both that the court had no authority to reappoint kieffer as court monitor over its objection,and that kieffer was disqualified from serving as special due to his personal knowledge of the case and the resulting appearance of partiality.
court monitor 
kieffer was appointed court monitor on april,with the consent of the parties,for a term of one year.in april the government objected to kieffer reappointment unless certain conditions were placed upon the scope of his powers.on april,the district court reappointed him without regard to one of those conditions.the department claims this was a clear error.we agree.
the district court claimed authority to appoint the monitor in the first instance based upon the consent of the parties,and the court inherent powers.the government claims it did not consent to kieffer reappointment,however,and neither the district court nor the plaintiffs point to any case or other authority suggesting a district court has inherent power to appoint a court monitor.indeed,in their brief the plaintiffs,tellingly,do not address the department argument that the district court could not appoint a court monitor over its objection.at oral argument the plaintiffs instead rested upon the assertion that the doi consent to kieffer original appointment as court monitor was temporally unlimited and irrevocable.
the plaintiffs position is untenable on the facts of this case.first,the district court did not propose or purport to appoint kieffer permanently,so the doi had no occasion to consent to his having an unlimited tenure.as we noted earlier,the order appointing him stated that kieffer would serve for at least year from this date.upon order of the court,after comment or objection thereto by the parties,his term of service may be extended for additional terms.the plaintiffs suggestion that this order,which explicitly grants the parties the right to object to kieffer reappointment,actually served as consent to his unlimited tenure,is absurd.we conclude the department effectively withheld its consent to the court reappointment of kieffer as monitor,which brings us to the question whether the district court has inherent power to appoint a monitor without the consent of the party to be monitored.
a judicial claim to an inherent power is not to be indulged lightly,lest it excuse overreaching t he judicial power actually granted to federal courts by article iii of the constitution of the united states,and the customs and usages that inform the meaning of that phrase.such a claim,therefore,must either be documented by historical practice,see,miner atlass,d rejecting contention that federal court sitting in admiralty has inherent power to order taking of depositions for discovery because there was no historical record of courts ordering such depositions link wabash,d noting court inherent power to dismiss suit for failure to prosecute dates to blackstone commentaries and has long gone unquestioned,or supported by an irrefutable showing that the exercise of an undoubted authority would otherwise be set to naught.see,chambers nasco,d it has long been understood that certain implied powers must necessarily result to our courts of justice from the nature of their institution,powers which can not be dispensed with in a court,because they are necessary to the exercise of all others all writs act,a granting federal courts power to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.often the two go hand in hand.see,fisher pace.historically and rationally the inherent power of courts to punish contempts in the face of the court without further proof of facts and without aid of jury is not open to question.this attribute of courts is essential to preserve their authority and to prevent the administration of justice from falling into disrepute.in this case,however,we find nothing but the district court assertion it has inherent power to appoint a monitor,which can hardly be.therefore,we hold the district court does not have inherent power to appoint a monitor at least not a monitor with the extensive duties the court assigned to kieffer over a party substantial objection,here the government objection that the appointment violated the separation of powers.as the foregoing sentence conveys,our holding is a narrow one,tethered to the peculiar facts recounted below.
in this case the court monitor was charged to monitor and review all of the interior defendants trust reform activities and to report to the district court on any matter he deem ed pertinent to trust reform.the court authorized the monitor to engage in ex parte communications,and required the doi to facilitate and assist the monitor,to provide him with access to any offices or employees to gather information,and to pay his hourly fees and expenses.in short,the monitor acted as an internal investigator,not unlike a departmental inspector general except that he reported not to the secretary but to the district court.
although the department initially consented to this arrangement,after a year experience it conditioned its renewed consent upon a narrower and more specific definition of the monitor role the doi sought to limit the scope of the monitor investigation to steps taken by the department to rectify the breaches of trust declared by the court or steps taken that would necessarily delay rather than accelerate the ultimate provision of an adequate accounting.it later augmented its objection to the monitor role,arguing that the monitor investigation interfered with the department deliberative process privilege under hinckley united states,describing privilege as protecting materials that are both predecisional and deliberative see also morgan united states.i t was not the function of the court to probe the mental processes of the secretary in reaching his conclusions if he did what the law required,and that the monitor otherwise intruded unduly into the function of the executive branch.we need not decide,however,whether the department objection was meritorious it is enough for present purposes that the objection was colorable.
regardless whether the district court has any inherent authority to appoint an agent to monitor the conduct of a party in litigation before it,it was surely impermissible to invest the court monitor with extrajudicial duties over the government objection.the monitor portfolio was truly extraordinary instead of resolving disputes brought to him by the parties,he became something like a party himself.the monitor was charged with an investigative,role that is unknown to our adversarial legal system.when the parties consent to such an arrangement,we have no occasion to inject ourselves into their affairs.when a party has for a nonfrivolous reason denied its consent,however,the district court must confine itself and its agents to its accustomed judicial role.
although the plaintiffs did not bring it to our attention,we are aware of the practice of a federal district court appointing a special master pursuant to rule to supervise implementation of a court order,especially a remedial order requiring major structural reform of a state institution.see,ruiz estelle,cir.prison reform,amended in part,reh g denied in part on other grounds,cir halderman pennhurst state sch,cir en banc reform of institution for the mentally retarded,rev on other grounds,d gary state of louisiana,cir same id.collecting cases ross sandler david schoenbrod,democracy by decree.putting aside the question whether those cases shed any light whatsoever upon the propriety of a federal court authorizing its agent to interfere with the affairs of another branch of the federal government,we think the present case goes far beyond the practice that has grown up under rule.
ruiz illustrates the limits of the mandate a district court may permissibly give its agent.there the district court,having found the defendant state department of corrections subjected inmates to cruel and unusual conditions,entered an injunction and appointed a special master,assisted by several monitors,at,to monitor implementation of the relief ordered.id.at.the special master was given unlimited access to the defendants premises and records as well as the power to conduct confidential interviews with staff members and inmates.id.at.on appeal,the state argued the appointment was improper because there was no exceptional condition warranting it,as required by rule.in rejecting that argument,the court of appeals approved the special master mandate,namely,to report on the department compliance with the district court decree and to help implement the decree,thereby assum ing one of the plaintiffs traditional roles.id.at.
the role of the special master in ruiz was not nearly as broad as the role of the monitor in this case.there the master was specifically instructed not to intervene in the administrative management of the department and not to direct the defendants or any of their subordinates to take or to refrain from taking any specific action to achieve compliance.id.at.most important,the court of appeals clarified that the special master and the monitors were not to consider matters that go beyond superintending compliance with the district court decree,thereby assuring the special master would not be an advocate for the plaintiffs or a roving federal district court.id.
the last requirement highlights the problems with the role of the monitor in this case,and with his appointment.the monitor was not limited to superintending compliance with the district court decree,but was instead ordered to monitor and review all of the defendants trust reform activities,including the defendants trust reform progress and any other matter kieffer deems pertinent to trust reform.nor could the monitor have been limited to enforcing a decree,for there was no decree to enforce,let alone the sort of specific and detailed decree issued in ruiz and typical of such cases.see sandler schoenbrod,above,at referring to court decrees that are as thick as phone books.the case had been remanded to the department for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of the district court in order t o allow defendants the opportunity to promptly come into compliance.cobell v,d at,halderman,at allowing special master to administer implementation of injunction and noting that m asters are peculiarly appropriate in the implementation of complex equitable decrees which require ongoing judicial supervision.in this case,the district court appointment of the monitor entailed a license to intrude into the internal affairs of the department,which simply is not permissible under our adversarial system of justice and our constitutional system of separated powers.accordingly,the district court should not have reappointed the court monitor on april,over the department objection.
in its june motion to revoke kieffer appointment and clarify the role of the court monitor,the department among other things complained that kieffer actions at the april,ex parte meeting had created an appearance of partiality.the district court not only rejected the department arguments,it supplemented kieffer role by appointing him special.again the department claims this was clear error.again we agree.
the relevant standard is to be found at a a judicial officer must be disqualified from any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,that is,questioned by one fully apprised of the surrounding circumstances.sao paulo state of the federative republic of brazil am.tobacco,d per curiam.it is clear,notwithstanding the plaintiffs objections,that in this circuit the ethical restrictions of apply to a special master.jenkins sterlacci.so much for the law for the facts we rely solely upon the district court own recitation,which establishes that kieffer prior role and personal involvement in this case as court monitor would cause a reasonable person to doubt his ability to remain impartial while serving as special master.
for instance,kieffer was permitted to make and receive ex parte communications with all entities,monitor order,d at,and in fact engaged in numerous ex parte communications with officials of interior.id.at.moreover,in the course of his investigation kieffer acquired information upon the basis of which he apprised the deputy secretary that there was a dispute developing between the secretary and the special trustee regarding the appropriate role of the special trustee.id.at.the court monitor was also present at the heated ex parte meeting on april,about which he reported to the court that defendants were unwilling to fully accept the role of the special trustee.id.at.at that meeting,kieffer expressed his concerns to the deputy secretary about the actions of the secretary and the deputy secretary regarding the special trustee.id.in particular,he apprise d the deputy secretary in the presence of the special trustee of the obvious risks faced by the defendants in this litigation and the additional concerns he had regarding some of the secretary views,in an effort to set the stage to convince the parties attending the meeting to find some way to work together rather than continue the internecine warfare patently obvious in their own dueling memoranda.id.at.
the district court account of these events demonstrates that kieffer had a settled opinion about what the department should and should not do on remand to comply with the order of the district court,which opinion he developed in his extrajudicial role as court monitor with access to the internal deliberations of the department regarding the lawsuit.the district court account also demonstrates that kieffer opinion was based in part upon ex parte communications received in his capacity as monitor.these facts so clearly cast a shadow over kieffer impartiality that the district court abused its discretion in appointing kieffer to be special master in addition to monitor.
the plaintiffs argue the april meeting was not extrajudicial because it took place with the knowledge and approval of the district court and of the parties.that does not change the key fact the district court appointed kieffer to a judicial role in a case in which he had significant prior knowledge obtained in his role as a court monitor,on the basis of which he had formed and expressed opinions of continuing relevance to the litigation.a newly appointed judge may not hear a case in which he previously played any role.see b a judge shall recuse himself w here he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel,adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy aba model code of judicial conduct canon e b a judge is disqualified when the judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy,or a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter,or the judge has been a material witness concerning it.similarly here,kieffer experience as court monitor disqualified him from later assuming a judicial role in this case.accordingly,the order appointing kieffer to be a special must be vacated.
contempt specifications 
the district court held secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb in civil contempt of court for having engaged in litigation misconduct,to wit,failing to comply with the court order of december,and for having,in each of four ways,committ ed a fraud on the court.contempt order,d at.the department claims the district court erred in two respects by holding norton and mccaleb in contempt based upon conduct of their predecessors in office,and without finding either officer had disobeyed a clear order of the court.the department also argues the district court factual findings do not support its conclusion that there was a fraud on the court.in response the plaintiffs argue the district court correctly applied the law to the facts.we agree with the department,although our analysis is somewhat different.
nature of the contempt 
a contempt proceeding is either civil or criminal by virtue of its character and purpose,not by reason of the trial judge so denominating the proceeding.int l union,united mine workers bagwell,d gompers bucks stove range.civil contempt is ordinarily used to compel compliance with an order of the court,bagwell,at.at,although in some circumstances a civil contempt sanction may be designed to compensate the complainant for losses sustained.id.at.at.by contrast,criminal contempt is used to punish,that is,to vindicate the authority of the court following a transgression rather than to compel future compliance or to aid the plaintiff.id.at.at.
in this case the nature of the contempt is obscured by the lack of any clear sanction.although it did,under the heading further relief,expand the scope of the plaintiffs discovery,contempt opinion,d at,the district court itself noted that 
much of the relief granted is not dependent on the court conclusion that the defendants committed several frauds on the court.rather,the court has fashioned much of the relief granted today such as future proceedings and the appointment of a special master simply because of the current status of trust reform.
id.at.in fact,other than an award of expenses the plaintiffs incurred in the contempt trial,d at which can not be considered relief for the underlying contempt the only relief granted that could conceivably be based upon the findings of contempt are the initiation of the phase proceeding and the appointment of the special master.on its face,that is,the contempt order appears to find the defendants in contempt,and then to impose no sanction.
clearly,however,the district court did not intend its decision to be without effect.the exceedingly strong words it used in finding the defendants in contempt in particular its statement that secretary norton was unfit suggest the court intended the adjudication and accompanying opinion to serve as a reprimand to secretary norton and assistant secretary mccaleb.indeed,the defendants reasonably characterize the decision as having impose d opprobrium upon them.norton and mccaleb in particular believed the district court adjudication to be so injurious to their reputations that they engaged private counsel and sought to intervene as appellants and to present arguments in their respective personal capacities.we see no reason a district court may not impose a reprimand as the sole san
