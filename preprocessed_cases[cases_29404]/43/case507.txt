on rehearing en banc 
in the san juan pueblo tribal council enacted a ordinance and also adopted a lease containing similar provisions.these actions were challenged by the instant declaratory judgment and injunction suit brought by the national labor relations board nlrb or the board and local union of the western council of industrial workers the union as an intervenor.after rejection of this suit by the district court,the board and the intervening union brought this appeal from the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the pueblo.
the relevant facts are undisputed.san juan pueblo is a indian tribe located in new mexico.most of its members live on tribal lands that are held in trust by the united states for the pueblo.the pueblo is governed by a tribal council,which is vested with legislative authority over tribal lands.through leases,the pueblo leases certain portions of its tribal land to businesses as a source of generating tribal income and as a means of employment for tribal members.the origins of this case lie in a labor dispute involving a lumber company operating on leased lands since august.the history of the leases as well as the dispute,which has now been settled,is described in the district court opinion.nlrb pueblo of san juan,d.
on november,the san juan pueblo tribal council enacted tribal ordinance which it amended on february.the ordinance in substance is a measure.the pueblo asserts that the ordinance is a valid exercise of its inherent sovereign authority.id.at.as amended,the ordinance prohibits the making of agreements containing clauses covering any employees,whether tribal members or not.section a of the ordinance reads 
no person shall be required,as a condition of employment or continuation of employment on pueblo lands,to i resign or refrain from voluntary membership in,voluntary affiliation with,or voluntary financial support of a labor organization ii become or remain a member of a labor organization iii pay dues,fees,assessments or other charges of any kind or amount to a labor organization iv pay to any charity or other third party,in lieu of such payments any amount equivalent to or a portion of dues,fees,assessments or other charges regularly required of members of a labor organization or v be recommended,approved,referred or cleared through a labor organization.
supplemental brief on rehearing en banc nlrb at.the ordinance prohibits employers and unions from entering into agreements requiring employees to maintain membership in or pay dues to a union,called union security agreements.the pueblo lease with the lumber company similarly provides 
lessee will not enter into any contract or other arrangement which would require a tribal member to be a member of a union,league,guild,club,or association hereinafter collectively referred to as union in order to be entitled to all of the priorities to be accorded him pursuant to this property lease.tribal members will not be required to join or maintain membership in,or pay any dues or assessments to,any union in order to be hired and benefit from the priorities stated in this lease.
brief on appeal for the nlrb,at.the priorities mentioned in the lease refer to terms of employment for employees who are tribal members.id.at.
on january,the nlrb filed the instant suit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico by its complaint for preliminary and permanent injunction and for a declaratory judgment,alleging that the ordinance and lease provisions,insofar as they prohibit compliance with agreements,are preempted by federal law.specifically,the board argued that these provisions are invalid under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,art.vi,cl.due to preemption by the national labor relations act,et hereinafter the nlra.leave to intervene was granted to the union upon the parties stipulation.
the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order on november,granting the pueblo motion for summary judgment and denying such motions of the nlrb and the union.nlrb pueblo of san juan,d.on appeal,a divided panel affirmed the district court decision.we granted petitions of the nlrb and the union for rehearing en banc which we have held.we now affirm the district court decision.
athe pueblo sovereign authority to regulate labor relations and inherent limitations on that authority 
the central question before us is whether,in light of the united states constitution supremacy clause,and congress plenary power over indian affairs the nlra prevents the pueblo from enacting a law or entering into a lease with provisions making prohibitions similar to those in laws we believe the question of the validity of the lease provisions here is subsumed within the larger question of the validity of the ordinance.because this is a question of law,we review the district court order de novo.olivet cemetery ass salt lake city,cir.the burden falls on the nlrb and the union,as plaintiffs attacking the exercise of sovereign tribal power,to show that it has been modified,conditioned or divested by congressional action.southland royalty navajo tribe,cir.as noted in southland royalty,a mbiguities in federal law have been construed generously in order to comport with tribal notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence.id.at.
in their challenges to the district court decision and our panel ruling,the nlrb and the union argue that a of the national labor relations act,a,clearly protects the rights of a union and an employer to enter into union security agreements meeting the requirements of a.moreover the nlrb and the union maintain that congress intended by the force of the wagner and taft hartley acts to preempt state and local regulation of union security clauses with the narrow exception of b,b,allowing only states or territories to prohibit otherwise permitted union shop provisions.appellant opening brief at.we disagree and instead are convinced by the pueblo argument that,as an indian tribe,it retains the sovereign power to enact its ordinance,and to enter into the lease agreement with provisions,because congress has not made a clear retrenchment of such tribal power as is required to do so validly.
we begin by noting what the district court also took pains to point out,namely,that the general applicability of federal labor law is not at issue.nlrb san juan pueblo,supp d at.furthermore,the pueblo does not challenge the supremacy of federal law.the ordinance,as amended,does not attempt to nullify the nlra or any other provision of federal law.the suggestion that tribes,including those that have already enacted laws might enact ordinances allowing precisely what generally applicable federal law prohibits finds no support in this record.furthermore,there is no danger that the pueblo and the state of new mexico might enact conflicting laws,since state laws are of no effect in federal enclaves such as indian reservations,see lord local union,ibew,cir finding state law inapplicable in federal enclave in spite of b of the nlra,cert.denied,d new mexico fed of labor city of clovis,indirectly noting the inapplicability of state laws in federal enclaves.
rather,the central question here is whether the pueblo continues to exercise the same authority to enact laws as do states and territories,or whether congress in enacting a and b of the nlra,a and b,intended to strip indian tribal governments of this authority as a sovereign.pursuant to the supremacy clause,the federal government has the power to preempt state and municipal authority in a particular field.wardair canada,florida dep t of revenue,d.likewise,congress in the exercise of its plenary power over indian affairs may divest indian tribes of their inherent sovereign authority,united states wheeler,d,a point the pueblo does not dispute.
indian tribes are not states for constitutional purposes,and the preemption analysis is not exactly the same.see reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir t ribes are not states under osha and thus,osha does not preempt tribal safety regulations in the same manner in which it preempts state laws.we need not delineate precisely the scope of federal preemption of tribal laws here,however.a canon of indian law states that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.montana blackfeet tribe,d.the supreme court has also explained that this canon means that doubtful expressions of legislative intent must be resolved in favor of the indians.south carolina catawba indian tribe,d.the canon applies to other statutes,even where they do not mention indians at all.eeoc cherokee nation,cir construing the age discrimination in employment act.
in resolving questions of preemption of state law,the test is one of congressional intent.wardair canada,at.in order to find preemption of tribal laws,similarly it is necessary to determine whether congress intended to divest the san juan pueblo of its power as a sovereign to pass laws.the burden to show such congressional intent to divest the pueblo of its power to enact its ordinance and to enter into the lease agreement rests upon the union and the nlrb.see eeoc cherokee nation,cir requiring party arguing preemption to carry burden of presenting clear evidence of congressional intent southland royalty navajo tribe,cir tribe general authority as sovereign included power to tax and the burden on those attacking that power was to show that it had been modified,conditioned or divested by congressional action.we find no showing here that satisfies the burden of the board and the union to demonstrate congressional intent to preempt the pueblo authority to enact the ordinance and enter into the lease agreement.in sum,from and b of the nlra as they now stand,we find that the board and the union are reduced to arguing that there is implied preemption of tribal sovereign authority to enact a ordinance or to enter into the challenged lease agreement.however implied preemption of such sovereign authority does not suffice.iowa mutual ins.laplante,d t he proper inference from silence is that the sovereign power remains intact.
indian tribes are neither states,nor part of the federal government,nor subdivisions of either rather,they are sovereign political entities possessed of sovereign authority not derived from the united states,which they predate.see mcclanahan,at.t he indian tribes claim to sovereignty long predates that of our own government.the pueblo,like all indian tribes,need not rely on a federal delegation of powers.indian tribes consistently have been recognized by the united states,as distinct,independent political communities qualified to exercise powers of,not by virtue of any delegation of powers,but rather by reason of their original tribal sovereignty.felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law footnotes omitted citing worcester georgia,pet.tribes retain those attributes of inherent sovereignty not withdrawn either expressly or necessarily as a result of their status.united states wheeler,d.u ntil congress acts,the tribes retain their existing sovereign powers.id.we are persuaded that those powers include the authority to adopt the ordinance challenged here by the nlrb and the union and to enter the lease agreement.
in addition to broad authority over intramural matters such as membership,tribes retain sovereign authority to regulate economic activity within their own territory,see,merrion jicarilla apache tribe,d recognizing the tribe general authority,as sovereign,to control economic activity within its jurisdiction washington confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation,d observing that tribes possess broad civil jurisdiction over the activities of nonmembers on reservation land in which the tribes have a significant interest,and that there was no evidence that congress had departed from that view.but see atkinson trading,shirley,d holding that tribal interest in tourism activity by nonmember hotel guests on owned land within the reservation was inadequate to support the tribal power to tax.
however,courts have described the tribes status as necessarily resulting in the loss of their power to engage in foreign relations,alienate their lands to without federal consent,or prosecute in tribal courts which do not accord the full protections of the bill of rights.colville,at.citations omitted.courts have likewise found divestiture of tribal power to tax or regulate certain activities by where such activities do not directly affect tribal political integrity,economic security,health,or welfare.see,atkinson trading,d imposition of hotel occupancy tax on guests of owned hotel on land served by federal and state highways on a reservation strate contractors,d civil jurisdiction over a case arising from an accident between nonmembers on a state on a reservation rice rehner,d liquor sales on a reservation,where the federal government and states had long exercised concurrent regulatory authority over such trade montana united states,d fishing and hunting on land on a reservation.
in general the cases where,absent congressional guidance,tribes have been found to lack regulatory authority have been those involving nonmembers activity on fee land that was found to have no direct effect on the tribe.a tribe may regulate,through taxation,licensing,or other means,the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,through commercial dealing,contracts,leases,or other arrangements,and may also exercise civil authority over the conduct of on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity,the economic security,or the health or welfare of the tribe.montana united states,at.see also william canby,american indian law summarizing recent federal precedents regarding limitations on tribal regulatory jurisdiction.these limiting precedents,however,are not applicable here,where the nlrb seeks a declaratory judgment prohibiting the application of the ordinance to all persons everywhere on the reservation,and where the only instance of regulation cited pertains to consensual commercial dealings between the pueblo and its members on the one hand,and a lumber company operating on lands leased from the tribe on the other.
whether a valid divestiture has been made of the pueblo sovereign authority to regulate labor relations by enactment of the ordinance or adoption of the lease containing provisions 
the retained sovereign authority of indian tribes is subject to divestiture by congress.divestiture may occur by treaty or statute,united states wheeler,d,the latter being relied on by the board and the union here.divestiture may also occur necessarily as a result of tribal status,or where it is inconsistent with overriding national interests.merrion,at.however,divestiture is disfavored as a matter of national policy,eeoc,at,and will only be found where congress has manifested its clear and unambiguous intent to restrict tribal sovereign authority.we have explained that 
w e believe that unequivocal supreme court precedent dictates that in cases where ambiguity exists such as that posed by the adea silence with respect to indians,and there is no clear indication of congressional intent to abrogate indian sovereignty rights as manifested,by the legislative history,or the existence of a comprehensive statutory plan,the court is to apply the special canons of construction to the benefit of indian interests.
id.emphasis added.
indian interests,as the supreme court has interpreted them,include tribal sovereignty,see white mountain apache tribe bracker,d looking to traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence for guidance in interpreting ambiguous or vague federal enactments,and maintaining tribal authority over civil matters on tribal territory,see,williams lee,d upholding a tribe authority over a business transaction involving a on a reservation,and pointing out that t he cases in this court have consistently guarded the authority of indian governments over their reservations.doubtful or ambiguous expressions,therefore,are to be construed as leaving tribal sovereignty undisturbed.
the government has assumed trust responsibility for indians and tribes,including the pueblos.united states sandoval.the canons of construction favoring indians reflect this.county of oneida oneida indian nation,d the canons of construction applicable in indian law are rooted in the unique trust relationship between the united states and the indians.rules of statutory construction generally provide for a broad construction when the issue is whether indian rights are reserved or established,and for a narrow construction when indian rights are to be abrogated or limited.cohen at.see,santa clara pueblo martinez,d construing indian civil rights act narrowly so as to avoid limiting tribal sovereignty bryan itasca county,d upholding right of indians to be free of state taxation in spite of provisions of public law.we further note that the canon requiring resolution of ambiguities in favor of indians is to be given the broadest possible scope,remembering that a canon of construction is not a license to disregard clear expressions of congressional intent.decoteau dist.county court,d.
where tribal sovereignty is at stake,the supreme court has cautioned that we tread lightly in the absence of clear indications of legislative intent.santa clara pueblo,at.the court teachings also require us to consider tribal sovereignty as a backdrop,against which vague or ambiguous federal enactments must always be measured,and to construe a mbiguities in federal law generously in order to comport with traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence.white mountain apache,at.courts are consistently guided by the purpose of making federal law bear as lightly on indian tribal prerogatives as the leeways of statutory interpretation allow.reich great lakes indian fish wildlife comm n,cir.we therefore do not lightly construe federal laws as working a divestment of tribal sovereignty and will do so only where congress has made its intent clear that we do so.
statutes are entitled to the presumption of.maryland louisiana,d.this is especially true in the context of indian tribal law.as noted,it is well established that federal statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of indians and tribes,and that any ambiguities or doubtful expressions of legislative intent are to be resolved in their favor.montana blackfeet,at.south carolina catawba,at.indian tribes,like states,are entitled to comity.reich great lakes indian fish wildlife comm n,at.furthermore,both the legislative and executive branches have declared that federal indian policy favors tribal.on this point the supreme court has spoken clearly and emphatically we have repeatedly recognized the federal government longstanding policy of encouraging tribal this policy reflects the fact that indian tribes retain attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory,to the extent that sovereignty has not been withdrawn by federal statute or treaty.iowa mutual ins.laplante,d internal quotation and citations omitted.see also generally,president message to congress,the american indians.july,declaring previous termination policy a failure and announcing a new direction in indian policy,favoring increased tribal autonomy 
the court has recognized that reservation tribes enjoy the right to make their own laws and be ruled by them,as a benefit to be protected from state infringement.williams,at.preempting tribal laws divests tribes of their retained sovereign authority,running counter to this policy and not benefitting indians.see washington confederated bands tribes of the yakima indian nation,d stating the general rule that ambiguities in legislation affecting retained tribal sovereignty are to be construed in favor of the indians,in favor of tribal sovereignty.in the absence of clear evidence of congressional intent,therefore,federal law will not be read as stripping tribes of their retained sovereign authority to pass laws and be governed by them.
we turn now to the arguments made by the board and the union that congress has divested the pueblo of its sovereign authority to enact the ordinance and enter into the lease.all parties agree that neither the legislative history of the nlra,nor its language,make any mention of indian tribes.we must decide what is the proper inference to draw from this silence.the nlrb cites andrus glover constr,d where congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,additional exceptions are not to be implied,in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.the board argues that this rule,akin to the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius,is a settled principle of statutory construction which is applicable in this case.supp.brief of the nlrb at.while this settled principle may find application in other types of cases,in matters of indian law expressio unius must often be set aside.el paso natural gas neztsosie,d.
the board argues that,while legal ambiguities can sometimes be resolved to the benefit of the indians,decoteau district county court,d,courts can not ignore a statute plain language supp.brief at.we disagree,however,with the implied contention that silence establishes this statute plain intent to preempt tribal authority.silence as to tribes can constitute a latent or intrinsic ambiguity that only becomes apparent when other facts are considered.reich great lakes indian fish wildlife comm n,at.in the context of indian law,appeals to plain language or plain meaning must give way to canons of statutory construction peculiar to indian law.id.at finding that the plain meaning canon was parried by the canon that not only treaties but other statutes as well are to be construed so far as is reasonable to do in favor of indians.we note further that it is congressional intent,and not merely the naked words of a statute,that controls.south carolina catawba,at.silence is not sufficient to establish congressional intent to strip indian tribes of their retained inherent authority to govern their own territory.see farley,aff cir,cert.denied,d observing that congressional silence is to be interpreted in favor of indians.
the correct presumption is that silence does not work a divestiture of tribal power.merrion,at.t he proper inference from silence is that the sovereign power to tax remains intact.el paso natural gas,at,d concluding that tribes should be treated like states because the price anderson act silence as to tribes was probably attributable to congressional inadvertence.but see chickasaw nation united states,d affirming this circuit denial of a tax exemption for tribes on their gaming operations,and reaching this conclusion on the basis of the special canon disfavoring implied tax exemptions,evidence of congressional intent,and strong statutory language confederated tribes of the warm springs reservation kurtz,cir concluding that express tax exemptions for states,their political subdivisions,and the district of columbia did not provide the clear statutory guidance required to find a tax exemption for a tribe,cert.denied,d.in neither of these latter cases,however,was a tribe sovereign authority to enact and enforce laws at stake,as is the case here.
the nlrb points out that,at the time that b was enacted,congress was aware that there existed some twelve states with laws prohibiting union security supp.brief nlrb at.the board goes on to argue that the legislative history indicates that it was these state laws which congress intended to preserve,and that t he legislative history repeatedly refers to state laws and only state laws prohibiting union security id.however,we are not convinced that congress did not merely intend to preserve the existing state laws,since in including b it recognized the authority of all territories as enact their own laws if they wished,not just the twelve states that had already done so.the nlra embraces the possibility that many of the states might be governed by laws enacted by sovereign governments.furthermore,the act embraces diversity of legal regimes respecting union security agreements at the level of major units.new mexico fed of labor.at.
algoma plywood veneer wisconsin employment relations,is instructive.algoma arose before the enactment of b.the court there held that a merely disclaims a national policy hostile to the closed shop or other forms of agreement.id.at.relying on strong legislative history,the court quoted from,among others,senator wagner,who stated that t he provision will not change the status quo.id.at.citations and quotations omitted.the court concluded that the wagner act had not swept aside state authority to regulate union security measures,but was enacted,as to these matters,simply to express congress judgment that closed shops were not illegal where authorized,and not to declare national policy that they were desirable.the court found this view of a supported by the subsequent enactment of b in the act.id.at.
thus the tribe is not preempted by a from enacting a law for business conducted in its reservation.what congress has not taken away by a it need not give back by b in order for the tribe to continue to have authority to pass a law.although the supreme court has characterized a as articulat ing a national policy that certain agreements are valid as a matter of federal law,oil,chemical atomic workers,int l union mobil oil,d,the court has also made it clear that a was not intended by congress to be preemptive.see id.at.noting b of the nlra was designed to make clear that a left the states free to pursue their own more restrictive policies in the matter of agreements internal quotations omitted retail clerks int l ass n,local schermerhorn,d noting b of the nlra was enacted to mak e clear and unambiguous the purpose of congress not to preempt the field see also algoma plywood,at.describing the predecessor to a as merely disclaim ing a national policy hostile to the closed shop or other forms of agreement.
the court has explained that,in enacting b,congress left the states free to legislate in that field and thus intended to leave unaffected the power to enforce those laws.schermerhorn,at.emphasis added.when congress enacted b,it did not grant new authority to states and territories,but merely recognized and affirmed their existing authority.congress silence as to the tribes can therefore hardly be taken as an affirmative divestment of their existing general authority,as sovereign s,to control economic activity on territory within their jurisdictions.see merrion,at.
the effect of the tuscarora case 
the nlrb and the union further urge us to find preemption on the basis of federal power comm tuscarora indian nation,d.there a tribe owned property that the court held was subject to condemnation under the federal power act in order to create a reservoir.the tribe had been using the property as a reservation but the tuscarora opinion held that congress had never designated it as such,either by statute or treaty.id.at.
the court noted that congress appeared to have intended that act to be generally applicable to lands owned or occupied by any person or persons,including indians.id.at.the tuscarora indian nation had relied on a rule set out in elk wilkins.that g eneral acts of congress did not apply to indians,unless so expressed as to clearly manifest an intention to include them.tuscarora,at.the court explained that,although at one time individual indians had been considered exempt from laws that did not specifically include them,the rule had since been modified.the court cited superintendent of five civilized tribes comm r,in which a restricted creek indian investment income was held to be subject to federal income tax under the broad terms of the revenue act,and oklahoma tax comm united states,in which the state of oklahoma was held to have authority to impose its estate tax on indians and alike.tuscarora at.the court said it is now well settled by many decisions of this court that a general statute in terms applying to all persons includes indians and their property interests.id.at.
however tuscarora dealt solely with issues of ownership,not with questions pertaining to the tribe sovereign authority to govern the land.proprietary interests and sovereign interests are separate one can own land without having the power to govern it by policy determinations as a sovereign,and a government may exercise sovereign authority over land it does not own.tuscarora mentions no attempts by the tribe to govern the disputed land,nor does it take cognizance of any argument that taking the land would incidentally infringe on tribal sovereign authority to govern.it was the tribe possessory interest in the land,rather than its sovereign authority to govern activity on the land,that was at stake in tuscarora.the tuscarora court remarks concerning statutes of general applicability were made in the context of property rights,and do not constitute a holding as to tribal sovereign authority to govern.
in phillips petroleum environmental protection agency,cir,we dealt with property rights and reached the conclusion that tribal ownership did not prevent a generally applicable federal statute from regulating activity to ensure the safety of ground water under land.there,the osage tribal government property interest was regulated by the safe drinking water act of sdwa,but its sovereign authority was not.far from attempting to exercise its sovereign authority to enact a competing regulation,the tribe supported the federal regulation and indicated its approval by tribal resolution it was a third party phillips petroleum that challenged the application of the regulation.id.at.furthermore,the facts differ significantly between that case and the instant one.there,the statute gave delegated authority to the environmental protection agency to promulgate regulations governing underground injection,which threatened to pollute groundwater and endanger the nation drinking water supply.id.at.
other cases have applied the tuscarora principle to indian tribal governments acting in proprietary capacities.see,florida paraplegic ass n,miccosukee tribe of indians of florida,cir reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir smart state farm,cir and donovan navajo forest products industries,cir.
thus tuscarora is not persuasive here.we are convinced it does not apply where an indian tribe has exercised its authority as a,by enacting a labor than in a proprietary capacity such as that of employer or landowner.in spite of the board attempts to bring to our attention multiple cases where the rule was applied to a tribe qua sovereign,no citations were found to be apposite supp.brief of the board at.further,tuscarora does not control where,as here,the law is not generally applicable as the exceptions of b show.the exception to a recognized in b indicates that congress did not intend inclusion within its general ambit as the norm,smart,at.in view of congress intention with regard to this statute,and the federal policy that has long recognized tribal sovereignty,we do not think that tuscarora may be applied to divest a tribe of its sovereign authority without clear indications of such congressional intent which are lacking here.we therefore are convinced that a proviso permitting union security agreements does not support divestment of the pueblo sovereign authority to enact the ordinance.
the exemption of a contemplates that federal law,and particularly the provisions of a,may conflict with that of other sovereigns,but intends that federal law give way.oil,chemical atomic workers,at,recognizing a conflict sanctioned by congress with directions to give the right of way to state laws.we recognize that b should not be read as granting states and territories general power to supplant federal labor law states and territories may not,for instance,enact laws that exempt their territory from other federal labor regulations.see id.at.finding no suggestion in b language or legislative history that types of laws not mentioned in b might be permissible.however neither the board nor the union contests the pueblo assessment of its law as being similar to state laws.brief for appellee pueblo of san juan at.there is therefore no showing before us that the pueblo ordinance is a kind of law that a state or territory might not be permitted to enact and enforce.
like states and territories,the pueblo has a strong interest as a sovereign in regulating economic activity involving its own members within its own territory,and it therefore may enact laws governing such activity.merrion,at.merrion illustrates the exercise of sovereign authority there,to tax and that sovereign authority exercised was recognized to be a fundamental attribute of sovereignty which the tribes retain unless divested of it by federal law or necessary implication of their dependent status.id.at.quoting washington confederated tribes of colville indian reservation,d.the legislative enactment of the pueblo ordinance was also clearly an exercise of sovereign authority over economic transactions on the reservation.this distinguishes the pueblo exercise of sovereign authority here from a congressional enactment like that in tuscarora which did not affect tribal legislative policy but instead impacted proprietary interests.this distinction demonstrates why the tuscarora principle,that indians proprietary interests may be affected even when indians are not specifically mentioned,does not apply here where the matter at stake is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty and a necessary instrument of and territorial management which derives from the tribe general authority,as sovereign,to control economic activity within its jurisdiction.merrion,at.
in sum,we are convinced that congress did not intend by its nlra provisions to preempt tribal sovereign authority to enact its ordinance and to enter into the lease agreement.the board and the union had the burden to establish such intent of preemption,but they did not satisfy their burden.since they failed to do so,we uphold the tribal ordinance.similarly we see no reason to hold invalid the lease provisions entered into by the tribe.accordingly,the decision of the district court is 
i concur.applying the analytical framework outlined in judge murphy dissent,which i believe to be controlling in this case the outcome,in my view,turns on the effect of a of the nlra.although the supreme court has characterized a as articulat ing a national policy that certain agreements are valid as a matter of federal law,oil,chemical atomic workers,int l union mobil oil,d,the court has also made it clear that a was not intended by congress to be preemptive.see id.at.noting b of the nlra was designed to make clear that a left the states free to pursue their own more restrictive policies in the matter of agreements internal quotations omitted retail clerks int l ass n,local schermerhorn,d noting b of the nlra was enacted to mak e clear and unambiguous the purpose of congress not to preempt the field see also algoma plywood veneer wisconsin employment relations.describing the predecessor to a as merely disclaim ing a national policy hostile to the closed shop or other forms of agreement.based upon these statements,i therefore agree with the majority that a does not preempt tribes from enacting laws for business conducted on their reservations.
i join judge briscoe concurrence.i write separately to note my recognition of the potential analytical tension between parts i,ii,and iv of the majority opinion,which i have also elected to join,and the approach set forth in judge briscoe concurrence.under either approach,the result reached today is mandated by two united states supreme court cases,retail clerks international ass n,local schermerhorn,d,and algoma plywood veneer wisconsin employment relations board.these cases do not permit us to entertain the interpretation or result advocated by appellants in this case.
a majority of this court concludes that congress did not divest native american indian tribes of the power to enact laws when it passed a and b of the national labor relations act nlra.the majority supports this conclusion by invoking the general proposition that congress can not abrogate indian by silence.it then goes on to conclude,however,that congress,by its silence,implicitly granted indian tribes the right to enact such laws when it passed b.because i disagree with the majority conclusion that a did not divest indian tribes of their power to enact laws and with its subsequent conclusion that b implicitly granted indian tribes the same power to enact laws granted to states and territories,i respectfully dissent.
it is beyond debate that indian tribes do not possess the full attributes of sovereignty.united states kagama.see also merrion jicarilla apache tribe,cir,aff,d.tribes,rather,are governments,possessing only those powers of not voluntarily relinquished by treaty,not divested by congress in the exercise of its plenary authority over them,or not inconsistent with the superior interest of the united states as a sovereign nation.merrion,at.the union and the nlrb do not argue that the pueblo of san juan pueblo never possessed the power to enact a law or that any such power has either been relinquished by treaty or is inconsistent with the superior status of the united states.rather,both simply argue that the pueblo power has been divested by the exercise of congressional plenary authority over indian tribes.
the majority does not dispute that congress retains plenary power over indian tribes and may exercise that power to divest tribes of their sovereignty.see op.at.further,the majority correctly points out that the burden is on the nlrb and the union to demonstrate that the pueblo power to enact the ordinance at issue here has been modified,conditioned or divested by congressional action.southland royalty navajo tribe of indians,cir.the majority then concludes that appellants have not met their burden of showing that congress intended to divest the pueblo of the power to enact the ordinance.the nlrb and the union,however,have met their burden by demonstrating that the nlra constitutes comprehensive federal regulation of labor relations.the pueblo then fails to offer any proof that congress did not intend for a to apply to indian tribes.
congress clear intention to apply a federal statute to indian tribes can be demonstrated in one of two ways.congress,of course,may expressly limit tribal sovereignty by including specific language to that effect in the federal statute.alternatively,congressional intent to abrogate indian sovereignty can be discerned from legislative history or from the existence of a comprehensive statutory plan.eeoc cherokee nation,cir.the conclusion that congress can abrogate indian sovereignty by implication is firmly supported by statements made by the supreme court in federal power commission tuscarora indian nation,d.in tuscarora,the court declared that it is now well settled by many decisions of this court that a general federal statute in terms applying to all persons includes indians and their property interests.id.though dicta,this language indicates the court position that the case law supports a presumption that federal statutes of general applicability apply to indian tribes.see gaylor united states,cir t his court considers itself bound by supreme court dicta almost as firmly as by the court outright holdings.
the ninth circuit has expounded on the court statement in tuscarora,articulating three exceptions to the general presumption in favor of applicability.
a federal statute of general applicability that is silent on the issue of applicability to indian tribes will not apply to them if the law touches exclusive rights of in purely intramural matters the application of the law to the tribe would abrogate rights guaranteed by indian treaties or there is proof by legislative history or some other means that congress intended the law not to apply to indians on their reservations

in donovan navajo forest products,this court opined that merrion jicarilla apache tribe,at.limits or,by implication,overrules tuscarora,cir.if merrion did limit the application of tuscarora,those limits are entirely consistent with the exceptions articulated by the ninth circuit in coeur.reading merrion as consistent with tuscarora is supported by the opinions issued by this court after merrion and navajo forest products in which the court invokes the tuscarora presumption and then considers the coeur exceptions.see nero cherokee nation,cir eeoc cherokee nation,at phillips petroleum epa,cir.thus,this court,together with several other circuits,has embraced the approach.
in eeoc cherokee nation,a divided panel of this court concluded that the age discrimination in employment act adea did not apply to indian tribes.see at.both the majority and the dissenting judge,however,acknowledged that clear congressional intent to abrogate tribal sovereignty could be manifested by the existence of a comprehensive statutory plan.see id.at,tacha,dissenting examining legislative history and an analogous federal statute to support the conclusion that the tribe right to was limited by the adea.it is unclear whether the majority based its holding on its view that the adea was not a comprehensive federal plan or its conclusion that a treaty between the cherokee nation and the united states overcame the tuscarora presumption.see id.at.
this court has also invoked the tuscarora presumption to conclude that congress intended to include indian tribes within the reach of the safe water drinking act of swda even though tribes were not expressly mentioned.see phillips petroleum,at the conclusion that the swda empowered the epa to prescribe regulations for indian lands is also consistent with the presumption that congress intends a general statute applying to all persons to include indians and their property interests.id.at.the court holding was supported,in large part,by its conclusion that the swda clearly establish ed national policy with respect to clean water.id.at.the court determined that this national policy would be thwarted if indian tribes were not covered by the swda.it then noted that there was no showing that the swda conflicted with a specific right granted to the tribe either by statute or treaty.see id.at.the majority believes phillips petroleum differs from this case because,unlike the pueblo,the indian tribe in phillips petroleum did not oppose the application of the swda.under the analysis employed by the phillips petroleum court,however,the outcome would be the same regardless of whether the issue of tribal sovereignty was raised by an indian or by a.certainly the majority can not be suggesting that the outcome in phillips petroleum would have been different had the theory of tribal sovereignty been raised by the affected tribe rather than phillips petroleum.the importance of phillips petroleum is that it squarely supports the proposition that cases involving comprehensive federal statutes of general applicability should be analyzed by applying.
other circuit courts of appeal have also concluded that tribes sovereign powers can be divested by comprehensive federal regulatory schemes that are silent as to their application to indians.see.paraplegic ass miccosukee tribe of indians,cir concluding that the ada applies to indian tribes reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir holding that osha applied to an indian tribe smart state farm ins,cir applying erisa to an employee benefits plan established and operated by an indian tribe coeur tribal farm,at holding that osha applied to a tribe commercial activities.these cases all discussed tuscarora and the exceptions articulated by the ninth circuit.
the majority distinguishes tuscarora and its progeny by concluding that the pueblo sovereign power to govern by enacting legislation,as opposed to its power to protect any proprietary interests it holds,can never be divested by implication.see op.at i mplied preemption of such sovereign authority does not suffice.the majority position,however,is purely visceral the majority offers no logical,precedential,or authoritative support for the proposition that a tribe sovereign power to enact general legislation is afforded more protection than any other aspect of its sovereignty.further,the majority position conflicts with merrion jicarilla apache tribe.
in merrion,the supreme court addressed the question of whether congress implicitly divested an indian tribe of its power to impose a severance tax,a power of.see at.although the court ultimately concluded that there was no indication the tribe power had been abrogated by congress,it clearly engaged in the very analysis repudiated by the majority in this case.the court first examined two federal statutes to determine whether they contained any references to indian tribes.see id.at.it then examined whether any particular provision in the statutes deprived the tribe of its authority to impose the severance tax.id.at.the court concluded that the first statute contained express language indicating congressional intent that it not apply to indian tribes.see id.at.as to the second statute,the court noted that although it authorized state taxation of royalties from mineral production on indian lands,it did not mention tribal authority to tax.see id.at.in rejecting the claims that the statute transferred the indian power to tax mineral production to the states,the court stated as follows 
this claim not only lacks any supporting evidence in the legislative history,it also deviates from settled principles of taxation different sovereigns can enjoy powers to tax the same transactions.thus,the mere existence of state authority to tax does not deprive the indian tribe of its power to tax.
although the court concluded that congress had not implicitly divested the tribe of its power to impose the severance tax at issue in that case,merrion clearly stands for the proposition that congress can divest an indian tribe of a power of by implication.at.we find no clear indications that congress has implicitly deprived the tribe of its power to impose the severance tax.emphasis added.the court did not conclude that congress could never divest a tribe of such powers by implication.
like the supreme court,this court has also recognized that congress can divest indian tribes of sovereign powers of by implication.see nero,at.in nero,this court concluded that a federal statute of general applicability did not divest a tribe of its sovereign power to determine tribal membership and thus exclude plaintiffs from participating in tribal elections and indian benefits programs.see id.at.the court arrived at this conclusion by applying the analysis.it apparently assumed that the federal statute was one of general applicability but then concluded that the statute could not be invoked against the tribe because it would impinge on the tribe right of over tribal membership,a purely intramural matter.see id.at.
the supreme court has consistently and unequivocally stated that congress has plenary authority to divest indian tribes of any and all aspects of their sovereignty,whether those powers were retained by the tribes or established by treaty.the sovereignty that the indian tribes retain is of a unique and limited character.it exists only at the sufferance of congress and is subject to complete defeasance.united states wheeler,d emphasis added.congress has plenary authority to limit,modify or eliminate the powers of local which the tribes otherwise possess.santa clara pueblo martinez,d see also united states dion,d holding that rights granted to a tribe by treaty may be abrogated by congress.even powers over purely intramural tribal matters can be divested by treaty or statute.see wheeler,at.
the test accommodates notions of both tribal and federal sovereignty.pursuant to the exceptions first articulated by coeur,congressional power to implicitly divest an indian tribe of sovereign powers is limited in only two circumstances when the federal statute strips the tribe of its power to regulate purely intramural matters or when the statute divests the tribe of powers guaranteed by treaty.only in those two situations must congressional divestiture be express.congress can divest indian tribes of any and all other aspects of their sovereignty by implication,including their power to regulate the activities of,unless the tribe can demonstrate that congress did not intend the federal statute to apply to them.
the majority attempt to distinguish the analysis on the basis that it only applies when a federal statute affects property interests and does not apply when a tribe merely invokes its general legislative powers is illogical.if the majority is correct,an indian tribe,in almost every instance,could avoid the application of a comprehensive,generally applicable federal statute simply by exercising its general legislative powers and enacting an ordinance that either declares the tribe to be exempt from the federal statute or which directly conflicts with the federal statute.by holding that congress can never implicitly divest tribes of their power to enact laws that conflict with generally applicable federal statutes,the majority effectively bestows upon indian tribes sovereign powers far greater than those possessed even by the states.as a result of the majority opinion,tribes will now have unfettered power to enact ordinances that directly conflict with any federal statute of general application.for example,the pueblo could enact an ordinance legalizing the closed shop,a form of compulsory unionization the majority acknowledges was outlawed in by the taft hartley act amendment of the nlra.see op.at.the pueblo could also enact legislation declaring its members to be exempt from all federal tax laws.such an ordinance would effectively preempt the application of all federal tax laws until congress remedied the situation by expressly including indian tribes within the reach of the federal tax laws.this certainly can not be the rule.
both the seventh and the second circuits have rejected the majority reasoning on this very basis.in smart,a member of the chippewa tribe argued that erisa did not apply to an employee benefit plan maintained by the tribe because it affected tribal sovereignty.see at.the seventh circuit disagreed,stating 
a statute of general application will not be applied to an indian tribe when the statute threatens the tribe ability to govern its intramural affairs,but not simply whenever it merely affects as broadly conceived.any federal statute applied to an indian on a reservation or to a tribe has the arguable effect of eviscerating since it amounts to a subordination of the indian government.
id.similarly,the second circuit addressed a nearly identical argument,concluding 
when taken to its logical limits,it would preclude the application of any federal legislation,silent as to indians,that in some way affects the political integrity,economic security,or health and welfare of a tribe.such a test greatly expands the niche the federal government has carved out for indian tribes that of a sovereign with limited powers,dependent on,and subordinate to the federal government.

merrion and nero stand for the proposition that the tuscarora coeur analysis should be applied to determine whether congress has,by implication,divested an indian tribe of any powers it retains.the approach adopted by the ninth circuit in coeur is consistent with both tuscarora and merrion and provides courts with an appropriate and workable framework within which to analyze the impact of all generally applicable federal statutes on all aspects of indian sovereignty.the exceptions articulated in coeur appropriately limit the tuscarora presumption by preserving tribal sovereignty over purely intramural matters even in the face of comprehensive federal regulation.a limited notion of tribal preserves federal supremacy over indian tribes while providing heightened protection for tribal regulation of purely intramural matters.any concerns about abrogating tribal powers of by implication are fully addressed by the coeur exceptions.the majority has offered no rationale for its position that tribes powers to enact general legislation occupy the same heights as their more vital powers to regulate purely intramural matters such as tribal membership and domestic affairs.
congress divested the pueblo of the power to enact the ordinance at issue here.the pueblo does not dispute that the nlra establishes a national labor policy.see barrentine freight,d the national policy favoring collective bargaining and industrial was first expressed in the national labor relations act of.it received further expression and definition in the labor management relations act.citation omitted phillips petroleum,at using the nlra as an example of a statute that established a national policy navajo tribe nlrb,congress has adopted a national labor policy,superseding the local policies of the states and the indian tribes,in all cases to which the national labor relations act applies.relying on algoma plywood veneer wisconsin employment relations board,however,the majority concludes that a does not prohibit laws like the one at issue here.see.
algoma can not be read for the proposition that a had no effect on an indian tribe power to enact a ordinance.in algoma,the court interpreted of the wagner act,which permitted the closed shop before it was amended by the act of see id.at.addressing the concern that could be interpreted as outlawing the closed shop,the court stated,merely disclaims a national policy hostile to the closed shop or other forms of agreement.id.at.the court,in part,relied on language from a senate report indicating that deals with the question of the closed shop.id.the court then quoted a statement made by senator wagner that will not change the status quo w herever it is the law today that a agreement can be made,it will continue to be the law.by this bill we do not change that situation.id.at.thus,the language in algoma relied upon by the majority stands only for the proposition that of the wagner act did not prohibit states from outlawing closed shops.the status quo referred to by the court was the states powers to regulate closed shops.
even assuming that of the wagner act had no effect on the rights of all sovereigns to fully regulate union security agreements,the majority fails to acknowledge that was amended by the act of.see ch,a,stat,current version at a.as amended,the statute regulates more than the closed shop.section a

retail clerks int l ass n,local schermerhorn,d.because algoma did not resolve the question of whether a of the act,the statute at issue here,preempted state laws,the court took the question up in schermerhorn.acknowledging that a of the act imposed additional federal restrictions on union security agreements not found in of the wagner act,the court,referring to a,stated,in other words,congress undertook pervasive regulation of agreements,raising in the minds of many whether it thereby preempted the field and put such agreements beyond state control.id.at.emphases added and citation omitted.although the court ultimately concluded that the state law at issue in schermerhorn was not preempted by a,its holding was premised on b of the taft hartley act,which restored to the states and territories a power otherwise preempted by a.see id.at.the exception carved out by b,however,is extremely narrow it only permits states and territories to enact legislation prohibiting union security agreements otherwise allowed under a.section b does not permit even states and territories to enact legislation allowing what a prohibits,the closed shop.
in,the court unambiguously reiterated its belief that a constitutes pervasive federal regulation of union security agreements,stating 
section a of the national labor relations act permits employees as a matter of federal law to enter into agreements with unions to establish union or agency shops.section b of the act,however,allo
