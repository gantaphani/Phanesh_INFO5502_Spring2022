appellants gros ventre tribe,assiniboine tribe,and the fort belknap indian community council collectively the tribes appeal the district court order granting summary judgment for the united states.the tribes filed suit in the district of montana against the united states,its bureau of land management blm,the bureau of indian affairs,and the indian health service collectively the government,alleging that the government had violated specific and general trust obligations to protect tribal trust resources primarily water rights by authorizing and planning to expand two cyanide gold mines located upriver from the tribes reservation.we affirm.
the tribes urge a theory of liability conflating general trust law principles with an attack on agency inaction under the administrative procedure act apa.see.but none of the treaties cited by the tribes impose a specific duty on the united states to regulate third parties or resources for the benefit of the tribes.because the government general trust obligations must be analyzed within the confines of generally applicable statutes and regulations,we reject the suggestion to create by judicial fiat a right of action congress has not recognized by treaty or statute.therefore,because the tribes do not have a cognizable claim,we agree with the district court that the tribes are required to comply with the apa final agency action requirement.see id.we also hold that after bifurcating the trial into a liability and remedy phase,the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the government motion for summary judgment upon conclusion of the liability phase.
the gros ventre and assiniboine tribes reside on the fort belknap indian reservation reservation located in montana.pertinent to this appeal is the fact that in seven different indian nations,including the two tribes,signed the treaty of fort laramie.the indian nations had assembled for the purpose of establishing and confirming peaceful relations amongst themselves,and,by signing the treaty,they agree d to abstain in future from all hostilities whatever against each other,to maintain good faith and friendship in all their mutual intercourse,and to make an effective and lasting peace.treaty of fort laramie,stat.the tribes also formally recognized the right of the united states government to establish roads,military and other posts,within their respective territories.id.at.in return,the united states agreed to protect the indian nations against the commission of all depredations by the people of the said united states.id.at.the treaty of fort laramie did not convey any land to the indians but instead chiefly represented a covenant among several tribes which recognized specific boundaries for their respective territories.montana united states,d.
the united states made a similar promise to protect the tribes and their territory in the treaty with the blackfeet.the tribes agree d that citizens of the united states may live in and pass unmolested through the countries respectively occupied and claimed by them.treaty with the blackfeet,stat.the united states agreed to be bound to protect said indians against depredations and other unlawful acts which white men residing in or passing through their country may commit.id.
in,congress ratified an agreement to reduce the territory of the gros ventre,piegan,blood,blackfeet,and river crow indian tribes.see an act to ratify and confirm an agreement with the gros ventre,ch,may,stat.in return,congress created the original fort belknap indian reservation,an area of land specifically set aside for the use and enjoyment of the indian tribes.although a reduction of their former territory,the original fort belknap indian reservation included the little rocky mountains of montana,a location long used by the tribes for subsistence,social,and religious purposes.
in the early,prior to the formation of the original fort belknap indian reservation,gold was discovered on the southern slopes of the little rocky mountains.congress soon realized that the larger part of the country was located within the boundaries of the newly delineated fort belknap indian reservation.in,congress ratified what later became known as the grinnell agreement,wherein the tribes agreed to relinquish all right,title,and interest to the portion of the little rocky mountains in return for certain monetary considerations.agreement with the indians of the fort belknap indian reservation in montana,ch,stat.while not articulated in the agreement ratified by congress,it was reported to the senate that the commission authorized to negotiate with the fort belknap indian tribes had assured the tribes that they would not be giving up any of their timber or grasslands and that they would have ample water for all their needs.doc,at.within the next ten years,the little rocky mountains mining district became montana largest gold producer.
the advent of cyanide technology in conjunction with a sharp rise in gold prices,prompted the development of open pit mining operations beginning in the late.in,the montana department of state lands issued permits to zortman mining,zmi,a wholly owned subsidiary of pegasus gold,pegasus,authorizing the zortman and landusky cyanide mines.both mines are located near the southern boundary of the reservation.the blm did not establish federal regulations controlling the operation of mines on public lands until.at that time,the blm approved the zortman and landusky mines as authorizations under its newly promulgated regulations.the blm issued a plan of operation for each mine,and both plans were amended numerous times between and.
in,zmi proposed to expand the zortman mine.in the course of reviewing the proposed zortman expansion,the blm and the montana department of state lands determined that acid rock drainage ard had become a widespread problem at both the zortman and landusky mines.despite these findings,in,the blm and the montana department of environmental quality issued an environmental impact statement eis and record of decision rod approving a proposed expansion of mining operations at both locations.in late,the tribes appealed that decision to the interior board of land appeals ibla.in,before the ibla issued a decision on the merits,pegasus and zmi filed for bankruptcy.consequently,the companies abandoned their plans to expand and announced that they would reclaim and close the mines.ultimately,the ibla found that the rod did not comply with the national environmental policy act nepa,the federal land policy and management act flpma,or the government trust obligations to the tribes.see island mountain protectors,ibla may.
on june,the blm issued a second rod requiring reclamation of existing disturbances using mitigation tactics.in doing so,it rescinded the rod authorizing mine expansion.because the blm relied on the eis in preparing the rod,the ibla denied the blm motion for reconsideration and vacated the rod on the same grounds it had cited to vacate the earlier decisions.in response to the ibla decision,the blm and the state of montana engaged in consultation with the tribes.the agency issued a final supplemental environmental impact statement seis in and signed a new rod in may.
in april,the tribes filed suit claiming that the government breached its trust responsibility to the tribes by approving,permitting,and failing to reclaim the zortman and landusky mines,the operation of which had diminished and continues to diminish the quality and quantity of water resources available to the tribes.the tribes further alleged that the government failed to consult with the tribes,and consider their spiritual,cultural,and religious interests in the little rocky mountains.according to the tribes,the government breached its common law trust obligations by failing to take action that it was legally required to take,or by acting in a fashion that was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.see.the tribes filed an equitable action,asking the district court to declare that the government violated its fiduciary duty to protect tribal trust resources,find that the government failure to comply with the nepa and other statutory mandates constituted an unnecessary and undue degradation in violation of the flpma,issue a writ of mandamus compelling the government to comply with its trust responsibilities,and enjoin the government from further destruction of tribal trust resources.
on january,the district court denied the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or failure to state a claim.the government had argued that the tribes claims were subject to all of the requirements of the apa.consequently,the government asserted that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider any claim that did not involve a final agency action and that the final agency actions that had occurred prior to were barred by the statute of limitation.
the tribes countered by arguing that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity applies to claims,as well as apa claims.they contended that their common law trust claim could be raised independent of the apa and other statutes and,therefore,they were not limited to challenging only final agency actions.
the district court initially agreed with the tribes and denied the government motion to dismiss.reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the tribes,the district court found that the tribes common law claims were more like private nuisance than an action stemming directly from administrative it agreed that the trust relationship between the tribes and the federal government provide d an independent basis to proceed.therefore,because the district court concluded that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity applied to claims,as well as apa claims,the tribes were not constrained by the final agency action requirement.
on november,the district court issued an order bifurcating the trial into a liability phase and a remedy phase.in december,the parties filed for summary judgment,and upon the district court order they renewed those motions in.
on june,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment.recognizing that t he tribes are not challenging the sic seis and rod,the district court determined that the tribes failed to challenge any final agency action as required by the apa moreover,it reasoned that although damages have been bifurcated from liability,the lack of an effective remedy for any wrongs committed on the tribes render ed the exercise of judicial power superfluous,and the case moot.the blm withdrew the plan to expand the mines,and,therefore the actions of which the tribes complain either can not be undone or have already been undone.consequently,the district court siting in equity ha d little to offer the tribes until and unless they seek judicial review of the sic seis and rod.
subsequently,the tribes filed a motion to amend judgment.on october,the district court denied the tribes motion in a published order but clarified its reasoning.see gros ventre tribe united states,d.the district court stated that it had reconsidered its prior order denying the government motion to dismiss sua sponte.id.at.it now believed that the tribes claims were subject to all apa provisions,including the final agency action requirement id.at.moreover,as an alternative holding,the district court concluded that the tribes common law claims must fail because the tribes could not state a cognizable claim that the government had failed to satisfy any other statutory obligations,whether directed at protecting the tribes or the environment in general.as the district court stated,in the absence of a specific duty,or specific control over tribal property,the government fulfills its obligations as a trustee for the tribes if it complies with applicable statutes.id.t he trust obligation is not elevated to an independent source of law,and,because it determined that the tribes failure to act claims under flpma were not reviewable,the district court concluded that the tribes common law rights were not independently enforceable under the apa.id.at.
consequently,because the statute of limitation for any civil claim against the government is six years,the tribes claims were limited to final agency actions taken after april,id.at.although the rod was a final agency action and occurred within the statute of limitation,that rod was later superseded by another final agency action,which the tribes did not challenge.id.therefore,the district court concluded that because the tribes l ack ed an injury flowing from the decision,they did not have standing to challenge the decision.id.the district court went on to hold that the controversy over the blm approval of the entire mine operation is now moot because the mines have closed,and there is no indication that they will reopen.id.at.the tribes timely appealed.

the parties go to great pains to argue the issue whether the apa waiver of sovereign immunity under for actions against the government is conditioned upon the parties challenging a final agency action as set forth in.we now recognize that there is a conflict in our caselaw regarding this issue however,we need not resolve it as we affirm the district court on its alternative holding 
the government argues that this case is controlled by the ninth circuit decision in gallo cattle department of agriculture,cir.there,we specifically stated that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity contains several limitations,including final agency action requirement.id.at.because the appellants in gallo cattle failed to challenge a final agency action,the express waiver of sovereign immunity did not apply,and could not vest the district court with jurisdiction.id.at.
the tribes attempt to distinguish gallo cattle on the ground that it involved a request for judicial review of agency action and not common law claims seeking equitable relief for agency violations of common law duties.they argue that waives sovereign immunity in review actions for relief brought under.see assiniboine sioux tribes of the fort peck indian reservation bd.of oil gas conservation,cir this court has held that section does waive sovereign immunity in review actions for relief brought under.therefore,they contend that waiver applies to more than just judicial review cases under the apa and that there is no common law final agency action requirement.
the tribes position is supported by the presbyterian church united states,cir,where we rejected the immigration naturalization service ins argument that waiver of sovereign immunity is limited to only agency actions as defined by the apa.id.at.in the presbyterian church,t he ins s argument wa s premised on the first sentence of,enacted in,which reads a person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute,shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.id.at quoting.therefore,because it believed that the challenged actions in the presbyterian church were not agency actions,the ins argued that waiver of sovereign immunity did not apply.id.at.
we see no way to distinguish the presbyterian church from gallo cattle.under the presbyterian church,waiver is not conditioned on the apa agency action requirement.therefore,it follows that waiver can not then be conditioned on the apa final agency action requirement.see reno,d souter,dissenting the waiver of sovereign immunity found in is not restricted by the requirement of final agency action that applies to suits under the apa.citing the presbyterian church,at.but that is directly contrary to the holding in gallo cattle where we stated that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity contains several limitations,including s final agency action requirement.at.
nevertheless,we need not make a sua sponte en banc call to resolve this conflict because,as we discuss below,the tribes do not have a common law cause of action for breach of trust.united states,cir declining to make a sua sponte en banc call to address an conflict when the court could affirm under either standard.therefore,because the statutes that the tribes cite authorize no private right of action,the tribes must state their claims within the confines of the apa.
the tribes argue that the apa final agency action requirement is inapplicable because they have presented the court with simple common law trust claims based upon clearly identified and ongoing injuries.even if the tribes were correct about whether the final agency action requirement applies to claims relying on waiver of sovereign immunity,the tribes can not allege a common law cause of action for breach of trust that is wholly separate from any statutorily granted right.see cobell babbitt,d,the tribes can not state claims for breach of trust against these federal officials in the context of financial mismanagement of the individual indian money trust.there is no such thing as a common law judicial review in the federal courts.quoting stark wickard.frankfurter,dissenting.
we recognize that there is a distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the government in its dealings with indian tribes.united states mitchell mitchell ii,d quoting seminole nation united states.that alone,however,does not impose a duty on the government to take action beyond complying with generally applicable statutes and regulations.tribes reno,a n indian tribe can not force the government to take a specific action unless a treaty,statute or agreement imposes,expressly or by implication,that duty.vigil andrus,cir t he federal government generally is not obligated to provide particular services or benefits in the absence of a specific provision in a treaty,agreement,executive order,or statute.miccosukee tribe of indians of united states,t he government assumes no specific duties to indian tribes beyond those found in applicable statutes,regulations,treaties or other agreements.although the tribes may disagree with the current state of ninth circuit caselaw,as it now stands,unless there is a specific duty that has been placed on the government with respect to indians,the government general trust obligation is discharged by the government compliance with general regulations and statutes not specifically aimed at protecting indian tribes.morongo band of mission indians faa,cir see also okanogan highlands alliance williams,cir,skokomish indian tribe ferc,cir,inter tribal council of arizona,babbitt,cir 
in vigil,the tenth circuit declined to find that,within the federal government broad fiduciary obligations to indian tribes,there lies a specific duty to provide free lunches to all indian children.at.stating that the federal government generally is not obligated to provide particular services or benefits in the absence of a specific provision in a treaty,agreement,executive order,or statute,the court concluded that language in treaties referring to the government obligation to support and educate indians was too broad and did not expressly impose a duty on the government to provide free lunches to all indians.id.
similarly,in tribes,the circuit held that a provision in the treaty of fort bridger of july,stat,giving the tribes a right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the united states so long as game may be found thereon did not impose a duty on the united states to litigate claims on the tribes behalf.at,internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that the broad provision within the treaty d id not suggest in the slightest that upon the tribes request,the united states is bound to file and defend meritless claims to water rights,and,w ithout an unambiguous provision by congress that clearly outlines a federal trust responsibility,courts must appreciate that whatever fiduciary obligation otherwise exists it is a limited one only.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also miccosukee tribe of indians of florida.at,rejecting the tribes argument that the federal government had a fiduciary obligation to accede to its request to take certain actions to alleviate flooding on tribal land caused by tropical storm gordon because t he tribe ha d not introduced evidence that the federal defendants assumed a duty under any of these statutes and agreements to provide the tribe with the flood relief it has requested.
in this case,the tribes argue that the government has failed to properly consider tribal interests in the approval and permitting of the zortman and landusky mining operations.moreover,they argue that the blm failure to fully reclaim the mines and restore the quantity and quality of the tribes water resources constitutes an ongoing breach of the government trust obligations.but their claim is no different from that which might be brought under the generally applicable environmental laws available to any other affected landowner,subject to the same statutory limitations.we also think this situation is unique from other cases where courts have required the united states to comply with a specific fiduciary obligation here,the tribes seek to impose a duty,not found in any treaty or statute,to manage property for the benefit of the tribes.united states mitchell mitchell i,d holding that the united states does not have a specific fiduciary obligation to manage timber resources on allotted lands,held in trust for united states mason,d finding that the united states had not breached its trust responsibility in the management of allotted land held in trust for a member of the osage tribe seminole nation,at.recognizing that the united states may have breached its fiduciary duty in its management of indian annuities minnesota united states.stating that the owner of the fee of the indian allotted lands holds the same in trust for the allottees.
in mitchell i,the seminal case dealing with the fiduciary trust obligations owed by the government to federally recognized indian tribes,the supreme court declined to find that the united states had a specific fiduciary obligation to manage timber resources on the allotted lands for the benefit of,even when there was statutory language expressly recognizing that the united states held these lands in trust.at.see also marceau blackfeet housing,cir in mitchell i the supreme court found that the general allotment act,under which tribal land was taken into trust,created only a limited trust relationship between the united states and the tribal member as it related to timber management.the court noted that the general allotment act did not unambiguously provide that the united states has undertaken full fiduciary responsibilities as to the management of allotted lands.mitchell i,at.emphasis added.furthermore,neither its legislative history nor any of the events surrounding the act passage gave any indication that congress intended the government to manage timber resources for the benefit of indian allottees.id.at.
the tribes argue that mitchell i and mitchell ii apply only to claims for monetary damages.in other words,the tribes contend that,when a party seeks monetary relief,mitchell i and mitchell ii require a substantive source of law that establishes a specific fiduciary duty that can be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duty imposed.however,the tribes contend that the government still maintains a general trust responsibility towards them and this responsibility exists for any federal action that relates to indian tribes.therefore,in their ninth circuit caselaw to the general trust obligation can not be satisfied simply through facial compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements.and,for claims for damages,the general trust obligation imposes duties on the federal government even in the absence of a specific treaty,agreement,executive order,or statute.however,we are not in a position to overrule prior precedent.in morongo band of mission indians,the morongo band of mission indians sought relief under the apa.id.at.although we recognized that the united states does owe a general trust responsibility to indian tribes,we stated that unless there is a specific duty that has been placed on the government with respect to indians,this responsibility is discharged by the agency compl
