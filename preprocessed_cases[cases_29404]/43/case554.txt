introduction 
the united states court of federal claims claims court held that a drunk driver who killed two sioux men on a sioux reservation was not a bad man within the meaning of the laramie treaty,and that in any event,the relevant provisions of the treaty are no longer enforceable by its beneficiaries.considering our textual analysis,and because we held in tsosie united states,the bad men provisions bad men provisions of the fort laramie treaty of the laramie treaty are not limited to persons acting for or on behalf of the united states,and because the claims court textual analysis and its historical recitations are erroneous or incomplete,the claims court improperly dismissed appellants complaint for lack of jurisdiction.accordingly,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,the laramie treaty was negotiated between different tribes of sioux indians and commissioners,on the part of the united states.laramie treaty,stat,the united states treaty commissioners included that famed and redoubtable warrior,general william sherman.tsosie,at.article i of the laramie treaty as found in stat.contains two bad men provisions and reads in part 
if bad men among the whites,or among other people subject to the authority of the united states,shall commit any wrong upon the person or property of the indians,the united states will,upon proof made to the agent and forwarded to the commissioner of indian affairs at washington city,proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the united states,and also reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained.
if bad men among the indians shall commit a wrong or depredation upon the person or property of any one,white,black,or indian,subject to the authority of the united states,and at peace therewith,the indians herein named solemnly agree that they will,upon proof made to their agent and notice by him,deliver up the to the united states,to be tried and punished according to its laws and in case they wilfully refuse so to do,the person injured shall be reimbursed for his loss from the annuities or other moneys due or to become due to them under this or other treaties made with the united states.
stat,emphasis added.
on august,two members of the oglala sioux tribe,calonnie randall and robert whirlwind horse,were killed on the pine ridge indian reservation by timothy hotz,a who was driving while intoxicated.richard united states,fed.cl.hotz pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the united states district court for the district of south dakota and was sentenced to federal prison for months.id appellants filed a complaint with the claims court alleging that under the relevant bad men provision in the laramie treaty,hotz actions were a wrong against native americans,hotz was a bad man under the treaty,and the united states therefore must reimburse the injured parties for losses sustained as a result of wrong actions by a bad man against sioux tribal members on their reservation.id 
the jurisdiction of the claims court was invoked pursuant to the tucker act,which waives sovereign immunity for any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort,id.at quoting a,and the bad men among the whites provision of the laramie treaty,id.the claims court found that t his case requires the court to determine the meaning of the phrase subject to the authority of the united states contained in the first bad men clause of article i of the fort laramie treaty,a determination that the trial court believed to be both the main jurisdictional question and an issue of first impression id.at.the trial court ultimately held that 
t he fort laramie treaty does not confer upon the court of federal claims jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs claim because hotz,who had no connection to the federal government other than citizenship at the time of the tragic incident,was not subject to the authority of the united states within the meaning of the first bad men clause contained in article i of the fort laramie treaty such that the united states can be held liable for plaintiffs losses.
id.accordingly,the claims court dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to rule b of the rules of the united states court of federal claims.id.

discussion 
resolution of this case depends solely on the interpretation of the bad men provisions of the laramie treaty 
this court reviews a dismissal of a claim for lack of jurisdiction by the court of federal claims de novo.bank of guam united states.the underlying question of treaty interpretation is a question of law,reviewed de novo.barseback kraft ab united states,citing cook united states.t he supreme court has made clear that while the court should look to the parties choice of words,it should also consider the larger context that frames the treaty,including its history,purpose and negotiations.elk united states,fed.cl,quoting minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,d.in evaluating this argument,we are mindful that treaties should be construed liberally in favor of the indians.tax comm chickasaw nation,u,d quoting county of oneida oneida indian nation of,d.
the treaty text,the object and policy behind the treaty,and this court precedent dictate that the bad men provisions found in article of the laramie treaty of are not limited to an agent,employee,representative,or otherwise acting in any other capacity for or on behalf of the united states.
the treaty text clearly does not limit bad men among the whites to governmental actors 
the interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text.medellin texas,d.the relevant portion of the provision at issue states if bad men among the whites,or among other people subject to the authority of the united states,shall commit any wrong upon the person or property of the indians,the united states will after steps not at issue here reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained.stat.the structure of the treaty divides potential bad men into two categories,bad men among the whites and bad men among other people.id.there are two issues to address whether the phrase subject to the authority of the united states applies to both categories or only the latter,and more importantly,the definition of the phrase subject to the authority of the united states.stat,see richard,fed.cl.at.
with regards to the former,the trial court assumed,without analysis or explanation,that subject to the authority of the united states applies to both categories,interpreting the text to say there are bad men among the whites and there are bad men among other people,all of whom must be subject to the authority of the united states,for the treaty to apply.see richard,fed.cl.at.however,it is equally if not more reasonable to interpret the provision to raise two wholly separate categories made parallel by the repeated use of the word among,there are bad men among the whites and,separately,there are bad men among other people who are subject to the authority of the united states 
additionally,the parties dispute the definition of subject to the authority of the united states.stat,see richard,fed.cl.at.the trial court accepted the government definition that subject to the authority of the united states is equivalent to an agent,employee,representative,or an individual otherwise acting in any other capacity for or on behalf of the united states.richard,fed.cl.at.the trial court offered no explanation and did not seem to consider why the alternative interpretation,that subject to the authority of the united states means persons governed by law,is not an equal if not more valid interpretation.see,id.
appellants argue that t he word whites,as used in bad men among the whites,is unambiguous,wholly separate from the other category bad men among other people subject to the authority of the united states,and that any white can be a bad man.appellants brief at and.appellants note the phrase subject to the authority of the united states immediately appears again in the following paragraph of the treaty,urging the court that these two paragraphs must be construed together in order for the same terms to be given consistent meaning.id.at quoting stat.
indeed,the next paragraph of the treaty incorporates this identical language in a way that can not be read to contain the limitations expressed by the claims court if bad men among the indians shall commit a wrong or depredation upon the person or property of any one,white,black,or indian subject to the authority of the united states,and at peace therewith stat,emphasis added quoted in appellants brief at it would make little sense for the drafters of the treaty to limit the terms of the treaty to only acts committed by indians against anyone,white,black,or indian,who are government actors,and at peace therewith.stat,
the supreme court has stated that it is an established canon of construction for similar language contained within the same section of a statute to be accorded a consistent meaning.credit union admin.first bank trust,d.see also skf usa united states,citing estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d noting the basic canon of statutory construction that identical terms within an act bear the same meaning sullivan stroop,d reaffirming the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.but united states cleveland indians baseball,d although we generally presume that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,the presumption is not rigid,and the meaning of the same words well may vary to meet the purposes of the law.internal quotations and citations omitted brackets in original.
reading the phrase subject to the authority of the united states as only modifying the phrase among other people lessens the need to define subject to the authority of the united states in the case at hand notwithstanding,the treaty text unambiguously distinguishes between bad men among the whites and government actors.if any ambiguity did exist,however,other avenues of statutory interpretation including the object and policy behind the provisions at issue lead to precisely the same result.
the object and policy reasons underlying the treaty show it was written to cover provocations by all non sioux 
the claims court relied heavily,not on the text of the statute,but instead on the doolittle commission and the commission resulting report,condition of the indian tribes as historical evidence that the phrase subject to the authority of the united states is equivalent to an agent,employee,representative,or otherwise acting in any other capacity for or on behalf of the united states and applicable to all bad men.see richard,fed.cl.at citing.the trial court determined,based on incidents of violence by soldiers found in the report,that t he lawless white men to which condition of the indians tribes referred were apparently united states soldiers,who engaged in the indiscriminate slaughter of men,women,and children.id.at quoting condition of the indians tribes.
appellants argue that n o historical evidence supports the lower court view,appellants brief at however,the government asserts that appellants simply ignore the substantial evidence cited by the lower court supporting the conclusion that the bad men provision did not impose liability upon the united states for the actions of those who were not employees,representatives or agents of the united states,appellee brief at citing condition of the indian tribes.additionally,the government asserts that a s the lower court explained,the doolittle commission report establishes that the white men who were perpetrating wrongs against the indians were,by and large,united states soldiers.id.at.finally,the government claims that it is clear from the legislative history of the statute that the parties were concerned with wrongs perpetrated by united states soldiers and recognized the limitations on the united states ability to control the behavior of white men who were not employees,agents or representatives of the united states.id.at.
the government assertions are historically and factually inaccurate.in tsosie,this court recognized the purpose of the laramie treaty of as being a treaty between two nations,and each one promised redress for wrongs committed by its nationals against those of the other nation.at.to appellants,this means the t reaty sought to protect whites against indians,and indians against whites,not just to protect federal officers,agents of employees against indians,and not just to protect indians against federal officers,agents or employees.appellants brief at.condition of the indian tribes,the historical evidence offered by the trial court,when read in full,supports the position that bad men were both those associated with the government and those wholly unassociated.see condition of the indian tribes at major general pope says they are rapidly decreasing in numbers from various causes including by cruel treatment on the part of the whites both by irresponsible persons and by government officials.emphasis added general carleton responded to the same question indians alluded to are decreasing very rapidly in numbers in part due to wars with our pioneers and our armed forces.emphasis added the committee are of the opinion that in a large majority of cases indian wars are to be traced to the aggressions of lawless white men,always to be found upon the frontier,or boundary line between savage and civilized life.such is the statement of the most experienced officers of the army.emphasis added on the other hand,the emigration from california and oregon into the territories from the west is filling every valley and gorge of the mountains with the most energetic and fearless men in the world.in those wild regions,where no civil law has ever been administered,and where our military forces have scarcely penetrated,these adventurers are practically without any law,except such as they impose upon themselves,viz the law of necessity and.emphasis added 
accordingly,the claims court historical evidence and united states history generally show that any white can be a bad man and that the united states government and specifically general sherman,as chief negotiator of the treaty,were concerned with friction created by more than just bad acts by whites serving in or with the armed forces of the united states equally as persuasive as the factual history is the legal precedent,some of it binding,concerning the bad men provisions of the laramie treaty of 
precedent prohibits the trial court holding 
this court has previously found that the bad men provisions were not confined to wrongs committed by government employees.see tsosie,in tsosie,the court stated we hold that the treaty provision in question the bad men provision of,even if infrequently invoked,has not become obsolete or been abandoned or preempted in any sense that affects its enforceability by suit in the claims court under the tucker act.tsosie,at.in rejecting the notion that the provision at issue had been preempted by changes in the law since the treaty negotiation,notably since the advent of the federal tort claims act ftca,we stated 
t he bad men provision is not confined to wrongs by government employees.the literal text of article i and the legislative history of the treaty show that any white can be a bad man plus any nonwhite subject to the authority of the united states,whatever that means,but most likely indian nonmembers of the navajo tribe but subject to united states law.
id.at the court finding in tsosie is controlling here 
after rejecting tsosie as guiding precedent,the trial court then examined two types of cases where courts have reached the merits of claims alleging that wrongs were committed by bad men who were acting for or on behalf of the government,and cases where courts have dismissed claims failing to allege that wrongs were committed by individual bad men who were subject to the authority of the united states.richard,fed.cl.at.the trial court concluded that,among these cases,a common thread is discernible the court possesses jurisdiction over article i bad men clause claims where there exists a nexus between the individual committing the alleged wrong and the united states.id.at.the trial court relied on the absence of bad men cases brought against defendants who were not officers,agents,or employees of the federal government as evidence that such cases can not be brought 
however,as pointed out in tsosie,p rolonged nonenforcement,without preemption,does not extinguish indian rights.at in addition,there are other cases that provide guidance for our interpretation,indicating that the bad men provisions should not be limited as defined by the trial court.for example,as articulated in janis united states 
in a somewhat remarkable case,united states perryman,the supreme court has held that the term a white person in section of the act of section of the revised statutes does not include a black man.that is to say,the supreme court has held of a crime perpetrated by a black man in the indian country in stealing the property of a friendly indian,amid circumstances which would have rendered the government liable if the perpetrator had been a white man,that the government is not liable and that for such a depredation a friendly indian can not recover,though the black man was a citizen of the united states.the laramie treaty is more comprehensive than the act of.it provides against depredations both by whites and by other persons subject to the authority of the united states and conversely it holds the indians liable for a depredation upon the person or property of anyone subject to the authority of the united states,be he white,black,or indian.
janis united states.cl,emphasis added also,in ex parte crow dog,the supreme court articulated the following with regards to the bad men provisions of the laramie treaty 
but it is quite clear from the context that this does not cover the present case of an alleged wrong committed by one indian upon the person of another of the same tribe.the provision must be construed with its counterpart,just preceding it,which provides for the punishment by the united states of any bad men among the whites,or among other people subject to their authority,who shall commit any wrong upon the person or property of the indians.here are two parties,among whom,respectively,there may be individuals guilty of a wrong against one of the other one is the party of whites and their allies,the other is the tribe of indians with whom the treaty is made.
ex parte crow dog.emphasis added.clearly,any white can be a bad man within the terms of the laramie treaty 
conclusion 
the treaty text,the object and policy behind the treaty,and this court precedent dictate that the bad men provisions found in article of the laramie treaty of are not limited to an agent,employee,representative,or otherwise acting in any other capacity for or on behalf of the united states.richard,fed.cl.at.
because we conclude the bad men provisions of the laramie treaty of is not so limited,the claims court improperly dismissed appellants complaint for lack of jurisdiction.accordingly,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
vacate and remand 
i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to vacate and remand the united states court of federal claims claims court dismissal of the claim in this case.
the claims court concluded that the bad men provision from the fort laramie treaty of does not render the united states liable for wrongs committed by those who are not subject to the authority of the united states,employees,agents,or representatives of the united states or otherwise acting upon the united states behalf.richard united states,fed.cl.as the drunk driver in this case was not such a person,the claims court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.i would affirm that decision.
there is a tension here between waiver of sovereign immunity and construction of treaties with the indians.on the one hand,waivers of sovereign immunity,including the tucker act,must be narrowly construed.radioshack united states.on the other hand,we also construe discrepancies in favor of the native americans without extending the treaty beyond its bounds in order to meet varying alleged injustices.minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,citations omitted.the supreme court recently noted in cooper that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and l egislative history can not supply a waiver that is not clearly evident from the language.fed.aviation admin.cooper,wl,at,citations omitted.any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity so that the government consent to be sued is never enlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires.id.citations omitted.the supreme court added that such a mbiguity exists if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not authorize money damages against the government.id.we also construe any ambiguities in the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign.id.in that event,the scope of congress waiver must be clearly discernable and i f it is not,then we take the interpretation most favorable to the government.id.in this case,in my view,the scope of congress waiver is not clearly discernable in the treaty and the balance therefore rests on the side of sovereign immunity.
a treaty with an indian tribe is a contract,and it should be interpreted to give effect to the intent of the signatories.washington.state comm.passenger fishing vessel ass n,a treaty is essentially a contract between two sovereign nations.santovincenzo egan,tsosie united states.in discerning the intent of the signatories to a treaty,we look to the parties choice of words and the larger context that frames the treaty,including the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.minnesota,at quoting choctaw nation united states,see also medellin texas,considering postratification understanding of the parties el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,same.in this fashion,treaties are construed to give effect to the terms as the indians themselves would have understood them.minnesota,at choctaw nation oklahoma.
the claims court thoroughly reviewed the historical context surrounding the fort laramie treaty of,including both the indian peace commission report of and the doolittle commission report from cited by the majority.the claims court,quoting the doolittle commission report,concluded that 
the doolittle commission observed that useless wars with the indians could be traced to the aggressions of lawless white men,always to be found upon the frontier.the lawless white men to which doolittle commission report referred were apparently united states soldiers,who engaged in the indiscriminate slaughter of men,women,and children 
richard,fed.cl.at citations omitted.the court then listed a number of entries in the doolittle commission report describing massacres,butchering,and murder by united states soldiers.id.the doolittle commission report also noted that it was difficult if not impossible to restrain white men,especially white men upon the frontiers from adopting savage warfare against the indians.id.emphasis added.consequently,as the court noted,the doolittle commission report recommended that congress establish five boards of inspection of native american affairs that would,among other things,inquire into conduct of the military toward tribes in order to preserve peace and amity.id.citations omitted.
similarly,the indian peace commission report,as the court also pointed out,likewise noted the difficulty of containing all of the indian tribes complaints 
in making treaties it was enjoined on us to remove,if possible,the causes of complaints on the part of the indians.this would be no easy task.we have done the best we could under the circumstances the best possible way then to avoid war is to do no act of injustice.when we learn that the same rule holds good with indians,the chief difficulty is removed.but it is said our wars with them have been almost constant.
id.emphasis added.in an effort to settle this conflict,the united states entered into nine treaties between various hostile indian tribes in the united states,including the fort laramie treaty.id.at.
the majority opinion focuses on the accounts in the doolittle commission report of atrocities by civilians.majority op.at.but just because the doolittle commission report listed those acts does not mean the treaty was intended or understood to prevent all of them,especially in light of the same reports noting the difficulty of such a task.indeed,the doolittle commission report is not legislative history it is historical context.in other words,the historical record stands for two propositions atrocities were committed by soldiers and civilians and controlling civilians would be difficult if not impossible.
given this historical backdrop,one must discern the meaning of the phrase bad men among the whites,or among other people subject to the authority of the united states as the parties themselves would have understood it,informed by the practical construction adopted by the parties.see minnesota,at.in the over year history of the fort laramie treaty,neither party nor the majority has been able to identify a single case brought by an indian individual against a white person who was not an employee,agent,representative of the united states or otherwise acting upon the united states behalf that has been found liable and upheld by any appellate or district court.instead,as the claims court pointed out,the bad men line of cases points to one common thread the court possesses jurisdiction over article i bad men clause claims where there exists a nexus between the individual committing the alleged wrong and the united states.id.at.
as the court showed,in each of the cases,the bad men were individuals white or other people who were subject to the authority of the united states in some capacity.id.at see,tsosie,at involving a united states public health service hospital employee begay united states.cl.teachers,both white and native american,who were employed at a bureau of indian affairs school hebah united states,indian police force officer subject to the authority of department of the interior elk united states,fed.cl.army staff sergeant.in fact,the earliest case brought against a person unaffiliated with the federal government appears to be hernandez in,which was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he was not a federal employee.hernandez united states,fed.cl,involving an officer who was employed by wing,a agency.the sound reasoning of the claims court derived from these cases has already been independently followed at least by one other district court.banks guffy,cv,wl,slip copy.
in the interim century and a half since the treaty was signed,there have undoubtedly been wrongs committed against the sioux by white,men.the complete dearth of cases brought against whites testifies to a practical construction adopted by the parties over an exceedingly long period of time,evidence that the sioux and the united states did not intend that this agreement cover persons not affiliated with the united states government.the bad men cases support this understanding.it is not for us to in effect create a new remedy in the claims court,as the majority does,that neither the courts nor the sioux contemplated for over years,and for which the government has not waived sovereign immunity.
the majority relies on the following passage from tsosie as constituting a holding and controlling our interpretation of the bad men provision 
t he bad men provision is not confined to wrongs by government employees.the literal text of article i and the legislative history of the treaty show that any white can be a bad man plus any nonwhite subject to the authority of the united states,whatever that means,but most likely indian nonmembers of the navajo tribe but subject to united states law.
tsosie,at.however,a plain reading of this statement is merely that the bad men provision is broader than government employees.it does not define the outer limit.indeed,the bad man at issue in tsosie was a government employee at a united states hospital.id.at.thus any broader interpretation was not a holding,but was dictum.likewise,we did not define whites or rule whether the term whites was modified by subject to the authority of the united states.we declined to do so,and simply noted the ambiguity of the phrase subject to the authority of the united states.id.at whatever that means.in contrast to tsosie,this case turns on the outer limit of whites and subject to the authority of the united states.
the majority also quotes tsosie as stating we hold that the treaty provision in question the bad men provision of,even if infrequently invoked,has not become obsolete or been abandoned or preempted in any sense that affects its enforceability by suit in the claims court under the tucker act.majority op.at.again,such is not a holding that the bad men provision is not limited to government actors,given the fact that the offending white party in tsosie was a united states government employee,a government hospital employee.instead,it merely holds that the bad men provision is still generally enforceable under the tucker act,which is not questioned in this appeal.
the majority is correct that we noted in tsosie that p rolonged nonenforcement,without preemption,does not extinguish indian rights.tsosie,at.but the claims court did not hold that the bad men provision is no longer enforceable.instead the claims court stated that the united states and the sioux did not intend that the bad men provision cover those who are not employees,agents,or representatives of the united states or otherwise acting upon the united states behalf.that is distinct from whether treaty rights have been abrogated by nonenforcement as discussed in tsosie.
the majority gives much weight to the use of subject to the authority of the united states in the second bad men clause.majority op.at.in particular,the majority argues that it makes little sense to have the terms of the treaty limited to acts committed by indians against anyone,white,black,or indian,who are government actors,and at peace therewith.majority op.at.instead,the majority suggests that the term subject to the authority of the united states could likely mean persons governed by law.majority op.at.but it would make even less sense for the united states to be involved with citizens of one indian nation committing a wrong against a citizen of another indian nation,as the majority view would suggest.as the government notes,the phrase at peace therewith immediately follows subject to the authority of the united states.the united states was not at war with its own citizens in.the logical conclusion is that subject to the authority of the united states and at peace therewith as used in the second bad men clause only modifies indians.
as noted by the majority,the comma placement between whites,or among other people is inconclusive as an interpretive aid in the context of the particular phrase here.majority op.at.given the comma ambiguity,it is,therefore,equally as likely that the drafters intended both categories,whites and among other people to be modified by subject to the authority of the united states while avoiding unnecessary repetition.in other words,while the phrase could have been written whites,subject to the authority of the united states,or among other people,subject to the authority of the united states the drafters could have easily discarded the unnecessary surplusage and ended with whites or among other people,subject to the authority of the united states as in the fort laramie treaty as signed.
i would take judicial notice of what may well be the original version of the treaty,obtained from the national archives,which contains the comma after among other people.see national archives,sioux treaty of,treaty last visited.that would lead to the conclusion,as discussed above,that subject to the authority of the united states was meant by the parties to modify both whites and among other people,supporting the interpretation that whites had to be subject to the authority of the united states government for liability to apply.even so,given the ambiguity in the text,the historical context and the practical construction adopted by the parties over the following century and a half are needed to inform us what was intended by the parties.
as discussed above,the historical context of the treaty and the practical construction adopted by the parties in the intervening years of its enforcement all suggest that it is unlikely that the federal government would broadly have waived sovereign immunity,opened its coffers,and,as the claims court stated,agreed to the impossible task of guaranteeing the safety and tranquility of all native americans on reservations from any and all of their interactions with anyone.in other words,the signatories,including the indians themselves,would have understood bad men among the whites,or among other people subject to the authority of the united states to mean employees,agents,or representatives of the united states or otherwise acting upon the united states behalf.
i finally note that the plaintiffs are not without an avenue for redress.the briefing before us represents that the plaintiffs are currently pursuing damages against the drunk driver.in any event,i see no reason to reverse the trial court,which decided the case correctly.i therefore respectfully dissent.
