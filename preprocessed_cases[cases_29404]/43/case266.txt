in this appeal,we consider whether federal jurisdiction exists over a lawsuit between two montana corporations alleging state law claims arising from a dispute over lands held by the united states in trust for various indian allottees.we conclude that federal jurisdiction does not extend to the claims,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
plaintiff appellant america corporation appeals the dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction of its action against defendant appellee roland oil gas,llc roland.asserts tort,contract,and state statutory claims and seeks,among other remedies,a constructive trust and declaratory judgment over an oil and gas lease located on allotted land,wherein title to the land is held by the united states in trust for various indian allottees.
in its complaint alleges the following facts,which we take as true in reviewing a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.wolfe strankman,cir.
a montana corporation,engages in exploration and production of oil and gas resources,and holds a number of leases in montana.roland is a montana limited liability company in the same line of business.
from to,retained john harper as a contract operator to assist the company in oil and gas development.through his work,harper became familiar with business plans and prospective lease acquisitions,including its plans to pursue oil and gas leases in the kye trout area,comprising roughly acres in sections and,township north,range west,montana principal meridian subject leases.a portion of the subject leases lies in allotted land,wherein title is held by the united states in trust for various indian allottees,who are enrolled members of the blackfeet tribe.calls this portion the allotment lease.
provided harper information about the subject leases in order as one might expect to further its business interests.harper had other designs,however he formed roland for the very purpose of acquiring the subject leases.in doing so,harper solicited capital and other assistance from competitor,robert miller.roland has already drilled two wells on the subject leases and plans to continue developing the leaseholds soon.
sued roland in federal district court,bringing claims for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,misappropriation of trade secrets,conversion,civil conspiracy,and implied enrichment.sought money damages a constructive trust requiring roland to assign its right,title,and interest in the allotment lease to a declaration that is the rightful owner of all right,title,and interest in the allotment lease punitive or exemplary damages and attorney fees.
roland answered and moved to dismiss complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted dismissal,holding that,the only primary basis of federal jurisdiction alleged,does not confer federal jurisdiction and that the supplemental jurisdiction statute,does not supply jurisdiction where no federal original jurisdiction exists.

federal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,possessing only that power authorized by constitution and statute.exxon mobil allapattah,internal quotation marks omitted.we presume that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction,and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,citations omitted.
jurisdictional arguments hinge on a single factual allegation the status of the land associated with the allotment lease.because that land is held in trust by the united states for indian allottees,contends that the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over actions concerning ownership of any interest in that land.accordingly,urges,the complete preemption exception applies to disputes involving indian trust lands,such that its case arises under.
as a preliminary matter,we note that in determining the existence of subject matter jurisdiction,a federal court is not limited to the jurisdictional statutes identified in the complaint.gerritsen de la madrid hurtado,cir.if facts giving the court jurisdiction are set forth in the complaint,the provision conferring jurisdiction need not be specifically pleaded.williams united states,cir.thus,the district court could have looked beyond the statutes pleaded,b and,and we will do so here.see gerritsen,at 
in its complaint,pleaded jurisdiction under b.the district court held that b does not grant federal jurisdiction,and we agree 
through what is commonly known as public law,congress provided to certain broad jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed in indian country,a,and limited jurisdiction over civil causes of action arising in indian country,id.a.doe mann,cir see also california cabazon band of mission indians,the precise limitations on the grant of civil jurisdiction appear in b,the provision cited by,which provides 
nothing in this section shall authorize the alienation,encumbrance,or taxation of any real or personal property,including water rights,belonging to any indian or any indian tribe,band,or community that is held in trust by the united states or is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the united states or shall authorize regulation of the use of such property in a manner inconsistent with any federal treaty,agreement,or statute or with any regulation made pursuant thereto or shall confer jurisdiction upon the state to adjudicate,in probate proceedings or otherwise,the ownership or right to possession of such property or any interest therein.
emphasis added.
the supreme court has explained that b simply reaffirmed the existing reservation indian federal government relationship in all respects save the conferral of jurisdiction to adjudicate private civil causes of action involving indians.bryan itasca,holding that a state could not impose a tax on reservation indians absent congressional intent and that did not confer the power to tax see also kirkwood arenas,cir section b is entirely consistent with,and in effect is a reaffirmation of,the law as it stood prior to its enactment.
the district court correctly concluded that b limits the exercise of state jurisdiction it does not confer jurisdiction on federal courts.see,frazier turning stone casino,d,noting that concerns state court jurisdiction and does not support exercising federal question jurisdiction over a misappropriation action.although necessarily preempts and reserves to the federal government or the tribe jurisdiction not so granted,santa rosa band of indians kings,cir,the law plainly did not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon federal courts 
federal courts have original jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.for a case to arise under federal law,a plaintiff complaint must establish either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff asserted right to relief depends on the resolution of a substantial question of federal law.peabody coal,at citing franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust.federal jurisdiction can not hinge upon defenses or counterclaims,whether actual or anticipated.vaden discover bank.
does not purport to bring a cause of action created by federal law it asserts only state tort,contract,and statutory claims.nevertheless,maintains that,because b delineates the scope of preemptive federal jurisdiction over lands held in trust for the benefit of indians,its claim does not require a federal statute to confer jurisdiction on federal courts.rather,in view,the complete preemption doctrine gives the district court subject matter jurisdiction under.
the complete preemption doctrine applies in select cases where the preemptive force of federal law is so extraordinary that it converts state common law claims into claims arising under federal law for purposes of jurisdiction.holman laulo rowe agency,cir.once an area of state law has been completely preempted,any claim purportedly based on that state law is considered,from its inception,a federal claim,and therefo
