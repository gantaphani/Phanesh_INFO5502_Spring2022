factual background 
between and the,a period commonly referred to as the termination era,congress endeavored to terminate the federal government supervisory responsibilities for indian tribes.south carolina catawba indian tribe,d.consistent with that policy,on august,congress enacted the ute partition and termination act upa,et.the express purpose of the upa was to provide for the partition and distribution of the assets of the ute indian tribe tribe of the uintah and ouray reservation reservation in utah between the and members thereof for the termination of federal supervision over the trust,and restricted property,of the members of said tribe and for a development program for the members thereof,to assist them in preparing for termination of federal supervision over their property.at the time of the upa enactment,the tribe owned cash,accounts receivable,and land estimated to be worth,as well as additional assets consisting of oil,gas,and mineral rights principally oil shale deposits underlying the reservation,and unadjudicated and unliquidated claims against the united states.affiliated ute citizens of utah united states,d.
implementation of the upa began with the preparation and submission,by the tribe,of roll s of its and members that were living on august.those membership rolls were finalized and published on april.the rolls listed and,a total of.the ratio was and.affiliated ute citizens,at.the upa provided that,e ffective on the date of publication of the se final rolls,membership in the tribe consist ed exclusively of members,and m members were deemed to have no interest in the tribe except as otherwise provided in the upa.
the next step in the implementation of the upa was the division of the assets of the t ribe that we re then susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution.this step was to be carried out by t he t ribal b usiness c ommittee representing the group,and the authorized representatives of the group id.pursuant to authority granted by the upa,the created an unincorporated association,affiliated ute citizens of the state of utah auc,to act as their authorized representative.app.at.in october,the auc and the tribal business committee agreed upon a plan for division of assets plan for division.app.at.

in november,the secretary,through the acting commissioner of the bureau of indian affairs,approved,with minor changes,the plan for division.id.at.in doing so,the secretary made the following recommendation to the tribal business committee and the auc board of directors 
w e recommend to you,in fact urge you,to give serious consideration to the obtaining of unimpeachable qualified independent advice in the matter of review of proposed plans for division of the lands falling within the other lands classification,and such similar review as you may deem advisable covering your entire real estate partition.
id.at.in late and early,the tribal business committee,auc board of directors,and auc membership adopted resolutions approving the plan of division.id.at.the resolutions adopted by the auc board and membership confirmed that the division of assets outlined in the plan of division was satisfactory,equitable,practicable and based upon the relative number of persons comprising the final membership roll of each group.id.at.on march,the commissioner of indian affairs,acting on behalf of the secretary,approved the division of assets,finding that it was made in a manner equitable to the two groups and within the legal authority of the upa.id.at.
following the adoption and approval of the plan for division,the,as required by the upa,prepared and ratified a plan for distribution of the assets among the members of the group.id.at.in accordance with the plan for distribution and the upa,the in turn formed three corporations to manage their assets.two of those were grazing corporations range corporations created to manage approximately acres of former tribal range lands that,pursuant to the plan for division,belonged exclusively to the.each member surrendered his or her individual interest in the range lands in return for stock in the range corporations which shares could,in the discretion of each member,be leased or sold.id.at.fee patents were then issued conveying to the range corporations all of the range lands,as well as all the rights,privileges,immunities,and appurtenances,of whatsoever nature,that were connected therewith id.at.the only exceptions to these conveyances were all minerals and mineral rights,including oil and gas,which were reserved to the tribe and the auc id.
the third corporation created by the in connection with the plan for distribution was the udc.id.at.udc was created to 
manage jointly with the tribal business committee all unadjudicated or unliquidated claims against the united states,all gas,oil,and mineral rights of every kind,and all other assets susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution to which the members of said tribe were then,or m ight thereafter become entitled and to receive the proceeds therefrom and to distribute the same to the stockholders of udc 
id.at udc articles of incorporation.
shortly after the plan for distribution received final approval,the tribe and auc jointly hired an engineering consultant named decker to study and produce a report regarding the water rights on the reservation.id.at.in doing so,both the tribe and the auc acknowledged that before a distribution of lands and assignment of lands c ould be fully completed many irrigation problems ha d to be solved id.decker completed his report on december.the report identified all practicably irrigable acreage within the reservation,and in turn used this as the basis for quantifying the tribal reserved water rights.
on august,the secretary issued a proclamation finalizing the termination of the group from the tribe.the proclamation stated,in pertinent part,that effective midnight august,members of the tribe would not be entitled to any of the services performed for indians because of their status as indian s,and a ll statutes of the united states which affect indians because of their status as indians would no longer be applicable to,and the laws of the several states shall apply to in the same manner as they apply to other citizens within their jurisdiction.id.at.
on march,auc filed suit in what was then known as the united states court of claims alleging generally that the federal government failed to divide the tribe assets properly pursuant to the upa,and that they received less than that to which they were entitled.affiliated ute citizens of utah united states.auc petition alleged,in particular,that the upa expressly required the united states to convey to the individual members their share of the tribe water rights,but that those members ha d not been granted,either directly or indirectly,their undivided of said water and water rights,nor any water or water rights whatsoever app.at.
on october,after eight years of litigation,the court of claims issued a final decision granting summary judgment in favor of the united states.affiliated ute citizens of utah united states.in doing so,the court of claims stated 
we find nothing in the record to shake our conviction that any acts for which the federal government might have been liable occurred by,leaving plaintiffs filing untimely.the purpose of the termination act was to end the tribal status of utes and to convert their status to that of ordinary american citizens.the division and distribution of assets of which plaintiffs complain were effected by,all intangible assets being conveyed either in the form of shares in the ute distribution corporation or as appurtenant to land whatever claims plaintiffs may have had matured then and became barred by the statute of limitations in.plaintiffs contend that their rights matured in,when the range corporations were dissolved and certain of their assets were acquired by the tribe.but,whatever rights the took were fixed in,after which the federal government took no actions affecting the parties division of assets.the later payment of money by the government to the ute distribution corporation does not affect this conclusion,since the relative shares of that corporation were finally fixed by.neither do we find merit to plaintiffs contention that they did not know and could not have known that all assets were being divided by the termination procedures.defendant numerous citations to the statute,to correspondence,and to the plans for division and distribution,leave us no doubt that the had notice of the finality of the termination procedures.in short,plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence,and we can find none ourselves,establishing a continued federal responsibility for claimed assets of the beyond the time of the termination proclamation.
procedural background 
on april,udc filed the instant action against the secretary and the tribe seeking a declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the.at.udc alleged that t he plan for division did not provide for an equitable and practicable distribution of water rights,with the possible exception of rights of use of water which were then being beneficially used on the lands distributed,and did not and could not fully address tribal water rights,because the nature and extent of tribal water rights was unknown.id.at.udc further alleged that,a t the time of distribution,tribal water rights were not adjudicated,liquidated,defined or quantified,and they remained under the trust responsibility of the united states in accordance with the upa.id.continuing,udc alleged that f rom time to time since the passage of the upa,the udc and its agents ha d asserted rights to water on the ute reservation and ha d been informed that the secretary d id not acknowledge such rights.id.at.based upon these allegations,udc sought a declaration that certain water rights were not partitioned that they remain in trust for the benefit of and members of the tribe and that they are subject to joint management by the udc and the tribal business committee under the supervision of the secretary id.at.
the tribe and the secretary each moved to dismiss the action arguing,in pertinent part,that udc claims were.on july,the district court denied the tribe motion,stating,in pertinent part 
t here is no single,discrete event associated with the upa that has given rise to a cause of action and triggered any attendant limitations period foreclosing this action i f this court were to conclude that certain tribal water rights were not partitioned and are an indivisible asset,then the ute tribe and the secretary of the interior would each be found to have an ongoing duty to ensure the udc was properly included at all times in the joint management of that asset.thus,any breach at any time of the continuing responsibility of the secretary or the tribe could trigger a cause of action hence,a declaratory judgment defining a party rights under the upa may properly be sought at any time while the federally supervised joint management scheme is in effect.

on march,the district court remanded udc claims to the secretary for final action and decision,and retain ed jurisdiction of th e matter pending final decision by the secretary.app.at.on remand,the secretary,after reviewing the parties supplemental submissions,issued a page letter conclud ing that the tribal water rights of the ute indian tribe were an asset susceptible to equitable and practical distribution and that this asset was in fact divided and distributed.id.at.
upon return to the district court,udc challenged the secretary decision,in pertinent part,on the grounds that the bureau of indian affairs failed to provide the udc access to various documents that the udc believed would affect the outcome of the decision.id.at.on march,the district court again remanded the case for further proceedings before the secretary.id.at.
on february,the secretary issued a second decision the decision concluding that udc failed to provide any evidence or argument which warrant ed changing the rationale or conclusions of the decision.id.at.in particular,the secretary rejected udc argument that the tribe unquantified water rights were water rights claims not susceptible of division,and instead concluded that such water rights were vested rights,established when the reservation was created,and that they were capable of being partitioned in a reasonable manner based on the division and distribution of the reservation lands.the secretary further concluded that the documents in the administrative record clearly show ed that tribal water rights and water rights claims were susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution under the upa and in fact were so divided and distributed pursuant to the upa.id.at.
the matter again returned to the district court.udc amended its complaint to add claims challenging the secretary decision.the tribe and the secretary responded,in part,by filing a joint pleading reasserting that udc action was.district court docket at.
